    "title": "NFL combine is awash with questions about veterans, not rookies. They range from Lamar Jackson to Maxx Crosby",
    "description": "While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won't eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.",
    "fullText": "Maybe it’s the quarterback chaos or the landslide of head coaching changes. Or because it’s late February and many of the NFL’s personnel departments already seem satisfied that the No. 1 overall pick in the draft is in the barn. Or maybe it’s because the 2025 season produced a wildly unexpected Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, and an even more unexpected Super Bowl quarterback winner in Sam Darnold.\n\nWhatever the driving force, it’s thrusting the usual sideshow of the NFL scouting combine — trade rumors, free-agency buzz and clandestine general manager meetings — into the middle of the main stage. And with that, the college players who are taking their next big step toward draft positioning have become a subplot.\n\n“It’s going to be a wild offseason and it’s going to start next week [at the combine],” one prominent NFL agent said this week. “There’s so much more than usual with different veteran stuff compared to how guys are going to work out — and we have a good class of guys [in the draft]. All the quarterback things to figure out, some of the [veteran] defensive players — some of the young players that could be traded with the staff changes — there’s going to be a lot going on. …\n\n“I see you guys talking about storylines — when was the last time anyone checked in on what’s going on with Lamar Jackson [and the Baltimore Ravens]? It’s like that situation has gotten lost in all this noise. That’s how crazy next week is going to be, though.”\n\nIn fairness, Jackson’s potential extension deadline — spoken into existence by Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti in January — has been a prominent story over the past month. Indeed, it will crank up next week, with the quarterback and franchise having been in a contract talks window for several weeks by the time Ravens new head coach Jesse Minter and general manager Eric DeCosta meet with the media in Indianapolis. It’s expected there will be some kind of temperature gauge coming out of the combine, with the front office and ownership wanting to sign an extension with Jackson and lower his $74.5 million salary cap hit in 2026.\n\nOf course, Jackson is only one of multiple pressing maneuvers — or non-maneuvers — heading into the combine that will certainly drain some of the daily news thunder from draft prospects’ workouts. Among the prominent:\n\nWho will be getting the franchise tag applied to them before free agency, with the biggest potential name being Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. As it stands, Dallas is expected to tag Pickens prior to the March 3 deadline and then either attempt to retain him or try to engage in a sign-and-trade scenario. With Pickens wanting to get to free agency and a likely $35 million average salary per season, there will likely be sparks in a tag scenario.\n\nPotential veteran trades, including Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby, Philadelphia Eagles wideout A.J. Brown, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and others. Throw in some young players who might get a call or two just to see if they are available on the trade market, including Buffalo Bills wideout Keon Coleman, Jacksonville Jaguars wideout Brian Thomas Jr., Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson and Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy.\n\nThe future of Aaron Rodgers will be a pressing question for the Pittsburgh Steelers — at least as it pertains to the organization’s other options and what kind of timeline there would be for a Rodgers decision. It’s possible we exit the combine under the presumption that the Steelers are going to move forward and try to find their future QB, which would shift the Rodgers conversation back to the Vikings, whom he was interested in before landing in Pittsburgh last offseason.\n\nAnd finally, one very big nugget that has yet to be developed: How much interest there will be in Malik Willis in free agency and what the money could ultimately look like. The ballpark speculation in the agent community is some kind of two-year deal averaging $30 to $35 million a season with $40 to $45 million guaranteed. That would put Willis in position to go back to the table next offseason and negotiate a longer term deal that tacks on to the end of 2027 and extends his guaranteed money out into a three-year window through the 2028 season. There are varying opinions on the numbers and structure, not to mention the potential interest. Willis feels like the first big quarterback domino that has to fall in March to trigger a larger migration. If he were to land in Pittsburgh, that then puts Rodgers — if he still wants to play — onto the market for the Vikings or any other suitors. And once Willis is off the board, the teams that ultimately don’t have him as an option will then have to reassess.\n\nThere’s a sliding scale of a trade likelihood for all these players. Crosby’s situation with the Raiders, from what Yahoo Sports has been told by league sources familiar with their talks, is still at a standstill — but also not unrepairable. Part of the Raiders’ motivation is to see what Crosby’s trade market looks like and also where he is at with the franchise in a new phase of a rebuild. The market will likely be the driving force here. If there is a solid offer of draft picks on the table, a trade seems more likely than not.\n\nThe same goes for Brown and the Eagles, although it remains to be seen what general manager Howie Roseman could engineer to fill his No. 1 wide receiver spot if there is ultimately an attractive offer available for Brown. It’s highly unlikely the Eagles would move Brown and not have another player in the mix, so the combine’s wide receiver workouts and other available players at the position could factor.\n\nThe Murray and Tagovailoa process is going to depend on suitors and money. Right now there are zero indications of an appetite to take on either Tagovailoa or Murray’s remaining contract in a trade, let alone surrender any meaningful draft assets to make him a starter. That could change if the QB shuffling doesn’t break right for some teams and desperation enters the scenario. Lest anyone forget, there was a market (albeit diminishing) for Russell Wilson the past two offseasons. So there can certainly be a market for Tagovailoa or Murray if a situation gets bad enough.\n\nAs for the young players, Coleman seems likeliest to be traded, given the comments of Bills owner Terry Pegula that essentially branded him as not being the front office’s draft choice. Unfortunately for Buffalo, Coleman’s trade value will be nothing more than a late pick at this stage. Even with his youth.\n\nThomas, Richardson and McCarthy are not expected to be officially on the trade block, but all three could garner some interest and calls. Thomas seems less likely to be dealt with the Jaguars moving Travis Hunter primarily to cornerback. McCarthy won’t be dealt unless the Vikings are presented with a quarterback option that effectively renders any chance of him having a future as moot. And Richardson doesn’t have much of a market, and will have only one year left on his rookie deal once his fifth-year option is ultimately declined. That doesn’t leave much room to develop him for any interested franchise. But again, we don’t know how desperate the quarterback field gets.\n\nThat’s a lot of veteran questions and potential developments that will hang over the primary reason teams are in Indianapolis next week: To begin laying down the foundations of their draft boards for April’s selection process in Pittsburgh. While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won’t eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.\n\nHere’s a look at some of those that will be worthy of watching.\n\nWhile it’s not expected to be as top-heavy as the 2024 wide receiver class — which saw seven first-round picks at the position — the wideouts are considered a spot that is going to have depth and offer needy teams quality options potentially into the third round. The general consensus at this point is that four to five receivers could go in the first round. Most of the intrigue will be how the top of the class sorts itself between the trio of Ohio State’s Carnell Tate, Arizona State’s Jordyn Tyson and USC’s Makai Lemon.\n\n“I think you could see some [changes in that trio] between interviews, measurements and whatever work gets done,” one NFC talent evaluator said. “The medicals, too — definitely the medical for Tyson. … And it depends how you want to use them in your scheme. Lemon, some teams might not like the size but others might love the versatility and how he catches it. How fast will Tyson run and some of the speed and agility things with Tate will be important. They’re all good players, but there’s definitely some of the [Travis] Hunter, [Tetairoa] McMillan, [Emeka] Egbuka [conversations from 2025] because they’re not all similar players.”\n\nAs it stands, Tate appears to stand out among talent evaluators as the most “clean” player from the threesome, in terms of the total package of consistency, health, size and production. But there’s definitely curiosity about what his pure speed and agility will look like, especially alongside Lemon and Tyson. Some of those questions will be answered — if all three actually do full workouts at the combine, which isn’t guaranteed. Beyond that trio, there will definitely be some gravity toward the next tier of WRs in Washington’s Denzel Boston, Tennessee’s Chris Brazzell II and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields, who all bring prototypical “X” receiver size to the table. The Bills will be an interesting team to watch with that group.\n\nFor only the second time in 13 years, we could end up seeing only one quarterback selected in the first round. With the Las Vegas Raiders expected to take Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza with the No. 1 pick, it’s also trending toward Mendoza passing on everything at the combine and opening the floor for the rest of the class. That will be a solid opportunity for multiple players, including Alabama’s Ty Simpson, Penn State’s Drew Allar, Miami’s Carson Beck, LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier and others.\n\nIt’s simply not a great class when it comes to star power (that will come in 2027), but there could be a bit of developmental depth with some strong showings.\n\nEven with the thin class, there is still plenty of quarterback need across the league — and that will point plenty of eyes in the direction of Simpson. He was a prospect with some solid draft heat near the midpoint of the college season, but red flags began to get raised as he got knocked around and turned the ball over later in the schedule and then suffered a rib injury that knocked him out of the College Football Playoff. Right now he’s likely to land in the late first to mid-second round range, somewhat similar to how teams were looking at Bo Nix in 2024, and Jaxson Dart and Tyler Shough last year. If Simpson can wow teams in interviews and put up a good workout, he can build momentum to move up the board and get a QB-needy team to expend a first-round pick on him. Already, you hear his name connected a lot to the Los Angeles Rams, who have the 13th and 29th overall picks.\n\nAs for the rest of the pack, it’s unclear what Allar will be able to do at the combine due to an ankle injury that ended his 2025 season. He’s the player with the size and easy arm strength, so he’ll draw in someone believing they can home his considerable talent into consistent results. Same goes for Beck, who also has size and arm, but also some leadership and love-for-the-game questions that teams want to pick at in interviews. Not to mention some bad turnovers in important spots, going all the way back to his time at Georgia. Then there’s Nussmeier, who some evaluators once believed could develop into a first-round pick, maybe even a solidly high one, before injuries derailed much of his 2025 college season. He’ll be another player who draws plenty of eyeballs.\n\nIt’s a loaded class with edge players, with an onslaught at that position expected to end up packing the first round. While there’s still a lot of work ahead, it wouldn’t be surprising to see as many as eight edge rushers come off the board in the first 32 picks. A lot of the attention will go to potential top-10 picks in Texas Tech’s David Bailey, Ohio State’s Arvell Reese and Miami’s Rueben Bain Jr. But there will be a battle to figure out the stack after that trio, with players like Auburn’s Keldric Faulk, Missouri’s Zion Young and Miami’s Akheem Mesidor battling it out. Young is a player to keep an eye on. He had a great week of practice at the Senior Bowl and ended up as the game’s defensive MVP, giving him a lot of buzz coming into the combine. But top to bottom it’s going to be great draft for teams that need edge players and defensive line talent in general.\n\n“It might be one of the deepest [edge] classes ever, especially through the top 50, 60 guys [in the entire draft],” an AFC general manager concluded. “There’s all types of skill sets and body types that fit different needs, but the talent in general just very, very good. There’s really not a Myles Garrett or Nick Bosa, but there’s a half dozen guys who could become just good, core second-contract players for teams.”\n\nBeyond the defensive line, there’s strength in the class of safeties and cornerbacks as well, with as many as a half dozen or more picks in the secondary likely to land in Round 1. And while safety isn’t traditionally a position that sees multiple first-round selections, this will almost certainly be one of those years, with Ohio State’s Caleb Downs, Toledo’s Emmanuel McNeil-Warren and Oregon’s Dillon Thieneman all having the profile to possibly land in the first half of the first round. That just doesn’t happen. Downs in particular will be very intriguing. His résumé is the kind that he’d be an easy top-five pick if he played at a more premium defensive position — and there were times that some evaluators believed he could even be worth that kind of juice in this draft. The overall strength of the defensive class at premium positions is likely to push him down the board, but it’s certainly not lost on front offices that so many of the NFL’s best defenses now feature a dynamic safety like Downs. That could cement Downs higher on teams boards by April.\n\nThe next running back after Notre Dame’s Jeremiyah Love is going to be an interesting development to watch. Overall, the class isn’t amazing and it’s going to be dinged a bit by the free-agent class being so strong. There’s no doubt that some teams want to see what Love’s backup for the Fighting Irish, Jadarian Price, does in the workouts. As much as game tape matters, Price could have transferred elsewhere for the 2025 college football season and doubled his touches while positioning himself to challenge Love as this year’s top running back. Now he comes into the draft with less wear and tear but also some curiosity about whether he can be a centerpiece starter and also catch the ball consistently out of the backfield. His workouts will matter, especially as it pertains to his receiving ability. If he can showcase that and put up the type of athletic numbers that some think he can, there will likely be more Alvin Kamara comparisons to follow. As of now, I’m not sure how that framing works without the receiving end of his game being more proven.\n\nOregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq is going to be interesting. Some evaluators like him as almost a hybrid running back/wide receiver if he fits into the right scheme. Others see him as a plus-level athlete whose “expected” 6-foot-2, 240-pound size is going to make him a bit of a tweener — and not in a good way — in the NFL. There’s curiosity about Sadiq’s true height and weight and what his workouts look like. There’s little doubt he has mismatch potential and maybe some considerable ceiling with the right coach and scheme, but some evaluators don’t see him as the kind of tight end who can fit in a lot of different places and be on the field at the rate of a multitude of TEs from last year’s draft. He can’t be compared realistically to the bigger bodied guys like Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren. And his overall consistency of college production wasn’t in the realm of Brock Bowers going into the 2024 draft. Who is the realistic comparable at the NFL level to Sadiq and what coach can draw that unique talent out of him?",

    "fullText": "No. 18 Saint Louis ended its 88-75 win over VCU on a power play Friday, thanks to a wild brawl shortly before time expired.\n\nThe fun began with Billikens guard Quentin Jones trying to dribble out the clock with his team up by double-digits. VCU's Nyk Lewis apparently wasn't happy about that, as he stole the ball, took a few steps and jacked up a half-court shot, which resulted in SLU star Robbie Avila — you might remember him from his time at Indiana State — bumping him out of bounds.\n\nAvila was called for a foul and also received a hard shove in the back from VCU forward Barry Evans, who then got shoved by Jones. Cue the benches the clearing, with 1.1 seconds left on the clock.\n\nBENCHES CLEAR IN SAINT LOUIS 🤯 VCU AND SLU BRAWL ON THE COURT pic.twitter.com/IRZHItxY7L\n\n— A10 Talk (@A10Talk) February 21, 2026\n\nThe courtside angle of the chaos:\n\nGo Billikens, great win. Barry Evans, what gives bro? pic.twitter.com/QpTqH9PD0h\n\n— Ross Chaifetz (@RossChaifetz) February 21, 2026\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, the officials ejected Evans and Jones with flagrant 2 fouls and also ejected all the players who left the bench once the dust-up started.\n\nThat left VCU with only four players. Lewis hit his three free throws, and the game ended.\n\nCuriously, it's the second straight year in which a VCU-Saint Louis game saw a brawl break out.\n\nBoth sides downplayed the incident after the game, with Avila saying \"That's not who we are\" and \"there's no ill intentions between anybody, just the emotions of the game.\"\n\nVCU head coach Phil Martelli Jr agreed:\n\n“I think there’s certainly a healthy intensity, as there should be at the top of the league, right? We've got a lot of respect for them. I think they have some respect for us, I assume,” Rams coach Phil Martelli Jr. said. “It’s two tough teams, two very competitive teams, two physical teams. Stuff like that, you wish it didn’t happen but, yeah, it’s an intense game. It’s an emotional game.”\n\nSaint Louis head coach Josh Schertz said the incident would \"get blown out of proportion,\" then provided his own recap of the incident:\n\n\"Guy stole the ball, Rob didn't take too kindly to it, fouled him, then that guy didn't take too kindly to Rob fouling him, two-hand shove in the back. And then our guy shoved that guy back and everybody just milled around and did what the general basketball fighting does, which is everybody's trying to get held back so they don't have to do anything.\"\n\nThe win keeps Saint Louis in the driver's seat in the Atlantic 10. Friday's game was between the No. 1 and No. 2. teams in the standings, and improved the Billikens' conference record to 13-1 while VCU sits at 12-3.",

    "description": "On a night that saw more Elimination Chamber qualifiers, here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 2/20/26 episode of \"WWE SmackDown!\"",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s weekly review of \"WWE SmackDown,\" the show that spent this week sending a pair of \"WWE NXT\" graduates to Elimination Chamber! We'll talk about one of those here in the column, along with Tama Tonga's win over Ilja Dragunov, Cody Rhodes' backstage confrontation with Sami Zayn, and much more!\n\nIf you're wondering why we're not discussing Oba Femi vs. Kit Wilson, or Tiffany Stratton vs. Alba Fyre (just to give two examples) it's because this show is three hours long and we can't cover everything — that's what our \"SmackDown\" results page is for. This column's subject material is reserved for matches and segments that moved us in some way, either positive or negative, as we continue to navigate the Road to WrestleMania. So without further ado, here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 2/20/26 episode of \"WWE SmackDown!\"\n\nI have spent more time brainstorming creative ways to say \"I don't care\" than I have actually caring about the Wyatt Sicks and the MFTs' feud.\n\nHow long have these two factions been feuding? Weeks? Months? Maybe even years? Regardless, even as the MFTs attempted to turn a new leaf with Tama Tonga's match against Ilja Dragunov (and \"attempted\" is the operative word here; Solo Sikoa is still walking out with Uncle Howdy's iconic lamp), we still find ourselves in Wyatt Sicks/MFT purgatory. Aside from Sikoa stealing Howdy's lamp, nothing about this feud has changed people. Nothing about this feud has changed. The world of professional wrestling is supposed to be dynamic — the card is, famously, subject to change. How can a professional wrestling storyline remain so incredibly static?\n\nFirst off, I applaud Tonga getting a win over Dragunov. I don't particularly love the call, but I can realize that it's because of my own Dragunov biases. Dragunov will be fine after this loss; in all honesty, Tonga stands to gain more from a win over Dragunov, rather than the other way around. Tonga is the one in more desperate need of a momentum push, which is exactly what a win over Dragunov would give him...if WWE actually moved his character, or any of the MFTs characters', forward, past their relationship with the Wyatt Sicks. I know that Ilja tried to jump the MFTs all on his own after the match, but let's be real: that's not leading to a feud, not if the ending vignette with the Wyatt Sicks says anything about it. Tonga got a momentum-building win, but with no trajectory for him to move towards, what good is a boost?\n\nWhat good is a boost for any of these guys, MFT and Wyatt Sicks both, if they have nowhere to go? I don't care how cool you look walking to the ring with your arch nemesis' stolen lamp, or how creepy you are with a jumpscare at the end of your vignette. If you're doing the same thing, week in and week out, with no narrative progression other than a title change, I don't want to hear it. It sucks so bad, because the Wyatt Sicks and the MFTs are, on paper, good ideas. The Wyatt Sicks was the most anticipated stable in wrestling, and had the potential to be an incredible, living honor to the late Bray Wyat. The MFTs had the opportunity to be a dominant force on the blue brand, similar to Roman Reigns' original Bloodline. Instead, they're caught in this endless cycle of lukewarm conflict against each other. The narrative stagnation is choking them out like vines. Nothing changes. These men are wasted.\n\nTama Tonga beat Ilja Dragunov this week and although it came with a heap of help from the MFT, it continues what appears to be a genuine effort to build him up as a credible singles competitor. That may turn out to mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but for the wishcasting of this writer. However, with the spotlight came quite a uniquely fought bout between Tama and the \"Mad Dragon.\"\n\nNo one could ever rightfully call a Dragunov match clean, with his entire attraction being the untempered violence he dishes out and endures. And Tama has very clearly packed a lot more meat onto his frame, while still seeming to move like he did when he was smaller. So everything had a little more weight behind it, everything had a little more ugliness, and personally that only added to the quality of the match.\n\nThis wasn't an instant classic between two technical magicians, but it was a fight and interference aside it served both competitors very well. It does put a little bit of a dampener on things that Tama needed help to get the win. The argument on the other hand would surely be that Dragunov needed protecting. But at the end of the day Tama got the win and continues to roll through former United States Champions, having beaten Shinsuke Nakamura earlier this month. And that seems to put him in the trajectory for challenging for singles gold.\n\nI have long been a fan of Tama and while the creative behind MFT leaves much to be desired, it's just cool to see that he may be getting the opportunity to progress for himself. Guerillas of Destiny/Sons of Tonga had been a great act for well over a decade, mostly through Tama's doing, and one could argue he deserves his HBK moment. However that may come.\n\nIt's great to see Jade Cargill get some television time on this edition of \"SmackDown\", but if we're being honest, that television time wasn't really put to good use.\n\nCargill's promo felt incredibly basic, brief, and by the book. It was nothing more than Cargill essentially saying that she was ready for whoever her WrestleMania 42 opponent, whether it's Liv Morgan choosing to face her as the winner of the 2026 Women's Royal Rumble or the winner of the 2026 Women's Elimination Chamber Match. While it can be argued that this promo was used to set up some mystery intrigue as to who Cargill will face, I would say that's both a good thing and a bad thing. It does generate hype and excitement for the fans, but at the same time, it leaves a whole lot of questions and creates some confusion for me personally.\n\nCargill's staredown with Charlotte Flair on the entrance ramp did seem to be a bit of a tease and would indicate a potential meeting between them at WrestleMania 42, but at the same time, Flair lost her Triple Threat Elimination Chamber Qualifier to Kiana James which seems to rule out that possibility. It's always possible that Flair could turn on Bliss to cost her the match and maybe take over her place, but I'm not convinced that WWE would be willing to do something like that. Morgan has also been set up as another potential opponent for Cargill, but it seems more likely than not that she'll be picking Women's World Stephanie Vaquer given their recent heated confrontations on \"Raw\". WWE could also opt to have Tiffany Stratton win the 2026 Women's Elimination Chamber match to set up a WrestleMania rematch between Cargill, but that feels like a really boring and safe choice.\n\nWith so many potential opponents for Cargill and with so much uncertainty as to which route WWE will go for her WrestleMania 42 opponent, I can't help but get the feeling that perhaps WWE doesn't quite know which route they want to go down themselves. It feels so convoluted and murky as of this moment, although time will ultimately tell how things will play out.\n\nSo Kiana James getting the win over Charlotte Flair and Nia Jax, two well-established names, in a qualifying match for the Women's Elimination Chamber, gave a little of both in that respect. It is just a throw-away match on a Friday \"WWE SmackDown\" and it is hardly a sign that she is going to main event WrestleMania. But it is also a pin on Charlotte Flair, in a really inventive way too, that also saw her beat Nia Jax – a dominant former champion – to her first Elimination Chamber match.\n\nThat at the very least says the company has faith in James and gives her an opportunity to make a name for herself in the Chamber match on a PLE. And considering the depth – or lack thereof – of the current \"SmackDown\" women's division, that's certainly a good thing.\n\nThe match itself was pretty fun, with each participant offering something different; Flair was the quarterback veteran, Jax was the dominant force and anchor to the action, and James sneaked in where she could and that ultimately paid off. Flair had worked hard to get Jax in a position to beat her, only for James to leverage her submission into the winning pinfall.\n\nThat immediately casts James as a would-be dark horse in the upcoming Chamber match. She may not be the one getting the win and going to the \"Show of Shows,\" but there is a strong chance that she gets a pin or two on some of the faves in the match.\n\nWe're on the \"Road to WrestleMania,\", but it's mostly talk and no action. Superstars are mentioning it and commentary is pushing tickets, but the card is coming together at a snail's pace. One would think one of the matches they'd be building towards is a match for the men's tag titles. MFT only won them a few weeks ago, yet no one is challenging for them. In fact, none of the tag teams seem to even care about them. Instead, they are preoccupied by one half of a former tag team. (There's also one less tag team competing for the titles, but I digress.)\n\nWrestling storylines sometimes revolve around objects like a fan-made bracelet or a lantern. In the case of Johnny Gargano and Candice LeRae, it was a mask belonging to Axiom. Since losing possession of it, Gargano has become depressed and taken up planking (or maybe it's because he regrets his life choices after seeing his former tag partner winning a title on his first night in a rival company). He is often laid out across a storage trunk or the box containing Danhausen or Chris Jericho or EVIL or the Gobbedley Gooker. LeRae is fed up that no one will help her husband. Gargano is depressed and you're laughing? Fraxiom and Motor City Machine Guns are. In their defense, Gargano has been a jerk to all four men and it's understandable.\n\nThe men's tag team division on \"SmackDown\" has been a mess for a while and the \"Raw\" division barely qualifies as a division. WWE is wasting one of the greatest tag teams of their generation in MCMG. Fraxiom is a great tag team that should be in the title picture. The problem is no tag teams are in the title picture because no one cares. Street Profits are wrestling house shows when they should've never been off TV. As a fan of tag team wrestling, it's frustrating that there's no effort (but WWE has long stopped caring about tag team wrestling). Last year, the tag title match was left off the WrestleMania card and there was a TLC match the following \"SmackDown\" that proved they deserved a 'Mania match. It seems we're heading towards another year where the titles are left off one of the biggest PLE's of the year.\n\nWith how easily WWE moves on from storylines and its characters, something we've sadly seen for Sami Zayn before, I really liked his backstage segment with Cody Rhodes, keeping him hot and at the forefront of fans' minds, especially during the busy WrestleMania season. This short backstage segment made me believe (or at least have hope) that Zayn isn't going to get lost in the shuffle, and on a pretty average episode of \"SmackDown\" tonight, it's one thing I really liked.\n\nZayn has been locked in some kind of mini-feud/rivalry with newcomer Trick Williams, which I've mentioned I really like a lot, but that wasn't the highlight of his story tonight. Sure, Williams got in his face there for a second after a brief crash-out following his interaction with Rhodes, but his confrontation with the former Undisputed WWE Champion was the highlight of this. And, it was something that needed to be addressed after Rhodes pinned Zayn in the Elimination Chamber qualifier last week. But, as we all know, it easily could have been something WWE chose to just never address again.\n\nRhodes appeared to be attempting to cheer Zayn up backstage, but after Rhodes being the one to dash his Chamber dreams last week, I really loved that Zayn wasn't having it. He wasn't all, \"Aw, shucks, man, thanks,\" when Rhodes told him that he shouldn't be ashamed of himself. Zayn was quick to say that he knew that, and it was Rhodes who should be ashamed for stabbing him in the back. Zayn said everything always comes up roses for Rhodes, but for him? He's been trying to finish his story for 10 years, and Rhodes doesn't know what it's like to do the right thing.\n\nThat's when things really started getting heated, and Zayn still wasn't having any of it, and had his mini-crash out, slamming stuff around as Rhodes walked away. I didn't love how Zayn apologized to him after his words with Williams, but this was still one of the best things on the show tonight. I'm also not sure if I love Zayn possibly turning heel, but I don't really know if fans would let that work at this point.\n\nI liked that this was simple and that we didn't see Zayn again for the rest of the night. He's involved with himself and his feelings and plans for the moment, and didn't need to get involved with Williams' qualifying match for the Elimination Chamber, or in the main event where McIntyre cost Randy Orton the match, which brought out Rhodes. This was clean, simple, and effective, and I'm glad WWE doesn't appear to be dropping anything for Zayn, at the moment, at least.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "It’s only the second weekend of the season, but Arizona is in jeopardy of letting this one get away before it even starts.\n\nThe Wildcats were shut out 4-0 by UConn on Friday night at Hi Corbett Field. The loss dropped them to 0-6 and extended their losing streak to eight dating back to last June’s trip to the College World Series, which feels like a century ago. It’s the longest skid since 2014.\n\n“I think it’s just gotten to the point where there’s a lot of anxiety, whether it’s new guys or the guys who played a lot here, just trying to do too much,” UA coach Chip Hale said. “And they put so much pressure on themselves. You can almost tell when guys get hits, right? When they get so excited, it’s like we’re back in Omaha or something. It’s just a base hit in game three or four or five. And so I can tell by that that they just are releasing so much anxiety out of their body. So we just got to find a way to get them to relax.”\n\nArizona finished with three hits, singles by Andrew Cain and Mathis Meurant and a double by Nate Novitske. Only two of eight baserunners reached third and the team struck out another 10 times, upping the season total to 80 in six games.\n\n“We don’t look ready to hit when we’re taking some pitches,” Hale said. “We’re stuck. And that comes from anxiety. In life, anything you do, it’s hard to do, to be at your best when your body’s all knotted up.”\n\nThat frustration spilled over into the field, as Arizona was charged with three errors and made several other defensive miscues.\n\n“How that game ended 4-0 I have no idea, we made so many mistakes on defense that are not characteristic of this group,” Hale said. “Hitting is hard, it’s the hardest thing to do in sports. We can control what we do on defense.”\n\nThe defensive issues and continued hitting struggles overshadowed another solid pitching performance by most of the staff. Owen Kramkowski struck out six over four innings, allowing two runs (one earned), while five relievers combined for 11 strikeouts. That included eight punchouts by a trio of relievers making their UA debuts.\n\nLefty Maclain Roberts came on with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth and struck out both UConn batters, the first on a nasty slider and the second a fastball down and away. Roberts then struck out the side swinging in the eighth.\n\n“When you look at his numbers from the preseason, everybody pitches their way in or pitches their way out,” Hale said of Roberts, a native of New Zealand who pitched the last two years at Pima College. “He had not pitched his way in. You pitch like that, you’re gonna get yourself in another game.”\n\nWhile the anxiety and frustration is evident, Hale said the effort has still been there. Making sure that remains will be difficult until the wins come.\n\n“It’s tough for the kids,” he said. “I know they’re they want to win for the program, they want to win for the fans. They want to win for themselves. Coach Jerry Kendall was very succinct in what he used to tell us: ‘disappointed is okay, we just can’t let them get discouraged.’ They’re very close. the two words, but there’s a huge difference. When you get discouraged, it’s tough to bring them back, but disappointed is okay.”",

    "fullText": "LANCASTER – What looked to be a blowout for the Fairfield Union boys’ basketball team turned into a nail-biter against rival Bloom-Carroll on Friday, Feb. 20.\n\nThe Falcons raced out to a 16-2 lead in the first five minutes of the game, and midway through the second quarter, held a 24-9 advantage. However, the Bulldogs weren’t about to go down without a fight. They showed a lot of grit and clawed back, cutting the lead to just two points with 17 seconds remaining.\n\nFairfield Union held off the hard-charging Bulldogs by making clutch free throws in the closing seconds to come away with a hard-fought 56-55 Mid-State League-Buckeye Division victory.\n\nThe Falcons were able to keep the Bulldogs just out of reach by making 13-of-16 free throws in the fourth quarter, including four straight in the final 17 seconds. Mason Ailes led the way by going 6-for-6 in the fourth quarter, and sophomore Asa Kline hit the clinching free throws with 13 seconds left.\n\n“Free throws are a big part of our practice, and we try to get at least 50 up during practice,” Ailes said. “We haven’t been the best at it this year, but we were able to come through when we had to. When you are up there in pressure situations, you just try to go through your routine, and we were able to knock them down when we had to.”\n\nMore: Fisher Catholic's Hadli Gillum is a sophomore basketball sensation\n\nFairfield Union coach John Helber said he knew the Bulldogs (12-10, 7-5) wouldn’t go away, forcing the Falcons (15-7, 9-3) to make their free throws in the end, but he had confidence in his guys when they toed the line.\n\n“I have a lot of confidence in our guys at the free throw line,” Helber said. “Asa and Mason hit the big ones. We practice free throws every day, and we do different things to make them like game situations in case it comes down to that at the end. We knew Bloom-Carroll would make a run. They have great shooters and run their offense well, but we hung in there and made the plays we needed to make. We needed to get this win tonight, and we needed to bounce back and get some confidence going into the tournament, and I think we did that tonight.”\n\nThe Falcons couldn’t have had a better start to the game, as five different players scored to build a big lead in the first quarter. They led 19-6 heading into the second quarter, but the Bulldogs stayed the course and finished the first half on a 10-2 run to cut the deficit to 28-19.\n\nThe Bulldogs kept the momentum going in the third quarter, cutting the margin to 34-31, but Drake DeFazio hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give Fairfield Union a 37-31 lead heading to the fourth quarter.\n\nBloom-Carroll kept chipping away, thanks to nine points from senior guard Caleb Hinkel. The Bulldogs were able to get it to a one-possession game when Hinkel scored on a three-point play, cutting the deficit to 45-42 with just over two minutes to play. However, the Falcons were able to keep them at arm's length by making seven consecutive free throws at one point.\n\nJayven Griffith had a steal, and Hinkel scored on another three-point play with 17 seconds left to cut it to 54-52 before Kline sealed it with his two free throws.\n\n“We didn’t like how we started the game, but credit to our guys,” Bloom-Carroll coach Andy Schmitz said. “Our guys want to keep playing, and it showed a lot about who we are. We stayed aggressive and stuck with it. We knew we couldn’t get it all back at once. It was going to be a grind all the way through, and our guys gave great effort and didn’t give up and kept fighting to the end. We just weren’t able to quite get over the hump because Fairfield Union kept making their free throws.”\n\nKeaton Webb led a balanced attack for the Falcons with 18 points and eight rebounds. Kline finished with 11 points, 12 rebounds, and three assists. Ailes also had 11 points, while Trevor Utzinger chipped in six points and five assists, and Dean Clark added six points.\n\nHinkel led the Bulldogs with 15 points, Griffith had 13, and Brady Petty chipped in nine points.\n\nTom Wilson is a sports reporter for the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette.

    "fullText": "Sometimes it’s not about having the ability to “buy another” after losing something valuable; it’s about the loss itself. LaMelo Ball can get his hands on another Hummer, but the one he crashed must have left him feeling devasted. Or perhaps not, if he thinks like DaBaby.\n\nThere were reports from earlier this week that suggested that Ball crashed his Hummer in the streets of Charlotte. Thankfully, he was unharmed. He got into another car — notably, a Lamborghini — and simply left the scene.\n\nBall had no time to dwell on that though, with NBA action resuming on Thursday following the All-Star break, and in the Charlotte Hornets’ game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, he got words of consolation from rapper DaBaby.\n\nA Charlotte native, DaBaby was sitting courtside. When Ball came close to him mid-game, he got the star guard’s attention and reminded him, “N **** crash cars every day, we ain’t worried about none of that!”*\n\nBall heard him, and laughed it off. Although for certain, he won’t be looking forward to crashing a car every day! DaBaby, however, went on to reveal in the video that, “I just crashed my Hellcat. N **** crash cars everyday.”*\n\nThe video involving the rapper was funny, but in actuality, it was a scary moment for Ball and those involved in the crash in downtown Charlotte. The lady driving the other car, like Ball, escaped without any major injuries which was a moment of relief for the Hornets baller.\n\nAfter the team’s loss to the Rockets on Thursday, Ball, who dropped 11 points and had somewhat of an off night, said, “I seen her get straight out of the car.”\n\nTalking about how he felt in the build-up to the game, Ball added, “I’m just alive and blessed. God is great.”\n\nFor now, there is no verdict on who was at fault, and it is also uncertain whether any legal action will be taken against Ball. He is not expected to miss time on the court, although he appears slightly shaken up.\n\nThe post “I Just Crashed My Hellcat”: LaMelo Ball Gets Courtside Consolation From DaBaby Over Crashing His Hummer appeared first on The SportsRush.",

They're looking to start stacking up wins in bunches as the push for the G League postseason nears.\n\nSouth Bay put up 37 points in the first quarter and was ahead 66-45 at halftime. The team never let up, as it led by as many as 26 points in the fourth quarter and ended up winning by a final score of 127-105.

Adou Thiero, a rookie forward who was taken in the second round of the 2025 NBA Draft, made all but one of his eight shot attempts and ended up with 19 points and seven rebounds. Four men off the bench — Malik Williams, Arthur Kaluma, Anton Watson and Augustas Marčiulionis — scored in double figures.\n\nBronny James played 27 minutes in this game and shot 5-of-14 from the field. He finished with 13 points, five rebounds, five assists, one steal and two blocks.\n\nThis win gave South Bay a 12-8 record, which puts it in fifth place in the Western Conference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: South Bay Lakers recap: G League Lakers race past Legends",

    "description": "The Hawks and Patriots joined in a pregame moment of silence for those lost in Monday's mass shooting during a high school hockey game in Pawtucket.",
    "fullText": "WARWICK – Friday evening was an attempt for the state’s hockey community to move on.\n\nNormal? It feels a long way from however you might define that in 2026.\n\nBishop Hendricken used part of its practice time this week to discuss evacuation routes at Thayer Arena. Pilgrim asked its student section to wear orange instead of its usual black and white while promoting gun violence awareness.\n\nThe Hawks and Patriots shared the center circle as one for a pregame moment of silence. Bishop Hendricken’s eventual 2-1 victory in a thriller between Division I rivals started with a common purpose. Each player was touched in some way by the horrific Feb. 16 shooting in Pawtucket that left three dead and three critically wounded at Lynch Arena.\n\n“It’s tragic,” Pilgrim goalie Michael Bessette said. “Practice has been a little gloomy. But we tried to bring awareness and show everyone what hockey is really about.”\n\n“When it comes to Rhode Island, it’s like, ‘Wow, it’s kind of real,’” Bishop Hendricken defenseman Ethan Sykora said. “It feels like it could happen at any time.”\n\nSykora is a Coventry native. He counts multiple former youth teammates on that high school's current co-op roster with Johnston. Those fellow teenagers skated for their lives when gunfire erupted in the stands, barricaded into their own locker room by coach Joseph Stringfellow until law enforcement arrived to clear the scene.\n\n“Gun violence in general needs to end,” Sykora said. “There’s no place for it. Mental health, too – something was wrong. You need to go talk to someone.\n\n“I feel like that needs to be pushed out there a little more. That can prevent something like that from happening.”\n\nSykora added an orange strip of tape to the light blue already featured on the shaft. That’s meant to raise awareness for the Shoulder Check program, a mental health initiative backed by the NHL, ESPN and Madison Square Garden, among others. Multiple mass school shootings in America over the last three decades have been carried out by current or former students who were victims of bullying or marginalized by their peers in some way.\n\n“You have to reach out,” Sykora said. “There’s no reason to make yourself suffer. There are plenty of people in this world who are going to help you – me included.\n\n“I never shy away from anyone. I never want to exclude anyone.”\n\nBessette made 38 saves in a sharp performance for the Patriots, beaten only by some tic-tac-toe passing in front and a tipped shot from the point that left him no chance to react. What happened elsewhere this week, his own student section lining the glass, the growing buzz in the crowd as the third period went on – it all melted into the background once the puck dropped.\n\n“You lose track of everything,” Bessette said. “You’re so focused and dialed in. You’re just focused on the game and ready to play.”\n\nCullen Crain and Mason Crain set up Nick DiRaffaele at the left post to put the Hawks (16-2-0) in front midway through the first period. Tiernan Leahy netted the eventual winner at 1:25 of the third when he redirected a Tuckerman Camera drive between the circles. Paul Smith answered for Pilgrim (12-8-1) when he converted a turnover in the neutral zone to a breakaway goal barely a minute later.\n\n“We had a great crowd tonight,” Bessette said. “It’s always good going against Hendricken. We practice in the same rink.\n\n“It’s just fun. It's really fun.”\n\nBlackstone Valley’s co-op – North Providence, North Smithfield, Providence Country Day and St. Raphael – has canceled the remainder of its regular-season games. Its own road to true healing will be considerably more difficult after losing members of its extended family so senselessly. Bessette found some solace in a return to action and the resources he has available if needed.\n\n“There’s no shame in asking for help if you need it,” Bessette said. “If you ever have mental health problems you should always go to whoever you can.\n\n“Whether it’s a teacher, a therapist – whoever. Your mental health is the most important thing in your life.”\n\nFirst period – BH, Nick DiRaffaele (Mason Crain, Cullen Crain), 8:10. No penalties.\n\nSecond period – No scoring. Penalties – P 1-2, BH 1-2.\n\nThird period – BH, Tiernan Leahy (Tuckerman Camera, Karlton Lough), 1:25; P, Paul Smith (unassisted), 2:29. Penalties – P, 1-2.\n\nShots on goal – P, 6-7-10 – 23; BH, 16-12-12 – 40. Saves – Michael Bessette, P, 38; Zach Fontenault, BH, 22.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Hendricken boys hockey beats Pilgrim 2-1 february 20 2026",

    "description": "The nine-time NFR bucking horse passed away in January, but his offspring are already carrying his name and his talent into the big shows.",
    "fullText": "When the talented Straight Jacket passed away in January 2026, the rodeo world lost more than a bucking horse. They lost a foundation sire, a proven champion, and a cornerstone of one of the sport’s most respected programs.\n\nThe 16 year old PRCA bucking horse from J Bar J Pro Rodeo suffered a broken leg and was treated at Washington State University, but he could not overcome the injury. After a storied career, J15 Straight Jacket was laid to rest on the ranch in Circle, Montana. Sparky and Marleen Dreesen mourned the loss of a horse that had become far more than just a number in the program.\n\nIn a social media post, the Dreesens shared, “He was heart, grit, and a partner in showcasing the very best of rodeo.”\n\nThat description fits just perfectly for the talented horse.\n\nStraight Jacket made nine trips to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo. Five of those in bareback riding and four in saddle bronc. His distinctive bald face and classic bucking style made him instantly recognizable, and he was respected the moment he left the chute.\n\nBut what makes Straight Jacket’s story even more significant is what is happening now. His offspring are not just carrying on his name, they are winning with it at the highest level.\n\nAt the 2025 NFR, an impressive eight of Straight Jacket’s colts were selected to buck at the Thomas & Mack Center. Eight. That kind of representation at rodeo’s biggest stage is not luck or coincidence, it is the result of intentional breeding and bloodlines built to last.\n\nStraight Jacket was sired by Night Jacket, a legendary bucking horse inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 2023 after seven consecutive bareback selections at the NFR from 2000 to 2007. Straight Jacket was one of 265 Night Jacket colts to have been selected to buck in Las Vegas. This is a staggering statistic that speaks to the strength of that line from the beginning. Out of Kattle Bells, he carried genetics that were proven before he ever stepped into the arena at all.\n\nOne of his standout offspring, Shady Jacket, has already made major noise. At the 2025 NFR, Shady Jacket helped saddle bronc rider Stetson Wright to an 89.75 point ride and a share of the Round 10 victory. Then on Feb. 7 at the Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo, Shady Jacket was half of Darcy Radel’s 91 point ride to split the final round win inside Dickies Arena.\n\nThat 91 point ride in Fort Worth was memorable. It was one of the top rides of the entire rodeo, and it came just weeks after Straight Jacket’s passing. Seeing his bloodline still dominating in major arenas made it clear that this legacy is not slowing down.\n\nAt the 2020 NFR that was held in Arlington, Texas Straight Jacket was placed in the TV pen (rounds 5 and 10) of the saddle bronc. He also had a daughter paced in the same pen for the bareback riding. The TV pen is reserved for the flashiest, best horses out there. Historically, these horses were chosen this way because only Round 10 was televised. Not only did Straight Jacket make that cut, but since then several of his songs and daughters have too.\n\nStraight Jacket had become a major part of J Bar J’s breeding program, just like his sire before him and because of amazing modern technology, his influence will continue for generations.\n\nThe stock contracting firm reported that they have collected hundreds of straws from Straight Jacket during his lifetime. According to Sparky Dreesen, the breeding approach moving forward will be intentional and selective.\n\n“We know the crosses that work, and we're probably not going to be trying any new crosses with him,” Dreesen said to the PRCA. “We'll see how that works a few years down the road.”\n\nJ Bar J plans to utilize intracytoplasmic sperm injection technology they say. It allows programs to preserve and strategically use elite genetics long after a horse is gone.\n\nThe goal is not just to replicate talent though, it is to build generations of bucking horses that carry the consistency, power and style that J Bar J has been known for. Maybe they will carry Straight Jacket’s personality, too.\n\nHe gave everything to the sport of rodeo and left a mark that goes far beyond the arena, living on in the memories of those who were lucky enough to climb into the chute on top of him.\n\nNow, his offspring is doing it for him.\n\nFrom Las Vegas to Fort Worth and beyond, the Straight Jacket name is still being called, and judging by what we have already seen, it will be for years to come.",

    "fullText": "If anyone was wondering whether Alabama softball is for real this season, Friday night delivered a loud, undeniable answer.\n\nBehind a lights-out performance from freshman pitcher Vic Moten and an explosive offensive surge, No. 9 Alabama shut out No. 7 Florida State 8-0 in one of the biggest early-season matchups in the country.\n\nRound One goes to the Crimson Tide🥊#Team30 #RollTide | @TMobile pic.twitter.com/8n2zMQVQGQ\n\n— Alabama Softball (@AlabamaSB) February 21, 2026\n\nIn a hostile environment and against a top-10 opponent, the Crimson Tide didn’t just win, they controlled the game from start to finish.\n\nMoten was the story from the circle. The freshman right-hander pitched with the poise of a seasoned veteran, silencing a dangerous Seminole lineup and never allowing Florida State to build any momentum. She attacked hitters, trusted her defense, and showed zero fear on a big stage. Performances like this are how young stars announce themselves nationally, and Moten did exactly that.\n\nFor three innings, the game felt like a heavyweight fight, with both teams trading scoreless frames.\n\nThen Alabama’s bats erupted in the fourth inning, and the entire tone of the game shifted instantly.\n\nBrooke Wells got things started with a towering solo home run that broke the tension and put the Tide on the board. Alexis Pupillo followed with a blast of her own, and before Florida State could regroup, freshman slugger Ana Roman crushed a two-run shot to cap a stunning three-homer inning. Just like that, Alabama had seized a 4-0 lead and complete control.\n\nThe freshman stays hot at the plate🔥\n\n📺ACCNX streaming | https://t.co/6bqnpNGavv #Team30 #RollTide pic.twitter.com/WVY0H3rwqn\n\n— Alabama Softball (@AlabamaSB) February 20, 2026\n\nThe Tide poured it on late, adding four more runs in the seventh inning with clutch hitting up and down the lineup. Pupillo delivered again with an RBI single, Jena Young added another run-scoring hit, and Kristen White provided the knockout blow with a two-run single that stretched the lead to eight.\n\nAlabama finished with 11 hits, showcasing both power and timely situational hitting. Wells led the charge with a three-hit night, while Pupillo and Roman continued to prove that this lineup has dangerous production from top to bottom.\n\nMost impressive of all was how complete the performance was.\n\nAgainst a top-10 opponent ON THE ROAD, no less.\n\nNow sitting at 11-0, this Alabama team isn’t just winning, they’re sending a message.\n\nThe Tide looks deeper, tougher, and more confident than they have in years, and they’re doing it with a mix of experienced leaders and fearless freshmen who aren’t waiting their turn.\n\nIf this game was any indication, Alabama softball isn’t just off to a hot start.\n\nThey’re building something special.",

    "fullText": "No. 7 BYU made light work of Fort Valley State Friday night in Provo, picking up its eighth straight sweep and imposing its will on the Wildcats in a very one-sided match.\n\nThe Cougars heated up as the contest wore on, taking it by set scores of 25-18, 25-16 and 25-14.\n\n“Hitting-wise, we made very few errors,” BYU senior setter Tyler Herget said after tallying 35 assists on a night when his team tallied a torrid .468 hitting percentage.\n\n“That’s something that we’ve been trying to work on, … keeping the ball in play against any team. That gives us a shot at winning any point, and so I think we did a very good job there.”\n\nThe match marked the first time the two schools had faced each other, as Fort Valley State played its inaugural season just four years ago.\n\nBYU looked like the more experienced team Friday evening, wearing the Wildcats down and staying in control for most of the match.\n\nThe Cougars were led by two of their usual workhorses, senior outside hitter Trent Moser and sophomore outside hitter Connor Oldani, who each finished with 12 kills and a pair of blocks.\n\nAll in all, it was a good team effort from BYU, which finished with 10 different players logging at least one kill.\n\nIt took the Cougars a few moments in the initial set before they began to separate themselves from the Wildcats, but the Provo school really took control when junior opposite hitter Teilon-Jonathan Tufuga led the team to four straight points and a 12-9 lead.\n\nThe Long Beach native first earned a sideout kill before putting on a show with some high-powered serving that led to a BYU overpass kill followed by two consecutive aces.\n\nBehind Tufuga’s serving and Moser’s seven kills, the Cougars proved to be too much for their visitors, ultimately expanding on their lead by the end of the set to win comfortably.\n\n“I think (Tufuga) really kind of set the standard for us from the service line,” BYU coach Shawn Olmstead said on a night when his team had seven aces from five different players.\n\n“He’s one of the better servers in the country right now statistically, and so he showed that again tonight. That got us that separation. … I was proud of (Tufuga) to put that pressure on them.”\n\nBYU ramped up the pressure in the second set, winning it in dominant fashion. The Cougars ultimately won the set by nine, but it could have been by more had a pair of Fort Valley State points not brought the Wildcats within 10 as the set neared its end.\n\nThe Cougars never trailed in the set, their advantage growing as it wore on before settling on the nine-point victory.\n\nThings only got more lopsided in BYU’s favor in the final set, the hosts going on three different 3-0 runs, essentially locking up the match long before the final whistle.\n\nThe Cougars’ victory pushes their win streak to eight matches, their last loss coming on January 24.\n\n“(We) did what we … wanted … to do (tonight),“ Olmstead said. “We were able to get… other guys in. That was the best part. I didn’t think we let down at all. … I think we need that physicality off the bench as we go down the stretch, and especially (in) March and April, it gets real nasty.”\n\nRight now, in February, BYU is looking pretty and will try to extend its win streak to nine when the Cougars and the Wildcats meet again Saturday evening at the Smith Fieldhouse at 7 p.m.",

The league season is very long but for me, it has barely even begun.\n\n“We have a very difficult away match, as they all are, and our objective now isn’t to relax because to win every match, you have to be at 100%,” he said.\n\nArbeloa also issued updates on Kylian Mbappé’s fitness, revealing that the Frenchman is “feeling better every day” after returning from a knee injury.\n\nThe former PSG forward featured in Real Madrid’s Champions League meeting with Benfica, and Arbeloa confirmed that “his knee is much better.

    "fullText": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Trey Kaufman-Renn scored 20 points and Braden Smith added 15 points and eight assists Friday night, helping No. 7 Purdue produce a historic rout over rival Indiana 93-64 to earn a split in this season’s series.\n\nThe Boilermakers emphatically ended their two-game losing streak against the Hoosiers by producing their highest point total in the series since scoring 94 points in 1998. It also was their largest victory margin in the series since a 44-point shellacking in 1969.\n\nFletcher Loyer and Omer Mayer each scored 18 points, with Loyer going 5 of 5 from the field, making four of his 3-pointers and all four free throws in what could be the Indiana finale for Purdue’s three senior starters — Kaufman-Renn, Smith and Loyer. The victory came three days after Purdue (22-5, 12-4 Big Ten) lost at home to top-ranked Michigan.\n\nLamar Wilkerson scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half to lead Indiana (17-10, 9-7), which lost its second straight to a top-10 team. Tayton Conerway had 12 points and seven assists, while Tucker DeVries added 11 points on a night Indiana’s offense never got in sync and whose post players struggled against the Boilermakers size, all while battling foul trouble.\n\nPurdue took control quickly, using an 11-4 spurt to take a commanding 26-14 lead. The Boilermakers extended the margin to 46-29 when Nick Dorn’s half-closing 3-ponter was erased after a replay review determined the shot came after time expired.\n\nKaufman-Renn and Loyer opened the second half with Purdue’s first three baskets to make it 54-32 with 17:41 to go, and the Hoosiers never recovered as the Boilermakers led wire to wire.\n\nIndiana: Begins its final homestand Tuesday against Northwestern.\n\nPurdue: Closes out a three-game homestand against No. 15 Michigan State on Thursday.",

Both were upended in WCHA play and now head into Saturday looking to gain series splits.\n\nThe Gophers battled back from a 2-1 deficit midway through the third period to force overtime at Minnesota-Duluth.\n\nUnfortunately, Minnesota’s rally only delayed the result as the Bulldogs prevailed 3-2 in the extra session.\n\nTova Henderson’s unassisted tally at 1:41 of OT iced the result and handed the Gophers a fourth consecutive defeat.\n\nMinnesota took the early lead as Madison Kaiser’s goal at 16:33 of the first period gave the visitors a 1-0 edge at Amsoil Arena on the shore of Lake Superior.\n\nThe advantage didn’t last long. UMD evened the count at 1-1 with a strike at 10:21. The hosts staked their claim to the game at 12:36 of the middle frame on a goal from Maddie Burr.\n\nDuluth’s 2-1 lead carried well into the third period before Ava Lindsay breathed new life into the Gophers at 9:30 of the stanza to send the game into overtime knotted at 2-2.\n\nWith the prospect of a shootout ticking ever closer, Henderson closed the door on Minnesota’s comeback. Bulldogs goalie Eve Gascon made 31 saves as her Gophers counterpart, Hannah Clark, made 29 stops. The loss dropped Minnesota to 24-8-1 overall and 18-8-1 in conference play.\n\nThe Bulldogs, as locked into fourth place in the WCHA standings as the Gophers are cemented to third place, improved to 18-12-3 overall and 14-10-3 in the circuit with one game remaining in the regular season.\n\nMinnesota and UMD will take the ice for that final pre-playoff contest at 2 p.m. Saturday inside Duluth’s lakeside arena. The game is scheduled to be televised on BTN+.\n\nAn exciting first period was followed by two more that didn’t go the Tommies’ way at the Lee & Penny Anderson Arena in a 5-2 loss.\n\nThe opening frame set up well for a big day in St. Paul. St. Thomas gave up the opening goal, but followed with two of their own in scintillating fashion to take a 2-1 lead into the first intermission.\n\nAfter the Mavericks drew first blood at 6:56, Rylee Bartz struck back for the Tommies just 24 seconds later to make the score 1-1. Then, just as fans began to head to get concessions, Ella Boerger had them standing up for a different reason as she scored with just four ticks left on the clock.\n\nMinnesota State got down to business in the second period, scoring the lone tally of the frame at 15:26 to draw even at 2-2.\n\nThat’s how the score remained until 16:09 of the third, when the visitors took their second lead of the game at 3-2. Unlike their brief first-period edge, this one proved to be permanent.\n\nThe Mavericks added a power play goal at 12:25 and a final tally with 2:15 remaining to skate away with the three-goal win.\n\nSt. Thomas goaltender Julia Minotti made 27 saves in the game, while MSU netminder Hailey Hansen saved 23 of 25 attempts.\n\nThe loss ended any Tommies hopes of leapfrogging the Mavericks in the WCHA regular-season standings. MSU (14-17-2 overall, 8-17-2 WCHA, 27 points) took a four-point edge on St. Thomas (12-20-1, 7-19-1, 23 points) in the conference with the win and just one game left to go before the playoffs.\n\nThe two teams go at it one more time at 2 p.m. Saturday inside Anderson Arena.\n\nCollege hockey: Tommies men tumble late vs. Vikings\n\nMen’s basketball: Gophers forward Jaylen Crocker-Johnson out indefinitely\n\nGophers, Badgers and Cyclones in hot pursuit of Maple Grove’s Babou Ann\n\nFootball: Gophers add productive Mississippi tailback Greg Hargrow to 2027 class\n\nWomen’s basketball: Gophers find aim, run away from No. 10 Ohio State",

    "fullText": "It took about a half for things to get rolling consistently, but the Sioux Falls Washington girls basketball team was able to get out in transition and run past Sioux Falls Roosevelt 69-43 on Friday, Feb. 20.\n\nThe Rough Riders were intent on getting the ball inside to 6-foot-3 sophomore Kalli Harris, which slowed the game down considerably. Roosevelt was able to hang around in the first half as Washington's half-court offense struggled to get going, but the Warriors still led 34-23 at the break.\n\n\"You've got to give Roosevelt credit,\" Washington head coach Jamie Parish said. \"The first thing that they did was kept going inside with the basketball, and that brought all of our kids down to protect the rim. Then it's a longer run when you have to get down and play physical.\"\n\nThe Warriors know they're at their best when they're out in transition and spent halftime trying to get to that more often.\n\nDana Harpe with a rebound off a Roosevelt miss and passes it to Josie Biteler for two. Washington leads 46-26 with 3:58 left in the third. Warriors have been cruising since they started to push the pace more. @ArgusSports pic.twitter.com/Oc2f29mvYa\n\n— Paul Cifonelli (@PCifonelli) February 21, 2026\n\n\"When we went in there, we knew we could play better and we knew we could get good shots easily, but we wanted to get the best shots by swinging it, moving it, giving it multiple touches,\" senior guard Dana Harpe said.\n\nParish knew it wouldn't be easy against a gritty Roosevelt team that played hard, and stressed to his girls that they needed to run the floor wide and run their lanes to get the ball up the floor quicker.\n\n\"We were told they weren't going to roll over and die, so just had to do our part and keep playing hard and keep playing as a team,\" senior guard Rylan Kennett said.\n\nWashington got out and ran immediately in the second half, starting the third with a 12-3 run to blow the game wide open.\n\n\"We're a team that thrives in transition,\" Harpe said. \"We're a really long team. We'll get up the court in five seconds. I feel like that translates on defense. If we get a good defensive possession we're going out in our outlets, and I feel like that's working well for us.\"\n\nThe Warriors got a lot of their fast-break chances from their defense, whether it was on steals or long rebounds. Parish wanted his girls to force more 3-pointers to get longer rebounds, which came with Roosevelt sophomore Henlee Loof making a few. Despite that, Washington stuck in its aggressive 2-3 zone that has led it to a 14-3 record this year.\n\n\"We tried to go a little bit of man and they got a couple baskets out of it,\" Parrish said. \"We're more comfortable in our zone. It's the thing that we practice, it's the thing that we stick to. We do give our kids a little bit of freedom in that zone to chase a kid. Our zone can change shapes and do some things.\"\n\nGood ball movement leads to a Rylan Kennett bucket.

The Warriors are looking to play like they did in the second half the rest of the regular season and into the postseason.\n\n\"We need to play to our standard every game no matter who we play because that's the only way we'll get better,\" Kennett said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sioux Falls Argus Leader: Washington girls basketball uses transition to race past Roosevelt",

    "description": "Games against Fulham haven’t always been thrilling, but one clash in April 2006 was filled with oddities!",
    "fullText": "The 2005/2006 season is one most Sunderland fans won’t want to remember too much of, given our total of just fifteen points and three wins.\n\nThe game was a chance to end a dire run of form — particularly at home. Back then, we’d see crowds of about 30,000 a week and go months without winning at the Stadium of Light — which had become a miserable sporting venue.\n\nThis was one of four home games I went to this season, and as a nine-year-old, this was probably for the best.\n\nHeavy rain on this particular Saturday afternoon eventually turned to snow, and by the time kick off came, the stadium was experiencing blizzard conditions. Yet just hours before, it was sunny, before the weather turned quicker than most of our defenders that season — which, in fairness, wasn’t that fast.\n\nDuring the build up to the match, my dad and I went to watch the players warm up. The snow was falling and starting to lie on the pitch with around an hour to go until kick off. Standing to the left of the goal at the North Stand, we spent about fifteen minutes watching our goalkeepers warm up.\n\nEach bounce of the ball and sprawling dive was met with the squelch of cold mud. It felt like it should be the middle of winter, yet the season was only a month away from ending!\n\nI was an aspiring goalkeeper at the time, so watching this warm-up was an education despite the dire weather.\n\nAs the warm-ups ended, Kelvin Davis must’ve spotted me watching on intently, as he unzipped his jacket and handed it over to me. I was delighted at the time — as was my dad — but then we were stuck with a waterproof jacket dripping with mud for what we thought would be a full game of football.\n\nKick off came, and I remember certain players looking like they were running through a swamp.\n\nIn hindsight, it’s a surprise referee Mike Riley was able to get the game underway at all, but they gave it a go for about twenty minutes and after three consultations with Sunderland caretaker boss Kevin Ball and Fulham manager Chris Coleman, he finally called it.\n\nSo many aspects of this game had “typical Sunderland” written all over it — firstly the fact that we still managed to concede during the period of the game that actually happened, and then that one player busted his nose open and was subbed off after colliding with his own player (Rory Delap walloping George McCartney).\n\nWe didn’t go down on that snowy day in April due to Birmingham’s failure to win, but the abandoned game only delayed the inevitable. It was a weird game from start to early finish, and Ball reported not being able to see across the other side of the pitch through the ice and snow showers.\n\nAs for Davis’ jacket? It’s still around at my family home, as far as I know. And yes, obviously, it’s been washed — although that’s surely knocked a few thousand pounds off the value I could’ve fetched for it on eBay? We may never know.\n\nTomorrow’s match will probably be very different, but it would be by simply being completed, but we’ll always have that bizarre afternoon in April 2006.",

    "fullText": "Savinho has missed the last 13 games for Manchester City. The Brazilian international was injured during Manchester City’s nil-all draw with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light at the beginning of January. Pep Guardiola has now revealed that Savinho is nearing a return to the pitch, which is good news for his team. Also, the Manchester City manager revealed that he has high hopes for Savinho as a player. Savinho is a player who can dazzle and frustrate in the same passage of play. But as Pep Guardiola said after his team’s win over Salford City, if the Brazilian international can put it all together, he could become a devastating weapon for his team.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 2-nil win over Salford City in their FA Cup fourth-round tie at the Etihad Stadium, Pep Guardiola revealed that Savinho could have played a few minutes against the League Two side. The Manchester City manager also revealed that if Savinho can put it all together with his end product, he will become a valuable weapon for his team. Speaking on Savinho’s injury situation, and the Brazilian international’s obvious potential, Pep Guardiola said: “He’s been out for six weeks. He could [have played] a few minutes, but we didn’t want to take risks. Training two days ago was wow, so good. He’s close. Now we have a long week and players coming back.”\n\n“Already Savinho, when he will learn to make the finished product he will be an unbelievable winger on both sides.”\n\nPep Guardiola’s assessment of Savinho is on the money. The Brazilian winger has the potential to become a key player for Manchester City. What has plagued Savinho since he arrived at City from Troyes is his end product. Savinho’s finishing is unreliable, and he squanders too many chances. His delivery and decision-making in the final third also remain inconsistent. None of these revelations are groundbreaking; they have been known for some time now. It is up to Savinho to rectify these areas of his game to take the next step as a player. He simply has to get an opportunity to become a consistent player for Manchester City.\n\nThere is strong competition now amongst the City sqaud for roles on either wing. Antoine Semenyo, Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden all stand in Savinho’s way. You could throw Omar Marmoush into that mix as well. To make good on Pep Guardiola’s assessment, Savinho has to improve his end product. He has no other choice. Modern squads are built on options, and Guardiola has plenty available in wide areas. Supporters see a similar idea in games too, where players can buy V Bucks to open up more choices and customise their experience before jumping back into action. For Savinho, the challenge is simple — take the next step and make himself the first option when it matters most.\n\nIt is good news for Manchester City to have Savinho back from injury. His return gives Pep Guardiola another attacking option to utilize. Pep Guardiola has also explained what Savinho needs to do to grow as a player. It is now up to him to take the next step and not be squeezed out of Pep Guardiola’s squad.",

    "fullText": "Obviously it’s going to be very different when he’s trying to go off on mazy runs against fit, experienced Premier League defenders and not tiring low-end Championship players, but it was good to see him come on and be positive.\n\nI wouldn’t want to place too much pressure on the lad this season as the likelihood is that we’ll barely see him much, but when he does get opportunities, it’ll be during late cameos like that where he can be most effective in short bursts.\n\nWhat excites me about Ta Bi — and pretty much everyone else we sign, for that matter — is that because he’s young and moldable, if he’s any good, his rate of improvement will be rapid.\n\nOur coaching is brilliant and we’ve fostered an environment that allows young players to flourish, so I really don’t see how Jocelin doesn’t fit in here if he’s prepared to put the work in. The talent is there — which is what got him this move in the first place, as weren’t signing a finished product.\n\nNow, it’s down to him and his coaches to see how much he can blossom. I’m pretty excited, but won’t be getting too carried away just yet — it’s a huge jump from the Israeli top division to the Premier League, so let’s give him time.\n\nYes, he wasn’t on for long and he was up against lesser opposition, but Ta Bi appears to be an exciting prospect.\n\nHe was direct and progressive with the ball — clearly eager to show us fans what he can do, and his feet were quick as he swerved his way in and around the Oxford defenders.\n\nHe’s still rough around the edges, but the talent seems to be there. Whether or not he’s able to perform at Premier League level is yet to be seen, but after a good showing on Sunday, maybe we’ll see him coming off the bench in the coming league games.\n\nI love this type of player — a quick, skilled right winger with a good left foot who gets the fan on their feet. I’m sure he can sharpen his skills under the wing of Bertrand Traoré, and maybe even live up to the iconic Patrick Roberts, whom he follows in the footsteps of.",

    "title": "On This Day (21st Feb 2015): Sunderland Draw After Poyet’s Open Letter",
    "description": "Poyet’s passionate plea to the fans sadly wasn’t enough to inspire a home victory against West Bromwich Albion",
    "fullText": "Only days after Gus Poyet’s open letter to the fans, his Sunderland team drew their thirteenth game of the season with a familiar 0-0 scoreline.\n\nThe Uruguayan felt compelled to write after some horrid results at home cranked up the pressure and left the team languishing just above the drop zone.\n\nIn the letter, Poyet asked fans to stay patient and positive in the midst of a bad run and accepted that criticism laid at his door.\n\nSo I invite all of you to stay positive, to be strong, closer to each other and keep believing in what we started together last year, working harder to make it better this season.\n\nTo finish I would like to clarify once more: the responsibility of the results of our team is down to me. I always said it and I will always accept my responsibility.\n\nSunderland struggled throughout the season and in truth, if you were a season ticket holder at the Stadium of Light, you’d certainly be wondering if you were getting “bang for your buck”, given that the team had only scored twelve goals at home by this stage of the season.\n\nIt was hoped that the signing of Jermain Defoe would make a difference and whilst he’d already picked up a couple of goals, the team still looked bereft and devoid of ideas in front of goal.\n\nA 0-2 defeat at home to QPR — then near the bottom of the table — was another nail in the coffin of Poyet’s already fragile tenure at the club, and it was in the aftermath to this defeat that he wrote the aforementioned letter.\n\nDays later, the Lads faced Tony Pulis’ revitalised West Bromwich Albion at the Stadium of Light and after the unexpected defeat to QPR, victory was certainly required here to alleviate some of the pressure on the team.\n\nWithout much difficulty, the away side absorbed our best attacking efforts and according to the match reports, our best attacks came from corners in the second half.\n\nSunderland’s best chances came from corners.\n\nSantiago Vergini headed wide a Larsson delivery amid more pushing and shoving in the penalty area, while substitute Connor Wickham turned Johnson’s ball straight at Foster.\n\nWith a trip to Old Trafford on the cards, this was a terrible week for Poyet and the team as the Lads only picked up one point from a potential six. Despite this, the manager attempted to take the positives out of the result and spoke about them after the game.\n\nThe performance was higher in commitment. Going for it, it was spot on. We needed a break. We needed a lucky goal or the right decision from somewhere. In England, you say it wasn’t to be and it was that kind of day.\n\nIt’s difficult for me. Tony has improved his team, he is one of the best and they are difficult to beat. I think we did enough to get a break today. It was important to get back to basics and we just needed that goal to be a perfect day.\n\nWe can take positives. We were higher up the pitch, we crossed I don’t know how many times. It wasn’t to be. You need to play this way. You need to anticipate the second ball. We will see.\n\nIt was a clear sign of a manager who potentially knew his days were numbered.\n\nSunderland’s style of play had become so sterile and ineffective that they were quite simply too easy to play against and with the drop zone looming, something had to change sooner rather than later.",

    "fullText": "UEFA are investigating explosive allegations levied against Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni that he used a racial slur towards Real Madrid ace Vinicius Junior during their Champions League clash.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Prestianni admitted to using an anti-gay slur towards Vinicius rather than a racist insult.\n\nThe incident occurred in the second half at the Estadio da Luz on Tuesday night, shortly after Vinicius fired home the only goal of the game for Real Madrid.\n\nVinicius reacted angrily to comments from Prestianni, who had covered his face with his shirt. The Brazilian forward alerted the referee, prompting a 10-minute stoppage.\n\nThe Real Madrid forward initially accused the 20-year-old Argentine of racist abuse.\n\nHowever, sources say Prestianni has since told UEFA investigators he used a homophobic slur in Spanish, not the word mono, meaning monkey.\n\nThe explanation was reportedly relayed to Madrid midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni immediately after the game.\n\nReal Madrid have submitted what they describe as a full dossier of evidence to UEFA.\n\nForward Kylian Mbappe stated he heard racist abuse directed at his teammate on five separate occasions during the match, adding that some Benfica players were also aware of the comments.\n\nMbappe urged for serious punishment, and so too did head coach Alvaro Arbeloa, who wants UEFA to make the case a turning point in football’s battle against discrimination.\n\nUnder Article 14 of UEFA’s disciplinary regulations, sanctions for racist or homophobic abuse are identical, carrying a minimum 10-match suspension or equivalent ban.\n\nWhether racist or homophobic, the intent from Pretianni is the same. It is to demean, to dehumanise, to wound.\n\nSwapping one vile slur for another is not mitigation. It is not clarification. It is a confession.\n\nSo he’s not racist? Just homophobic? That’s hardly a defence. It paints the same ugly picture of a young professional who thinks hatred is acceptable, heat-of-the-moment behaviour.\n\nAt the elite level, ignorance is no shield. Football has moved on. Anyone who hasn’t shouldn’t be anywhere near it.",

    "description": "“I have confidence in this team’s ability to put a marker down against Fulham and go again”, writes John Wilson.",
    "fullText": "At the start of this season, it seemed as though every game was informative of the direction we were going in and that every game told us something about the squad and the team.\n\nHow would we compete with West Ham in our opening fixture? How would we bounce back after our first away defeat against Burnley? For me, it was following the home draw with Arsenal that I stopped asking about how we’d cope.\n\nThat performance told me all I needed to know: that when this Sunderland team puts their mind to a task; when there’s a collective desire to get a result, they can achieve it. So that took us to early November, when I started to relax and think we weren’t going to be in any relegation scrap, and to try and enjoy each match and the season as a whole.\n\nWhen there were blips and when the collective eye wasn’t on the ball (the away games against Fulham, Brentford and West Ham) we always bounced back with a win or at least a solid performance. Our home form has been excellent, attracting plaudits from every angle, and it wasn’t until the Premier League title holders came to the Stadium of Light earlier this month that our undefeated home record was lost.\n\nIndeed, our general form has been so good that there are many fans and football commentators who’ve mentioned Sunderland as contenders for a European spot. Yet, in the eyes of Régis Le Bris, forty points has always been the target — and I think he recently adjusted that total to forty two as the competition at the bottom has started to heat up.\n\nI’m not worried in the slightest about being pulled into the relegation fight.\n\nIt’s not going to happen, but in my head, the reason I’ve returned to my early season thoughts of “This game will tell us a lot about this team and mentality”, for the Fulham game is, I suppose, the next stage of our development.\n\nAre we going to stall and be very content just to sit mid-table and possibly end up as low as fifteenth or sixteenth (which we would’ve said was excellent before a ball was kicked this season), or do we have the skill, desire and energy to push on and try and claim a European spot?\n\nThe argument as to whether this is a good thing for the club at this stage is a moot point, as you can bet there isn’t one player in the squad who is holding back because they don’t think we’re quite ready for Europe as a club!\n\nFulham are one of those teams to whom if the psychology and attitude of the players isn’t right, we’ll lose.\n\nAs a fan, I can appreciate that being “up” for a game against a Manchester City or Arsenal is relatively easy a players want to show what they can do, challenging themselves against better teams and supposedly better footballers.\n\nHowever, just as we might be walking to the Stadium of Light full of excitement and vigour for a match against the ‘Visitors’ or Manchester United, are we as passionate against Burnley or indeed Fulham? It must surely be the same for the team.\n\nYes, they’re professionals and should be able to play at their peak for every game, but in reality, that isn’t the case — only the very top teams have that consistency to turn it on against whomever the opposition might be.\n\nSo, I’m back to my early-season quandary. What will this game tell us about our team? Are we up for a European challenge — or is it “only Fulham”, and as such, we don’t have to put a shift in?\n\nThis week, I’ve seen some criticism of Le Bris, based on the idea that during the second half of the season, his teams are generally not as impressive as the first half. They either point to his second season with Lorient — when they were relegated — or the way we took our foot off the gas in the Championship when fourth place was assured — both of which were defined by extraneous circumstances, in my opinion.\n\nWithout Granit Xhaka, we’ve played four league games and lost three (albeit two of them were against Arsenal and Liverpool), but Xhaka is back for the Fulham game and despite losing Reinildo, we do have a decent squad to pick from.\n\nI think the answer to my question is “Yes. We can push on, and our season isn’t going to fizzle out”.\n\nWe’ll know by Sunday afternoon, but I have confidence in this team’s ability to put a marker down against Fulham and go again. Haway, me bonnie lads!",

    "description": "Workers describe a deteriorating culture at Block, the company behind Square and Cash App, where layoffs continue and employees are expected to use AI tools daily.",
    "fullText": "workers were laid off in early February from Jack Dorsey’s Block, some of the people remaining at the company say the internal culture has devolved to a point where performance anxiety is running rampant, using generative AI is required, and overall morale is rapidly deteriorating. Block is the parent company behind the merchant payment processor Square and the payment app Cash App. Dorsey cofounded the company in 2009 after previously cofounding Twitter.\n\n“Morale is probably the worst I’ve felt in four years,” reads an employee complaint submitted to Dorsey in a recent all-hands meeting, a transcript of which was seen by WIRED. “The overarching culture at Block is crumbling.” WIRED spoke with seven current and former Block employees, who requested anonymity to speak freely about internal operations at the company. A Block spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe layoffs at Block started this month and could eventually impact up to 10 percent of the company's workforce, according to reporting by Bloomberg. Before the headcount reductions began, Block had around 11,000 people on staff. Rather than a one-off event, management has slowly enacted the firings over the course of weeks and told employees that the process will continue through the end of this month, sources tell WIRED.\n\n“We don't yet know if our livelihoods will be affected, and this makes it incredibly hard to make major life choices without knowing if we still have a job next week,” reads another employee complaint from the same meeting with Dorsey.\n\nMultiple sources who spoke with WIRED say they were appalled when Arnaud Weber, Block’s engineering lead, sent out an email after the initial wave of layoffs characterizing them as being performance-related rather than a cost-saving measure. The sources say they disagree with management’s internal messaging about the firings being merit-based.\n\n“As part of our 2025 performance cycle, we have parted ways with teammates who weren't meeting the expectations of their role,” wrote Weber in the email, which was viewed by WIRED. “These departures were based on clear performance gaps, role expectations, and alignment coming out of calibrations on the bar for each level.”\n\nBlock employees are currently expected to send an update email to Dorsey every week, who then uses generative AI to summarize the thousands of messages. In the same all-hands meeting, which took place after hundreds of staff had already been fired, Dorsey said that frequent topics cited by workers in their latest messages included “widespread concerns about layoffs,” “performance anxiety,” and “the tension between accelerating delivery through AI adoption versus maintaining code quality and engineering rigor.”\n\nDuring the meeting, Dorsey reiterated that the layoffs were made for performance reasons, saying that there was “a sizable portion of our population that have been phoning it in.” He also stressed that the remaining workers should be using generative AI tools to maximize productivity, or else Block would risk being outpaced by its competitors.\n\n“Top-down mandates to use large language models are crazy,” says one current Block employee. “If the tool were good, we’d all just use it.”",

    "description": "What scientists thought were four separate star clusters are actually part of one nearly invisible system.",
    "fullText": "identified what appears to be a cosmic anomaly: a faint galaxy with so few visible stars that, according to calculations, as much as 99.9 percent of its mass is dark matter. The remaining 0.1 percent is conventional matter.\n\nThis galaxy, located about 300 million light-years away, is practically invisible. Only four globular clusters, small concentrations of stars that look like isolated neighborhoods in the middle of the void, stand out. For years, these star collections in the Perseus cluster were considered independent objects.\n\nNow, after an exhaustive analysis, a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters presents solid evidence that these globular clusters are part of the same galaxy dominated by dark matter. Tentatively named CDG-2 (Candidate Dark Galaxy-2), it is the first galaxy to be detected only by its brightest fragments.\n\nThe authors pooled data from the Hubble, Euclid, and Subaru telescopes, three of the most powerful observatories available. The combined readings reveal an extremely faint glow around the four globular clusters. This residual light is a clear sign of an underlying galaxy so dim that the three telescopes missed it on their own.\n\nPreliminary analysis indicates that CDG-2 has a total luminosity equivalent to about 6 million suns, with the four globular clusters contributing about 16 percent of that brightness, an unusually large share. This distribution suggests that, despite its low light, the galaxy is a gravitationally bound system, implying a particularly dense dark matter halo. Astronomers estimate that this invisible structure accounts for between 99.94 to 99.98 percent of CDG-2’s total mass.\n\nAccording to current models, dark matter constitutes roughly 27 percent of the universe’s total energy density and about 85 percent of its matter. Although the exact nature of what makes up dark matter is still unclear, because it neither emits nor reflects light, scientists infer its existence from its gravitational effects on radiation, visible matter, and the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\n\nDark matter is so pervasive throughout galaxies that its presence explains the stability and motion of stars in systems such as the Milky Way. For example, current models indicate that our galaxy is embedded in a halo composed of about 90 percent dark matter.\n\nHowever, the case of CDG-2 is extreme: a galaxy with almost no stars, surrounded almost entirely by an invisible halo. These types of systems, so-called “dark galaxies,” are beginning to appear in astronomical records. Beyond their rarity, scientists value them because they serve as natural laboratories for exploring the nature of dark matter and testing current models of galaxy formation.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "description": "A pragmatic, code-first argument for Ruby as the best language to ship AI products in 2026.",
    "fullText": "If your goal is to ship AI applications in 2026, Ruby is the best language to do it.\n\nPython owns model training. PyTorch, TensorFlow, the entire notebooks-and-papers gravity well. Nobody disputes that.\n\nBut you’re not training LLMs. Almost nobody is. Each training run costs millions of dollars. The dataset is the internet!\n\nThis is what AI development today looks like:\n\nThe entire Python ML stack is irrelevant to achieve this. What matters is everything around it: streaming responses to users, persisting conversations, tracking costs, switching providers when pricing changes.\n\nThat’s web application engineering. That’s where Ruby and Rails shine like no other.\n\nYou need a beautiful, truly provider-independent API. Let me show you.\n\nYou need to specify the provider, create an array of messages that need to be instantiated, etc.\n\nWhat if you want to use a model from another provider?\n\nIf you’re running AI in production, you need to track token usage. This is how you price your app.\n\nDifferent key and different structure!\n\nSame interface. Every provider. Every model.\n\nThis isn’t just about aesthetics.\n\nIt’s about cognitive overhead: how many abstractions, how many provider-specific details, how many different data structures you need to hold in your head instead of focusing on what really matters: prompts and tool design.\n\nLow cognitive overhead compounds: faster onboarding, fewer accidental bugs, easier refactors, and cleaner debugging when production explodes at 2AM.\n\nRuby’s advantage here is cultural: elegant APIs are treated as first-class engineering work, not icing on the cake.\n\nModel calls are only a small chunk of your code. The rest makes up the bulk of it: auth, billing, background jobs, streaming UI, persistence, admin screens, observability, even native apps.\n\nRails gives you a beautiful, coherent answer for all of it.\n\nWith RubyLLM + Rails, the core streaming loop is tiny:\n\nThis gives you streaming chunks to your web app and persistence in your DB in absurdly few lines of code.\n\nLLM workloads are mostly network-bound and streaming-bound. That’s exactly where Ruby’s Async ecosystem shines. Fibers let you handle high concurrency without thread explosion and resource waste. No need to plaster the code with async/await keywords. RubyLLM became concurrent with 0 code changes.\n\nI wrote a deep dive here: Async Ruby is the Future of AI Apps (And It’s Already Here)\n\nSomeone ported RubyLLM’s API design to JavaScript as NodeLLM. Same design. Clean code, good docs.\n\nThe JavaScript community’s response: zero upvotes on Reddit. 14 GitHub stars. Top comments: “How’s this different from AI SDK?” and “It’s always fun when you AI bros post stuff. They all look and sound the same. Also, totally unnecessary.”\n\nRubyLLM: #1 on Hacker News. ~3,600 stars. 5 million downloads. Half a million people using RubyLLM-powered apps today.\n\nSame design. Wildly different reception. That tells you everything about which community is ready for this moment.\n\nAnd teams that switched from Python are not going back:\n\nWe had a customer deployment coming up and our Langgraph agent was failing. I rebuilt it using RubyLLM. Not only was it far simpler, it performed better than the Langgraph agent.\n\nOur first pass at the AI Agent used langchain… it was so painful that we built it from scratch in Ruby. Like a cloud had lifted. Langchain was that bad.\n\nAt Yuma, serving over 100,000 end users, our unified AI interface was awful. RubyLLM is so much nicer than all of that.\n\nThese aren’t people who haven’t tried Python. They tried it, shipped it, and replaced it.\n\nWhen we freed ourselves from complexity, this community built Twitter, GitHub, Shopify, Basecamp, Airbnb. Rails changed web development forever.\n\nNow we have the chance to change AI app development. Because AI apps are all about the product. And nobody builds products better than Ruby developers.",

    "description": "As Colorado lawmakers once again revisit online age verification, the debate is no longer about whether to protect children online.",
    "fullText": "As Colorado lawmakers once again revisit online age verification, the debate is no longer about whether to protect children online. It is about how and whether the tools being proposed can realistically accomplish that goal.\n\nIn recent years, Colorado has joined a growing number of states considering legislation aimed at limiting minors’ access to online content deemed harmful. The proposals have varied in structure but share a common thread.\n\nMany lean on centralized technology ecosystems, particularly mobile operating systems and app stores, as enforcement points rather than attempting to regulate the open web directly.\n\nSenate Bill 26-051 reflects that pattern. The bill does not directly regulate individual websites that publish adult or otherwise restricted content. Instead, it shifts responsibility to operating system providers and app distribution infrastructure.\n\nUnder the bill, an operating system provider would be required to collect a user’s date of birth or age information when an account is established. The provider would then generate an age bracket signal and make that signal available to developers through an application programming interface when an app is downloaded or accessed through a covered application store.\n\nApp developers, in turn, would be required to request and use that age bracket signal.\n\nRather than mandating that every website perform its own age verification check, the bill attempts to embed age attestation within the operating system account layer and have that classification flow through app store ecosystems.\n\nThe measure represents the latest iteration in a series of Colorado efforts that have struggled to balance child safety, privacy, feasibility and constitutional limits.\n\nColorado lawmakers have grappled with age verification policy for several sessions. In 2025, Senate Bill 25-201 sought to require certain websites that publish material deemed harmful to children to implement age verification systems.\n\nThe bipartisan proposal mirrored legislation advancing in other states that targeted adult content platforms and imposed mandatory age checks.\n\nSB 25-201 advanced out of committee but ultimately did not pass and is marked as lost after multiple second reading layovers.\n\nThe bill included provisions requiring that platforms offer at least one age verification method that did not disclose a user’s identity and required compliance with Colorado’s Privacy Act data handling standards.\n\nStill, it faced significant First Amendment and enforcement concerns. Civil liberties groups argued that requiring users to submit government-issued identification or other sensitive credentials to access lawful speech would burden adults’ rights and create new security risks if that information were breached.\n\nTechnical experts questioned whether a state mandate could effectively regulate websites hosted outside Colorado’s jurisdiction.\n\nAnother 2025 measure, Senate Bill 25-086, took a broader regulatory approach. It required social media companies to make commercially reasonable efforts to determine user age categories and imposed reporting and design-related requirements tied to minors.\n\nThat bill was ultimately vetoed by Governor Jared Polis in April 2025. The veto reflected concerns about feasibility, constitutional exposure and the complexity of imposing sweeping platform mandates at the state level.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, SB 26-051 takes a different structural approach. Instead of focusing on specific categories of websites or imposing direct verification obligations on individual publishers, it moves enforcement closer to the hardware and operating system layer that mediates access to mobile applications.\n\nThe shift is partly technical. Smartphones and tablets operate within vertically integrated systems. A limited number of companies control the operating system, the application marketplace, the account infrastructure and the software distribution pipeline.\n\nThat structure creates a defined compliance point. Lawmakers can require operating system providers to generate an age signal and require app developers to rely on that signal.\n\nWeb browsers provide access to millions of independently operated sites across jurisdictions. Cloud infrastructure is globally distributed. There is no single chokepoint on a desktop or laptop where a state can easily impose age verification without fundamentally altering how the open web functions.\n\nSB 26-051’s operating system-level age attestation requirement reflects that reality. It targets the segments of the digital ecosystem where centralized control already exists, even if other access pathways remain available.\n\nAs of the current legislative session, SB 26-051 has been introduced and assigned to the Senate Committee on Business, Labor, and Technology. The committee is scheduled to take up the bill on February 24.\n\nLike prior efforts, the bill is expected to face scrutiny over its constitutional footing, technical feasibility and privacy implications. Recent federal court decisions in other states have underscored the legal uncertainty surrounding age verification mandates, particularly those affecting access to lawful adult speech.\n\nCourts have examined whether such laws are narrowly tailored and whether less restrictive alternatives, including parental controls, are available. That judicial backdrop is likely to shape how Colorado lawmakers evaluate and potentially refine the bill.\n\nAt the same time, political momentum behind child online safety legislation remains strong. Lawmakers across party lines continue to frame age attestation and related requirements as responses to concerns about exposure to explicit material, social media harms and addictive platform design.\n\nThat shared concern has kept successive proposals alive even as earlier versions have failed or been vetoed.\n\nLegislation that conditions app downloads and access on an operating system-generated age signal may reduce friction in certain contexts, particularly within centralized mobile ecosystems. But it does not eliminate alternative access pathways.\n\nMany services that exist as mobile apps are also accessible through web browsers. School issued laptops, shared family computers and public library terminals are not governed by the same mobile app store infrastructure.\n\nIf the same content remains available through the open web, determined users may be able to bypass mobile restrictions. That dynamic has led critics to argue that such laws risk offering the appearance of safety without comprehensively addressing how minors access online material.\n\nIf the objective is to meaningfully restrict minors’ access to specific categories of online content, policymakers face a more fundamental choice.\n\nOne approach would be universal identity verification for Internet access, requiring users to present government issued identification to access websites and digital services.\n\nSuch a system would effectively end anonymous browsing and would represent a profound transformation of the Internet’s architecture, raising sweeping privacy, civil liberties and data security concerns.\n\nThe other approach centers on parental control. Major technology companies already provide device level and account level tools that allow parents to filter content, restrict downloads, set time limits and monitor usage. These systems can be tailored to family preferences and activated voluntarily.\n\nAge attestation mandates like SB 26-051 occupy a middle ground. They attempt to impose standardized compliance obligations within existing mobile ecosystems without requiring universal identification across the open web.\n\nIn doing so, they expand the role of the state in shaping digital identity infrastructure while leaving much of the broader internet unchanged.\n\nWhether Colorado ultimately advances SB 26-051 will depend on how lawmakers navigate that tension. The political appeal of protecting children online is clear.\n\nThe harder question is whether operating system-level age attestation can deliver meaningful protection without reshaping digital identity systems in ways that raise new constitutional and privacy concerns.\n\nage verification  |  app store age verification  |  children  |  Colorado  |  data privacy  |  device-based age verification  |  legislation  |  United States",

    "description": "ESET researchers discover PromptSpy, the first known Android malware to abuse generative AI in its execution flow.",
    "fullText": "ESET researchers uncovered the first known case of Android malware abusing generative AI for context-aware user interface manipulation. While machine learning has been used to similar ends already – just recently, researchers at Dr.WEB found Android.Phantom, which uses TensorFlow machine learning models to analyze advertisement screenshots and automatically click on detected elements for large scale ad fraud – this is the first time we have seen generative AI deployed in this manner. Because the attackers rely on prompting an AI model (in this instance, Google’s Gemini) to guide malicious UI manipulation, we have named this family PromptSpy. This is the second AI powered malware we have discovered – following PromptLock in August 2025, the first known case of AI-driven ransomware.\n\nWhile generative AI is deployed only in a relatively minor part of PromptSpy's code – that responsible for achieving persistence – it still has a significant impact on the malware's adaptability. Specifically, Gemini is used to analyze the current screen and provide PromptSpy with step-by-step instructions on how to ensure the malicious app remains pinned in the recent apps list, thus preventing it from being easily swiped away or killed by the system. The AI model and prompt are predefined in the code and cannot be changed. Since Android malware often relies on UI navigation, leveraging generative AI enables the threat actors to adapt to more or less any device, layout, or OS version, which can greatly expand the pool of potential victims.\n\nThe main purpose of PromptSpy is to deploy a built-in VNC module, giving operators remote access to the victim’s device. This Android malware also abuses the Accessibility Service to block uninstallation with invisible overlays, captures lockscreen data, records video. It communicates with its C&C server via the VNC protocol, using AES encryption.\n\nBased on language localization clues and the distribution vectors observed during analysis, this campaign appears to be financially motivated and seems to primarily target users in Argentina. Interestingly, analyzed PromptSpy samples suggest that it was developed in a Chinese‑speaking environment.\n\nPromptSpy is distributed by a dedicated website and has never been available on Google Play. As an App Defense Alliance partner, we nevertheless shared our findings with Google. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is enabled by default on Android devices with Google Play Services.\n\nEven though PromptSpy uses Gemini in just one of its features, it still demonstrates how incorporating these AI tools can make malware more dynamic, giving threat actors ways to automate actions that would normally be more difficult with traditional scripting.\n\nAs was briefly mentioned already, Android malware usually depends on hardcoded screen features such as taps, coordinates, or UI selectors – methods that can break with UI changes across devices, OS versions, or manufacturer skins. PromptSpy aims to achieve persistence by staying embedded in the list of recent apps by executing the “lock app in recent apps” gesture (the full process is described in the Analysis section), which varies between devices and manufacturers. This makes it difficult to automate with fixed scripts traditionally used by Android malware.\n\nPromptSpy therefore takes a completely different approach: it sends Gemini a natural‑language prompt along with an XML dump of the current screen, giving the AI a detailed view of every UI element: its text, type, and exact position on the display.\n\nGemini processes this information and responds with JSON instructions that tell the malware what action to perform (for example, a tap) and where to perform it. The malware saves both its previous prompts and Gemini’s responses, allowing Gemini to understand context and to coordinate multistep interactions.\n\nFigure 1 shows a code snippet of PromptSpy’s initialization of communication with Gemini, including the first prompt used. By handing the decision-making over to Gemini, the malware can recognize the correct UI element and perform the appropriate gesture, keeping the malware alive even if the user tries to close it.\n\nPromptSpy continues prompting Gemini until the AI confirms that the app has been successfully locked, showing a feedback loop where the malware waits for validation before moving on.\n\nIn February 2026, we uncovered two versions of a previously unknown Android malware family. The first version, which we named VNCSpy, appeared on VirusTotal on January 13th, 2026 and was represented by three samples uploaded from Hong Kong. On February 10th, 2026, four samples of more advanced malware based on VNCSpy were uploaded to VirusTotal from Argentina.\n\nOur analysis of the samples from Argentina revealed multistage malware with a malicious payload that misuses Google’s Gemini. Based on these findings, we named the first stage of this malware PromptSpy dropper, and its payload PromptSpy.\n\nIt should be noted that we haven’t yet seen any samples of the PromptSpy dropper or its payload in our telemetry, which might indicate that both of them are just proofs of concept. However, based on the existence of a possible distribution domain described in the following paragraphs, we cannot discount the possibility of the PromptSpy dropper and PromptSpy existing in the wild.\n\nAccording to VirusTotal data, all four PromptSpy dropper samples were distributed through the website mgardownload[.]com; it was already offline during our analysis.\n\nAfter installing and launching PromptSpy dropper, it opened a webpage hosted on m‑mgarg[.]com. Although this domain was also offline, Google’s cached version revealed that it likely impersonated a Chase Bank (legally, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.) site (see Figure 2).\n\nThe malware uses similar branding, with the app name MorganArg and the icon inspired by Chase bank (see Figure 3). MorganArg, likely a shorthand for “Morgan Argentina”, also appears as the name of the cached website, suggesting a regional targeting focus.\n\nWe used the m-mgarg[.]com domain to pivot in VirusTotal, leading us to yet another Android malware sample (Android/Phishing.Agent.M). VirusTotal showed the spoofed website in Spanish, with an Iniciar sesión (Login) button, indicating that the page was probably intended to mimic a website of a bank (see Figure 4).\n\nThis trojan appears to function as a companion application developed by the same threat actor behind VNCSpy and PromptSpy. In the background, the trojan contacts its server to request a configuration file, which includes a link to download another APK, presented to the victim, in Spanish, as an update. During our research, the configuration server was no longer accessible, so the exact download URL remains unknown. However, given that it uses the same unique bank spoofing website, the same app name, icon, and, most importantly, is signed by the same unique developer certificate as the PromptSpy dropper – we strongly suspect this app may serve as the initial stage designed to lead victims toward installing PromptSpy.\n\nBoth VNCSpy and PromptSpy include a VNC component, giving their operators full remote access to compromised devices once victims enable Accessibility Services (see Figure 5). This allows the malware operators to see everything happening on the device, and to perform taps, swipes, gestures, and text input as though they were physically holding the phone.\n\nOn top of the malicious capabilities already contained in VNCSpy, PromptSpy adds AI‑assisted UI manipulation, helping it maintain persistence by keeping the malicious app pinned in the recent apps list (an example of how the lock is indicated in the list can be seen in Figure 6).\n\nWe believe this functionality is used before the VNC session is established, so that the user or system will not kill the PromptSpy activity from the list of recent apps. In Figure 7, you can see PromptSpy network communication with Gemini AI.\n\nWhile analyzing PromptSpy, we noticed that it contains debug strings written in simplified Chinese. It even includes handling for various Chinese Accessibility event types (see Figure 8), a debug method that had been disabled in the code but not removed. The primary purpose of this method is to provide a localized (Chinese) explanation for various accessibility events that occur on an Android device. This makes the event logs more understandable for Chinese-speaking users or developers, rather than just displaying raw integer codes.\n\nWith medium confidence, these details suggest that PromptSpy was developed in a Chinese‑speaking environment.\n\nOur technical analysis focuses on the PromptSpy dropper and its payload, PromptSpy. PromptSpy is embedded (app-release.apk) inside the dropper’s asset directory. This APK holds the core malicious functionality. When the dropper is launched, it displays a prompt urging the user to install what appears to be an updated version of the app. This “update” is actually the PromptSpy payload, which the user must install manually (see Figure 9).\n\nOnce installed and launched, PromptSpy requests Accessibility Service permissions, giving the malware the ability to read on‑screen content and perform automated clicks.\n\nThen PromptSpy shows a simple loading-style decoy screen in the foreground (see Figure 10). Meanwhile, in the background, it begins communicating with Gemini AI to obtain instructions needed to lock its process in the Recent Apps list – a simple persistence technique that allows PromptSpy to remain active and locked in place even after the device is rebooted.\n\nWhen the user sees the Loading, please wait activity, PromptSpy uses Accessibility Services to open the Recent Apps screen and collect detailed UI information: visible text, content descriptions, class names, package names, and screen bounds. It serializes this dynamic UI snapshot as XML and includes it in its prompt to Gemini. Gemini then returns step-by-step tap instructions on how to achieve the “app lock” gesture.\n\nThis process forms a continuous loop:\n\nThe loop continues until Gemini confirms that the app is successfully locked in recent apps. Here is an example structure:\n\nAll actions suggested by Gemini – taps, swipes, navigation – are executed through Accessibility Services, allowing the malware to interact with the device without user input.\n\nPromptSpy’s main malicious capability lies in its built‑in VNC service. This allows attackers to remotely view the victim’s screen in real time and fully control the device.\n\nThe malware communicates with its hardcoded command‑and‑control (C&C) server at 54.67.2[.]84 using the VNC protocol; the messages are AES-encrypted using a hardcoded key. Through this communication channel, the malware can:\n\nPromptSpy also misuses Accessibility Services as an anti‑removal mechanism. When the user attempts to uninstall the payload or disable Accessibility Services, the malware overlays transparent rectangles on specific screen areas - particularly over buttons containing substrings like stop, end, clear, and Uninstall. These overlays are invisible to the user but intercept interactions, making removal difficult. In Figure 11, we’ve run PromptSpy with the debug flag enabled (kept there by developers) that would set the color of the transparent rectangle, to visualize where they are specifically displayed. However, on the actual device, they are fully invisible.\n\nBecause PromptSpy blocks uninstallation by overlaying invisible elements on the screen, the only way for a victim to remove it is to reboot the device into Safe Mode, where third‑party apps are disabled and can be uninstalled normally.\n\nTo enter Safe Mode, users should typically press and hold the power button, long‑press Power off, and confirm the Reboot to Safe Mode prompt (though the exact method may differ by device and manufacturer). Once the phone restarts in Safe Mode, the user can go to Settings → Apps → MorganArg and uninstall it without interference.\n\nPromptSpy shows that Android malware is beginning to evolve in a sinister way. By relying on generative AI to interpret on‑screen elements and decide how to interact with them, the malware can adapt to virtually any device, screen size, or UI layout it encounters. Instead of hardcoded taps, it simply hands AI a snapshot of the screen and receives precise, step‑by‑step interaction instructions in return, helping it achieve a persistence technique resistant to UI changes.\n\nMore broadly, this campaign shows how generative AI can make malware far more dynamic and capable of real‑time decision‑making. PromptSpy is an early example of generative AI‑powered Android malware, and it illustrates how quickly attackers are beginning to misuse AI tools to improve impact.\n\nA comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in our GitHub repository.\n\nSHA-1\nFilename\nDetection\nDescription\n\n6BBC9AB132BA066F63676E05DA13D108598BC29B\nnet.ustexas.myavlive.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\n375D7423E63C8F5F2CC814E8CFE697BA25168AFA\nnlll4.un7o6.q38l5.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\n3978AC5CD14E357320E127D6C87F10CB70A1DCC2\nppyzz.dpk0p.ln441.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\nE60D12017D2DA579DF87368F5596A0244621AE86\nmgappc-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n9B1723284E311794987997CB7E8814EB6014713F\nmgappm-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n076801BD9C6EB78FC0331A4C7A22C73199CC3824\nmgappn-0.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n8364730E9BB2CF3A4B016DE1B34F38341C0EE2FA\nmgappn-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\nF8F4C5BC498BCCE907DC975DD88BE8D594629909\napp-release.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy.\n\nC14E9B062ED28115EDE096788F62B47A6ED841AC\nmgapp.apk\nAndroid/Phishing.Agent.M\nAndroid phishing malware.\n\nIP\nDomain\nHosting provider\nFirst seen\nDetails\n\n52.222.205[.]45\nm-mgarg[.]com\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n2026‑01‑12\nPhishing website.\n\n54.67.2[.]84\nN/A\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nN/A\nC&C server.\n\n104.21.91[.]170\nmgardownload[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2026‑01‑13\nDistribution website.\n\nThis table was built using version 18 of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n\nTactic\nID\nName\nDescription\n\nPersistence\nT1398\nBoot or Logon Initialization Scripts\nPromptSpy receives the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast intent to activate at device startup.\n\nT1541\nForeground Persistence\nPromptSpy uses foreground persistence to keep a service running.\n\nDefense Evasion\nT1516\nInput Injection\nPromptSpy abuses the accessibility service to prevent its removal.\n\nCredential Access\nT1417.002\nMalicious Third Party Keyboard App: GUI Input Capture\nPromptSpy can intercept Android lockscreen PIN and password.\n\nDiscovery\nT1426\nSystem Information Discovery\nPromptSpy obtains device name, model, and OS version.\n\nCollection\nT1418\nSoftware Discovery\nPromptSpy can obtain a list of installed applications.\n\nT1513\nScreen Capture\nPromptSpy can record the screen.\n\nCommand and Control\nT1663\nRemote Access Software\nPromptSpy can use VNC to remotely control a compromised device.\n\nT1521.001\nStandard Cryptographic Protocol: Symmetric Cryptography\nPromptSpy encrypts C&C communication using AES.\n\nExfiltration\nT1646\nExfiltration Over C2 Channel\nPromptSpy can exfiltrate collected data to the C&C server.",

    "fullText": "Ex-Victoria’s Secret mogul Les Wexner’s lawyer was caught on a hot mic jokingly threatening to \"kill\" him if he continued giving long answers to questions during his deposition on Jeffrey Epstein by the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe moment was caught after the committee released its full, nearly five-hour deposition of 88-year-old Wexner as part of its ongoing probe into Jeffrey Epstein’s network.\n\nSeveral hours into the deposition, while Wexner was giving a particularly long-winded answer, Wexner’s attorney leaned over to him and whispered in his ear, \"I’m going to f---ing kill you if you answer another question with more than five words, okay?\"\n\nBoth Wexner and his attorney laughed after this statement, indicating Wexner understood it as a joke. The lawyer proceeded to instruct Wexner to \"answer the question,\" laughing more.\n\nShortly before this exchange, the attorney had urged Wexner to \"answer the question,\" saying, \"I'm sure we all appreciate the stories, we're just trying to answer questions that they actually want answered,\" referring to the House committee.\n\nEpstein Probe Leader Comer Says 'No One Is Above The Law' After Ex-prince Andrew Arrest\n\nThe Oversight Committee heard from Wexner, a billionaire fashion mogul best known for his work in revolutionizing the Victoria’s Secret store chain, about his involvement with Epstein, whom Wexner characterized as strictly a business associate rather than a close friend.\n\nDespite being named a co-conspirator in a recently uncovered FBI document from 2019, Wexner said that he has never been directly contacted by either the FBI or the Department of Justice. He maintained his total innocence during the deposition, saying, \"I was naïve, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein. He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide. I completely and irrevocably cut ties with Epstein nearly twenty years ago when I learned that he was an abuser, a crook, and a liar.\"\n\nThe committee stated it was releasing the full deposition with \"no spin,\" saying, \"The American people deserve to see the testimony for themselves—transparency matters.\"\n\nWexner is the founder of L Brands, formerly called The Limited, through which he acquired well-known companies Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, Express, and Abercrombie & Fitch, among others. He is no longer associated with Victoria’s Secret. He was one of Epstein's first major clients as a financial advisor, with Epstein being granted power of attorney over Wexner's vast wealth. Wexner also sold his Manhattan townhouse to Epstein, which was later discovered to be one of the locations where federal authorities accused Epstein of abusing young women and girls under 18.\n\nDespite this, Wexner stated that he always kept his relationship with Epstein as strictly professional, saying, \"I don’t think I ever went to lunch, or dinner, a movie or had a cup of coffee with Jeffrey,\" adding, \"My focus was on my business and on community.\"\n\nExclusive: Epstein Emails Released As Doj Says No Criminal Or Inappropriate Conduct By Trump\n\nWexner said he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after learning of an investigation and discovering that Epstein had misappropriated funds from him and his family. He said a substantial amount of the money was returned.\n\nWexner also testified that he was not aware of Epstein ever staying at a guesthouse on his New Albany, Ohio, estate, where Maria Farmer is said to have been abused by Epstein and associate Ghislaine Maxwell. He maintained that he only had knowledge of Epstein staying at a nearby neighbor’s residence. Pressed on whether he denied Farmer’s testimony that she was abused on his property, he stated, \"I never met her, didn’t know she was here, didn’t know she was abused.\"\n\nHe categorically denied any knowledge of either Epstein or Maxwell arranging women for prominent individuals. He also categorically denied ever having a sexual encounter with anyone introduced by Maxwell and Epstein or having any sexual relationship with Epstein himself.\n\nHe further denied any sexual contact or knowledge of another prominent Epstein victim, Virginia Giuffre.\n\nAg Pam Bondi Announces 'All' Epstein Files Have Been Released, Listing Over 300 High-profile Names\n\nWexner was also asked about his knowledge of Epstein and President Donald Trump’s relationship. He said that he does not think they were friends, but said Epstein \"held him out as a friend.\"\n\nCommittee members also questioned Wexner on a note he wrote in a birthday book to Epstein in which he drew breasts with the caption, \"Dear Jeffrey, I wanted to get you what you want, so here it is … Your friend, Leslie.\"\n\nWexner confirmed that he wrote the note but dismissed it, saying, \"He was a bachelor, so I drew a pair of boobs as kind of a joke, offhandedly, I would say.\"\n\nWexner is the fourth person appearing before the House Oversight Committee in its Epstein probe.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer picked by judges to serve as the top federal prosecutor for a Virginia office that pursued cases against foes of President Donald Trump was swiftly fired Friday by the Justice Department in the latest clash over the appointments of powerful U.S. attorneys.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the firing of James Hundley on social media shortly after he was unanimously chosen by judges to replace former Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. While the law says that the district court may choose U.S. attorneys when an initial appointment expires, the Trump administration has insisted that the power lies only in the hands of the executive branch.\n\n“EDVA judges do not pick our US Attorney. POTUS does. James Hundley, you’re fired!” Blanche said in a post on X.\n\nHundley, who has handled criminal and civil cases for more than 30 years, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday evening.\n\nThe firing of Hundley is the latest reflection of tumult in one of the Justice Department’s most elite prosecution offices, which since September has been mired in upheaval following the resignation of a veteran prosecutor amid Trump administration pressure to prosecute two of the president’s biggest political foes, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThat prosecutor, Erik Siebert, was effectively forced out and swiftly replaced by Halligan, a White House aide who secured indictments against Comey and James but was later deemed by a judge to have been unlawfully appointed. The cases were dismissed, but the Justice Department has appealed that decision.\n\nHalligan resigned from the position last month after judges in the district signaled continued skepticism over the legitimacy of her appointment.\n\nU.S. attorneys, the top federal prosecutors in regional Justice Department offices around the country, typically require Senate confirmation but the law does permit attorneys general to make temporary appointments for limited time periods. In several instances, though, the Justice Department has attempted to leave its temporary appointees in place in ways that have invited court challenges and drawn resistance from judges who have found the appointments unlawful.\n\nLast week, a lawyer appointed by judges to be the U.S. attorney for northern New York was fired by the Justice Department after spending less than a day in the job. Judges in the district appointed Kinsella after declining to keep the Trump administration’s pick, John Sarcone, in place after his 120-day term elapsed.",

But if you're in the market for a new TV, you might be better off buying sooner rather than later.\n\nAs Axios reports, televisions generally require 1GB to 8GB of RAM to run \"smart TV\" features and to process video and data, and the memory units widely found in 4K TVs have more than quadrupled in price over the last year. That extra cost could be passed on to consumers: Analyst TrendForce said last month that a price hike on TVs was \"unavoidable,\" while Samsung acknowledged it may need to reprice its products. That said, a typical television uses less memory, and less advanced memory, than some other key devices, so a potential price-spike is likely to be less dramatic than it is for things like PCs and smartphones. We'll see for sure when manufacturers announce the prices of their 2026 models.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia are scooping up memory supply to run AI data centers, and most TV makers don't have the market power of these gigantic corporations. \"When memory tightens, prices rise, product launches shift...margins compress and smaller companies struggle more than large tech giants,\" Marco Mezger, executive vice president of memory tech company Neumonda, told Axios. There is good news for consumers, however.\n\nHigher RAM prices have yet to hit the retail TV market, making now an unusually good time to buy a television. Overall, the price of smart TVs decreased by 15% between 2024 and the start of 2026, so you're starting from a good place. In addition, manufacturers generally offer lower prices at this time of year to clear shelf space ahead of new model releases. While more expensive RAM could be baked into the price of 2026 televisions, sets on the shelves now were priced before the effects of the shortage hit the retail market. Plus, some companies price their TVs lower because they make a lot of money collecting your data—unless you do you what you can to stop them, of course. All of which leads to ridiculously good deals, like $900 for a 65-inch OLED TV from Samsung. Bottom line: if you're in the market for a new TV, don't wait. (Though, chances are, you might not need a new TV.)\n\nNo one can say for sure how long the memory shortage will last, but the consensus of industry analysts is that we likely won't see a return to anything we'd consider normal before 2028. AI demand is projected to consume 70% of all high-end DRAM in 2026, so manufacturers are prioritizing it over the less advanced, less in-demand memory chips used for TVs and appliances. While investors are sinking billions into ramping up memory manufacturing, it takes around 19 months to get a factory up and running in Taiwan, and even longer in the U.S., so TV prices will likely remain high into 2028.",

    "fullText": "Creators say they’re offering Africans a ‘hopeful, utopian feeling’ of retrieving objects looted by colonial armies\n\nA new South African video game lets players take back African artefacts held in western museums in a series of heists, amid a growing campaign to repatriate treasures looted by colonial armies.\n\nPlayers of Relooted become South African sports scientist and parkour expert Nomali, as she leaps and dives through museums to retrieve 70 real objects. They include an Asante gold mask that was taken by the British army when it destroyed the Asante empire’s capital, Kumasi, and is now in the Wallace Collection in London. Another object is the skull of the Tanzanian king Mangi Meli, which was taken to Germany after its colonial regime executed him in 1900.\n\nHundreds of thousands of culturally and spiritually significant items were looted from Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries, when European countries carved up the continent into colonies. A 2018 report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, estimated that more than 90% of Africa’s material cultural heritage was held outside the continent.\n\nBerlin’s Ethnologisches Museum and Cambridge University are among the institutions to have returned Benin bronzes to Nigeria, for example. Others, including the British Museum, have resisted calls to return bronzes and other looted objects.\n\nBen Myres, chief executive of Nyamakop, which developed Relooted, said: “Real-life repatriation is enormously complicated and it’s been ongoing for decades, in some cases even a century or more … We’re giving people this hopeful, utopian feeling … of what it’s going to feel like when all these artefacts finally come home.”\n\nMyres started creating the game in 2018 after his mother returned from the British Museum outraged at seeing the Nereid Monument, a Lycian tomb from Turkey. The museum says it was brought to the UK “with the full permission of the Ottoman Turkish authorities”.\n\n“She was shocked by the audacity of stealing a building … and she very flippantly said you should make a game about taking this back to where it belongs,” he said.\n\nThe game was created by a team from more than 10 African countries, while voice actors were hired from the countries of the characters that make up Nomali’s heist crew.\n\nMohale Mashigo, the game’s narrative director, said: “If we were going to go as far as researching real artefacts, getting a pronunciation guide for the artefacts, creating these characters from Cameroon, DRC, Malawi and [more], I wanted to make sure it sounded like different voices from different places.”\n\nMashigo created an “Africanfuturist” vision of the continent at the end of the 21st century, with cities and countries that “work for people”, rather than the more fantastical genre of Afrofuturism.\n\nIn contrast, Europe and the United States were intentionally made generic, as “The Old World” and “The Shiny Place” respectively. “We wanted to parody the way the west represents Africa,” Myres said.\n\nThe museums are also not real, apart from the Museum of Black Civilisations in Dakar, where players return the looted objects to an symbolically empty hall before they make their final journey to their home country.\n\nFor the game producer, Sithe Ncube, it was important that the Kabwe Skull, a 300,000-year-old fossil discovered in her country, Zambia, was included. The skull, also known as Broken Hill Man, is in London’s Natural History Museum.\n\nShe said: “Even before I started working at Nyamakop … I just felt like … someone should get it back and it would be cool for someone to do this in some form of media, in a game.”\n\nCreating Relooted was an eye-opening experience, Ncube said. “Learning about the scale of artefact looting in Africa, up to now I still can’t wrap my head around the numbers. It seems quite ridiculous and probably underestimated as well.”",

    "fullText": "As Saturday night prime-time drama goes, curling might seem a strange choice.\n\nEight men sliding 16 stones down an ice sheet to the soundtrack of clunking granite, furious sweeping and hollered commands of \"hard\" and \"curl\".\n\nAnd yet at 18:05 GMT - live on the BBC - millions will find themselves staring at televisions, tablets, laptops and phones to see if Team GB can add a fourth gold medal of these Winter Olympics.\n\nBruce Mouat's rink will face Canada - their oldest rivals - in the men's event in Cortina, high in the Dolomites in the north of Italy.\n\nIt will be the culmination of 11 days of competition which have included controversy, drama and intrigue... as well as the odd bout of boredom.\n\nBut why should you dedicate a couple of hours of your Saturday evening to it? Here's what you need to know...\n\nFour men, one aim - to end 102-year wait for Winter Olympic curling gold\n\nWhat do curlers do when they're not at the Olympics?\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\nThe first time curling appeared in the Winter Games was in 1924. That was the last time Britain's men won gold in the event as only three teams competed.\n\nThey have only been among the medals twice since.\n\nMouat's rink had to settle for silver four years ago in Beijing after being edged out by Sweden.\n\nAnd at Sochi 2014, a GB rink lost in the final to a Canadian team skipped by Brad Jacobs, who will lead them again on Saturday.\n\nAmong the British men he beat that day, were current GB coaches Michael Goodfellow and Greg Drummond, as well as David Murdoch, who is now the Canada high performance director.\n\nCanada also beat the British quartet in the round robin this month.\n\nBad omens or just fuel for revenge?\n\nLet's say Canada have had an eventful time of it in Italy.\n\nAccusations of cheating. Swear words being hurled across the ice. Counter-claims of a sting operation with illicit filming... it all got a little bit tasty.\n\nThen we had several days of wondering if Marc Kennedy was prone to leaving a lingering finger or guilty of administering an intentional prod?\n\nThe heat has been drawn from the situation since, but the Canadians seem a good fit for the role of pantomime villains.\n\nIt's fair to say they carry themselves in a certain manner...\n\nDismissed by some as just \"ice bowls\", curling follows a similar cycle.\n\nBroadly ignored for three years and 50 weeks, it registers in the wider public attention when the Olympics comes round, but as little more than wallpaper filling the gaps between the more exciting winter sports.\n\nThen, a few days in, we become hooked. People in offices and pubs find themselves discussing Rebecca Morrison's outrageous draw, or the ferocity with which Hammy McMillan brushes the ice. Or maybe just revelling in the Canadian capers.\n\nCome the end of the round-robin and the medal matches, we've properly bought in - the BBC audience for the semi-final win over Switzerland peaked at 3.4million.\n\nMaybe something worth keeping handy for when people tell you nobody is interested in curling...\n\nThen we'll get to Saturday's gold-medal match. Clammy palms, spiked heart-rates, agonising groans and joyful roars - and that's just Steve Cram in the commentary box.\n\nThe Cortina Curling Stadium is a quirky wee place.\n\nFirst built as an open-air venue to host the 1956 Games, it also played host to scenes from the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only, where James Bond became involved in a contretemps with some ice hockey players. Obviously.\n\nThe wooden bleachers and facings from those days still remain within the shell of a modern building. And when the noise rolls down from those stands... wow, it's loud.\n\nThe absence of the Italian hosts might quieten things down a little, but day-upon-day the British contingent seems to have swelled in this high-end resort town.\n\nFor the semi-final, one fan managed to smuggle a set of bagpipes into the arena. The story goes that they were hidden within a baby's pram to avoid the attention of security.\n\nWill they make it in again on Saturday? We'll see. But regardless, the roar of the kilt-clad masses will be there to support Mouat and his team.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe battle for the final podium spot in the men’s ice hockey tournament is set, with Slovakia taking on Finland in the Bronze Medal Game at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on Saturday, February 21.\n\nMy top Finland vs. Slovakia predictions and free betting picks expect Finland to win, extending their streak as the longest-standing nation to medal in Olympic tournaments featuring NHL players.\n\nFinland vs Slovakia Best bet: Finland -1.5 (+125 at BET99)\n\nDespite Slovakia winning 4-1 in the tournament opener, Finland generated 65.9% of the scoring chances.\n\nThe Finns just need more finish on those chances to take home the bronze medal and podium at the Olympics for the fourth consecutive time with NHL players, and that's a claim to fame no other country can match.\n\nMedaling will be both a point of pride for the Finns and an opportunity to kick the stink from the preliminary loss to the Slovaks.\n\nimg src=\"https://img.covers.com/betting/sportsbooks/82/bet99.svg\" alt=\"Bet99\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"194\" height=\"62\"\n\nIn addition to the highlighted mismatch, Finland gave Canada a good scare, and the Finns have allowed just 10 goals through five games. Finnish No. 1 Juuse Saros is also sporting an elite .938 save percentage after turning away 36 of 39 Canadian shots Friday.\n\nThe Slovaks lack the same firepower, and I expect the Finns to clog the neutral zone and rely on their depth of defensively responsible NHLers, just as they did against Canada in the semifinal.\n\nMoneyline: Finland -230 | Slovakia +175\n\nPuck Line: Finland -1.5 (+125) | Slovakia +1.5 (-160)\n\nOver/Under: Over 5.5 (+100) | Under 5.5 (-130)\n\nMilano Santagiulia Arena, Milan, Italy\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

Hateful language will not be tolerated. Exceptionally violent language (especially directed at specific people) will not be tolerated. Before you type, ask yourself, “Would I have a reasonable expectation of being thrown out of a bar in an average city if I said something like this?”\n\nBe respectful. There will definitely be times when everyone is upset and disagreements get heated, and that’s fine, but remember that we’re all rooting for the same team. Keep arguments based on substance and not personal insults.\n\nNo sharing illegal streams. NONE. Zero tolerance.\n\nNo spam. I have no interest in whatever crypto scheme you’re shilling. You will be banned.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers begin Cactus League play on Saturday, but early spring training action on Friday showed a high-profile free agent already making an impact at his new home. There were also updates about two pitchers on either side of Tommy John surgery.\n\nPete Alonso seems to be settling in nicely in Baltimore after leaving the New York Mets in free agency.\n\nAlonso, who signed a five year, $155 million contract with the Orioles late last year, blasted a two-run home run in the team’s spring training matchup with the Yankees.\n\nOrioles manager Craig Albernaz said Alonso asked for the third at-bat that resulted in the bomb, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\n“He wanted it, and he made the most of it,” Albernaz said. “It speaks a lot. Pete just wants to play.”\n\nAs reported by Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, Gerrit Cole wowed his teammates in his first live batting practice since Tommy John surgery.\n\nCole hit 97 mph with some pitches and managed to strike out one of the three batters he faced.\n\nYankees superstar Aaron Judge, who grounded out off a Cole pitch during the brief session, said his teammate again looked like the great pitcher who won the 2003 American League Cy Young Award.\n\n“Gerrit looked great,” Judge said. “Excited to see him back on the mound. That was the most important thing. The stuff is still electric.\n\nFull AB: Trent Grisham strikes out on a 95 mph fastball from Gerrit Cole pic.twitter.com/nh5TFcJYZQ\n\n— Chris Kirschner (@ChrisKirschner) February 20, 2026\n\nOn the other end of the Tommy John spectrum, Pablo Lopez will indeed have to undergo the procedure after tearing his ulnar collateral ligament.\n\nThe tear was reported earlier this week, though the details of the procedure have now been confirmed.\n\n“The team said Friday that López’s surgery will be performed next week in Texas by Rangers team physician Dr. Keith Meister,” the Associated Press reports. “López turns 30 early next month.”\n\nLopez missed significant time last season with injuries, but he still posted a 2.74 ERA in 14 starts.\n\nHe will also miss pitching for Team Venezuela in the upcoming World Baseball Classic.",

    "fullText": "Antoine Semenyo has made an impressive start to life at Manchester City. Since signing for City from Bournemouth, the Ghana international has scored five goals and added two assists in nine appearances for Pep Guardiola’s side. Semenyo, alongside Marc Guehi, arrived at City during last month’s transfer window, and the pair have made an immediate impact on their new team. In Semenyo’s case, Pep Guardiola has praised the powerful winger for the impact he has already made for his team. Looking further ahead, you do sense that Semenyo has barely scratched the surface of what he will become as a Manchester City player.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Manchester City’s pivotal Premier League fixture against Newcastle, Pep Guardiola praised the impact that Antoine Semenyo has made since signing for Manchester City. He explained: “It’s not just scoring a lot of goals. The strikers and the players who play up front are so important. Not just that. (He) makes a special rhythm, his versatility to play many positions up front and in the three positions.”\n\n“We knew it and comes from Bournemouth, they are exceptional in the rhythm and defensively and he has it in his DNA. His impact has been really good.”\n\nPep Guardiola also has confidence in Antoine Semenyo’s ability to play on the biggest stage in the UEFA Champions League. The Ghana international is yet to play in the competition, but that opportunity awaits him as this season progresses. Guardiola added: “Antoine we played against him many times in the last years and whether he can be top class or elite, we have to see. I don’t know, when you buy a player from a club, they come here, see how he adapts to play in the Champions League where he hasn’t played before.”\n\n“The biggest stages in the Premier League, yes, but in the knockout stages in the position is a good test for him. How he will react. I’m pretty sure his mentality, I think he will handle it quite well.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Antoine Semenyo, along with Marc Guehi, has made an immediate impact at Manchester City. This City side does feel immediately stronger with their addition. The pair were ready to make the next step in their careers. They forged their way in the Premier League at Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, and a move to a club like City was the logical next step for both players. Antoine Semenyo has made an impressive start to life as a City player. His goals have been crucial. In terms of what Semenyo can become as a City player, he is yet to scratch the surface of what he will become.\n\nAs impressive as Semenyo’s start to life at Manchester City has been, the areas of his game that need to be tidied up stand out. Semenyo has been clunky in possession at times, and he has been guilty of losing possession. He also needs to learn the nuances of Manchester City’s high defensive press. That will all come in time. Semenyo is currently learning on the fly. He is also yet to develop a proper understanding with Erling Haaland, Jeremy Doku, Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki, and the remainder of his City teammates. The more he plays, the more that will all come. So while Semenyo has made an immediate impact already, the ceiling is incredibly high for what the Ghana international will become for Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nAntoine Semenyo has rightly been praised by Pep Guardiola for his fast start to life at Manchester City. He has already made a tremendous contribution. Looking further ahead, Semenyo has more room to grow as a City player, and that in itself is a fantastic proposition to ponder for the future for Semenyo and Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "No. 19 Clemson turned a tight game into a comfortable win in a matter of minutes on Friday night.\n\nSix runs in the bottom of the eighth inning broke open a 3-3 tie and carried the Tigers to a 9-3 victory over Bryant in the opener of a three-game set at Doug Kingsmore Stadium. Clemson moved to 5-0 on the season, while the Bulldogs dropped to 1-3.\n\nThe game swung on a chaotic eighth. After loading the bases, true freshman Jason Fultz worked a walk to force in the go-ahead run, the first RBI of his career. Following a strikeout, Tryston McCladdie lined a two-run single into right to stretch the lead to 6-3. Clemson wasn’t finished. Luke Gaffney added an RBI walk with the bases loaded, Ty Dalley lifted a sacrifice fly, and Jack Crighton capped the inning with a run-scoring single.\n\nGaffney set the tone early at the plate, finishing a perfect 3-for-3 with a solo homer and two RBIs. Crighton also had three hits and drove in a run, while Jacob Jarrell went 2-for-3 with a homer, an RBI and two runs scored.\n\nBryant grabbed an early lead in the second when a ball off the bat of Charlie Saul skipped past centerfielder Bryce Clavon and rolled to the wall, allowing Saul to circle the bases. Clemson answered quickly. Gaffney launched a solo shot to left to tie it, and Jarrell followed Crighton’s single with a two-run homer to make it 3-1.\n\nThe Bulldogs evened the score in the seventh, capitalizing on a double and a fielding error that led to two unearned runs. Defensive miscues proved costly again for Clemson, which committed three errors. All three Bryant runs were unearned, and the Bulldogs managed just two hits all night.\n\nOn the mound, Aidan Knaak was sharp in his start, striking out eight over five innings while allowing just one unearned run on one hit. Justin LeGuernic followed and logged two-plus innings, surrendering only one hit. Joe Allen entered in the eighth after a leadoff walk and retired the next three hitters, striking out two to earn his second win. Nathan Dvorsky closed the door with a clean ninth.\n\nReacting to Clemson stars landing spots in ESPN’s best QBs of 2000’s https://t.co/LH8iUNef1T pic.twitter.com/foJNyTWKws\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) February 20, 2026\n\nClemson’s pitching staff racked up 14 strikeouts, a season high, and has now allowed just two earned runs through five games.\n\nThe same two teams meet again on Saturday, with first pitch scheduled for 2 p.m. Michael Sharman is slated to start for the Tigers.\n\nContact us @Clemson_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Clemson Tigers news and notes, plus opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Clemson Wire: Clemson baseball takes down Bryant after a massive 8th inning",

Both men are in rough patches in their careers, with Garcia coming in off a loss to Rolando Romero for the WBA welterweight title in May, while Barrios has retained his title in back-to-back draws in his previous two bouts.\n\nThe lead-up to their fight on Saturday has been mostly respectful between the two, and remained that way during the ceremonial weigh-ins on Friday night, though the two did have a prolonged final faceoff.\n\n𝗪𝗕𝗖 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗝𝗨𝗡𝗜𝗢𝗥 𝗪𝗘𝗟𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗪𝗘𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗧𝗜𝗧𝗟𝗘𝗦 𝗢𝗡 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘 🏆\n\nMario Barrios 🆚 Ryan Garcia \n\n🎟️ Buy BARRIOS VS GARCIA HERE –> https://t.co/FoiaUucafv#TheRingHighStakes | Feb 21 | Live Exclusively on DAZN | @RingMagazine ▪️ pic.twitter.com/WyJ0U7CC1K\n\n— DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nFollowing the faceoff, both men gave their final thoughts on the fight, with Garcia promising a much more exciting performance on Saturday than he gave against Romero last year.\n\n“You’re going to see a ferocious Ryan Garcia in the ring,” Garcia said. “We’re not here to play games. From that start of the bell, we’ll be ready to fight. … We’re going to be ferocious when it comes to that ring, and we’re getting right to it. …\n\n“I’m coming to light lightning, baby. You don’t want to miss this one, I promise you. This is going to be a Ryan Garcia classic. You don’t want to miss this one, I promise.”\n\nBarrios was less animated than Garcia, but no less confident, praising the challenger’s skills while maintaining he may have a surprise in store for “King” Ryan on Saturday.\n\n“Both of his hands are dangerous,” Barrios said. “He definitely has an equalizer with that hook. But like I said, everything we worked on. I also have a hook, I’ve got two hands, and I think that there’s a lot that he has to look out for. …\n\n“I’m going in there with bad intentions. Going in there, like I said, with all the work we put in. I think this fight could definitely end early.”\n\nGarcia vs. Barrios takes place this Saturday night, with prelims starting at 6 p.m. ET and available on MMA Fighting, while the main card kicks off at 8 p.m. on DAZN.",

    "fullText": "Eddie Hearn has claimed he “misjudged the character” of Conor Benn, after the boxer left Matchroom to join rival promoter Dana White.\n\nOn Friday, it was announced that Benn had joined Zuffa Boxing, which is spearheaded by UFC president White. And the move comes just days after White launched a scathing attack on Hearn, saying the British promoter lacks “vision”.\n\nBenn’s decision to leave Matchroom is particularly shocking given he has spent his entire professional career with Hearn’s company, which even stood by the 29-year-old from 2022 until 2025, during a saga in which he failed two drug tests and could not box on home soil.\n\n“I blame myself, because I just forgot it was boxing, you know?” Hearn told iFL TV late on Friday, admitting he was “pretty devastated”. “I was like... I just felt that the loyalty that we’ve shown would never, ever put us in this position.\n\n“And I just felt that I never really needed to push Conor Benn to sign a new contract previously, and I probably could’ve got him to sign a new contract previously.\n\n“Like I said, I blame myself. I made a mistake, because I misjudged the character. And again, I’m not gonna hang him out to dry, and he will say: ‘Well, it was a big offer.’\n\n“But when I received the email from his lawyer, I texted him and said: ‘I think we should have a call. I think, for everything I’ve done for you, I think I deserve a call. And he said ‘no’, and I was like: ‘Man... f***... I can’t believe it.’\n\n“I just don’t know what to say, other than I just felt that everything that we gave him, the loyalty that we gave him, the support we gave him, would be enough to talk it through – or just get close to a number, but there wasn’t really the interest.\n\n“So, very surprising, very painful, but just another moment in life that you live and learn from [...] You lose a bit of your soul. It’s a little bit numb. There’s a lot I could say.\n\n“He doesn’t think like he’s done anything wrong, but that’s him as a person. Sometimes you can get poisoned.\n\n‼️ Eddie Hearn on Conor Benn signing with Zuffa Boxing: \"I blame myself because I forgot it was boxing and I was like — I just felt that the loyalty that we've shown would never ever put us in this position and I just felt that I never really needed to push Conor Benn to sign a… pic.twitter.com/SAZgZcObRg\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) February 20, 2026\n\n“[Anthony] Joshua, you can’t mention those in the same breath – for many reasons. Joshua is a different breed of class and loyalty,” Hearn added, referencing his highest-profile boxer.\n\nBenn, the son of British boxing great Nigel Benn, released a statement on Friday upon the announcement of his move, and the welterweight said he hoped he could still work with Hearn going forward.\n\n“First and foremost, I want to thank Eddie and the entire team at Matchroom for everything they’ve done for me over the past decade,” said Benn. “From guiding me when I first turned pro, to headlining stadium shows, they were not only with me for those highlight moments but stood shoulder to shoulder with me during the tough times.\n\n“It’s been a journey beyond anything we could have imagined, and for their belief, support and guidance, I will always be truly grateful, but Zuffa Boxing presented me with an opportunity I simply couldn’t refuse.\n\n“I’d love Eddie to continue to be part of my team and for our partnership to evolve in this new chapter.\n\n“I’m filled with excitement and hunger for what’s ahead with Zuffa Boxing. I want the legacy fights, the biggest nights, the biggest stages. I fear no man at any weight, and I’m ready to give the fans the fights they’ve been calling for. I’m in my prime, and together we have bold, ambitious plans.”\n\nZuffa Boxing is being up by White and Saudi government official Turki Alalshikh, the latter of whom has been pivotal to the Gulf nation’s boxing drive in recent years.",

    "description": "The FC Bayern star is having an incredible season.",
    "fullText": "There is something undeniably encouraging about hearing a player speak with clarity, confidence, and humility all at once—and that is exactly the tone Luis Díaz struck when reflecting on his current level. For Bayern Munich supporters, it is the kind of mindset that suggests not just a short burst of form, but a sustained period of influence at the highest level.\n\n“Yes, I think so. I’ve actually been in very good form since I left Colombia. I had a couple of very good seasons in Porto. Things also went very well for me in Liverpool, especially last season. But I think that over time I’ve simply grown a lot more as a footballer and also as a person, that I’ve learned a lot more. It just helps when you’re more mature. And today I feel at 100% – physically and mentally. I think I’m going through a very good time right now, and I’m trying to enjoy that on the one hand… but on the other hand, also to keep doing things right and not be complacent. Because that’s what it’s all about: staying grounded and continuing to help my team. That’s the most important thing,” Díaz told Sky Germany’s Kerry Hau (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nWhat stands out most is not just the confidence, but the balance. Díaz is not declaring himself finished product or superstar above reproach. Instead, he frames his rise as a process—one built through experience in Portugal and England, personal growth, and the discipline to remain grounded even when things are going well.\n\nThat mentality fits perfectly within Bayern Munich’s long-standing culture. The club has always thrived on players who combine elite talent with relentless professionalism. If Díaz truly feels “at 100% – physically and mentally,” then Bayern may be witnessing the beginning of a particularly dangerous phase in his career.\n\nFor fans, that is the most exciting takeaway. Form can fluctuate, but maturity and mindset tend to last. And if Díaz continues pairing confidence with humility, his “very good time” might extend far beyond the present moment.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "High school girls basketball: Dixie grinds past Desert Hills in 4A semifinal foul fest",
    "fullText": "Here’s a recap of the 4A girls basketball state tournament semifinals at Weber State on Friday, with No. 1 Dixie winning the first game to advance to Saturday’s championship. This story will be updated.\n\nFor the first time in 13 years, Dixie’s girls basketball team will play for the state championship after winning an exhausting semifinal nailbiter over Desert Hills 60-55 on Friday afternoon.\n\nDixie coach Kasey Winters remembers the Flyers’ last championship well, as he was there. Granted, he was waiting in the tunnels at Weber State to coach the Bear River boys in the 3A championship immediately after the girls game.\n\nDixie’s girls won that championship over Desert Hills in a thriller, while Winters’ Bears lost.\n\nThe second-year Dixie coach is hoping this time he gets to cut down the nets on Saturday when his team faces the Green Canyon-Pine View winner at 1 p.m.\n\nAdvancing to the championship was an absolute grind against Desert Hills, which plays a relentless full-court game for 32 minutes.\n\n“I think it just wears on you physically and mentally,” Winters said. “We just have to preach like it’s going to be that way the whole game.\n\n“You can’t expect any breaks. You can’t expect to just be able to walk it up the court. You have to be ready for pressure and physicality for 32 straight minutes.”\n\nDixie handled the pressure much better in the second half in a back-and-forth game that featured nine lead changes and six ties.\n\nThe constant pressure resulted in a lot of whistles, with 43 combined fouls and both teams dealing with foul trouble for much of the game.\n\nWinters said the style wasn’t surprising, as it mirrored Dixie’s two region wins over Desert Hills earlier this season.\n\n“Both teams are athletic, they’re physical, we both like to try to cause a little bit of chaos and ultimately it ends up in a lot of fouls for both teams,” said Winters.\n\nDesert Hills dealt with the chaos better early on, jumping out to a 13-7 lead after the first quarter, but Dixie made a push in the second quarter to claim a 23-21 halftime lead despite a dozen first-half turnovers.\n\n“We gave them quite a few possessions just because we weren’t tough with the ball and we weren’t ready for the pressure that we should know is coming,” said Winters.\n\nIt spilled over into the third quarter as well, with Desert Hills opening on a 11-0 spurt to build its largest lead of the game at 32-23 with 5:46 left in the frame.\n\n“Yeah, it wasn’t our best start to the second half, but we knew there was a lot of game left and that’s kind of what we said in the timeout, is just have to stop turning the ball over, get a couple stops,” said Winters.\n\nThe lead changed hands four more times in the fourth as the fouls and free throws mounted for both teams. Crucially, Dixie finished the game 19 of 26 from the free throw line while Desert Hills was 13 of 23.\n\nTrailing 51-49 with under three minutes remaining, Desert Hills’ Ellie Heaton hit a huge 3-pointer to put the Thunder ahead and answer a big 3 from Dixie leading-scorer Izzy Hollinghead — her only 3 of the game.\n\nOrton had a huge response a minute later with her fourth 3-pointer of the game, putting Dixie ahead for good 54-53 with 1:51 left.\n\nShe finished 4 of 8 from behind the arc with 12 points. She was one of four Dixie players who scored in double figures, led by Addison Winters with 15, Hollinghead with 14 and Lydia Shurtliff adding 10.\n\n“I love seeing that four or five people in double figures. It means we’re moving the ball, we’re not forcing shots and we’re just playing good team basketball,” said Winters.\n\nAfter pulling ahead, Dixie forced Desert Hills into three turnovers in the final two minutes and then it successfully sealed the win from the foul line.",

    "description": "Peterson is viewed as the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NBA Draft, but questions about his availability could affect that status.",
    "fullText": "Amid star player Darryn Peterson facing criticism for missing games or leaving them early due to injuries or illness, Kansas men's basketball coach Bill Self says the freshman guard must take initiative to change the national conversation about him.\n\n\"There is a way to change the narrative. Play. Finish,\" Self told reporters on Friday. \"Now, if his body allows him to, fantastic. If it doesn't allow him to, then they'll say something again the next game.\"\n\n\"But that's the way to get people to quit talking,\" he added. \"It's not me saying, 'It's not fair.' I don't think that really keeps anybody from having an opinion on a national level, or on this level, or any level, to be quite candid.\"\n\nPeterson, 19, has played in only 15 of the Jayhawks' 26 games this season. But he has also left three of those games early, most recently Wednesday's 81-69 win over Oklahoma State. Peterson has missed games due to hamstring, quad and ankle injuries and taken himself out because of flu-like symptoms and cramping.\n\nThat limited availability has led to questions about Peterson protecting himself for the 2026 NBA Draft, which could affect his prospects of being the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nSelf says the speculation over why Peterson has missed games or finished them early is misguided, but acknowledges that such conjecture can't be controlled.\n\n\"He hasn't finished games. The reasons why they say he hasn't finished games is 100% false,\" Self said. \"So, at least in 70 to 80% of the reasons why, with what they've said that I've heard. I can't say 100% of everything would be false, but that's the narrative that's being out there.\"\n\nThe Kansas coach asserted the speculation over Peterson's mindset is \"100% false,\" then seemed to say, well, maybe it's not entirely false. But that chatter will only be silenced if Peterson plays and continues to show the talent that makes many evaluators believe he will be the top player available in this summer's NBA Draft.\n\nBill Self on Darryn Peterson:\n\n\"He hasn't finished games... The bottom line is, there is a way to change the narrative: Play. Finish. That's the way to get people to quit talking.\" 👀\n\n(🎥: @KUsports) pic.twitter.com/71bbB7sD7q\n\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) February 20, 2026\n\n[Get more Jayhawks news: Kansas team feed]\n\nIn his 15 games, Peterson has averaged 20 points per game while shooting 43% on 3-pointers. Despite leaving the matchup with Oklahoma State after playing 18 minutes, he still scored 23 points and shot 6-for-10 from long range. Peterson scored a season-high 32 points in a 104-100 overtime win over TCU. That's the kind of production that has NBA teams coveting the opportunity to draft him.\n\nSelf supported Peterson, saying that he's dedicated to basketball in addition to being a gifted scorer.\n\nI don't know that we've had a guy that studies the game, has prepared himself for this moreso than what Darryn Peterson has,\" Self said. \"He loves ball. He can't get enough ball... Nobody's put more time in outside of practice working on their game on an individual than what he has over a lifetime.\"\n\nWith five games remaining in Kansas' regular season, along with the Big 12 conference and NCAA tournaments approaching, Peterson has plenty of opportunity to alter whatever perceptions are being formed about him. Especially if that includes a national championship run. The Jayhawks face Cincinnati (14-12) on Saturday before big matchups versus No. 2 Houston (23-3) and No. 4 Arizona (24-2) next week.",

    "fullText": "The coaching carousel for the 2025-2026 men's college basketball season is starting to heat up.\n\nNumerous programs around the country are virtually eliminated from NCAA Tournament contention, barring a surprise conference championship win. Some athletic directors are already starting to get ahead of the curve and filing away candidates.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Kansas State said it fired Jerome Tang 'for cause.' Will that hold up in court?\n\nKansas State's Jerome Tang was one of the first major dominos to fall, although there's still discourse between Tang and the school regarding his $18.7 million buyout. Kansas State claims it has bounds to fire Tang for cause, which would invalidate the total.\n\nThere are multiple mid-major coaches that are also on the rise and could be next up for Power Four gigs. Names like Saint Louis' Josh Schertz, New Mexico's Eric Olen and Utah State's Jerrod Calhoun have all been wildly successful in 2025-26.\n\nHere's a running list of every head coaching change during the 2025-26 men's college basketball season:\n\nThis story will be updated live.\n\nScott was suspended indefinitely in January while being investigated for treatment of Air Force's cadet-athletes. It was announced Feb. 20, however, that he and the school mutually agreed to part ways.\n\n\"Coach Scott's passion for the game of basketball has long been evident in his competitive and direct coaching style. It was this coaching style that guided Air Force Basketball to some of the program's most memorable achievements during his initial tenure at the Air Force Academy,\" Air Force athletic director Nathan Pine said in the announcement. \"This is a different day, and now is the right time for a new voice and a new approach to drive the culture and success of the men's basketball program, aligned with the Air Force Academy's mission of forging leaders of character developed to lead in our Air Force and Space Force.\n\n\"We thank Coach Scott for his 10 years of service to the Academy and wish him and his family well.\"\n\nAir Force went 97-183 in Scott's second tenure as head coach from 2020 onward. He also led the program from 2000-04, taking the team to an NCAA Tournament berth in 2004. - Austin Curtright\n\nLavin won't return to San Diego for the 2026-27 season but will remain as head coach for the remainder of the current campaign. The former UCLA and St. John's coach has a 46-79 record at San Diego in four seasons, and currently holds an 11-17 mark this season.\n\n\"As my coaching tenure at USD begins to wind down, I would like to pause and express my heartfelt appreciation to President Jim Harris for presenting this life-changing opportunity in 2022,\" Lavin said in the announcement. \"Teaching and coaching at the University of San Diego has been an experience of unparalleled pride and joy. Specifically, I will carry forward the gift of participating in our players' journeys, and will treasure the relationships forged along the way.\" - Austin Curtright\n\nTang led Kansas State to the Elite Eight in his first season at the helm in 2022-23, but it was a downward spiral from there. The Wildcats failed to reach the NCAA Tournament the next two seasons and had a 10-15 record with a 1-11 mark in conference play this season before Tang was fired.\n\n“This was a decision that was made in the best interest of our university and men’s basketball program,\" K-State athletic director Gene Taylor said. “Recent public comments and conduct, in addition to the program’s overall direction, have not aligned with K-State’s standards for supporting student-athletes and representing the university. We wish Coach Tang and his family all the best moving forward.”\n\nKansas State is attempting to fire Tang for cause after he called out his players in a press conference after a blowout loss against Cincinnati. - Austin Curtright\n\nKansas City announced in January that Menzies would finish out the season at Kansas City but wouldn't be returning for the 2026-27 season. The Roos hired former Maryland coach Mark Turgeon shortly after. - Austin Curtright\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Men's college basketball coach firings, changes in 2025-26 season",

    "fullText": "It’s been four months since the Seattle Mariners played a baseball game. Four months can feel like a long time. A lot happened: the holidays came and went, various roster moves were (and weren’t) made, Rick Rizzs announced his impending retirement, the Seahawks won the Super Bowl, nearly the entirety of the Winter Olympics have happened… et cetera. Still, despite how much has happened, just 123 days have passed since the Seattle Mariners last played a baseball game.\n\n“123 days” feels like a lot less time than “4 months”. I’m not sure why — maybe just a quirk of human bias and perception. For most of the last month, I’d identified more with the “4 months” side of things. It seemed like forever since we had baseball. To have gone from each day being punctuated with the joy of the 2025 Mariners, to each having no clear punctuation at all… well, they call it the bleak midwinter for a reason.\n\nToday, though, it felt like baseball never left. From the moment this morning that the Mariners posted the first lineup card of 2026, all the way through the last pitch that non-roster invitee Nick Davila delivered to close out the ninth inning, today was a continuation of the excitement, joy, and momentum of 2025. Peoria Sports Complex looked and sounded like it was at capacity. Nary a patch of grass in the outfield was unoccupied, and every exciting moment on the field was answered by a chorus of jubilant cheers.\n\nIt helped that the Mariners’ starting lineup was mostly comprised of their actual projected Opening Day lineup. The same cannot be said of the pitching, as the team looks to more slowly bring their big-league staff up to speed. Non-roster invitee Dane Dunning took the bump for Seattle. Dunning, who projects to be a (hopefully unneeded) depth piece for the Mariners this year, ended up throwing 1.2 scoreless innings after working around some early traffic. His fastball, which last year averaged a hair above 90 MPH, sat around 89 MPH for most of the day. The presence of full Statcast numbers in Spring Training this year is fun. However, as I scour Dane Dunning’s February 20th velocity and vertical break, searching for meaning, it occurs to me that the availability of these data may not be optimal for my mental health. Verdict: Dunning looked fine.\n\nThe rest of today’s pitching staff for Seattle was comprised mainly of Guys on the Pile. One highlight was newcomer Cooper Criswell, acquired from the Red Sox over the offseason. Criswell, a soft-tossing righty, induced three strikeouts over two innings, including a particularly nasty one of Manny Machado.\n\nAnother familiar face was Troy Taylor, who looks to bounce back from a disappointing 2025. Taylor’s velocity was great: he was already up and over last year’s average speed of 96. Less great was a hung sinker that Romeo Sanabria whacked 416 feet over the center field fence.\n\nRight hander Alex Hoppe, who the Mariners also acquired from the Red Sox this winter, had a doubly disappointing afternoon. A dinger surrendered to Jose Miranda might have been bad enough, but the broadcasting team outed Hoppe as a true sicko: apparently his favorite player growing up was Jack Flaherty? First of all, Flaherty is literally 30 years old and Hoppe is 27, so I truly do not know when he would have idolized Flaherty. Secondly, even if the timeline did make any sense, Hoppe is likely the first person ever to idolize Jack Flaherty.\n\nFortunately, the hitters on Seattle’s side were a lot more interesting than the pitchers. Luke Raley, Julio Rodríguez, Josh Naylor, Leo Rivas, and Dom Canzone each checked in with hits in their first game back (Raley had two). Canzone made a flashy play in right field, laying out for a sinking line drive to rescue Dunning’s first inning. The real story of today, though, was the young guys. Most specifically Michael Arroyo.\n\nArroyo, a 21-year-old second baseman who just today was revealed to be working out at third base and in the outfield, watched the first pitch he was thrown. It was a changeup on the corner, called a ball. The Padres challenged, and it was overturned. Arroyo fouled off a second changeup to go down 0-2. A third changeup went right down the middle, and Arroyo took it the other way. It looked somewhat innocuous off the bat, but the ball carried, and carried, and carried. 406 feet later, Arroyo had recorded Seattle’s first home run of 2026.\n\nStar prospect Colt Emerson immediately hit a ball in nearly the exact same spot, but it died before reaching the fence.\n\nArroyo’s very next at bat saw him hit another ball hard to the same spot. This one dropped short of the fence, but Arroyo was left standing on second base for a double. Not a bad showing for the 67th ranked prospect in all of baseball.\n\nThe final effort from today that I wanted to highlight was from fellow Top 100 Prospect Lazaro Montes. In the box score, Montes’ day didn’t look overly impressive: 1-for-3 with a single and a strikeout. The single, however, was one of the more difficult ones you’re likely to see.\n\nThe at bat in question was against Padres flamethrower Mason Miller, who we all know well from his days with the Athletics. Montes started by working a 2-2 count off Miller — an impressive feat in its own right. Miller responded by dialing up a 101.5 MPH fastball, which he lost control of. The resulting errant pitch nearly decapitated Montes, who had to leap out of the way. With a slight smile on his face, Montes dug back into the box and fouled off another 101.5 MPH fastball. Miller tried to switch it up with a slider, which Montes pulled for a line drive single into right field. Talk about Big League stuff from the 21-year-old.\n\nCountless battles of NRI-on-NRI later, the Mariners were left standing with a 7-4 advantage over the Padres. Sure, the game was meaningless. Though, isn’t every game meaningless in the long run? Everything, even?\n\nWith meaning ultimately left as an exercise for the reader, I hope you enjoyed seeing the sunlight today, even if it was through a laptop or television screen. Fewer than five weeks remain until Opening Day and fewer than three until Daylight Savings. We made it.",

    "description": "Comment: Precocious talent, mental-health concerns, and a failed drug test – what next for Garcia? Possibly a showdown with Britain’s Benn",
    "fullText": "Ryan Garcia and Conor Benn are a match made in hell, in the exact way that makes them heaven for boxing promoters. For now, a match-up between the American and the Briton is in purgatory, but the barriers could come crumbling down on Saturday.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Garcia will challenge Mario Barrios for the WBC welterweight title, to which Benn is the next mandatory challenger.\n\nNever mind the fact that Garcia, 27, is receiving this title shot on the back of a loss, in which he was dropped and outpointed by underdog Rolly Romero. Never mind that he entered the Romero fight after a year-long drug ban. Never mind that Benn’s last two fights were middleweight bouts with Chris Eubank Jr, in which he went 1-1. Never mind that he went through his own drug-test saga beforehand. All roads lead to Garcia vs Benn.\n\nStill, the terrain is often rocky in this sport.\n\nBenn, 29, has long said his greatest desire is to become WBC welterweight champion, yet he has also barked at any American star who will listen, as well as a 47-year-old Manny Pacquiao. Just a few weeks ago, the Briton was face-to-face with new WBO champion Shakur Stevenson, having “messaged” the four-weight king over a possible showdown in the preceding weeks.\n\nYet the general thinking is that the unbeaten Stevenson, 28, would prove too slick for Benn, in a way that the inconsistent Garcia might not. Indeed, in Garcia, Benn might have found the ideal opponent and perfect rivalry to follow the blood feud with Eubank Jr.\n\nHowever, Garcia must first overcome Barrios, and “King Ryan”’s past struggles in and out of the ring mean that is no guarantee. One cannot overlook his loss to Romero in May, his stoppage by Gervonta Davis in 2023, nor past concerns over his mental health – due to, in his own words, his habit of “drinking every day” before his bout with Devin Haney.\n\nIn that contest in 2024, Garcia was electric. He had gone 3-3 with his fellow American during their amateur careers, but the feeling was that, at this level, the unbeaten Haney would prove too clinical and elusive for Garcia. But Garcia dropped the “Dream” three times en route to a points win. Of course, that victory was ruined by the revelation of a failed drug test, with the result overturned and Garcia banned for a year.\n\nNaturally, that adverse test result had fans and pundits questioning the legitimacy of Garcia’s performance against Haney, but King Ryan may not need to match that level to see off Barrios; with respect, the 30-year-old is seen as one of the weaker champions in boxing right now, and he enters Vegas on the back of two straight draws – one of which came against an aged Pacquiao. So, Garcia is the favourite on Saturday, and the question is whether he can live up to that status, after he failed to against Romero.\n\nIf he can, boxing may have a scintillating new rivalry: one between two admittedly-flawed fighters.\n\nFor Benn, Garcia represents a more-beatable opponent than Stevenson, and a more-marketable one than Barrios. In that way, a Garcia victory would be the perfect outcome for Benn this weekend.\n\nThere are other options out there for Benn, such as a clash with Northern Ireland’s Lewis Crocker for the IBF belt. However, the risk-reward ratio of that fight might not tip in the right direction for the “Destroyer”.\n\nIn truth, the profile of Benn’s opponents from here on out feels more important than their status; that is to say: Benn should share the ring with big names, whether or not they carry title belts.\n\nBut again, in Garcia, he might have encountered someone who can bring both. And so Benn will watch from ringside at T-Mobile Arena, it seems.\n\n“I don’t think he has a big presence in America, but I would be willing to go to the UK,” Garcia said of Benn in November. “I would definitely be willing to go to the UK to fight him. He seems like a fun match-up. He’s gonna come crazy and throw bombs all night and thinks he’s gonna overwhelm me, but he won’t.\n\n“But I would love to fight him. I love fighting Eddie Hearn’s fighters, I don’t know why, I just love to beat them up. He just makes you want to beat his fighters up. It’s just the way he talks, the way he moves, I can’t wait to look at his face and say: ‘I did it again.’\n\n“That would bring so much joy to me, almost more than a championship title. I would be ecstatic just to see Eddie's face, sad and confused. I beat Luke Campbell, Devin Haney – he was representing him, I beat him. I’m ready to beat up Conor now.”\n\nIn any case, Garcia must beat up Barrios. Then, fans will hope the road to Garcia vs Benn remains firm under the fighters’ feet. The press conferences would be engrossing, and the fight itself would be captivating. Yes, Garcia and Benn are flawed, but at this precise moment, they could make each other whole.\n\nEditor’s note: Friday brought the shock news that Benn is leaving Hearn’s promotional company, Matchroom, to join rivals Zuffa Boxing. Given Zuffa’s desire to move away from boxing’s traditional belt system, it is conceivable that Benn will soon lose his status as WBC mandatory challenger.",

    "description": "Justices Kavanaugh, Alito, and Thomas argued that Trump's tariffs were lawful and that reversing them could get messy.",
    "fullText": "Three conservative justices of the US Supreme Court — Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito — broke with the majority Friday, arguing that President Donald Trump had clear authority to impose his sweeping tariff policy.\n\nThe three dissenting justices said the president's tariffs were perfectly legal under the 1970-era law Trump used that says presidents can \"regulate\" importation in the case of emergencies.\n\n\"The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful.\"\n\nThe three justices also noted that the majority 6-3 decision is silent on how to return billions of dollars in tariffs that have already been collected.\n\nThat process \"is likely to be a 'mess,'\" as was acknowledged at oral arguments, Kavanaugh wrote in a lengthy dissent that Thomas and Alito joined.\n\nThe two dissents differed with the majority on two fronts: Trump's bypassing of Congress in imposing tariffs, and the legality of the president's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.\n\nIn the dissent written by Kavanaugh, the justices argued that presidents have \"commonly\" imposed tariffs to regulate imports throughout American history.\n\nInterpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs \"creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" Kavanaugh wrote. As with quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a \"traditional and common tool to regulate importation,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not make much sense to think that IEEPA allows the President in a declared national emergency to, for example, shut off all or most imports from China, but not to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nReversing the tariffs may be an exercise in futility, Kavanaugh added. Even without IEPPA, \"numerous other federal statutes authorize the president to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not all) of the tariffs at issue in this case,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nIn a separate dissent, Thomas wrote that \"neither the statutory text\" of IEEPA \"nor the Constitution provide a basis for ruling against the President.\"\n\n\"This Court has consistently upheld Congress's delegation of power over foreign commerce, including the power to impose duties on imports,\" Thomas wrote. \"The Court has long conveyed to Congress that it may 'invest the President with large discretion in matters arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce with other nations.'\"\n\nIn remarks at the White House following the Supreme Court's decision, Trump praised the three dissenting justices while bashing the others.\n\n\"I'd like to thank and congratulate Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country, which is right now, very proud of those justices,\" Trump told reporters. \"When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them — there is no way.\"\n\nTrump called the Supreme Court ruling \"deeply disappointing\" and said he was \"ashamed of certain members of the court.\"",

    "description": "Our family went on an ultra-luxury Seabourn Ovation cruise to the Caribbean. Here's what the cheapest room was like and why it was a good value.",
    "fullText": "We traveled as a group of five: my mother, my brother and sister-in-law, their 7-year-old son, and me.\n\nIn total, we booked two entry-level suites — one for my mother and me, and another for my brother, sister-in-law, and their son — bringing the combined cruise fare to just over $20,000 for five people across 12 nights.\n\nThis figure includes accommodations, all meals, a selection of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, and gratuities. We saved some money on my 7-year-old nephew's fare thanks to the cruise line's third-guest-at-half-price policy.\n\nOur suite measured 302 square feet, plus a 68-square-foot balcony.\n\nIts decor was pretty minimal, but it felt a bit elevated with accents of marble, dark wood, and glass.\n\nDespite being the cheapest option on the ship, this room felt more like it was part of a boutique hotel than just a standard cruise cabin.\n\nThe base-category suite felt thoughtfully laid out, with a seating area, a couch, a table, two beds, and a generously sized walk-in closet. Our clothes and bags easily fit inside with space to spare.\n\nIn the other suite, a sofa bed was set up as a dedicated sleeping space for my nephew.\n\nWe were delighted to find our room's minibar stocked with complimentary ginger beer, juices, and the spirits we requested prior to our sailing.\n\nTwice-daily housekeeping kept everything meticulously refreshed.\n\nSince all of our meals, standard beverages, and gratuities were included in the cost of the cruise fare, we didn't have to budget or crunch numbers during our trip.\n\nWe had most of our dinners in the ship's main dining room, which was so easy. It felt quite formal, and the rotating menus kept things interesting across the 12-night itinerary.\n\nPassengers also had access to The Patio, a poolside eatery with laid-back fare, and The Colonnade, a more casual spot serving buffet breakfasts and lunches, plus seated themed dinners.\n\nOptions for specialty dining included a sushi restaurant and a Mediterranean eatery called Solis, which was a standout for me.\n\nThe menu featured steak, lobster, and whole grilled fish deboned tableside. I particularly loved its post-dinner affogatos\n\nThe ship has a large main pool surrounded by lots of loungers, though we preferred the smaller hot tubs in other areas.\n\nQuieter spots, like the hot tub at the bow with incredible views of the ocean, quickly became our favorites.\n\nLocated on the top sundeck, The Retreat was my favorite area on the ship.\n\nThe space offered shaded cabanas, a noticeably calmer atmosphere than the main pool deck, and attentive, unhurried service.\n\nTo access it, passengers had to pay an additional $150 per day on port days or $250 on sea days.\n\nBooking it on sea days felt especially worthwhile. The quiet setting made it easy to relax or catch up on a bit of remote work on my laptop without feeling out of place.\n\nWe mostly booked excursions through the cruise line for peace of mind.\n\nOur favorite was in Saint Lucia, where a packed day included a catamaran ride, volcano hike, mud bath, and snorkeling.\n\nThe excursion ran late, but the ship waited for us as it had been booked through them.\n\nOn Saint Kitts, the crew arranged a private Christmas Day beach party with grilled lobster and drinks. Later, Santa Claus arrived by Jet Ski to serve caviar and Champagne in the surf.\n\nUltimately, our cruise averaged out to about $333 per person, per night. That felt surprisingly fair considering how much was included in our 12-night trip.\n\nWe also really enjoyed the ship's intimate size. Compared to other mega-ships carrying thousands of people, this 600-passenger vessel felt calm, navigable, and personal. We never felt overwhelmed by crowds, even on sea days.\n\nAlthough children aren't typically the target audience for ultra-luxury cruises, my nephew genuinely had a great time alongside the mostly older guests. His sailing also felt like a great value, considering he was charged half price as a third guest and still had his own proper bed.\n\nFor a multigenerational holiday trip that combined ease, variety, and consistent service, the value ultimately justified the price.\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed the trip enough to book another Seabourn voyage (at a discounted price) before disembarking.",

    "title": "Peacock's next growth bet: selling subscriptions for other streamers",
    "description": "Peacock has approached specialty streamers about selling subscriptions to complement its reality TV and sports-heavy programming.",
    "fullText": "Peacock's next growth bet isn't a blockbuster show or sports deal.\n\nNBCU's flagship streaming service is plotting to sell add-on subscriptions to other specialty streamers on its platform, four people familiar with the plans told Business Insider.\n\nPeacock has approached streamers about selling subscriptions to offer viewers content that complements its reality and sports-heavy line-up, these people said. Peacock expects to start with one streamer this year and is likely to limit the offering to a small number of partners.\n\nStarz, which already has multiple distribution partnerships, is one that's being considered, two insiders said. Starz declined to comment.\n\nTwo people briefed on Peacock's pitch saw it as a way for smaller streamers to reach new subscribers in a relatively uncluttered environment, and they hoped Peacock would eventually offer features such as the ability for streamers to offer free samples of their shows.\n\nThey described Peacock's terms as favorable compared to Amazon, which has a large business selling subscriptions to programmers big and small, from HBO Max to Crunchyroll. Amazon's channel terms vary by partner, but two partners told Business Insider in 2025 that Amazon's subscription revenue cut was over 50% in their deals.\n\nPeacock's plans come at a time when streaming services — especially outside market leaders Netflix and Disney — face pressure to consolidate as they look to continue growing their subscriber bases while remaining profitable. Overall, paid streaming growth in the US has cooled, while cancellation rates have risen in the wake of price hikes.\n\nTV viewership growth for streamers in the US is largely stagnant, and subscribers are navigating an increasingly complex landscape. Streaming services are trying tactics like discounts and bundling to keep people from leaving their platforms.\n\nSome other streaming platforms have adopted a marketplace approach that's broader than what Peacock is contemplating. Amazon is by far the leader. Last year, Amazon reported that its \"Channels\" program accounted for about 25% of US streamer sign-ups, citing Antenna data. Roku, YouTube, and device makers like Samsung and LG also let people \n\nPeacock, for its part, already sells add-on subscriptions to NBC Sports Regional Sports Networks, which it shares a corporate parent with. It also sells a bundle with Apple TV+ that involves cross-platform sampling and a discounted price.\n\nPeacock, with less than 2% of TV watch time in the US, has struggled to grow its share of the TV pie, according to Nielsen. That makes it the second-smallest of the subscription streamers Nielsen measures, ahead only of Warner Bros. Discovery (1.4%), which includes Discovery+ and HBO Max.\n\nUS-only Peacock also has relatively few subscribers, with about 44 million. Its nearest rival, Paramount+, has around 79 million global subscribers, and both are well behind Netflix, which is No. 1 with more than 325 million subscribers.\n\nStill, Peacock has far more subscribers than many specialty streamers. AMC Networks, for example, reported about 10 million subscribers across its portfolio of streamers, including AMC+, Acorn TV, and Shudder, as of the end of 2025.\n\n\"Peacock has been struggling,\" said Alan Wolk, a media industry analyst. \"There haven't been a whole lot of reasons to watch it, so giving people another reason to subscribe is a smart idea. If you ask consumers what's your biggest frustration with streamers, it's always, 'I can't find anything.' So the more you can put things together under one interface, the happier people will be.\"\n\nA global survey by Nielsen in November found more than 46% say it's harder to find the content they want to watch because there are too many streamers, rising to 51% in the US, with people spending 14 minutes searching for what to watch and 49% likely to cancel because they can't find something.\n\nThe survey also showed 66% of people expressed interest in a guide to present content information across all services.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "description": "I traveled the world as a digital nomad in places like Mexico City and Paris after a breakup. The experience taught me about my own resilience.",
    "fullText": "Three and a half years ago, I stood in my New Jersey apartment, surrounded by boxes I was about to put into storage. Tears streamed down my cheeks.\n\nI'd recently ended a two-year, live-in relationship. We loved each other deeply, but just weren't the right fit — and although the split was a gut-wrenching decision, we both knew it was the right move.\n\nI had just accepted a fully remote job, which allowed me to explore moving out of the New York City area — something I had been considering for about a year.\n\nI planned to just travel for a few months before settling down somewhere, but I ended up spending the next three years as a nomad.\n\nAlthough it wasn't quite what I'd pictured when I said goodbye to the apartment I shared with my ex, it turned into one of the most important chapters of my life.\n\nMy post-breakup plan was to put all of my belongings into a storage unit and spend a few months in Tulum.\n\nAfter that, I would travel to Miami and Los Angeles, \"interviewing\" both cities as candidates for a longer-term move. I was about seven months into this plan when I learned my role was going to be eliminated.\n\nLuckily, I was able to secure freelance work, so I decided to continue my travels since I wasn't needed in one particular place for my job.\n\nFrom Tulum, I headed to Mexico City. After just a few days, I fell in love with the food, vibrancy, people, and culture. My one-week vacation turned into an almost three-month stay.\n\nDuring my time in Mexico City, I explored art galleries and museums, learned some Spanish, made friends, went on dates, visited small shops, and tipped local people well.\n\nThese little moments helped me learn how adaptable I truly was. I realized I could make friends anywhere, stay disciplined with my work even while exploring a new place, safely navigate dating as a solo traveler, and be extremely resourceful.\n\nI kept exploring. I took the nomad life slowly, spending about four or five months abroad at a time in places like Paris, Lisbon, Málaga, London, Melbourne, Miami, and Tulum.\n\nBetween travels, I'd spend a few months recharging in a sublease (or a friend's apartment) in New York City.\n\nWhen traveling solo, every choice you make is yours, from where you eat to how you spend your days. I felt immensely grateful for this freedom — every day, it struck me how lucky I was to have every minuscule decision be solely my own.\n\nThat's not to say I felt lonely, though. With each new city and country I stayed in, I was delighted by the magic of connecting with strangers.\n\nOne time, I struck up a conversation with another woman at a particularly intense yoga class in Tulum. She was visiting from Canada, and we ended up spending a whole day together.\n\nI had another memorable experience in Europe. I had been traveling by myself for about three years at that point, and although it was incredible, I was exhausted. I felt ready to return to New York City, but I wasn't sure I could afford to do so.\n\nThen, one afternoon, my spirits were lifted when I found myself in a café in Paris, enjoying a chocolate-chip cookie and a latte. An older woman started chatting with me, and soon, another young woman traveling solo from Korea joined in.\n\nWe all shared stories and giggled as we sipped our coffees. As the older woman left the café, she said, \"You two girls exchange numbers now, and spend time together.\"\n\nWe laughed at the gentle demand, but wound up spending that evening — and the next day, too — exploring the city as a pair. I may or may not ever see her again, but she told me that if I ever visit Seoul, I'll be welcomed with open arms.\n\nI learned that not every place has to be a permanent home, and not every relationship has to last forever; in fact, some friendships might just last for the span of a trip.\n\nThe memories I made during this time will stick with me, though I've since emptied out my storage unit and settled into a one-year lease in New York City.\n\nMy nomadic chapter is closed for now, but my encounters with strangers, small moments in new cities, and solo time with myself left me changed for the better — and will surely inspire my next adventure.",

    "fullText": "NATO is deploying a Turkish drone carrier to the Baltic Sea to boost its surveillance and defense in response to \"repeated\" Russian airspace violations, the alliance announced on Friday.\n\nThe TCG Anadolu will support Eastern Sentry, a defensive operation the alliance launched in September after Russian drones crossed into Polish airspace, forcing a military response.\n\nThe Turkish drone carrier is deploying toward the coast of Latvia, where it will contribute to air surveillance and defense along NATO's eastern edge. Allies have been surging fighter jets and warships to the Baltic region in response to Russian drone incursions.\n\nAllied Joint Force Command Brunssum, one of three operational-level NATO headquarters, said in a statement on Friday that the deployment of the Anadolu follows \"repeated airspace violations\" that have been attributed to Russia.\n\nJFC Brunssum called the deployment \"a clear signal to the east\" and said that it \"sends an unmistakable message\" that NATO is prepared to defend its territory.\n\nIt's unclear when the carrier will arrive on station and how long it will remain there. The Turkish defense ministry could not immediately be reached for comment, and neither JFC Brunssum nor NATO's Allied Air Command responded to a request for additional information.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind TCG Anadolu is the Turkish Navy's only drone-carrying amphibious assault ship. It was commissioned in 2023 and is now Ankara's most advanced vessel and flagship.\n\nThe 750-foot-long vessel was originally intended to carry helicopters and F-35B fighter jets, but after Turkey was kicked out of the F-35 program over its purchase of Russian surface-to-air missile systems, Ankara decided to repurpose the Anadolu for fixed-wing drones.\n\nThe Anadolu can carry Bayraktar TB-3 and Bayraktar Kızılelma combat drones, systems made by the Turkish company Baykar, as well as attack helicopters.\n\nJFC Brunssum said the carrier is the largest ship in NATO's Steadfast Dart fleet, which is comprised of 17 vessels, including amphibious landing ships, frigates, destroyers, and submarines.\n\nIran and China have also built their own drone carriers, and Portugal expects to receive one later this year.",

    "title": "The battle over Trump tariff refunds is next — and it will be messy",
    "description": "The process for IEEPA tariff refunds will likely go through the Court of International Trade. Already, over 1,000 lawsuits are pending.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday overturned the centerpiece of President Donald Trump's tariff plans, ruling the federal government illegally collected over $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nNow comes the battle over refunds for tariffs paid, which Trump on Friday predicted could take years.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said at a White House press conference, while blasting the ruling as \"terrible\" and \"defective.\"\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury went a step further, saying about refunds: \"I've got a feeling the American people won't see it.\"\n\nOne reason: Over 1,000 companies have filed lawsuits to claw back money from the government if the Supreme Court overturned Trump's tariffs justified by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh also predicted the process could become a \"mess,\" citing refund requests tallying \"billions of dollars to importers,\" even as some importers have already passed those costs to consumers.\n\nHere are all your questions about tariff refunds, answered by experts.\n\nTypically, the refund process would be handled by Customs and Border Protection, which collected the tariffs in the first place.\n\nIn order for that to happen, the Trump administration would need to establish a process for handling refund requests. The White House, which didn't return Business Insider's request for comment, has yet to signal plans to do this, said Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nWithout a formal process in place, claims will be litigated in the Court of International Trade, which will order CPB to issue refunds to specific companies, Brewster said.\n\nIn the past, the Court of International Trade has ordered refunds when it has found particular taxes to be invalid — albeit on a smaller scale, according to Daniel Mach, a commercial litigator at Bryan Cave.\n\nIt'll likely turn to the process that followed a 1998 Supreme Court decision to overturn a harbor maintenance tax, which also resulted in refunds, Mach said.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" Mach said. \"Everyone's going to be kind of figuring out the ropes as they go. But at the end of the day, it's not an unsolvable problem.\"\n\nGiven the number of claims, the Court of International Trade is likely to appoint an administrator or special master to consider each of them, rather than handling the lawsuits piecemeal, Mach said.\n\nGroups that advocated for the Supreme Court to overturn the IEEPA tariffs have urged the Court of International Trade to develop a smooth process for refunds.\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" said David French, an executive at the National Retail Federation, in a statement.\n\nThe whole refund process — whether through CPB or through a class-action or administrative processes in court — could take up to two years, according to Brewster.\n\nYes! The cases that went to the Supreme Court were groups of small companies, including a wine importer and an educational toy retailer. But several massive corporations, including Toyota and Costco, have also filed refund lawsuits.\n\nYou can try to get a refund for personal orders hit by tariffs, but it'll be complicated.\n\nIn asking CPB or a court for a refund, you'll have to distinguish tariffs you paid pursuant to IEEPA, which were overturned, and the tariffs justified by other laws, which remain on the books.\n\nIndividual lawsuits for IEEPA tariffs on individual retailer orders, like from Temu and Shein, likely won't be worthwhile. The legal fees would likely exceed any potential refund. But it's possible that some enterprising litigators would put together a class-action lawsuit to make it worthwhile, Brewster predicted.\n\n\"It was an illegally imposed tax,\" she said. \"So in theory, everyone is entitled to a refund.\"\n\nWith reporting by Brent Griffins",

The AI infrastructure stock has battled high volatility lately, though it's up about 19% year to date.\n\nWhy: CoreWeave's decline on Friday comes after a report from Business Insider that said Blue Owl Capital was unable to arrange debt financing for a data center it's co-developing that is expected to be occupied by CoreWeave.\n\nBusiness Insider's Dan Geiger reports that a debt arranger for major data center deals said that the project, located in Pennsylvania, failed to attract interest because lenders are reluctant to add exposure to AI firms with below-investment-grade credit. CoreWeave debt is rated B+ by S&P Global Ratings, several notches below investment grade.\n\nWhat it means: Despite being backed by Nvidia, CoreWeave has faced skepticism from finance pros who have wondered about the sustainability of the business model of renting out compute to AI customers.\n\nThe company's high debt-to-equity ratio and its AI-dependent business model have been red flags for some investors, particularly as AI enthusiasm has waned somewhat in the last six months.\n\nIn October, CoreWeave's attempted merger with Core Scientific fell through after Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital and Core Scientific's third-largest shareholder, announced he would vote against it.\n\nFamed short-seller Jim Chanos has also raised concerns about CoreWeave, highlighting problems he sees with its financials and profitability, and warning investors against owning data center stocks.\n\nBlue Owl, meanwhile, was already in the spotlight this week for reportedly halting redepmtions on one of its private credit funds offered to retail investors.",

    "fullText": "Wall Street is weighing the impact of the US Supreme Court ruling against Trump's tariffs, with investors on the hunt for stocks that stand to gain the most from the reversal of the landmark trade policy.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that Trump can't use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify tariffs. Following the announcement, Jefferies analysts highlighted five stocks that they say have the \"largest upside benefit\" on the court's decision.\n\n\"The removal of IEEPA tariffs introduces a meaningful margin tailwind across our consumer discretionary coverage,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"While the ruling eliminates the legal authority for these tariffs, questions remain around remedies—most notably whether companies will be entitled to refunds for duties already paid,\" they added.\n\nHere are five stocks that Jefferies sees as best-positioned to gain after the SCOTUS tariff decision.\n\nJefferies analysts said Signet Jewelers is a primary beneficiary of the tariff decision.\n\nThe company sources roughly half of its inventory from India since the country is a global hub for both natural and lab-grown diamonds.\n\nWith the SCOTUS ruling, Signet Jewelers' weighted‑average tariff exposure falls to 0% from 15.1%, creating an opportunity for margin expansion and earnings growth, Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nPrior to the SCOTUS ruling, Yeti had a nearly 15% exposure to tariff-related sources, concentrated in its US revenue.\n\nThe company told investors there was a $0.35 earning per share impact from the IEEPA tariffs, meaning that the decision will eliminate tariff pressures going forward.\n\nSharkninja proactively mitigated tariff impact by diversifying its supply chain, supply concessions, strategic pricing, and promotions.\n\nEven with these efforts, the company still saw tariff-related margin headwinds.\n\nSCOTUS's decision will turn this pressure into a benefit for the company, as the already successful operational shifts, along with the removal of the tariffs, will further boost earnings.\n\nNike embedded a 7.7% tariff exposure into its fiscal 2026 guidance. This would have amounted to a $1.5 billion cost for the athletic wear company.\n\n\"The elimination of IEEPA tariffs now flips this dynamic into a margin tailwind, supporting incremental gross margin expansion through FY26,\" Jefferies wrote.\n\nBirkenstock worked a nearly 7% weighted‑average tariff impact into their guidance.\n\nThe SCOTUS news turns the margin headwind into a tailwind to fuel outperformance compared to the company's outlook, Jefferies said.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court blocked Trump's IEEPA tariffs, but he has other ways to impose sweeping duties — some of which are already being dusted off.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday knocked down President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs, ruling that the president overstepped his authority by relying on a law normally reserved for emergencies.\n\nThe high court ruling, however, only curbed the president's most flexible tool for reshaping global trade. Taxing imports is central to Trump's economic policy, and the president indicated on Friday that the White House has plenty of other options for imposing taxes on imported goods — some of which they are already dusting off.\n\n\"We have very powerful alternatives,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday as he bashed the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nHere's a rundown of options the Trump administration could turn to next, starting with a new 10% global tariff that the White House announced on Friday.\n\nTrump can use other laws to impose duties on goods from other countries, including Sections 122 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act.\n\nOn Friday, Trump mentioned all of these laws as viable alternatives to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the Supreme Court ruled was not intended for tariffs.\n\n\"Effective immediately, all national security tariffs under Section 232, and existing Section 301 tariffs — they're existing, they're there — remain in place, fully in place, and in full force and effect,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added, \"Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged.\"\n\nTrump also said his administration was \"initiating several Section 301, and other investigations, to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies.\"\n\nSection 301 allows the United States to place tariffs on goods from particular countries if they \"either violated international trade law or otherwise acted unfairly,\" according to Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nIt's a \"broad standard\" that can work to Trump's benefit, Brewster said. And because the law includes provisions that allow the president to form trade deals with other countries to resolve the unfair trade practices, the deals Trump already struck after imposing IEEPA tariffs could likely be \"folded into\" Section 301, Brewster said.\n\nSection 232, on the other hand, allows the president to impose tariffs on particular goods they deem a national security threat, across all countries. Trump has already used the law broadly — he's applied it to everything from aluminum to bathroom vanities.\n\nSection 122 is a blunt instrument, allowing a blanket tariff of up to 15% on all imports from all countries for up to 150 days. The law is meant to address a \"balance of payments\" imbalance, and it's possible Trump could use it as a stopgap measure, according to Brewster.\n\nBefore Trump, no president tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs. The 1970s-era national security law says that, in case of emergencies, presidents can \"regulate\" importation.\n\nIt's the law he used to justify his April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs of at least 10% on every country in the world, a 125% tariff on imports from China, and a tariff on any country that imported oil from Venezuela.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling released on Friday, the highest court in the land said that Trump overstepped his authority by using the IEEPA to impose taxes on imported goods.\n\n\"IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the ruling said.\n\nOne benefit of using Section 301 and Section 232 is that they have already proven legally durable.\n\nTrump used Section 301 in his trade war against China during his first term. Joe Biden, during his presidency, renewed the tariffs and expanded them by imposing additional duties on electric vehicles and solar panel components.\n\nImporters have challenged the tariffs brought under Section 301 and Section 232. So far, they haven't been successful, according to Kathleen Claussen, an international trade arbitrator and professor at Georgetown Law. Courts have ruled in favor of the government on all sorts of legal questions, from whether Trump had the power to bring the tariffs at all, to whether he followed the right process to add or modify particular products that were subject to tariffs.\n\n\"Big picture questions down to small, detailed nuances — those were all tested back in Trump One,\" Claussen told Business Insider.\n\nThe downside of both Section 301 and Section 232 is that each requires investigations from federal agencies to establish the tariffs, which can take months.\n\nA typical Section 301 United States Trade Representative investigation — to determine whether another country truly acted unfairly, and how high the duties should be in response — usually takes six months, Brewster said.\n\nBut the Trump administration can move quickly if it wants to, Claussen said. It can skip procedural steps, like convening a private sector committee or holding hearings.\n\n\"I do think people who think we're talking about, 'Oh, this is going to take a couple of months for them to stand up 301 — I don't think it will take that long,\" Claussen said.\n\nTrump could also dust off Section 338, a law passed during the Great Depression that has never been used to impose tariffs. The law allows duties of up to 50% for goods from specific countries that \"discriminate\" against US exports.\n\nThe law's language is broad and \"squishy,\" Claussen said, and it could be vulnerable to legal challenges. But it's possible the Trump administration would use it anyway.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind that the government is preparing all possible tools and options for the president,\" Claussen said. \"That's what you would imagine that they should be doing. So I would think that they are considering 338, I would think that they're considering 122 and just sort of teeing anything up so the president can choose what he thinks most appropriate.\"",

    "fullText": "Another employee at Thinking Machines Lab is leaving to rejoin OpenAI.\n\nIt's the latest in a string of departures from the $12 billion AI startup, which is led by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati and lately has been the subject of high-profile poaching campaigns from bigger tech companies.\n\nThe latest employee to go back to OpenAI is Jolene Parish, who joined Thinking Machines Lab in April last year, according to her LinkedIn profile. She had worked at OpenAI for three years prior. Before that, she worked for 10 years on security at Apple, her profile says.\n\nOther employees rejoined OpenAI last month. Two co-founders, former CTO Barret Zoph and Luke Metz, both left, along with researcher Sam Schoenholz.\n\nLia Guy, another researcher, also rejoined OpenAI, The Information reported. Another cofounder, Andrew Tulloch, left for Meta late last year, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nOpenAI and Thinking Machines Lab declined to comment.\n\nThinking Machines Lab raised a monster $2 billion funding round last year, valuing the company at $12 billion, spokespeople said at the time. The startup launched its first product, Tinker, last October.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company has become known for attracting star-studded talent. It quietly hired Neal Wu, a legendary coder who won three gold medals in an Olympiad for programming, and Soumith Chintala, the creator of the open-source AI project PyTorch at Meta, who is now Thinking Machines Lab's CTO, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Microsoft named Asha Sharma, an executive in its CoreAI group, as Phil Spencer's replacement as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is retiring, according to an email to employees. Microsoft executive Asha Sharma will become the new executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft Gaming, reporting directly to Nadella.\n\n\"Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in the email.\n\n\"He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms,\" Nadella wrote.\n\nSpencer's departure marks the end of an era for Xbox. Under Spencer, Microsoft transformed gaming into a subscription- and services-driven business and completed the largest acquisition in its history, paying $69 billion for Activision Blizzard.\n\nSharma joined Microsoft in 2024 and has worked in the CoreAI group under Jay Parikh. She was previously a chief operating Officer at Instacart and a vice president of product and engineering at Meta before that.\n\nXbox's president and chief operations officer, Sarah Bond, is leaving the company, while longtime Microsoft gaming executive Matt Booty will become executive vice president and chief content officer, reporting to Sharma.\n\nGaming has been part of Microsoft from the start. Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the '90s to the accelerated‑compute era we're in today.\n\nAs we celebrate Xbox's 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.\n\nI am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I'm excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.\n\nMatt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt's career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including Halo, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Candy Crush, and Fallout.\n\nTogether, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I've long admired Phil's unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nWe have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I'm excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.\n\nWhen I walked through Microsoft's doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I'd help build, the players and customers we'd serve, or the extraordinary teams I'd be lucky enough to join. It's been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.\n\nLast fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.\n\nToday marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right. I'll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.\n\nI'm also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.\n\nAs part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I'm grateful for her partnership and the impact she's had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.\n\nMost of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say \"thank you\". I've learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.\n\nI'm incredibly proud of what we've built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I'll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox's proudest fan and player.\n\nToday I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.\n\nI feel two things at once: humility and urgency.\n\nHumility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.\n\nI am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.\n\nThank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.\n\nMy first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.\n\nThat starts with three commitments.\n\nEverything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.\n\nI promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.\n\nWe will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.\n\nWe will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.\n\nGaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.\n\nWe are witnessing the reinvention of play.\n\nTo meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.\n\nAs monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.\n\nThe next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.\n\nThank you for welcoming me into this journey.\n\nI read Phil's note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I've learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I'm also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.\n\nLooking forward, I'm excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.\n\nWe have good reasons to believe in what's ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.\n\nMy focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.\n\nThanks for everything you do for players and for each other.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A 6-3 majority struck down one of President Donald Trump's favored methods to impose tariffs.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court after justices dealt a sweeping rebuke of his trade policy.\n\nIn some of his harshest criticisms ever of the nation's highest court, Trump said some justices should be \"absolutely ashamed\" for siding against him. Without evidence, Trump accused justices of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He added that the majority opinion was \"almost like not written by smart people.\"\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" he said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump said that it was fair to question the loyalty of \"our people,\" a likely reference to his two appointees, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who sided against the administration's view.\n\nTrump said that due to the \"deeply disappointing\" decision, \"alternatives\" will be used to preserve his trade agenda. Later, he said he would use a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of any existing tariffs.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law in question in the court's ruling.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to the 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nLeft unclear is what the administration will do in the long term.\n\nSection 122 tariffs, which Trump said he would use for a global tariff, can only be imposed for 150 days. After that, Congress must vote to extend. It's unclear if such a vote could pass just months before the midterm elections.\n\nAsked if the government will now have to issue refunds, Trump again criticized the court for not addressing the issue.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump did not have the power under a 1970s law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs as he did in April 2025 during \"Liberation Day.\" The ruling does not invalidate all of Trump's tariffs, as other tariffs were imposed under different authorities. It does mean that Trump is significantly more limited in imposing broad, general tariffs against countries, one of his preferred methods in trade negotiations.\n\n\"The President must 'point to clear congressional authorization' to justify his extraordinary assertion to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"He cannot.\"\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly proclaimed himself to be \"Tariff Man,\" has also repeatedly suggested that he would use revenue from tariffs to pay for a range of things, from refund checks to paying down the national debt to helping fund childcare.\n\nIn total, Treasury Department data showed that the US has collected more than $133 billion in tariffs as of December.\n\nThe White House and top Trump administration officials have repeatedly suggested that if the court struck down most of Trump's tariffs that it would be a mess to sort out any potential refund process.\n\n\"It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently told Reuters. \"Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?\"\n\nRoberts' opinion did not explicitly address a potential refund process, a point that Justice Brett Kavanaugh seized on in his 63-page dissent.\n\n\"The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.\"\n\nIn addition to criticizing the justices in the majority, Trump offered effusive praise for Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissenting opinion.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Trump said, suggesting Kavanaugh's stock has \"gone way up.\"\n\nThis is unlikely to be Trump's last word on the soon-to-be historic ruling. On Tuesday, he is set to deliver his annual State of the Union address.\n\nHistorically, the justices occupy front-row seats on the House floor.",

    "description": "Govs. Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker demand Trump pay Americans $1,700 in tariff refunds after the Supreme Court ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump previously promised Americans tariff dividend checks, but if Democrats have their way, he could be issuing refunds instead.\n\nAfter a Supreme Court ruling on Friday struck down Trump's tariffs levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Democratic lawmakers were quick to demand that the president repay Americans through tariff refunds.\n\n\"Donald Trump should return that money immediately. He has an obligation,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday. \"$1,751 per family that were taxed by Donald Trump. He took hundreds of billions of dollars from working folks, from the ag community, from small businesses for this vanity play, this illegal action, and he finally was held to account. The rule of law won out.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker sent a letter to Trump calling for refunds to families in his state.\n\n\"Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enrage our allies, and sent grocery store prices through the roof,\" Pritzker said in the letter. \"On behalf of the people of Illinois, I demand a refund of $1,700 for every family in Illinois.\"\n\nThe governor also sent an invoice billing that amount for more than 5.1 million Illinois families, totaling more than $8.6 billion. The invoice said it was \"PAST DUE - DELINQUENT.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai responded in part by saying if Pritzker \"really cared about delivering economic relief for Illinois, he'd start with his own state government instead of chasing another stupid headline.\"\n\nThe offices of Newsom and Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth Newsom and Pritzker are considered potential candidates for the presidential election in 2028, and they've both been highly critical of Trump.\n\nThe governors appeared to be basing their requests for refunds of that amount on a report released this month by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. The report found American families paid an average of $1,745 in tariff costs between February 2025 and January 2026, for a total of over $231 billion paid by consumers.\n\nOther studies, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale, have found that tariff costs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that tariffs issued under the IEEPA, a national security act, had exceeded the president's authority. Trump denounced the decision and said he would pursue additional tariffs through other avenues.\n\nIn November, Trump touted the money being collected from tariffs and floated the idea of sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to middle and low-income Americans, though issuing such checks would likely have required an act of Congress. In January, Trump gave mixed messages about his plans for tariff rebate checks.\n\nNow, with the IEEPA tariffs struck down, it's likely some American businesses will try to receive refunds for the tariff costs they paid.\n\nDespite Democrats' stance on the issue, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or how refunds would happen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling did not touch on issuing tariff refunds.\n\nWhen Trump was asked Friday if the government would now have to issue refunds, he said, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would receive tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said, adding, \"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years.\"",

The president has other avenues to impose tariffs, including through Section 232.\n\nWhile he criticized the justices who sided against him, Trump lavished praise on the three who dissented, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"I would like to thank Justice Kavanaugh for, frankly, his genius and his great ability,\" Trump said.\n\nWedbush's Dan Ives said the ruling could be a \"net positive\" for tech companies if refunds are issued.\n\n\"With ~$133.5 billion in tariff revenue up for grabs if the US tariff ruling leads to refunds for organizations, we believe this would act as a net positive for tech with financial relief for many companies while creating greater supply chain visibility especially coming from the Asia supply chain,\" Ives wrote in a note. \"This will be a very noisy situation but for the tech space and AI trade it's a net positive out of the gates in our view.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts' ruling did not explicitly address what companies that paid the now-invalidated tariffs may be entitled to.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent lamented the ruling, adding that it was \"unlikely\" Americans will ever see tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas.\n\nLike Trump, Bessent noted the administration has other alternatives to impose tariffs. He also echoed the president's point that it may take years to sort out any potential refunds.\n\n\"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years,\" Bessent said about the coming court fights.\n\nJefferies analysts said five consumer stocks are poised to get a big boost on the heels of the ruling.\n\nThe firm's analysts said Signet Jewelers, Yeti, Sharkninja, Nike, and Birkenstock are all set to gain do to \"a meaningful margin tailwind.\"\n\nRaymond James Washington Policy Analyst Ed Mills said he expects any sort of refund process to be \"lengthy and challenging.\"\n\n\"We expect that the process for firms to receive tariff refunds will be lengthy and challenging, with litigants needing to bring individual cases or participate in class action (vs. automatic refunds),\" Mills wrote in a note.\n\nMills added that Costco and other firms have sued to ensure their claims are not invalidated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's deadline for disputing tariff bills. Costco's case remains ongoing.\n\nFormer Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti said \"rational businesses\" should understand that tariffs aren't going away.\n\n\"The point is that any rational US business is going to anticipate the possibility of new tariffs, which is going to: (a) deter them from passing along any short-term cost savings to consumers; and (b) continue to fuel the uncertainty that is putting a damper on certain forms of business investment in the US,\" Ramamurti wrote in a post on Substack.\n\nThe short-term economic impact is unclear, Ramamurti wrote, because the court's opinion did not address major issues like potential refunds.\n\nOn the topic of refunds, Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said it should actually be quite easy for the Trump administration to issue refunds.\n\n\"The IEEPA tariffs have brought in around $160 billion in tariff payments. For context, the IRS refunds taxpayers more than $300 billion in income tax overpayments each year,\" York wrote on X. \"Refunding tariff payments to the importer of record should follow a similar, straightforward process.\"\n\nInvestor Jason Calacanis said the court's ruling shows why Trump needs to work with Congress to impose tariffs.\n\n\"MAGA and AFAO loyalists will lose their minds when President @AOC and VP @ZohranKMamdani start using 'emergency powers' to shape their socialist agenda,\" Calacanis wrote on X. \"This is why the Founding Fathers limited executive power and balanced the branches of government.\"\n\nWhile often supportive of Trump, Calacanis and others in the business and tech space have expressed skepticism of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision.\n\n\"Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,\" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Retail Federation called on a lower court \"to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs.\"\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" David French, executive vice president of government relations, said in a statement.\n\nCanadian Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the decision \"strengthens\" his country's view that Trump's emergency tariffs were \"unjustified.\"\n\n\"Although Canada has concluded the best trade agreement with the United States among all its trading partners, we recognize that there is still much to be done to support Canadian businesses and workers who continue to be affected by the tariffs imposed under Section 232 on the steel, aluminum, and automotive sectors,\" LeBlance wrote in a post on X.\n\nNotably, Section 232 tariffs are not included in Friday's ruling, underscoring that Trump still has additional tools at his disposal for his trade policy.\n\nVice President JD Vance called the decision \"lawlessness from the Court.\"\n\n\"Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to 'regulate imports,' didn't actually mean it,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple. And its only effect will be to make it harder for the president to protect American industries and supply chain resiliency.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans would find a way forward after the setback.\n\n\"No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades,\" Johnson said in a statement posted on X. \"Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a victory lap after the ruling.\n\n\"Donald Trump's failed economic policies and global trade war waged with irresponsible, on-again, off-again tariffs on our allies and trading partners have generated massive uncertainty, threatened the economic well-being of the American people and damaged our country's standing around the world,\" Jeffries said in a statement.\n\nThe Top House Democrat said his party will \"push back aggressively in Congress\" on Trump's tariffs.\n\nDespite being in the minority, all but one House Democrat recently joined with six Republicans to approve a largely symbolic rebuke of Trump's emergency tariffs on Canada. It was unclear if the resolution would have passed in the Senate. Trump was widely expected to veto it if it arrived on his desk.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Trump lacked the power to impose such tariffs on Canada.\n\nCorrection: February 20, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Hakeem Jeffries' name.",

    "title": "Here's Why You Should Never Use AI to Generate Your Passwords",
    "description": "ChatGPT isn't good at generating secure passwords.",
    "fullText": "I'm a bit of a broken record when it comes to personal security on the internet: Make strong passwords for each account; never reuse any passwords; and With these three steps combined, your general security is pretty much set. But how you make those passwords matters just as much as making each strong and unique. As such, please don't use an AI program to generate your passwords.\n\nIf you're a fan of chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, it might seem like a no-brainer to ask the AI to generate passwords for you. You might like how they handle other tasks for you, so it might make sense that something seemingly so high-tech yet accessible could produce secure passwords for your accounts. But LLMs (large language models) are not necessarily good at everything, and creating good passwords just so happens to be among those faults.\n\nAs highlighted by Malwarebytes Labs, researchers recently investigated AI-generated passwords, and evaluated their security. In short? The findings aren't good. Researchers tested password generation across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, and discovered that the passwords were \"highly predictable\" and \"not truly random.\" Claude, in particular, didn't fare well: Out of 50 prompts, the bot was only able to generate 23 unique passwords. Claude gave the same password as an answer 10 times. The Register reports that researchers found similar flaws with AI systems like GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, and even Nano Banana Pro. (Gemini 3 Pro even warned the passwords shouldn't be used for \"sensitive accounts.\")\n\nThe thing is, these results seem good on the surface. They look uncrackable because they're a mix of numbers, letters, and special characters, and password strength identifiers might say they're secure. But these generations are inherently flawed, whether that's because they are repeated results, or come with a recognizable pattern. Researchers evaluated the \"entropy\" of these passwords, or the measure of unpredictability, with both \"character statistics\" and \"log probabilities.\" If that all sounds technical, the important thing to note is that the results showed entropies of 27 bits and 20 bits, respectively. Character statistics tests look for entropy of 98 bits, while log probabilities estimates look for 120 bits. You don't need to be an expert in password entropy to know that's a massive gap.\n\nHackers can use these limitations to their advantage. Bad actors can run the same prompts as researchers (or, presumably, end users) and collect the results into a bank of common passwords. If chatbots repeat passwords in their generations, it stands to reason that many people might be using the same passwords generated by those chatbots—or trying passwords that follow the same pattern. If so, hackers could simply try those passwords during break-in attempts, and if you used an LLM to generate your password, it might match. It's tough to say what that exact risk is, but to be truly secure, each of your passwords should be totally unique. Potentially using a password that hackers have in a word bank is an unnecessary risk.\n\nIt might seem surprising that a chatbot wouldn't be good at generating random passwords, but it makes sense based on how they work. LLMs are trained to predict the next token, or data point, that should appear in a sequence. In this case, the LLM is trying to choose the characters that make the most sense to appear next, which is the opposite of \"random.\" If the LLM has passwords in its training data, it may incorporate that into its answer. The password it generates makes sense in its \"mind,\" because that's what it's been trained on. It isn't programmed to be random.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional password managers are not LLMs. Instead, they are designed to produce a truly random sequence, by taking cryptographic bits and converting them into characters. These outputs are not based on existing training data and follow no patterns, so the chances that someone else out there has the same password as you (or that hackers have it stored in a word bank) is slim. There are plenty of options out there to use, and most password managers come with secure password generators.\n\nBut you don't even need one of these programs to make a secure password. Just pick two or three \"uncommon\" words, mix a few of the characters up, and presto: You have a random, unique, and secure password. For example, you could take the words \"shall,\" \"murk,\" and \"tumble,\" and combine them into \"sH@_llMurktUmbl_e.\" (Don't use that one, since it's no longer unique.)\n\nIf you're looking to boost your personally security even further, consider passkeys whenever possible. Passkeys combine the convenience of passwords with the security of 2FA: With passkeys, your device is your password. You use its built-in authentication to log in (face scan, fingerprint, or PIN), which means there's no password to actually create. Without the trusted device, hackers won't be able to break into your account.\n\nNot all accounts support passkeys, which means they aren't a universal solution right now. You'll likely need passwords for some of your accounts, which means abiding by proper security methods to keep things in order. But replacing some of your passwords with passkeys can be a step up in both security and convenience—and avoids the security pitfalls of asking ChatGPT to make your passwords for you.",

However, the possibility of further disruptions needs to be addressed urgently.\n\n\"Surely the priority must be to give Martin and our players every opportunity to achieve their objectives within the remainder of the season.\n\n\"On that basis, I will continue to seek an end to this debilitating and unnecessary atmosphere of conflict.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Milan-Cortina 2026 has been one of the most eventful Winter Olympics in history – in sporting and political terms - so it is appropriate that the final medal event could be the most enticing of all.\n\nCanada and United States have been the two best teams in the men's ice hockey competition, and they will duke it out at Milano Santagiulia Arena on Sunday at 13.10 GMT.\n\nFor two of the most storied nations in the sport, however, they have very different Olympic histories.\n\nCanada are aiming to be the first nation to earn 10 men's ice hockey gold medals, most recently winning the title in 2014.\n\nUSA meanwhile have not claimed the men's title since 1980 - the 'Miracle on Ice' triumph over Soviet Union in Lake Placid - and have not beaten Canada in a men's final since 1960.\n\nCanada have beaten the American men in their past two Olympic final meetings - Salt Lake City 2002 and Vancouver 2010. But the USA are looking for a double in Milan after their women's side defeated the Canadians on Thursday.\n\nThe two teams did not have a totally smooth skate to this point. Both needed overtime to win their quarter-finals, while Canada had to come from 2-0 down to beat Finland 3-2 in Friday's semi-final on Friday, scoring the winner with 35 seconds on the clock.\n\nThe Canadians also have fitness issues. They could be without captain Sidney Crosby, who was forced off in their last eight win over Czech Republic with a knee injury and missed the Finland semi. Canada are hopeful to have him for Sunday, but he certainly will not be 100% fit.\n\nThe squad has also been afflicted by a sickness bug, which dramatically revealed itself in the quarter-final when Nathan MacKinnon threw up while sat on the bench.\n\nBut even when impacted by injury and illness, Canada still have the strongest team.\n\n\"In Connor McDavid you have the best player on the planet by a million miles,\" ice hockey commentator Seth Bennett told BBC Sport. \"He was averaging three points a game going into semi-finals.\n\n\"McKinnon is another superstar offensive player. Defensively, Cale Makar is the best defenceman in the world and a gamechanger. All will be judged against him.\n\n\"You mix them up and it's like if you have a computer game and you put all the best players on one team.\"\n\nThey also have some of the best up-and-coming talents in the game, such as 19-year-old Macklin Celebrini who has already scored the most points by a teenager in an Olympic competition.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nUSA meanwhile have stars of their own, but don't have the attacking gifts of the Canadians.\n\n\"The Tkachuk brothers [Brady and Matthew], and Jack Eichel, that attacking line has worked well together,\" Bennett said.\n\n\"What they have not had is much scoring from captain Auston Matthews, he has not yet taken any of the games by the horns. They are OK, but not more than that.\"\n\nHowever, the Americans have the best defenceman at the Games in Quinn Hughes, who scored the crucial winner against Sweden.\n\n\"He might be the best three-on-three player in the world,\" said Bennett. \"He loves to keep possession, and is always looking to make an exciting play.\"\n\nIt sets up a mouth-watering finale of an Olympic ice hockey competition which has benefitted hugely from the return of National Hockey League (NHL) players for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe attendance of players from the top North American league was in doubt for a time over concerns about the ice quality at the unfinished Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, but they have been a major boon for the Games.\n\n\"This is the highest level of hockey we have ever seen at an Olympics,\" said Bennett. \"The NHL players have made it a different world.\n\n\"At the last two Olympics, games have been good but have missed the quality in the final third, the big moments. Players didn't have the skillset to break a game, so saw a lot of tight, dull games\n\n\"Some of what the players have been doing here has been mind-blowing. One of the goals scored for Canada, McDavid saucered this pass from the back door [behind the goal], it lands as McKinnon is shooting, on the half-volley. That's when you recognise it.\n\n\"I have been getting phone calls from people in the hockey world, all they have been saying is, this is so good. There have been periods where Kent [Simpson, BBC co-commentator] and I have just been sat watching, smiling, laughing.\"\n\nCanada have won gold in three of the five Olympics when NHL players have featured and will fancy their chances in a game on Sunday which could be as fascinating in the stands as it is on the ice.\n\nIt is highly likely that Canadian prime minister Mark Carney will be in Milan for the game.\n\nNot only is Canada as a country hockey-mad, but so is Carney - when working as governor of the Bank of England, he would play for a recreational team in Haringey, north London.\n\nThe big question is whether his American counterpart will also be in Italy.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe BBC understands that, as of Friday afternoon, Donald Trump is scheduled to remain in Washington DC - but that could now change.\n\nIt would be a logistical and security nightmare for the International Olympic Committee should he attend, and it would add a major frisson to an already charged game.\n\nTrump's vice president JD Vance attended a USA group stage game, and the Olympic opening ceremony at San Siro where he was loudly booed when he appeared on the stadium's big screen.\n\nAnd the presence of Trump - who previously said he will impose tariffs on imported goods from Canada, while also floating the idea of their northern neighbours becoming the US's 51st state - would turn the Santagiulia Arena into a political cauldron.\n\nHis impact was seen in February 2025, when the Four Nations match between the United States and Canada descended into chaos with three fights breaking out between players in the first nine seconds.\n\nThe crowd at Montreal's Bell Centre for that game loudly booed the US national anthem pre-game - an issue which will be avoided in Milan. What happens after the game depends on the victor.\n\nAnd Bennett thinks the heightened stakes and occasion will mean a less pugilistic occasion.\n\n\"There won't be a repeat of the fights with a gold medal on the line,\" he said. \"They will be at each other though; in every break in play, there will be a cross-check, a word, a push, a scrum.\n\n\"Then when they fly back, they will fly on the same private jets because the NHL will put on transport.\n\n\"For example, you have Matthew Tkachuk for USA and Brad Marchand for Canada, who are both rink rats, they will go head-to-head 100%. Then they will be on the same flight, they are Florida Panthers teammates and will try to win the Stanley Cup together.\"\n\nThe crowd may also be less tense due to the likelihood of more neutrals buying tickets for an Olympic spectacle, rather than a potential grudge match.\n\nSo, if you are a neutral going to the game, who does Seth think you should support?\n\n\"Canada going for their 10th gold, so usually the neutral will go with the underdog,\" he says. \"But that is USA.\n\n\"Canada are a bit arrogant too, but they have all the favourite players. How do you not love a team with all those players?\n\n\"But how do you not love a USA team who are having this much fun?\"",

    "fullText": "Great Britain has fallen 25 years behind the best short track nations in the world amid outdated facilities and rising costs, according to British Ice Skating's head of performance.\n\nTeam GB's only short track representative at Milan-Cortina 2026, Niall Treacy, crashed in all three events - 500m, 1,000m and 1500m.\n\nThe 25-year-old reached the final of the 1500m, finishing ninth. But he was the only Brit to compete, with Team GB unable to fill their quota of three athletes.\n\nIt is a far cry from eight years ago, when a well-funded team of five were sent to PyeongChang 2018 with realistic medal hopes.\n\nBut a failure to get on the podium in Korea saw the sport's funding slashed, and head of performance Jon Eley says they have been rebuilding ever since.\n\nFormer short track skater Eley – who represented Britain in three Olympics between 2006 and 2014 – told BBC Sport: \"Go back to PyeongChang, where short track was funded well and we had a world champion [Elise Christie] in the team. That was a Games when we were disappointed not to win a medal.\n\n\"Since then, we have been rebuilding. During that time many teams have gone to the next level of performance and resources.\n\n\"When I made the team 25 years ago and we moved to Nottingham, we had one of the best facilities in the world; now, we don't have an international standard arena. We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nBefore the 2018 Games, UK Sport provided £4.8m to short track skating. As of 2026, the latest UK Sport funding allocation of just under £2m has been presented as a total for short track, figure and long track speed skating.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nBritain has no international quality rinks to host short track events – such as an arena with soft padding around the barriers in case of crashes - meaning Treacy trained with the Dutch national team ahead of the Olympics.\n\nAnd Eley says there are no plans to improve facilities, due to a lack of funding as well as the greater popularity of other winter sports.\n\n\"If you do that [install padding] you can't have hockey on the rink, you can't have pucks with the pads, so you are cutting the use of the facility,\" he said. \"Ice hockey is a big participation sport in the UK.\n\n\"We had that in the lead up to PyeongChang, a hybrid system – pads in place during the week then they take them out on the weekend when the hockey team played.\n\n\"But it was costing £30,000 a week because of how much work it took to take the barriers in and out.\n\n\"Plus, the cost of running rinks in the last few years has gone through the roof, the cost of freezing the ice and the price of energy.\"\n\nInstead, short track will have to be clever with their funding and facilities – and Eley says they could look to a sport where Britain have had Olympic success.\n\nTwo of Britain's three golds at Milan-Cortina have been in skeleton, despite training on a single track in Bath with no ice.\n\nHowever, a clear talent ID and training programme brought success, followed by funding to allow for greater strides to be made in design and hiring world-class coaches.\n\n\"From a skeleton perspective, they might not have loads of access to tracks, but what they do, they do very well,\" he said. \"So we can learn from them.\"\n\nShort track is currently funded as a development sport, and Eley says they are looking to have a stronger and larger team for French Alps 2030.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Britain's Conor Benn leaves Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing organisation to join Dana White's Zuffa Boxing promotional company.",
    "fullText": "Britain's Conor Benn has left Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing organisation to join Dana White's Zuffa Boxing promotional company.\n\nThe 29-year-old had been with Matchroom since turning professional and beat long-time rival Chris Eubank Jr in a blockbuster rematch at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in November, having lost their first bout in April.\n\nIn a statement on Instagram, Benn said he was \"filled with excitement and hunger for what's ahead with Zuffa Boxing\" while paying tribute to his former promoters.\n\n\"First and foremost I want to thank Eddie and the entire team at Matchroom for everything they have done for me over the past decade,\" wrote Benn, the son of former two-weight world champion Nigel.\n\n\"From guiding me when I first turned pro, to headlining stadium shows. They were not only with me for those highlight moments but stood shoulder to shoulder with me during the tough times.\"\n\nBenn and Eubank Jr were originally set to fight in 2022 but the bout was called off when Benn failed a voluntary drugs test - twice testing positive for the banned substance Clomifene.\n\nThat sparked a two-year battle with authorities, before Benn's suspension was lifted in November 2024.\n\nBenn has won 24 of his 25 professional bouts, with his only loss coming against Eubank - whose father Chris Sr fought Nigel Benn twice in the early 1990s.\n\nVictory over Eubank Jr in November has left Conor Benn on the verge of challenging for a world title.\n\nZuffa Boxing, backed by UFC chief White and Saudi Arabian money, staged its first event in January and has vowed to transform professional boxing.\n\nWhite's ultimate aim is to sideline the four traditional sanctioning bodies - WBO, WBC, IBF and WBA - and make Zuffa's belt the premier world title alongside the Ring Magazine title, an organisation owned by Saudi boxing powerbroker Turki Alalshikh.\n\n\"Conor Benn is an absolute beast and a superstar,\" said White. \"He shows up every time and destroys people, and now some of the best fighters in the world are calling him out.\n\n\"He's ready for a world title next and I can't wait to see him compete in Zuffa Boxing. He's going to be a huge addition to a growing stable of very talented boxers.\"\n\nBenn said he hoped Hearn could still be involved in future fights, adding: \"I want the legacy fights, the biggest nights, the biggest stages. I fear no man at any weight and I'm ready to give the fans the fights they've been calling for.\"\n\nAbsolutely nobody in boxing had this on their bingo card. There were no whispers, rumours or cryptic social media hints.\n\nUsually when a fighter jumps ship, the outgoing promoter gets ahead of it with a statement or some kind of warning shot - not this time.\n\nWhite has made no secret of his desire to disrupt boxing's power structure, and securing Benn - a fighter with genuine mainstream appeal, albeit still with doubters - is a statement signing.\n\nHearn had stood firmly behind Benn throughout the doping saga and was actively manoeuvring him towards a world-title shot. Benn is the mandatory challenger for the winner of Mario Barrios v Ryan Garcia, and has made no secret of his ambition to become a world champion.\n\nSo what does this mean for those plans? Zuffa recently signed reigning cruiserweight world champion Jai Opetaia, yet the long-term vision is one belt, a Zuffa title, and no reliance on the traditional sanctioning bodies.\n\nIf that is the direction, what does Benn do now? Will he target becoming the first Zuffa welterweight champion?\n\nOver the past week, White dismissed Hearn's credentials and quipped he works for his father Barry - prompting the younger Hearn to fire back that White's boss is Alalshikh.\n\nFrom a pure PR standpoint, this is a major win for White. This brewing promotional rivalry just got a whole lot louder.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

First and foremost, getting over injuries with a long time left in the game, was a challenge we had to get over pretty quickly.\n\n\"The players had to not let that derail what we are about and how we had prepared and planned and that we still had that belief, with people out of position, that we could hold tight, stay resilient and get the outcome we wanted.\n\n\"It's a long list of injuries and Jonny [Lomax] and Nene [Macdonald] going off so early in the game had a direct impact on the fluidity of what we wanted to do, offensively.\n\n\"As always, you learn more about people in adversity, so buckle up and we'll see where we get. Mid-season we'll have an influx of top-line players coming back.\n\n\"Jonny has a fractured arm, to be confirmed and Nene took a bang to his leg so we expect more investigation on that over the weekend or early next week.\"\n\n\"Leigh coach Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"We had the game won in the first half. The Leigh team of last year would have taken advantage of that and gone on with the job in the second half, but it wasn't to be.\n\n\"We were our own worst enemy, with so many mistakes and put ourselves under pressure against a St Helens team who were very enthusiastic.\n\n\"In the second half the wind was quite strong, we scored the try to go up eight points right at the end of the first half and they kicked off and got the ball back.\n\n\"That was a massive play in the game - if we go in at half-time up by eight it's a completely different ball game, but they're the little things we've just got to get through at this point.\n\n\"It's difficult to point the finger. We've got a lot of new faces and it's going to take some time.\"\n\nSt Helens: Sailor; Feldt, Macdonald, Cross, Murphy; Lomax, Hastings; Klemmer, Clark, Walmsley, Sironen, Wright, Shorrocks.\n\nInterchanges: Robertson, Host, Delaney, Whitley\n\nLeigh: Hodgson; Senior, Niu, Brand, Charnley; Cook, Lam; Trout, Ipape, Mulhern, Badrock, Alick-Wienke, Ofahengaue.\n\nInterchanges: Hughes, Liu, Davis, Horne",

    "description": "Sheffield Wednesday are on the brink of becoming the first team in English Football League history to be relegated in February.",
    "fullText": "Barring a highly unlikely series of results, administration-hit Sheffield Wednesday will become the first team in English Football League history to be relegated in February at some point in the next week.\n\nThe foundations for this relegation were set last summer when former owner Dejphon Chansiri's chaotic tenure came to a head with numerous missed wage payments.\n\nA large number of the senior squad and manager Danny Rohl left in the summer before the Owls were eventually placed into administration in October.\n\nTwo separate points deductions - totalling 18 points - followed, and it has always been a case of when, not if they went down from the Championship this season.\n\nA preferred bidder for the club was selected in December but the Owls remain in administration and are operating under tight restrictions, leaving them with a threadbare squad ill-equipped to compete at this level.\n\nHowever, few would have thought relegation could come quite as early as this and, to make matters worse, it could in fact now be confirmed at bitter cross-city rivals Sheffield United on Sunday.\n\nIf Sheffield Wednesday win all of their remaining 14 games of the season, they will finish the campaign on 35 points.\n\nFollowing Blackburn's win against Preston on Friday, the Owls will be relegated on Saturday if West Bromwich Albion beat leaders Coventry.\n\nA draw or a Coventry win would mean that Wednesday, who are still on -7 points, must then win at Bramall Lane to stop the 'R' from being placed next to their name this weekend.\n\nWinning a derby away from home is a tall task at the best of times, but when you consider that Wednesday's only win all season came at Portsmouth in September, they have lost their past nine games in the Championship, and have not so much as scored in the past six Steel City derbies, you get some idea of what Henrik Pedersen's beleaguered men are up against.\n\n\"We will do everything to bring a top, top performance to compete with them,\" Pederson told BBC Radio Sheffield. .\n\n\"Of course, we know it will happen some day.\n\n\"Nobody understands what this group has been through in the past many months.\n\n\"I have a group with a big belief and big motivation, and a group of senior players who are ready to do everything for our fans and stand up and perform.\n\n\"They know that 95% will not be enough.\"\n\nThe 18 points Sheffield Wednesday have been deducted are the third highest in a single Football League season.\n\nDerby County were deducted 21 in the 2021-22 campaign but took their fight for Championship survival through to April, while Luton Town were hit with a 30-point penalty in the 2008-09 season but finished on a creditable 26 points as they dropped out of League Two and also won the Football League Trophy.\n\nWith 14 games to go, Wednesday are also in danger of setting several more unwanted EFL records, including:\n\nNo team has ever ended a season on minus points. The Owls, who have won 11 points from 32 games so far, need seven from 14 matches to avoid this.\n\nAllowing for three points a game, the fewest points a team has ever picked up in a Football League season is Loughborough with nine in 1899-1900. In more recent times, Derby County went down from the Premier League with 11 points in the 2007-08 season. The all-time low for a 46-game season is Doncaster Rovers' 20 points in 1997-98.\n\nThe record for the most defeats in a 46-game league season also belongs to Doncaster with 34 in the 1997-98 campaign. Wednesday have lost 23 of their first 32 games, meaning 12 defeats in their remaining 14 matches would see them break that record.\n\nThe most consecutive defeats suffered by a team in one season was by Darwen way back in the 1898-99 season with 18. Since the second tier was rebranded as the Championship, the record for the most successive defeats is Rotherham's 10 in the 2016-17 season. Pedersen's side have lost their past nine games.\n\nIn a 46-game season, the fewest wins a team has ever managed is Rochdale's two as they were relegated from the third tier in 1973-74.\n\nWednesday's only win this season came away from home, meaning the Owls are now just six games from becoming the first Football League team to go an entire season without a home win.\n\nThe farthest adrift a team has finished is Stoke City in the 1984-85 season. They finished 33 points from safety in the top tier. At present, the Owls are 41 points behind 21st-placed West Brom.\n\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder has said the prospect of relegating their cross-city rivals is \"not in his thought process at all\".\n\nThe Blades fan, who is unbeaten in his seven games against the Owls, said he disagreed with the notion that his side, who are 15th in the table, should cruise to a win.\n\n\"We'll have done more preparation on this game than we have on any game this season and all the games other than the play-off final last season,\" he told BBC Radio Sheffield.\n\n\"I've got complete respect for Henrik and a group of players... there's talk of it being a mismatch or a gimme, whether it's bookies' odds or the narrative in the city... football just doesn't work like that.\n\n\"The players have to play with a discipline and a control to win a game of football, to win a local derby.\"\n\nWilder added: \"We put a slide up about Macclesfield v Crystal Palace and Bodo/Glimt v Manchester City. There are all sorts of examples recently, let alone [in] the 100 years plus of football, the game isn't decided on team sheets.\n\n\"We understand it's basically their season on the line, we're not daft. But we've got our fight, and ours has to be bigger than theirs.\"\n\nLatest Sheffield Wednesday news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Sheffield Wednesday content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "Preparation, training, and belief - after Keely Hodgkinson smashes the indoor 800m world record, her coach Jenny Meadows explains how their plan came together.",
    "fullText": "Keely Hodgkinson had been preparing for this moment for years.\n\nWhen she stepped on to the indoor track in France on Thursday, the Briton and her team \"had no doubt\" she was going to break the 800m indoor world record - and she did so in some style.\n\nBut it has not all been plain sailing for Hodgkinson since she won the Olympic 800m title at Paris 2024.\n\nThe 23-year-old suffered injury issues last year which challenged her physically and mentally - but has used those setbacks to return even stronger, with her training group, the M11 Track Club, dubbing her 'Keely 2.0'.\n\nShe proved she is back to her best with her stunning indoor run in Lievin, crossing the line in one minute 54.87 seconds to smash a world record which had stood since 3 March 2002 - the day Hodgkinson was born.\n\nAnd this is how Hodgkinson etched her name in the history books.\n\nSince 2019, Hodgkinson has trained with coaches Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows in Manchester.\n\nMeadows, a former international runner, was in France to watch her protege take almost a second off the 800m indoor record, set by Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak almost 24 years ago.\n\n\"She actually said to me the day before: 'obviously I know I'm going to get it',\" said Meadows.\n\n\"There had been so many benchmarks we measure in training, we had no doubt that she would do it.\n\n\"Her biggest fear was to set a world record, but be disappointed with the time. She said 'what if I can't smile? What if I've got the world record, and everyone's so excited, and I think, oh that was rubbish. I could have gone faster'?\"\n\nThe date - 19 February 2026 - had long been set in the diary by Meadows and Hodgkinson given the track in Lievin is notoriously fast.\n\n\"Lievin has had a lot of world records over the years, and we kind of thought 'you know what, let's go with the statistics',\" Meadows said.\n\n\"We're only probably going to get one opportunity during this indoor season to go for it. So that's the event that we picked, and that's the date we've really had etched in our minds the last three months.\"\n\n\"I've got to say, the time she did was the bare minimum of what she was happy with,\" Meadows added.\n\n\"She definitely would have liked to run faster, and there was definitely half a second, maybe even up to one second in those legs.\"\n\nMeadows retired from the sport in 2016. As a former world and European medallist over 800m, she knew exactly what was required to make history.\n\n\"800m is so tough, your body is literally breaking down from the training,\" she said.\n\n\"Keely can be doing certain repetitions, and she's being physically sick from the lactic acid. It's a little bit inhumane at times.\"\n\nIn the build-up to Thursday's race, Meadows said the team learned lessons from previous years, and resisted the urge to do too much training with Hodgkinson - instead believing in the process and their athlete.\n\n\"Keely is a really interesting character. I was quite robotic and could follow a routine. Keely keeps us on our toes. We have to keep her interested. So we're always trying to do little different goals for her.\"\n\nMeadows added: \"We've not been greedy, we've really held back and said we need to believe in our process. We need to believe in our product. We need to believe in our athlete, that Keely can stand on that start line and deliver when the eyes of the world are on her.\"\n\nNine months ago the success experienced in Lievin would have felt like a distant dream for Hodgkinson.\n\nShe had planned a tilt at the 800m indoor world record at her eponymous Keely Klassic event in February 2025 and \"was in great shape\", according to Meadows.\n\nHowever, a hamstring problem forced Hodgkinson to withdraw, regroup and retrain - only for the injury to reoccur 12 weeks later.\n\nDespite setbacks and a reduction in training, she made it to the start line for September's World Athletics Championships, claiming bronze behind GB team-mate Georgia Hunter Bell and winner Kenya's Lilian Odira.\n\n\"It was phenomenal, given the very little preparation [Hodgkinson] did but I doubt she's ever looked at that medal again. She wants the gold, she wants the records, and that is what was driving her forward,\" said Meadows.\n\n\"She isn't the most talented athlete I have ever seen. The difference between Keely and a lot of others is mindset, she can get the best out of herself on a daily basis.\"\n\nIn under a month Hodgkinson will head to Poland to compete in the World Athletics Indoor Championships as a firm favourite for gold.\n\nBeyond that there is another target in her sights - the world record that has stood longer than any other in athletics.\n\nIn July 1983, Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova set a women's outdoor 800m world record in a time of 1:53.28.\n\nBut 43 years on, Hodgkinson wants to beat that mark and make more history.\n\n\"She wants that more than the indoor record. Her ambition is to be a legend of the sport,\" said Meadows.\n\nKratochvilova's time remains more than a second quicker than Hodgkinson's current personal best of 1:54.61, a national record she set in London in 2024.\n\nHer coach believes London could be the scene of what would be arguably Hodgkinson's greatest achievement.\n\n\"I think she would like to do it in the UK. London always delivers a great crowd, a great occasion. In 2026 I think she can definitely run under 1:54...\n\n\"If she goes in on interrupted training, she really does stand a chance.\"",

    "description": "\"Wonderfully different\" Henry Pollock will start his first England Test in Saturday's must-win Six Nations game against Ireland.",
    "fullText": "Henry Pollock has never been short on confidence. He also knows how to leave an impression.\n\nEngland head coach Steve Borthwick speaks to Rugby Football Union director of performance Conor O'Shea \"four or five times a week\" about talent coming through the system.\n\nA blond-haired schoolboy flanker sprinting from his own 22 to score a solo try, external for Northampton Saints Under-18s will not go unmissed.\n\nHowever, it was a colourful post-match interview that first brought Pollock's personality to screens, as the youngster chose not to hold back after England Under-18s were beaten by South Africa in 2022.\n\nPollock's potty mouth was different and unexpected. The talent was always undeniable, but the personality drew attention.\n\nWhen visiting some of Northampton's England players, Borthwick was told to meet the then teenager, who was not long out of school.\n\n\"Normally, when an 18-year-old meets the England head coach for the first time and you don't know each other at all, they are reasonably shy and reserved at that point in time. He was the complete opposite,\" Borthwick told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"He bounded up to me and introduced himself, and I think his words were 'how are you, mate?' I thought 'this guy is wonderfully different, he is an incredible character, full of confidence'.\"\n\nAfter a meteoric rise, Saturday's match against Ireland - which England likely need to win to keep their Six Nations title hopes alive - will be Pollock's first Test start.\n\nDespite it being England captain Maro Itoje's 100th cap, many headlines have been around the inclusion of the 21-year-old tyro, who played for the British and Irish Lions last year after an extraordinary breakthrough season.\n\nSaturday 21 February at 14:10 GMT\n\nListen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds with live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nSuch has been Pollock's impact that already children at rugby clubs across England have been spotted running around with black head tape on, scoring tries and imitating his pulse-checking celebration.\n\nNorthampton's club shop does a roaring trade in sales of black head tape, which Pollock wears to protect his ears.\n\nBut his influence goes further than that.\n\nFormer Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll came home from covering last Saturday's game against Italy in Dublin to find his son dressed as Pollock.\n\nBordeaux Begles players mocked Pollock, who ended up in a final-whistle scuffle, in their post-match celebrations after winning last season's Champions Cup final.\n\n\"Pollock is an outstanding rugby player and I think he is brilliant for the game,\" former Scotland scrum-half Andy Nicol told Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"My daughters are 25 and 22 and they don't know who Tom Curry or Ben Earl are. They know who Henry Pollock is.\"\n\nIn less than six months, he went from being an England Under-20 player to playing for the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\"He is a great character and I got on well with him on the Lions tour in a weird kind of way,\" said assistant coach Johnny Sexton, who received a tongue-in-cheek 40th birthday message on tour off Pollock.\n\nA number of solo tries - one which cut open Leinster in a Champions Cup semi-final win and a remarkable chip-and-chase against Sale Sharks - showed Pollock has the speed and finishing prowess of a Test winger.\n\nThat ability to turn a game on its head, with a moment of magic, was missing for England in their defeat by Scotland last weekend.\n\nFormer Ireland wing Shane Horgan added on BBC 5 Live: \"He does things that few others can, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a spectacular moment by him [against Ireland] that galvanises England's performance.\n\n\"You've got an extremely highly skilled, massively talented individual who has enormous self-confidence, and that confidence has not been blunted by anything yet.\n\n\"That is when you get those generational players. They have all the components but also this bullet-proof confidence, which means they can just keep on delivering throughout their career.\"\n\nWhy Pollock may be England's next breakthrough star\n\nFive moments that made England centurion Itoje\n\n'Ireland plot upset with title hopes on the line'\n\nBorthwick has leaned into Pollock's energy, deploying him as an impact replacement for all seven of his England caps.\n\nFormer Ireland scrum-half Conor Murray played against Pollock in Europe last season and could not believe he has yet to start for England.\n\n\"He has been ripping it up for so long,\" Murray told BBC Rugby Union Weekly. \"He is perceived very well in my book.\n\n\"It was something very different when he came on the scene - too loud and brash - but what makes that OK in my sporting world is that he backs it up all the time.\n\n\"People talk about Pollock being so good off the bench with his dynamism, power and energy.\n\n\"Watch him for Northampton - he goes from the first minute to the 80th minute and does not look tired. I think he is a real danger.\"\n\nPollock, who can play across the back row, also enjoys playing on the edge, adding that he plays best when \"aggressive and confrontational\".\n\nHis love-hate relationship with fans in France continued this season in Bordeaux as he was booed in the Champions Cup final rematch, where he scored twice in defeat.\n\n\"Nobody boos rubbish players, nobody boos somebody they don't actually respect,\" Northampton boss Phil Dowson said.\n\nImpressive performances off the bench against Scotland and Wales have earned him a start at number eight, a position where he has scored six tries in his past five starts for Saints.\n\nFlanker Tom Curry, who started all three Lions Tests, has recently been used as a replacement in a back-row combination with Pollock.\n\nGetting one of England's big-game players on from the start would also have helped pave the way for Pollock, with Ben Earl's speed at open-side flanker also useful in trying to out-run Ireland.\n\n\"Henry Pollock is always tremendously excited. That is his general state. He lives at a level of excitement,\" Borthwick added.\n\n\"The supporters see the joy he plays the game with and they are excited by him.\"\n\nThe last time Pollock faced Irish opposition he played the entire 80 minutes and delivered a performance that accelerated his career and profile.\n\nA similar performance on Saturday may do the same, but this time as a Test starter.\n\nSix Nations: All about Ireland with Conor Murray",

    "description": "As pre-season testing reaches its conclusion, which teams look best - and worst - placed ahead of the Australian Grand Prix?",
    "fullText": "The final pre-season test confirmed there will be a new Formula 1 when the 2026 season starts in Australia in two weeks' time.\n\nNew in the sense of who is at the front - and new in terms of many aspects of the sport and how it works.\n\nSo what did the last three days of running in Bahrain, before the teams decamp to Albert Park in Melbourne, say about the reshaped sport - and who are the winners and losers within that?\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc ended the test with the single fastest lap time in an emphatic way - 0.811 seconds quicker than the next best time, set by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\n\nHeadline times in testing are usually not the place to look to gauge the competitive order, but this did reflect the picture in one important way - Mercedes and Ferrari look like they are going into the new season in the best shape.\n\nAndrea Stella, team principal of world champions McLaren, said on Friday evening: \"This test has confirmed that Ferrari and Mercedes look like the teams to beat. McLaren and Red Bull [are] probably very similar, Ferrari and Mercedes a step ahead.\"\n\nThis picture, an impression reflected by many other senior figures up and down the pit lane, comes less from the headline lap times - even if they did show the teams in the order Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Red Bull - than the so-called race-simulation runs.\n\nBecause the teams fill up their cars with fuel and run a grand prix distance, these have far fewer variables to muddy the picture than single laps.\n\nOn Friday evening, Leclerc did the best race simulation of the week, slightly quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen and McLaren's Oscar Piastri the day before, when they set more or less exactly the same time.\n\nMercedes did not do any race simulations in the second week, only in the first, when track conditions were up to a second slower.\n\nAntonelli set comfortably the fastest race simulation of the first week - a lot faster than Piastri, who was running at the same time.\n\nAnd his team-mate George Russell - the bookies' pre-season championship favourite - was also impressively quick when running in the hotter, slower conditions earlier in the day.\n\nThis is not an exact science, but the cumulation of data is what led to the conclusion reached by Stella and many others.\n\nA complication was that McLaren were not running the latest specification of Mercedes power-unit, which Mercedes were proving out, so can expect an uplift when they switch in Australia to the latest spec.\n\nAnother is Red Bull's new engine is said by Russell to have the best deployment of energy, which is such an important facet this season.\n\nMercedes' biggest concern is reliability. This hit Antonelli much more than Russell, but it's probably fair to say that Mercedes suffered more problems than their major rivals, although Red Bull's new recruit Isack Hadjar did lose a fair bit of his running to issues of one kind or another.\n\nRelive final day of pre-season testing as Ferrari's Leclerc fastest in Bahrain\n\n'Keep calm,' says Domenicali on criticism of new F1 rules\n\nNorris admits new F1 cars 'not purest form of racing'\n\nThere is no question as to the prize for biggest disappointment so far this year. Aston Martin, starting their new works partnership with Honda, are runaway winners of that.\n\nWith design legend Adrian Newey at the helm, Honda - world champions with Red Bull as recently as 2024 - and the money of their billionaire owner Lawrence Stroll and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), all the ingredients for success seem to be there.\n\nBut the new car, delayed by the fact Newey did not arrive until March last year, is uncompetitive and difficult, and the engine is lacking power and unreliable. Aston Martin completed the fewest laps of testing, and look like they may even be in worse shape than new team Cadillac, who expected to be last this year.\n\nBoth the internal combustion engine and hybrid elements of the new Honda power-unit are said to be well behind the best.\n\nSeveral sources told BBC Sport this week that Newey said at Wednesday's meeting of the F1 Commission - a rule-making body comprising all the teams as well as F1 and the FIA - that the Honda power-unit could not even recover energy at the lower limit of 250kw, let alone the higher one of 350kw, which comes into force under certain circumstances in the highly complex rules.\n\nReliability was so bad that by the start of the final day of the test, Honda had only one battery left, and took the decision to limit running to only short runs. A statement said that was to allow them to study data in between track outings, but in the end Lance Stroll did only six laps all day.\n\nThe problems with the engine make it difficult to make any judgement on the car. There is no question it was slow in the corners - but the Honda is running so badly that it's hard for the team to work out where the car is, and therefore how to improve it.\n\nThis is exacerbated by the fact Aston's first in-house gearbox - they have bought them in previously - is not communicating with the engine properly, and keeps behaving oddly, making life even more difficult for the drivers.\n\nFor Fernando Alonso, this all must come with an agonising sense of deja vu. He spent three painful years at McLaren when Honda were underprepared when they re-entered F1 in 2015.\n\nAnd now he faces another one, at the age of 44, and with his contract running out at the end of the year.\n\nPublicly, Alonso is staying optimistic as he said: \"Short and medium term, I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\"\n\nHow long it takes, though, is another matter. And one thing Alonso does not have much of is time.\n\nWhile all the teams are reluctant to say exactly where they think they stand in the competitive order, all are clear that there appears to be three groups of teams - the top four, the midfield, and then Aston Martin and Cadillac at the back.\n\nAmong the midfield runners, who are in the region of at least a second a lap slower than the big four, the team poised to make the biggest step seem to be Alpine.\n\nThey finished last season last, by the biggest margin ever, partly because they devoted extremely limited resource to last year's car, so they could focus on this year.\n\nAlpine have switched to a Mercedes power-unit, following parent company Renault's decision to end its F1 engine programme. And with the combination of this and a much-improved car appear to have jumped up to the top of the midfield fight.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether they or Haas are in the best shape, but either way this is huge progress for the French team.\n\nRacing Bulls are also in this mix at the top of the midfield.\n\nAmong the midfield teams, Williams seem to be the biggest losers. Their 2026 car has been a disappointment so far, overweight by a significant margin - said to be anywhere between 25 and 40 kilos - and lacking downforce.\n\nWilliams finished fifth last year, and this season was supposed to be the next step in their ambition of a return to the top of F1.\n\nTeam principal James Vowles has been saying for two years how much of an opportunity the new rules are to move forward, and was vocal last season as to how early they had switched to the 2026 design and compromised 2025 for exactly this reason.\n\nAudi, which has taken over Sauber for the start of its brand new works programme with its own in-house engine, were expected to have difficulties.\n\nBut they appear to be in decent shape and have been quietly impressive in the midfield context, and could well be ahead of Williams, even if a long way from their ultimate ambitions.\n\nThe leading drivers have all at various points expressed their dissatisfaction with the new rules, especially the amount of energy management required with the new hybrid power-units.\n\nThese feature a near 50-50 split between internal combustion engine and electrical components.\n\nWith the amount of hybrid power increased three-fold, a component of the engine that helped recovery energy removed, and the batteries more or less the same size as last year, the cars are energy starved.\n\nThis has led to some unusual aspects being added to driving.\n\nThese include not going flat out in the run up to the start of a qualifying lap, taking corners in higher gears than is optimum for lap time to keep the turbo spinning, lifting and coasting in qualifying, and even not going flat out at the end of a qualifying lap because it is more time-effective to use the energy elsewhere.\n\nAt some circuits, there will be a lot more energy recovery required than others by the various means available. These include recovering while at full throttle, known as \"super-clip\", and lifting and coasting, as well as the standard method, during braking.\n\nAlbert Park is one of these energy-poor circuits.\n\nFor a purist, and drivers who want to be on the limit at all times, this is not ideal.\n\nBut F1 as a sport has known this was coming ever since the power-unit regulations were created in 2022. And, for now, the drivers are going to have get used to a new normal.\n\nBehind the scenes, meanwhile, there are ongoing discussions as to how to allow the drivers to drive in a more conventional way, but it remains to be seen how these will resolve.\n\nHowever, having seen the cars on track, and watched them on television, it is highly unlikely the average viewer will notice any difference. They still look like F1 cars, and in some ways are more appealing than last year's.\n\nThey are smaller and have less downforce, so they slide \n\nRussell, while acknowledging the differences from previous cars, said: \"The guiding principles are still very much the same. You're pushing the car to the absolute limit. You're trying to brake as hard and late as possible, and carry as much speed through the corners. So far, I'm quite enjoying it.\"\n\nOff track, one of the main focuses of pre-season has been a row between the engine manufacturers over the rules governing the engines' compression ratio.\n\nIt split the engine suppliers into two groups, Mercedes versus the rest - Ferrari, Honda and newcomers Red Bull and Audi.\n\nThe row was dismissed earlier this week by Vowles - a Mercedes customer - as \"noise that will probably go away\", and by Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff as \"a storm in a teacup\".\n\nAnd it looks like both will end up being right.\n\nWhy have Mercedes been targeted? Because their rivals believe they have found a way of exploiting the rule restricting the compression ratio - a measurement of the cylinder displacement between the two extremes of the piston stroke - to 16:1. The rules dictate it is measured at ambient temperature.\n\nTypically, the compression ratio reduces when engines heat up, and the belief was Mercedes had found a way using materials technology to limit this loss.\n\nMercedes' rivals have been pushing for a rule that measures it at a higher temperature, in the hope of restricting their perceived advantage.\n\nThis could also have allowed the others to set their ambient temperature compression ratio higher than 16:1 so that it was at the limit at a higher temperature, and so improve the performance of their engines relative to Mercedes.\n\nGoverning body the FIA has proposed a compromise whereby the ratio is measured both at ambient temperature and 130C.\n\nAs this does not achieve the aim Mercedes' opponents wanted, the signs are the other companies may even vote against the proposal that came out of their own campaign. Even if it passes, it seems it will make no difference.\n\nWolff added: \"The way it works, you know, either we stay with the regulations like we are or the e-vote goes ahead with the proposal that came from the FIA. Both are OK for us.\"\n\nThe new engines are also much harder to get off the line, which many expect will lead to unpredictability at starts.\n\nThere were safety concerns about this at the start of the first test - especially the risk of a car slow away being rear-ended by another at high speed.\n\nBut these were largely assuaged by a new start line procedure that was trialled at the test, which gives the drivers more time to get the turbos spinning at the optimum speed.\n\nOn the face of it, the Ferrari-engined cars seemed to have an advantage - they rocketed past rivals on several occasions during these tests.\n\nBut Williams driver Alex Albon said: \"I don't think what you're seeing is really what's going to happen. You've got drivers who are finishing long runs, going into a practice start, on a high-mileage tyre that's already gone. So you've seen this chaos of some people getting good starts, bad starts, but actually it's not as bad as that.\"\n\nAnd data seen by BBC Sport showed that, actually, of all the starts performed in testing, the Mercedes-engined teams as a bloc had the best starts on average - they were ranked in four of the top five places - followed by Ferrari-powered cars.\n\nStrangely, Racing Bulls were second and Red Bull last, despite having the same Red Bull Powertrains/Ford engine.\n\nFerrari (Charles Leclerc) one minute 31.992 seconds\n\nMercedes (Kimi Antonelli) Mercedes 1:32.803\n\nMcLaren (Oscar Piastri) 1:32.861\n\nRed Bull (Max Verstappen) 1:33.109\n\nHaas (Oliver Bearman) Haas 1:33.487\n\nAudi (Gabriel Bortoleto) 1:33.755\n\nRacing Bulls (Arvid Lindblad) 1:34.149\n\nWilliams (Carlos Sainz) 1:34.342\n\nCadillac (Valtteri Bottas) 1:35.290\n\nAston Martin (Lance Stroll) 1:35.974",

    "description": "Cloudflare introduces Code Mode for Workers AI, a technical approach to fit entire API schemas into 1,000 tokens, enabling LLM agents to execute precise tool calls with minimal latency.",
    "fullText": "Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard way for AI agents to use external tools. But there is a tension at its core: agents need many tools to do useful work, yet every tool added fills the model's context window, leaving less room for the actual task.\n\nCode Mode is a technique we first introduced for reducing context window usage during agent tool use. Instead of describing every operation as a separate tool, let the model write code against a typed SDK and execute the code safely in a Dynamic Worker Loader. The code acts as a compact plan. The model can explore tool operations, compose multiple calls, and return just the data it needs. Anthropic independently explored the same pattern in their Code Execution with MCP post.\n\nToday we are introducing a new MCP server for the entire Cloudflare API — from DNS and Zero Trust to Workers and R2 — that uses Code Mode. With just two tools, search() and execute(), the server is able to provide access to the entire Cloudflare API over MCP, while consuming only around 1,000 tokens. The footprint stays fixed, no matter how many API endpoints exist.\n\nFor a large API like the Cloudflare API, Code Mode reduces the number of input tokens used by 99.9%. An equivalent MCP server without Code Mode would consume 1.17 million tokens — more than the entire context window of the most advanced foundation models.\n\nCode mode savings vs native MCP, measured with tiktoken\n\nYou can start using this new Cloudflare MCP server today. And we are also open-sourcing a new Code Mode SDK in the Cloudflare Agents SDK, so you can use the same approach in your own MCP servers and AI Agents.\n\nThis new MCP server applies Code Mode server-side. Instead of thousands of tools, the server exports just two: search() and execute(). Both are powered by Code Mode. Here is the full tool surface area that gets loaded into the model context:\n\nTo discover what it can do, the agent calls search(). It writes JavaScript against a typed representation of the OpenAPI spec. The agent can filter endpoints by product, path, tags, or any other metadata and narrow thousands of endpoints to the handful it needs. The full OpenAPI spec never enters the model context. The agent only interacts with it through code.\n\nWhen the agent is ready to act, it calls execute(). The agent writes code that can make Cloudflare API requests, handle pagination, check responses, and chain operations together in a single execution.\n\nBoth tools run the generated code inside a Dynamic Worker isolate — a lightweight V8 sandbox with no file system, no environment variables to leak through prompt injection and external fetches disabled by default. Outbound requests can be explicitly controlled with outbound fetch handlers when needed.\n\nSuppose a user tells their agent: \"protect my origin from DDoS attacks.\" The agent's first step is to consult documentation. It might call the Cloudflare Docs MCP Server, use a Cloudflare Skill, or search the web directly. From the docs it learns: put Cloudflare WAF and DDoS protection rules in front of the origin.\n\nStep 1: Search for the right endpoints\nThe search tool gives the model a spec object: the full Cloudflare OpenAPI spec with all $refs pre-resolved. The model writes JavaScript against it. Here the agent looks for WAF and ruleset endpoints on a zone:\n\nThe server runs this code in a Workers isolate and returns:\n\nThe full Cloudflare API spec has over 2,500 endpoints. The model narrowed that to the WAF and ruleset endpoints it needs, without any of the spec entering the context window.\n\nThe model can also drill into a specific endpoint's schema before calling it. Here it inspects what phases are available on zone rulesets:\n\nThe agent now knows the exact phases it needs: ddos_l7 for DDoS protection and http_request_firewall_managed for WAF.\n\nStep 2: Act on the API\nThe agent switches to using execute. The sandbox gets a cloudflare.request() client that can make authenticated calls to the Cloudflare API. First the agent checks what rulesets already exist on the zone:\n\nThe agent sees that managed DDoS and WAF rulesets already exist. It can now chain calls to inspect their rules and update sensitivity levels in a single execution:\n\nThis entire operation, from searching the spec and inspecting a schema to listing rulesets and fetching DDoS and WAF configurations, took four tool calls.\n\nWe started with MCP servers for individual products. Want an agent that manages DNS? Add the DNS MCP server. Want Workers logs? Add the Workers Observability MCP server. Each server exported a fixed set of tools that mapped to API operations. This worked when the tool set was small, but the Cloudflare API has over 2,500 endpoints. No collection of hand-maintained servers could keep up.\n\nThe Cloudflare MCP server simplifies this. Two tools, roughly 1,000 tokens, and coverage of every endpoint in the API. When we add new products, the same search() and execute() code paths discover and call them — no new tool definitions, no new MCP servers. It even has support for the GraphQL Analytics API.\n\nOur MCP server is built on the latest MCP specifications. It is OAuth 2.1 compliant, using Workers OAuth Provider to downscope the token to selected permissions approved by the user when connecting. The agent  only gets the capabilities the user explicitly granted.\n\nFor developers, this means you can use a simple agent loop and still give your agent access to the full Cloudflare API with built-in progressive capability discovery.\n\nSeveral approaches have emerged to reduce how many tokens MCP tools consume:\n\nClient-side Code Mode was our first experiment. The model writes TypeScript against typed SDKs and runs it in a Dynamic Worker Loader on the client. The tradeoff is that it requires the agent to ship with secure sandbox access. Code Mode is implemented in Goose and Anthropics Claude SDK as Programmatic Tool Calling.\n\nCommand-line interfaces are another path. CLIs are self-documenting and reveal capabilities as the agent explores. Tools like OpenClaw and Moltworker convert MCP servers into CLIs using MCPorter to give agents progressive disclosure. The limitation is obvious: the agent needs a shell, which not every environment provides and which introduces a much broader attack surface than a sandboxed isolate.\n\nDynamic tool search, as used by Anthropic in Claude Code, surfaces a smaller set of tools hopefully relevant to the current task. It shrinks context use but now requires a search function that must be maintained and evaluated, and each matched tool still uses tokens.\n\nEach approach solves a real problem. But for MCP servers specifically, server-side Code Mode combines their strengths: fixed token cost regardless of API size, no modifications needed on the agent side, progressive discovery built in, and safe execution inside a sandboxed isolate. The agent just calls two tools with code. Everything else happens on the server.\n\nThe Cloudflare MCP server is available now. Point your MCP client at the server URL and you'll be redirected to Cloudflare to authorize and select the permissions to grant to your agent. Add this config to your MCP client:\n\nFor CI/CD, automation, or if you prefer managing tokens yourself, create a Cloudflare API token with the permissions you need. Both user tokens and account tokens are supported and can be passed as bearer tokens in the Authorization header.\n\nMore information on different MCP setup configurations can be found at the Cloudflare MCP repository.\n\nCode Mode solves context costs for a single API. But agents rarely talk to one service. A developer's agent might need the Cloudflare API alongside GitHub, a database, and an internal docs server. Each additional MCP server brings the same context window pressure we started with.\n\nCloudflare MCP Server Portals let you compose multiple MCP servers behind a single gateway with unified auth and access control. We are building a first-class Code Mode integration for all your MCP servers, and exposing them to agents with built-in progressive discovery and the same fixed-token footprint, regardless of how many services sit behind the gateway.",

    "description": "Preflight Checklist I have searched existing requests and this feature hasn't been requested yet This is a single feature request (not multiple features) Problem Statement When auto-compaction trig...",
    "fullText": "When auto-compaction triggers mid-task, the summarization process irreversibly loses user-provided data that Claude is actively working with. The compacted summary retains a reference to the data (e.g., \"user provided DOM markup\") but discards the data itself — even though the full transcript is still on disk at ~/.claude/projects/{project-path}/.\n\nConcrete example: I paste ~8,000 characters of DOM markup and ask Claude to refactor it. The session continues, auto-compaction fires, and the summary now says \"User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis.\" When I ask a specific question about the markup, Claude either hallucinates details, hedges, or asks me to re-paste what I provided minutes ago. The transcript on disk still has the original markup — Claude just has no way to know that, or where to find it.\n\nThis isn't an edge case. Any task involving substantial user-provided input (DOM markup, config files, log output, schema definitions) is at risk the moment the context window fills up. There are at least 8 open issues describing different symptoms of this same root cause:\n\n#1534 — Memory Loss After Auto-compact (June 2025, closed — problem persists)\n\n#3021 — Forgets to Refresh Memory After Compaction\n\n#10960 — Repository Path Changes Forgotten After Compaction\n\n#13919 — Skills context completely lost after auto-compaction (compiled its own list of 5+ related issues)\n\n#14968 — Context compaction loses critical state\n\n#19888 — Conversation compaction loses entire history\n\n#21105 — Context truncation causes loss of conversation history\n\n#23620 — Agent team lost when lead's context gets compacted\n\nThe underlying problem: compaction is a one-way lossy transformation with an available lossless source that isn't wired up. The summary and the transcript coexist on disk, but the summary contains no pointer back to the source material it compressed.\n\nPhase 1: Within-session indexed transcript references\n\nTag compressed entries in the compacted summary with transcript line-range annotations so Claude can surgically recover only the specific content it needs, on demand.\n\nCurrent behavior (lossy, no recovery):\n\n[compacted] User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis.\n\nProposed behavior (recoverable):\n\n[compacted] User provided 8,200 characters of DOM markup for analysis. [transcript:lines 847-1023]\n\nWhen Claude detects it needs the original data — because a question requires specifics the summary doesn't contain — it reads only lines 847–1023 from the transcript. Surgical recovery, minimal token cost, no wasted context on data that isn't needed.\n\nImplementation scope: A modification to the compaction summarizer — when compressing a block of content, emit the summary line plus a transcript line-range annotation. Then expose a recovery mechanism (likely a file read with offset) that Claude can invoke when it identifies a gap between what the summary references and what it can actually see.\n\nPhase 2 (future extension): Cross-session indexed lookup\n\nThe same mechanism generalizes across sessions. Transcripts from past sessions persist in ~/.claude/projects/. A cross-session reference would look like:\n\nSuggested UX: Claude checks the current session transcript first (fast, local, cheap). If no match, Claude prompts the user: \"I don't have that detail in the current session. Want me to search previous session transcripts?\" User opts in → Claude searches across session transcripts using indexed references. This respects the user's token budget while providing a clean escalation path.\n\nMEMORY.md behavioral nudge — Adding a rule in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md telling Claude to check the transcript when data feels incomplete. This works occasionally but depends on Claude being self-aware enough to recognize what it's lost, which it often can't. It's a behavioral hack, not an architectural fix.\n\nManual /compact with preservation instructions — e.g., /compact preserve all user-provided DOM markup. This is manual, not automated, and still produces lossy summaries.\n\nExisting proposals that address this differently:\n\n#17428 — File-backed summaries that write compacted content to new files for later retrieval. This proposal achieves the same goal with less machinery: the transcript already exists on disk, so rather than duplicating data into new files, annotate the summary with line-range pointers to the existing transcript. Same recoverability, zero additional storage.\n\n#15923 — Pre-compaction hook to archive transcripts before compaction. Useful for logging but doesn't solve the recovery problem — Claude still can't find what it lost.\n\n#21190 — Include last N interactions verbatim in the compact summary. Helps with recent context but doesn't scale to mid-session data and increases summary size.\n\n#6549 — Manual continuation prompts before compaction. Effective but entirely manual and user-dependent.\n\nCommunity workarounds: The MCP memory ecosystem (embedding stores, knowledge graphs, SQLite-backed recall) has dozens of projects working around this gap externally. These are all compensating for one missing capability: the compacted summary doesn't know where its source material lives. The indexed transcript reference approach solves it natively, at the platform layer, with zero additional infrastructure.\n\nHigh - Significant impact on productivity\n\nWith indexed transcript references:\n\nAt step 4, Claude sees [transcript:lines 847-1023] in the compacted summary, reads just those 177 lines from the transcript on disk, recovers the exact markup, and answers accurately. No re-paste, no guessing, no wasted tokens. The session continues as if compaction never happened.\n\nThe transcript already persists at ~/.claude/projects// — no new storage mechanism needed. This proposal adds metadata to the compaction summary, not infrastructure.\n\nImplementation scope is a modification to the compaction summarizer: emit summary lines with [transcript:lines X-Y] annotations, plus a recovery mechanism (file read with line offset) Claude can invoke on demand.\n\nToken cost is zero until recovery is triggered, and surgical when it is — only the specific compressed chunk gets loaded, not the full transcript.\n\nRelated issues (demand evidence):\n\nAt least 8 open bugs trace back to this same root cause — compaction summaries with no back-reference to source:\n\n#1534, #3021, #10960, #13919, #14968, #19888, #21105, #23620\n\nRelated feature requests (differentiation):\n\nPhase 2 extension (not the core ask, but worth noting): The same indexed mechanism generalizes across session transcripts for cross-session recovery. Default to current session lookup; prompt the user before searching prior sessions. Same architecture, wider scope.",

    "fullText": "It has long been the case that the person sitting next to you on an airplane may have paid a very different price for their seat than you did. For two reasons. First, airlines don’t price seats – they price itineraries. A seat from London to New York may be priced very differently depending on whether it’s one-way, one-half of a round trip, or one stage in a larger, multi-stage journey. Second, however, airlines are sophisticated about maximizing the value of your seat, responding to patterns of peak travel (Thanksgiving, August), when you buy it, and other factors. Despite their complexity, those prices are supposed to be based on published tariffs that anyone can, in theory, calculate for themselves and come up with the same answer.\n\nIn 2012, travel and data privacy expert Edward Hasbrouck explained all this as part of documenting and opposing the airlines’ desire to move to personalized pricing. Instead of acting as common carriers and publishing tariffs that apply across the board, with personalized pricing the airlines would use the information they have about you to charge what you can and would be willing to pay. In 2012, the International Air Transportation Association called it “New Distribution Capability”.\n\nThis is a much scarier proposition now than it was then; companies have a lot more data they can exploit. In 2012, they might simply have known your flying habits and credit score, while balancing their desire to get the most they can for the seat against the time they have left to sell it. Uber uses similar tactics; it raises the price of a ride – “surge pricing”, or “dynamic pricing” – when demand is high.\n\nToday, an airline might know – or be able to find out – that you are racing against time to see a beloved relative before they die. And why should it stop with airlines? Exploitative possibilities abound.\n\nUber has already been dubiously accused of charging more when riders’ phone batteries are low. Retailers collect shopping histories through loyalty cards and apps; often customers already pay more for opting out.\n\nSome types of price discrimination have long been illegal under consumer protection law. On February 12, US senators Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced the Stop Price Gouging in Grocery Stores Act of 2026 to block it in grocery stores. Other efforts are also underway in the US. This week’s news is calling this “surveillance pricing” or “predatory pricing”, which accurately reflects the data collection and surveillance capitalism underpinning.\n\nThis is not really a story about specific technologies, although “AI”; the issue is, as Hasbrouck writes, opacity and discrimination.\n\nThe technological pieces are in place to make this all much worse. Not just online, where prices are easily generated on the fly, but also in real-world retailers via wireless connections and electronic shelf tags, which already exist in some stores. A May 2025 study finds that these tags are so far not used to implement surge pricing but to update sale prices and offer discounts – but for how long?\n\nIn a May 2025 paper in the International Journal of Research in Marketing researchers examine the rise of algorithmic pricing – Uber, landlords, retailers – generally and personalized pricing in particular. The authors note that the latter requires market power, and buyers must have limited ability to exploit price differences. And also: it’s profitable (duh). The authors go on to discuss the role of privacy, data protection, consumer laws, and backlash, in curbing unfairness. At Big, which focuses on consolidation and market power, Matt Stoller warns of the potential power of Google’s plan to run pricing strategies for advertisers.\n\nHasbrouck returned to the subject last year while recapping the latest season of The Amazing Race to explain the airlines’ use of systems that deliver increasingly opaque and unpredictable pricing and the lack of enforcement enabling it.\n\nIn a pair of posts, the ACLU’s Jay Stanley follows Hasbrouck’s logic to new levels, laying out a possible future these developments may bring. The desire to wring every last possible bit of profit out of us – we’re talking everyone who sells goods or services now, not just airlines – in Stanley’s view will lead to collecting more and more detailed data. The digital identification infrastructure being built into airports – as planned here in 2013 and shown arriving in 2022 – will ensure there is no countermeasure we can take to escape monitoring and data collection. In Stanley’s projection, stores will be able to demand a digital identification sign-in as a condition of entry.\n\nAgain, a bit of this is here already. In the UK, Facewatch, which we first encountered in 2013, is used by some major retailers to identify and bar shoppers who have previously been caught shoplifting or being violent. Recently, the system flagged a shopper and staff ousted the wrong person, who found it difficult to prove the mistake.\n\nIn other words, all these technologies, wrapped up together, could enable a world not much different from that imagined by Ira Levin in his 1970 book This Perfect Day, where everything anyone wanted to do required permission from a centralized system. Although: the key to making that work was drugging the entire population.\n\nIllustrations: Burmese python in Florida, 2011 (via Wikimedia).\n\nWendy M. Grossman is an award-winning journalist.

    "fullText": "Figure 1: JPEG produced with DALL-E 4o\n\nEvery engineer I've worked with has used the phrase \"technical debt\", but everyone seems to have a different notion of what this phrase actually means. I've also found the phrase to be quite controversial, sparking knee jerk reactions that cut short any meaningful discussions around how to improve codebases and the systems they precipitate.\n\nIn general, I feel the term has become a catch-all for anything in a codebase that someone doesn't like – messy code, missing tests, old frameworks, that one service nobody wants to touch, that slow CI in a repo that everyone has to touch…. This imprecision isn't just sloppy language – it's actively harmful. When everything is \"tech debt,\" nothing is, and teams lose the ability to reason clearly about what to fix, when to fix it, and whether to fix it at all.\n\nWhen everything is \"tech debt,\" nothing is, and teams lose the ability to reason clearly about what to fix, when to fix it, and whether to fix it at all.\n\nThis post reclaims the financial metaphor that Ward Cunningham originally intended1, extends it with precise mappings to financial instruments, and proposes concrete management strategies that scale from a two-person startup to a thousand-engineer enterprise.\n\nThe key insight elicidated in this post, and the main subject of my argument, is that the real danger isn't the debt itself – it's the interest. This post will be useful to you because, if you are like most teams, you likely don't know your interest rate.\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nLike financial debt, it has principal (the cost to fix), interest (the ongoing drag), and an interest rate (the frequency with which you interact with the debt multiplied by the friction it causes).\n\nThe problem isn't taking on debt – it's failing to manage the interest. This post provides a framework for classifying, measuring, and paying down technical debt at any organizational scale.\n\nIn 1992, Ward Cunningham presented an experience report at OOPSLA describing the development of a financial portfolio management system in Smalltalk. He needed to justify ongoing refactoring to his business stakeholders, so he reached for a an unironically relevant metaphor they'd understand1:\n\nShipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite… The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. – Ward Cunningham\n\nNotice what he didn't say. He didn't say \"writing bad code is like going into debt.\" He said shipping code before you fully understand the problem domain is like going into debt. The distinction matters enormously.\n\nCunningham was describing something specific: the team had built a working system, and through the process of building it, they had learned things about the domain that the code didn't yet reflect. The code worked. It was well-written. But it encoded an earlier, incomplete understanding of the problem. The \"debt\" was the gap between what the team now understood and what the code expressed.\n\nThis is a much more subtle – and much more useful – concept than \"the code is messy.\"\n\nBuilding on Cunningham's original insight, and drawing from a decade of subsequent refinement by Martin Fowler, Philippe Kruchten, and others, here's the definition I use:\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nTechnical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work.\n\nFurthermore, technical debt has four essential properties:\n\nThat last point is critical. A mortgage isn't reckless. Neither is shipping a prototype with hardcoded configuration to validate a business hypothesis. The question isn't whether to take on debt. It's whether you know you're doing it, and whether you have a plan to service it.\n\nPrecision matters here. Conflating these concepts with tech debt dilutes the metaphor to uselessness.\n\nThe litmus test: does this thing have both a principal (cost to fix) and an interest rate (ongoing cost of not fixing it)? If it only has a principal and no meaningful interest, it's not debt – it's just cleanup work. If it has interest but no meaningful principal (you can't fix it), it's a constraint, not debt.\n\nThe power of Cunningham's metaphor is that finance has centuries of well-developed theory for managing debt. But most engineers use the analogy at the level of \"debt = bad, pay it off\" – which is about as sophisticated as saying \"mortgages are bad, never buy a house.\"\n\nLet's map the concepts precisely.\n\nA key insight falls out of this mapping:\n\nHigh-interest debt is debt that compounds every time you touch it.\n\nHigh-interest debt is debt that compounds every time you touch it. The auth module you hack around daily costs orders of magnitude more than the deployment script you run quarterly – even if the deployment script's remediation cost (principal) is lower. This is why prioritizing debt paydown by \"ease of fix\" is backwards. You should prioritize by interest rate.\n\nNot all debt is created equal, and not all debt should be treated the same way.\n\nHere are a few high level categories:\n\nFinancial analog: a 30-year fixed mortgage.\n\nThis is stable code that is architecturally imperfect but rarely touched. For example, this could be a data ingestion pipeline written in Python 2 that runs once a month and processes CSV files. If it works and nobody modifies it, then the interest is near-zero because the frequency of interaction is near-zero.\n\nManagement strategy: leave it alone. Seriously. Refactoring this is like paying off a 2% mortgage early when you have 20% credit card debt. It's mathematically silly.\n\nFinancial analog: credit card debt.\n\nThis is the core module that every team touches daily and everyone hates. For example, the ORM that requires three workarounds per query, or the authentication layer that breaks in every test environment, or the deployment pipeline that takes 45 minutes and fails 20% of the time.\n\nI once worked on a team where the API gateway had been \"temporarily\" written as a single Express.js middleware file. Every team in the company routed through it. Every feature that touched authentication, rate limiting, or request validation required modifying that file. We had merge conflicts on it daily. The file was 3,000 lines long. The principal to fix it – decomposing it into proper middleware layers – was maybe two weeks of focused work. We deferred it for eighteen months because no sprint ever had \"room.\" By the end, we estimated that the accumulated interest – in merge conflicts, debugging time, and incidents caused by accidental regressions in that file – had cost us closer to six months of engineering time. Two weeks of principal. Six months of interest. That's a 1,200% annual rate.\n\nManagement strategy: pay this down immediately. Every day you don't costs more than the day before, because interest compounds with each interaction. This is where the \"just ship it\" mentality becomes catastrophically expensive.\n\nFinancial analog: an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nThis is debt whose cost changes based on external factors. A system that works fine at current scale but will collapse at 10x. Hardcoded assumptions about single-region deployment. A data pipeline that assumes English-only text.\n\nThe interest rate is low today but will spike when conditions change – a new market, a compliance requirement, a viral moment. The danger is that by the time the rate spikes, the principal has grown too.\n\nManagement strategy: cap your exposure. You don't need to fix it now, but you need to know about it and have a plan. Architecture decision records (ADRs) are your friend here – they document the assumptions that, when violated, will trigger a rate increase.\n\nFinancial analog: off-balance-sheet liabilities (the kind that caused the 2008 financial crisis).\n\nThis is the scariest kind. Tribal knowledge that exists only in one engineer's head. Undocumented invariants that the code silently depends on. A deployment process that only works because of a specific order of operations that nobody has written down.\n\nHidden debt is the technical equivalent of off-balance-sheet liabilities – the kind that brought down Lehman Brothers. You don't know about it until it explodes.\n\nManagement strategy: incognito leverage too dangerous – make it visible. Do bus factor analysis, documentation sprints, runbooks, chaos engineering – anything that surfaces hidden assumptions. You can't manage debt you can't see.\n\nTechnical debt doesn't appear and disappear in a single event — it follows a lifecycle. The diagram below traces debt from the moment it's incurred through a decision point where teams choose one of five responses. Notice the feedback loops: deferred debt compounds back into accruing interest, and even \"resolved\" debt eventually gives way to new debt as the system evolves.\n\nMartin Fowler's Technical Debt Quadrant provides the best taxonomy I've seen for why debt gets created. It classifies debt along two axes: deliberate vs. inadvertent and prudent vs. reckless2.\n\nEach quadrant requires a different response:\n\nIt's important to resist the temptation to moralize about technical debt. In many contexts, taking on debt is the right decision:\n\nTech debt is often a sign of rational decision-making under uncertainty – not incompetence.\n\nThis is the framing I use with stakeholders, and it changes the conversation immediately. Instead of \"we need to clean up the code\" (which sounds like an engineering vanity project), it becomes \"we need to manage our financial exposure\" (which sounds like responsible governance).\n\nMost teams think about technical debt in terms of principal – \"how hard would it be to fix this?\" They estimate the cost of a refactor, put it on the backlog, and let it sit there because it never outranks the next feature.\n\nBut the principal is static. The interest is what kills you. And interest compounds.\n\nAvoid metrics theater. Lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and lint scores are proxies at best and noise at worst. The following signals are more useful for measuring the interest on your technical debt:\n\nThese signals map directly to interest, not principal. A system with high change amplification and a high fear factor is accruing massive interest, regardless of how \"easy\" the fix would be.\n\nInterest on technical debt compounds in ways that are genuinely analogous to financial compound interest. Consider a module with a 10% \"tax\" – every feature touching this module takes 10% longer than it should.\n\nHacking around debt like trying to kill a mythological hydra – the effort is herculean, but the problem only grows with each swing of the engineer's sword.\n\nIn isolation, 10% sounds manageable. But compound it:\n\nThis is how a 10% tax becomes a 50% tax in 18 months. I've seen this exact pattern play out at multiple companies. Hacking around debt like trying to kill a mythological hydra – the effort is herculean, but the problem only grows with each swing of the engineer's sword. If the banner image of this blog post reminds you of a terrifying hydra, then I've accomplished my goal of being illustrious.\n\nThe chart above models three scenarios over five years. The red line shows what happens when debt is left unmanaged – a 10% velocity tax compounds into a 50%+ tax within a few years. The yellow line shows moderate, consistent debt service. The green line shows aggressive front-loaded paydown that levels off once the worst debt is addressed.\n\nThe takeaway: the earlier you start servicing debt, the cheaper it is. Just like a mortgage.\n\nThe compounding effect isn't just an analogy – it's a law of software evolution.\n\nLehman's laws of software evolution, established empirically in the 1970s and validated repeatedly since, state that4:\n\nLaw #2 is the kicker. Complexity doesn't increase because engineers are careless. It increases because that's what happens to systems that interact with the real world. Entropy is the default. Order requires energy. This is as true in software as it is in thermodynamics.\n\nEntropy is the default. Order requires energy.\n\nTechnical debt, in this framing, is unreduced complexity – the delta between the system's current complexity and the minimum complexity needed to serve its current purpose. Interest is the ongoing cost of carrying that excess complexity. And Lehman tells us that without deliberate effort, that delta only grows.\n\nSo the debt compounds. The interest accrues. Lehman's second law tells us complexity grows by default. The natural question is: what do you actually do about it?\n\nThe right approach depends heavily on context. A strategy that's right for a 500-person engineering org can be lethal for a 5-person startup, and vice versa.\n\nThis is where debt management gets serious, and where I've seen the most damage done. At one growth-stage company I worked with, the engineering team tripled in a year. The codebase they inherited from the startup phase was a classic \"clean interfaces, dirty internals\" system – which had been fine at 8 engineers. But at 30, the dirty internals became a coordination bottleneck. Three teams would independently hack around the same internal limitation in three different ways, creating three new debt instruments per quarter. The startup-era debt didn't grow linearly with headcount – it grew quadratically, because every new engineer was another node in the collision graph.\n\nYou're past the point where everyone knows everything, but not yet at the scale where platform teams and formal governance make sense. This is the most dangerous stage.\n\nAllocate fixed capacity for debt service. 15-25% of engineering capacity, every sprint, non-negotiable. This is not a \"20% time\" passion project. This is interest payments. McKinsey's research found that organizations with systematic debt management freed up engineers to spend up to 50% more time on value-generating work5.\n\nAt enterprise scale, technical debt becomes systemic risk. Individual modules matter less than system-level friction: API boundaries, deployment pipelines, shared libraries, and the organizational structures that produce them.\n\nNotice how the allocation to debt service increases with company size. This is counterintuitive – you'd think larger companies with more resources could afford less proportional debt spending. But larger companies have more accumulated debt, more system boundaries where debt hides, and higher coordination costs. The 5% a startup spends is \"fix it when you see it.\" The 25% an enterprise spends is \"dedicated teams, formal processes, migration projects.\"\n\nOne of the most powerful reframings in this entire financial analogy:\n\nRefactoring is not \"paying off\" debt. It's refinancing it.\n\nWhen you refinance a mortgage, you don't eliminate the debt. You replace one debt instrument with another that has better terms – lower interest rate, more predictable payments, better aligned with your current financial situation.\n\nGood refactoring does the same thing:\n\nThis reframing matters because it changes the conversation with stakeholders. \"We need to stop feature work for 3 months to clean up the code\" is a hard sell. \"We're refinancing – we'll reduce our ongoing maintenance costs by 30%, freeing up 2 engineers' worth of capacity for new features\" is a business case.\n\nNo discussion of technical debt in 2026 is complete without addressing the elephant in the IDE: AI code assistants.\n\nGitHub Copilot, Claude, and their cousins have fundamentally changed the economics of code production. Writing code is now cheaper and faster than ever. But cheaper production doesn't mean cheaper ownership – and this is where the financial analogy becomes urgent.\n\nGitClear's 2025 research on AI-assisted code quality found11:\n\nGoogle's 2024 DORA report corroborates: teams with higher AI adoption reported faster code review and improved documentation, but the same cohort showed a measurable decrease in delivery stability3.\n\nIn financial terms: AI assistants have massively increased the rate at which teams can issue new debt, while simultaneously reducing the rate at which existing debt gets serviced.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward:\n\nThis creates a specific new type of debt that deserves its own name: comprehension debt.\n\nAI assistants have massively increased the rate at which teams can issue new debt, while simultaneously reducing the rate at which existing debt gets serviced.\n\nComprehension debt is the gap between the size of a codebase and any individual engineer's ability to hold a working mental model of it. Traditional technical debt is about code that's wrong – suboptimal designs that create friction. Comprehension debt is about code that might be individually correct but is collectively unintelligible. Each AI-generated function may work perfectly, but when 40% of the codebase was written by an LLM that doesn't know your team's conventions, the overall architecture drifts toward incoherence – ten different patterns for error handling, six ways to call the same API, three duplicate utility functions that almost-but-do-not-quite do the same thing.\n\nThe insidious property of comprehension debt is that it can't be addressed by traditional refactoring. You can't \"fix\" a codebase that nobody can hold in their head. The debt isn't in any individual module – it's in the aggregate. The principal doesn't show up in any static analysis tool, and the interest manifests as slower onboarding, more bugs from unexpected interactions, and a growing sense among senior engineers that \"nobody really knows how this system works anymore.\"\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth that most engineers don't want to hear:\n\nTechnical debt is often a management and incentive problem, not a technical one.\n\nConway's Law states that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures8. The implication for technical debt is profound: organizational friction becomes architectural friction becomes technical debt.\n\nIf teams A and B can't communicate efficiently, the interface between their services will accrue debt – duplicated logic, mismatched assumptions, undocumented contracts. The debt isn't caused by poor engineering. It's caused by poor organizational design. And no amount of refactoring will fix it, because the structure that created the debt will recreate it.\n\nThe Inverse Conway Maneuver – deliberately restructuring teams to match the desired architecture – is the only way to address this class of debt. It's also politically difficult, which is why this debt tends to persist.\n\nTechnical debt grows fastest in organizations with these incentive patterns:\n\nTech debt grows fastest where engineers feel powerless to address it. If your process doesn't allocate time for debt service, debt will accumulate. This is not a technical problem. It's a governance problem.\n\nThe most pernicious version of this: organizations that say they value quality but measure only velocity. Engineers quickly learn which metric actually matters, and they optimize accordingly.\n\nLet's pull everything together into a practical framework.\n\nYou can't manage what you can't see. Build a simple inventory:\n\nDon't over-engineer this. A spreadsheet or a markdown file (or org-mode file if you're cool like me 🤪) in the repo is fine. The point is visibility, not process.\n\nSort your inventory by interest rate, not by principal. The debt that every team interacts with daily costs more than the debt that one team encounters quarterly, even if the quarterly debt has a higher remediation cost.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt Priority Score} = \\text{Interest Rate} \\times \\text{Number of Affected Teams} \\times \\text{Interaction Frequency}\n\\]\n\nThis isn't meant to be precise – it's meant to force the right conversation.\n\nDecide on a fixed percentage of engineering capacity for debt service. This should be:\n\nIn practice, I've seen this work best when the allocation is protected at the team level, not the org level. Telling 50 teams \"the org is allocating 20% to debt\" is meaningless. Telling each team \"20% of your sprints go to debt service, and here's how we'll track the impact\" creates accountability.\n\nFor each debt paydown initiative, define:\n\nTrack these before and after. This builds the institutional evidence base for continued debt service investment.\n\nHere's a concrete example: suppose you're refactoring the authentication module. Before starting, measure: average PR size for auth-touching features (say, 15 files), average time from \"code complete\" to \"merged\" (say, 4 days), and staging failure rate for auth changes (say, 25%). Set targets: reduce PR size to <8 files, merge time to <2 days, staging failures to <10%. After two sprints of focused refactoring, measure again. If the metrics moved, you have evidence. If they didn't, you're either fixing the wrong thing or the refactor isn't done yet.\n\nPaydown without prevention is a treadmill. Implement:\n\nLet me end with the thesis I promised at the start:\n\nYou don't eliminate technical debt. You structure it.\n\nEvery financial system carries debt. Healthy companies have mortgages, lines of credit, and corporate bonds. The difference between a healthy company and a bankrupt one isn't the presence of debt – it's the management of it. Healthy companies know their debt-to-equity ratio, their interest obligations, and their capacity to service existing debt before taking on more.\n\nThe same is true for codebases.\n\nA healthy codebase has known, documented debt with managed interest rates, owned by specific teams, prioritized by business impact, and systematically paid down. An unhealthy codebase has the same amount of debt but nobody can tell you what it is, how much it costs, or who's responsible.\n\nEvery system carries debt. The question is who pays, when, and how predictably.\n\nThe financial analogy isn't perfect. No analogy is. But it gives us a vocabulary – principal, interest, refinancing, credit rating – that makes the invisible visible and the abstract concrete. It transforms \"we have a lot of tech debt\" from a vague complaint into a specific, actionable diagnosis: what is the debt, what is the interest rate, and what is our plan for servicing it?\n\nStart there. The rest follows.\n\nCunningham's original insight was that shipping code creates a gap between what you've built and what you now understand. Thirty-four years later, the insight holds – but the gap has widened. We ship faster, understand later, and compound the difference daily. The metaphor he gave us is still the best tool we have for closing it. Use it precisely, and it will serve you well.\n\nThis post reclaims Ward Cunningham's original financial metaphor for technical debt and extends it into a comprehensive framework for managing code quality at any organizational scale.\n\nThe core argument begins with a precise definition: technical debt is a deliberate or accidental deviation from an optimal design that yields short-term value at the cost of increased future work. Critically, not everything that frustrates engineers is debt—bugs are liabilities, legacy systems are only debt if they impede change, and \"bad code\" is a style preference unless it causes measurable drag.\n\nThe post maps technical concepts to financial instruments with precision: principal is remediation cost, interest is ongoing friction, and the interest rate is interaction frequency multiplied by system friction. This leads to a taxonomy of debt types—low-interest long-term debt (like a mortgage), high-interest revolving debt (like credit cards), variable-rate debt whose costs spike under changing conditions, and dangerous hidden debt that lurks off the balance sheet.\n\nMartin Fowler's quadrant classifies debt by whether it was deliberate or inadvertent, prudent or reckless—each requiring different responses. The post argues that debt is often rational, especially for startups validating product-market fit or teams exploring uncertain requirements.\n\nThe central thesis emerges in the section on interest: the real danger isn't the debt itself but the compounding interest. The post provides practical signals for measuring interest—change amplification, time-to-confidence, fear factor, and rework rate—and illustrates how a 10% velocity tax can become 50% in 18 months through compound effects that Lehman's Laws predict are inevitable without deliberate countermeasures.\n\nManagement strategies vary by company stage: startups should accept higher interest rates while avoiding irreversible debt, growth-stage companies must allocate 15-25% of capacity to debt service, and enterprises need platform teams functioning as internal lenders with enforced contracts at system boundaries.\n\nThe post reframes refactoring as refinancing rather than cleanup—replacing one debt instrument with another that has better terms—and distinguishes good refinancing (incremental, measurable) from bad (big-bang rewrites, cosmetic changes).\n\nA timely section addresses AI-generated code as a new debt accelerator, introducing the concept of \"comprehension debt\"—the gap between codebase size and any engineer's ability to maintain a working mental model. The data shows AI tools have increased code production while reducing refactoring activity, creating a dangerous imbalance.\n\nOrganizational factors often matter more than technical ones: Conway's Law means organizational friction becomes architectural friction becomes debt, while incentive misalignment (rewarding only shipping, no ownership past delivery) accelerates accumulation.\n\nThe post concludes with a five-step framework: inventory your debt, prioritize by interest rate rather than principal, allocate fixed non-negotiable capacity for debt service, execute with measurable targets, and prevent new high-interest debt through ADRs and architecture tests. The final message: you don't eliminate technical debt, you structure it—just as healthy companies carry managed debt with known obligations and clear ownership.\n\nWard Cunningham first described the debt metaphor in his 1992 OOPSLA experience report, \"The WyCash Portfolio Management System.\" He later clarified in a 2009 video that the metaphor was specifically about the gap between the team's evolving understanding and the code's current design – not about deliberately writing poor code.\n\nMartin Fowler's Technical Debt Quadrant (2009) built on Cunningham's original metaphor by distinguishing between deliberate/inadvertent and prudent/reckless debt. This taxonomy is now widely used in industry.\n\nGoogle's DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) program has tracked software delivery performance for over a decade. The 2024 State of DevOps report introduced rework rate as a fifth key metric and found mixed results from AI adoption: improved throughput but decreased stability. See: dora.dev.\n\nLehman's laws of software evolution were first proposed by Meir M. Lehman in 1974 and refined through the 1990s. The laws describe empirically observed properties of \"E-type\" systems (software that solves real-world problems). The key insight – that complexity increases unless explicitly counteracted – has been validated across decades of research. See: Wikipedia: Lehman's Laws.\n\nMcKinsey's 2023 report \"Breaking technical debt's vicious cycle to modernize your business\" found that technical debt consumes a significant share of IT budgets – CIOs surveyed reported that as much as 40% of their technology estate was composed of tech debt. Organizations with systematic debt management freed engineers to spend up to 50% more time on value-generating work. One CIO reported reducing the \"debt tax\" on engineer time from 75% to 25%.\n\nArchitecture Decision Records (ADRs) were popularized by Michael Nygard in a 2011 blog post. The format is simple: Context, Decision, Consequences. The key value is recording the context so future engineers understand why the decision was made, not just what it was.\n\nFor a deep dive on schema languages as an interface-level debt prevention strategy, see my companion post: The Schema Language Question: Avro, JSON Schema, Protobuf, and the Quest for a Single Source of Truth.\n\nConway's Law, introduced by Melvin Conway in 1967, states that \"organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.\" Research from MIT and Harvard Business School found \"strong evidence to support the mirroring hypothesis.\" See: Wikipedia: Conway's Law.\n\nThe Strangler Fig pattern was named by Martin Fowler in his 2004 blog post, inspired by the strangler fig trees he observed in Australia. The pattern involves building a new system around the edges of the old, gradually routing traffic from old to new, until the old system can be decommissioned.\n\nJoel Spolsky's \"Things You Should Never Do, Part I\" (2000) argues that full rewrites are \"the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make,\" citing Netscape's decision to rewrite their browser from scratch as a cautionary tale. The argument is that working code, however ugly, embodies years of accumulated knowledge about edge cases and failure modes that a rewrite will inevitably lose.\n\nGitClear's \"AI Copilot Code Quality: 2025 Data Suggests 4x Growth in Code Clones\" analyzed over 200 million lines of changed code to measure the impact of AI assistants on code quality metrics. The findings suggest that AI tools are accelerating code production while reducing refactoring activity, leading to increased duplication and higher churn rates.",

    "description": "Five months after being labeled a nuisance, Downtown Market at 11th and Grand remains open despite city orders and an eviction. From David Hudnall:",
    "fullText": "For a business that was supposed to be on the brink of closure, Downtown Market is doing a brisk trade.\n\nFive months after the city labeled it a nuisance and the landlord moved to evict, the lights are on at 1103 Grand. The beer coolers hum. The liquor selection remains vast. The counter display still includes synthetic urine kits for anyone looking to game a drug test. Step outside the market, and you won’t struggle to find a sidewalk entrepreneur selling some of the substances those tests are meant to detect.\n\n“We’re still seeing all the same activity, dealing with all the same problems,” said Jason Swords, one of the owners of The Grand, a high-rise a few doors down. “We still find bottles of alcohol all over the place on the sidewalks every morning. There are vagrants everywhere. We still see people hiding in the alleyways, peeing on the sidewalks.”\n\nIt has not been for want of effort from those with authority to intervene.\n\nIn September, Public Safety Director Lace Cline sent Downtown Market a cease and desist letter giving the store 10 days to correct conditions the city said enabled “unrelenting, open, and notorious drug activity and public intoxication.” The letter cited 184 calls for service over two years — 101 of them disturbances — and referenced a January 2025 shooting inside the store.\n\nTwo months later, the building’s owner took the matter to Jackson County court. The Alexander Company, which owns the 16-story Professional Building where Downtown Market occupies the ground floor, filed suit seeking to give Downtown Market the boot. The landlord says it sent a notice of default in October, gave the tenant time to address multiple violations, then terminated the lease when it concluded the problems continued. It has asked a judge for possession of the space and back rent while the case plays out.\n\nThe city and the landlord have the same gripe: The lease envisioned something more like a grocery store for on-the-go downtown dwellers and workers. The operation on the ground moves mostly booze and attracts loose characters that have turned the block into something resembling a skid row.\n\nShawn Choudry, part of the management team that owns Downtown Market, has a different version of the story: This is a city problem, not a Downtown Market problem.\n\n“Downtown Market didn’t get 184 calls for service,” Choudry told me back in the fall. “This area did. The problems come from outside our store, not inside.”\n\nChoudry said this week that he preferred to let his countersuit against The Alexander Company do the talking for now. That complaint, filed in January, says the market’s owners poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into renovating the space and that its mix of groceries, alcohol and tobacco was approved from the start. It argues that, contrary to the landlord’s allegations, alcohol makes up less than half of sales and that much of the activity cited by the city happens at the bus stop across the street. It accuses the landlord of using the city’s nuisance designation as leverage to push them out of a long-term lease.\n\nThis fight probably burns hotter because of where it sits. The corner of 11th and Grand is a few blocks from the Power & Light District and T-Mobile Center, adjacent to the city’s financial district, and next door to the Ambassador Hotel. It is a part of downtown that’s supposed to feel stable and safe, a stretch of street the city will be showing off to visitors with the World Cup on the horizon.\n\nSwords and his investors at The Grand have been saying for months that the disorder around their building is bleeding into their balance sheet. They’ve asked PIEA, the city’s Planned Industrial Expansion Authority, for additional tax relief, arguing that shootings, street activity and constant repairs have made their $69 million investment increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nPIEA hasn’t taken up that request yet; chair Tom Porto told me this week that he expects it to come before the board later this spring. I imagine Kansas City Public Schools and other taxing jurisdictions that would forgo revenue in such a deal are unlikely to shrug quietly at the prospect of extending further relief to a project already enjoying a substantial tax break.\n\nSwords said he has noticed a stronger police presence in recent months. He credits officers for spending more time on the block and the city for trying to take action against Downtown Market, even if the day-to-day street scene still looks familiar to him.\n\nOn my own drop-ins over the past few months, the store does appear to be on slightly better behavior. The supply of kratom products and other “gas station drugs” has been cleared out, and I’m not seeing loosies or airplane bottles moving across the counter.\n\nHis complaints are backed up by the call data regardless. I asked KCPD for calls to service to the address since the cease and desist went out in September. Between late August and mid-February, police logged 215 calls — including most commonly disturbances (69), followed by advice or non-emergency calls (56). At least 10 incidents involved weapons, and more than 40 required fire or EMS response.\n\nI asked Mayor Quinton Lucas Wednesday where the city stands on the matter, and got a statement heavy on legal phrasing. The plain-English version reads something like: The city intends to keep citing and pushing for compliance while the landlord-tenant case works its way through court, and it hasn’t ruled out shutting the place down if conditions don’t improve. It has made a similar move at least once in recent years, when it closed an illegal nightclub on Prospect Avenue after a shooting.\n\nBut it remains hard to know how much the issue involves Downtown Market customers versus people who would be on that corner regardless. Closing Downtown Market might remove one piece of the puzzle. But the corner sits at the intersection of much bigger problems in the city: chronic homelessness, addiction and a mismanaged KCPD budget that has started to make sustained community policing feel like a luxury. One padlock won’t solve all that.",

    "fullText": "Investigators examining last year’s deadly Air India Flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad have concluded the disaster was caused by the pilot in command deliberately moving both engine fuel control switches to cutoff, according to a report published Thursday.\n\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner lost thrust seconds after takeoff and crashed into a medical student hostel on June 12, 2025, killing 241 people on board and 19 on the ground. The report cites cockpit voice and flight data recordings that allegedly show manual shutdown of both engines despite no evidence of mechanical failure.\n\nBlack box data under review: The aircraft’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered days after the crash and sent for detailed analysis as part of the investigation led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with technical assistance from U.S. and U.K. authorities. The Boeing 787 was powered by twin engines and equipped with electronically controlled fuel systems that require intentional manual input to change fuel flow settings. Investigators have examined parameters including throttle position, engine core speed and fuel flow rates to determine the sequence of events in the seconds between liftoff and impact.\n\nMental health scrutiny surfaces: The report also claims that Captain Sumeet Sabharwal had experienced depression in the months before the crash, citing unnamed sources familiar with the inquiry. Sabharwal’s family has publicly rejected assertions about his mental health and called for a fresh and impartial investigation. Pilot associations in India previously objected to earlier reports suggesting pilot responsibility, urging authorities to avoid attributing blame before the final report is issued.\n\nTrending on NextShark: AI research boom draws scrutiny after single author claims 113 papers in one year\n\nLegal questions emerge: The crash has prompted scrutiny beyond the technical investigation, including reports that Air India has offered financial settlements to some victims’ families. According to separate media accounts, the offers allegedly included provisions limiting the ability to pursue legal action against the airline and the aircraft manufacturer. Air India has not publicly detailed the terms of any such agreements, and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has yet to release its final determination of cause.\n\nThis story is part of The Rebel Yellow Newsletter — a bold weekly newsletter from the creators of NextShark, reclaiming our stories and celebrating Asian American voices.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Minority psychologist coalition challenges Jewish ethnic recognition within APA\n\nSubscribe free to join the movement.

    "description": "Consumers should stop using the product immediately.",
    "fullText": "Freeze-dried food and treats have become a popular feeding option for both cats and dogs. The food provides a better delivery system for nutrients to your pets without the downsides of raw food, which can pose a salmonella risk.\n\nHowever, freeze-dried foods are not exempt from recalls. One popular cat food brand recently issued a voluntary recall for their freeze-dried chicken cat nuggets. It wasn't for bacterial contamination, though. This recall was due to a possible vitamin deficiency.\n\n🐶\nView the complete details on this recall at: https://t.co/E5Zy1sSKuI pic.twitter.com/pSb6bD7qW0\n\n— U.S. FDA Recalls (@FDArecalls) February 18, 2026\n\nIf your cat is eating the Quest Cat Food Chicken Recipe, you need to check your pantry. The voluntary recall affects one specific lot: C25288 with the UPC: 6-91730-18103-1 and a Best Buy Date of 10/15/2027. The zip-lock bags were sold in Colorado, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Michigan, California, Texas and Illinois. The affected batch may have low thiamine levels, also known as vitamin B1.\n\nThe recall of the freeze-dried nuggets was triggered after a cat owner reported illness in their cat. Thankfully, a veterinarian treated the cat, and it has recovered. So far, it is the only cat to have experienced adverse effects from the product.\n\nThe product was tested by the veterinarian who treated the ill cat, and the test indicated that the lot did not meet the required thiamine levels to support a cat's diet. Quest conducted further testing to verify that the lot may have low thiamine levels. Quest's parent company, Go Raw LLC, has already taken measures to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\n\nThiamine is considered an essential nutrient for cats. According to a 2017 study, the water-soluble vitamin helps animals process carbohydrates, synthesize nucleotides, and maintain normal nervous system function. Since they can't produce the vitamin on their own, they need to consume at least 0.33 to 0.35 milligrams per day to maintain healthy levels.\n\nWhile deficiencies can be reversed if caught early enough, they can lead to severe medical issues. According to the FDA's press release, cats' nervous systems and stomachs can be affected. \"Early signs of thiamine deficiency may include decreased appetite, salivation, vomiting, failure to grow, and weight loss,\" the release said. \"In advanced cases, neurological signs may develop, including ventroflexion (bending towards the floor) of the neck, mental dullness, vision changes, wobbly walking, circling, falling, and seizures.\"\n\nIf not treated in time, cats can also become so ill that they die from their symptoms. Go Raw LLC has said that consumers should immediately stop using the product and return it to the store where it was purchased for a full refund. If you have any questions, you can email the company at cs@gorawllc.com or call them at (801) 432-7478, Monday through Friday, 9 am to 4 p.m. MST.",

    "fullText": "The car market can often defy logic. As we are aware, buying used saves money in general, as new cars lose a potential 30% of their value within two years. Yet, this isn't always the case: some used models often sell for above the MSRP of their newer rivals.\n\nIt doesn't make sense, but there are reasons for this. For instance, inventory may have been disrupted by market events, such as the 2022 semiconductor shortage. Moreover, when demand outstrips supply, certain vehicles become more desirable, which only drives wider interest.\n\nWhich cars make the grade for this unique selection? Using the latest iSeeCars listings data, among other sources, we have compiled this fleet of stalwarts. As you can probably guess, Toyota is quite the overperformer.\n\nIf you're looking for a new car to get you from point A to B and back, these might be worth considering.\n\nThe Ford Maverick boasts a hybrid powertrain option that can deliver strong fuel economy and a modest tow rating that still handles everyday tasks. As a selling point, it is one of the few pickups appealing broadly from daily commute to weekend jobs. This used car has an astonishingly high price difference over a new model: around 12.3% and an average $4,038 increase.\n\nMoreover, its smaller footprint makes city parking easier, and standard features like smartphone integration and a comfortable cabin extend its value on the used market. It is clearly a very popular used car choice. According to Drew Dorian at Car and Driver, the Maverick is \"a simple, honest truck with enough capability for casual truck drivers who don't need something the size of an F-150.\"\n\nToyota's Corolla Hybrid has quietly become one of the most efficient compact sedans/SUV alternatives on the road. Of course, it is just one reason why used examples can fetch prices well above their new counterparts in recent listings.\n\nIn its 2026 review, Car and Driver observed that the Corolla Hybrid can deliver fuel economy into the 50+ mpg range. Such an irresistible economy makes it stand out among compact vehicles, where efficiency and cost rule the roost. That blend of everyday thrift and strong reliability has translated into strong demand for lightly used units. It goes without saying that Toyota's hybrid technology has decades of consistent performance under its belt, which translates to trust in the used market.\n\nLike its Japanese rival, Toyota, Mercedes has already convinced us how much we can trust them. The company's reputation for durability means buying used comes with few doubts. The Mercedes-Benz G-Class is no exception and arguably the premier example of a luxury SUV whose used pricing often exceeds new MSRP on dealership listings.\n\nThis outcome is particularly true for low-mileage AMG variants. The G-Class blends classic design with formidable off-road capability and premium amenities that appeal to enthusiasts and luxury buyers alike. According to Edmunds' appraisal data, a 2024/2025 G-Class can still command dealer retail values well into the high five figures and beyond.\n\nMinivans usually depreciate faster than SUVs, so the Toyota Sienna is in a league of its own, and not just for this unique trait. For starters, it's one of the few modern minivans that never got replaced by SUVs, instead evolving into a hybrid-only platform that's both fuel-thrifty and family-friendly.\n\nThat reputation for practicality, combined with strong reliability, has led to very tight used-car inventories, keeping prices close to or above new MSRP in many markets.\n\nIn its 2025 coverage, MotorTrend's Bob Hernandez called the Sienna \"one of the most enduring people movers in North America,\" noting its efficient hybrid powertrain, generous interior space, and thoughtful tech upgrades, including larger infotainment screens and refined connectivity features.\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 Prime is the plug-in hybrid version of America's perennial SUV bestseller. This trusty little SUV is one of the models that still shows used pricing above new MSRP in the latest iSeeCars research. It's a reflection of the RAV4 Prime's demand among buyers who want both electric range and SUV utility.\n\nDrew Hardesty of the YouTube channel Car Confections cites the 2024 Prime as his all-around favorite SUV. He says it \"builds upon the already excellent formula of the Rav 4 hybrid and gives you that pure electric range and more performance without compromising really anything.\" The video estimates that a used 2024 RAV4 Prime retains a nice 65% of its resale value after five years, which is why these SUVs are hard to find.\n\nWhile often underrated against bigger siblings, the Toyota Corolla Cross has quietly boomed in popularity. The TCC is a small SUV with a big following and a solid performer in a small package, much like Prince before he departed the stage for good.\n\nIt has held its own so well that used prices have edged above new MSRP in national iSeeCars listings. Built on Toyota's reliable foundation, the Corolla Cross delivers comfortable seating, good visibility, and efficient performance: traits that buyers prize in a small SUV. There is a clear Toyota-shaped pattern emerging here.\n\nOfficially, Toyota's RAV4 is America's favorite SUV, according to AutoBlog's Jacob Oliva. It means that demand is at an all-time high, and inventory is tight. Added to this fact, RAV4s will go hybrid, pushing used demand even further.\n\nNot all used RAV4 Hybrid pricing comes from electrified variants: the standard RAV4 Hybrid also appears above new MSRP in some used listings. Owners can appreciate its smooth ride quality, good fuel economy, and adaptability from suburban roads to light off-road trails: a balance that can appeal to many buyers.\n\nWhile Japan's Toyota is unmatched for long-term auto investment, South Korea is never far behind. Kia's success has been palpable over the past two decades in the USA, and the Carnival's utilitarian design makes it one of the more popular models. With minivans less common than SUVs, buyers seeking maximum space without jumping to larger three-row SUVs have helped keep Carnival prices firm. Furthermore, it has the handling, feature content, and usability rather than sheer economy to promote resilience.\n\nJerry Seiner of Kia South Jordan in Utah reminds us why they are so popular. \"Kia vehicles are built to last, with high-quality materials and engineering designed for longevity,\" he writes. \"This focus on durability means that even older Kia models can perform well and maintain their aesthetic appeal over time.\"\n\nThis off-road icon with huge cult appeal has seen a revival this decade, making it one of Ford's recent success stories. Built on a rugged ladder frame, the Bronco offers multiple trim levels, powerful turbocharged engines, and authentic off-road capability with selectable drive modes designed to conquer terrain from sand to mud.\n\nFor an idea of which models will retain value best, perhaps this Everything Bronco Aftermarket review will enlighten. \"Models such as the Bronco Raptor with the top-spec V6 and the limited edition Ford Bronco Heritage Edition are likely to retain value the best,\" it reads.\n\nIf there's one vehicle that has turned depreciation into something of a practical joke, it's the Toyota Tacoma. This iconic midsize pickup has become America's go-to for reliability and longevity, rugged enough for weekend hauling but compact enough for daily use.\n\nThat reputation for durability and desirability means light-mileage used Tacomas are sometimes priced as high as or higher than new ones: a rare exception to the usual depreciation curve.\n\nKelley Blue Book's (KBB's) \"Best Resale Value Awards\" make clear that the 2025 Toyota Tacoma has a strong 64% resale value. This credential makes it highly in demand across the used car markets.",

    "description": "The court action brings an end to three years of negotiating by eight men, including Freeburg’s mayor.",
    "fullText": "Former Major League Baseball player Danny Cox and three other men have entered plea agreements on hunting citations issued three years ago on his property in rural Freeburg.\n\nThis brings an end to cases against eight men, including Freeburg Mayor Seth Speiser, in St. Clair County Circuit Court. Illinois Conservation Police had issued them a total of 29 citations and 22 written warnings after a monthlong investigation.\n\nThis week, Cox pleaded guilty to two of six alleged violations, according to court records. They include falsifying harvest records by using an archery permit issued to someone else, a Class A misdemeanor; and taking a 10-point buck with aid of bait, a Class B misdemeanor.\n\nAssociate Judge Maurche’ Belk fined Cox $700. She dismissed cases related to four other citations for allegedly placing bait for deer, firearm deer hunting with aid of bait, taking an 8-point buck with aid of bait and failing to wear blaze orange while hunting.\n\n“It was a prosecution that led to an outcome of guilt on the charges,” said Chris Allen, spokesman for State’s Attorney James Gomric’s office, which negotiated the plea agreements.\n\nConservation police, formerly known as game wardens, are part of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. IDNR representatives declined to comment for this story.\n\nUnder an agency point system, Cox’s convictions on the two violations would result in 22 points against his hunting license and lead to a 22-month suspension of privileges.\n\nCox, 66, formerly pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays, and managed the Gateway Grizzlies. He didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nCox’s two sons, Kamdan and Kyle, and a fourth hunter, Steve Pate, entered similar plea agreements this week. All were represented by former State’s Attorney John Baricevic.\n\nSpeiser, 61, owns property next to 300 mostly wooded acres owned by the Cox family. The mayor, his son and another man entered plea agreements last month in St. Clair County Circuit Court.\n\nSpeiser pleaded guilty to placing bait for deer. Associate Judge L. Dominic Kujawa fined him $400, placed him on 12-month court supervision and dismissed cases related to three other citations for alleged taking of a white-tailed deer with aid of bait and firearm deer hunting with aid of bait.\n\nAll four charges against Speiser were Class B misdemeanors. Under Illinois law, each carried a maximum penalty of up to six months in jail and/or a fine of up to $1,500.\n\nIf Speiser completes supervision and isn’t cited for additional hunting violations in the next year, the first charge also will be dismissed, according to Allen. However, that won’t eliminate his penalties. The nine points against his hunting license don’t reach the 13-point threshold for suspension.\n\nHere are the results of the other plea agreements:\n\nKamdan Cox, 30, of Clarksville, Tennessee, pleaded guilty to one violation involving turkey hunting. He was fined $800. Belk dismissed cases related to six other citations.\n\nKyle Cox, 35, of Belleville, pleaded guilty to using a hunting license issued to someone else. He was fined $500. Belk dismissed cases related to two other citations.\n\nSteve Pate, 65, of Marietta, Georgia, pleaded guilty to archery deer hunting without a valid permit and unlawful taking of a 7-point buck. He was fined $600. Belk dismissed cases related to two other citations.\n\nMitchell Speiser, 28, of Freeburg, pleaded guilty to taking a protected species (white-tailed deer). He was fined $400 and placed on 12-month supervision. Kujawa dismissed a case related to one other citation.\n\nBrian Forrester, 38, of New Athens, pleaded guilty to firearm deer-hunting with aid of bait. He was fined $300 and placed on 12-month supervision. Kujawa dismissed a case related to one other citation.\n\nAn eighth hunter, Barry Northerner, 66, of Roswell, Georgia, pleaded guilty early on and paid a fine for failing to wear blaze orange instead of negotiating for a plea agreement.\n\nIllinois Conservation Police conducted the investigation in the fall of 2022. Incident reports show that officers did site reconnaissance by day and night and used an Illinois State Police plane for aerial surveillance.\n\nOfficers issued 21 citations and 12 written warnings to the Cox hunting party. They alleged in reports that:\n\nDanny Cox used a firearm permit issued to his wife, Nancy, who doesn’t hunt, to harvest a doe.\n\nKamdan Cox used Nancy’s archery permit to harvest a 5-point buck.\n\nKyle Cox harvested deer using free landowner permits, despite not living on the property.\n\nOthers in the party used permits obtained in the name of Danny and Nancy Cox’s daughter, Kayleigh, who doesn’t hunt.\n\nOfficers observed trail cameras on nine deer stands or blinds baited with corn, molasses and mineral salt.\n\nDanny Cox told them that he’s a “conservationist” who feeds deer year-round to ensure they have enough to eat.\n\nDeer baiting is illegal in Illinois due to ethical or “fair-chase” standards and the risk of disease spread from congregated feeding, according to IDNR, although more than 20 states allow it.",

    "fullText": "All truckers and bus drivers will have to take their commercial driver’s license tests in English as the Trump administration expands its aggressive campaign to improve safety in the industry and get unqualified drivers off the road.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the latest effort Friday to ensure that drivers meet the federal requirements to understand English well enough to read road signs and communicate with law enforcement officers. Florida already started administering its tests in English.\n\nCurrently, many states allow drivers to take their license tests in other languages even though they are required to demonstrate English proficiency. California offered tests in 20 other languages. Duffy said that a number of states have hired other companies to administer commercial driver's licenses tests, and those companies aren't enforcing the standards that drivers are supposed to meet to demonstrate their driving and English skills.\n\nThese latest enforcement efforts come just days after the Transportation Department said 557 driving schools should close because they failed to meet basic safety standards. The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants who shouldn’t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August.\n\nA truck driver who Duffy says wasn’t authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Other fatal crashes since then, including one in Indiana that killed four members of an Amish community earlier this month, have only heightened concerns.\n\nStates are expected to ensure drivers can speak English before giving them a commercial license, and then law enforcement is supposed to check driver's language skills during any traffic stops or inspections. Drivers who can't communicate effectively are supposed to be pulled off the road. A recent federal effort involving 8,215 inspections led to nearly 500 drivers being disqualified because of their English skills. California initially resisted enforcing the English rules, but the state recently pulled more than 600 drivers off the highways.\n\nDuffy said every American wants drivers who get behind the wheel of a big rig to be well-qualified to handle those vehicles. But he said that for too long the problems in the trucking industry were “allowed to rot and no one's paying attention to it for decades.\"\n\n“Once you start to pay attention, you see that all these bad things have been happening. And the consequence of that is that Americans get hurt,” Duffy said. “When we get on the road, we should expect that we should be safe. And that those who drive those 80,000-pound big rigs, that they are well-trained, they’re well-qualified, and they’re going to be safe.”\n\nThe campaign will also now expand to prevent fraudulent trucking companies from getting into the business while continuing to go after questionable schools and ensure states are complying with all the regulations for handing out commercial licenses.\n\nDuffy said that the registration system and requirements for trucking companies will be strengthened while Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspectors conduct more spot checks of trucks and commercial driver’s license schools.\n\nOfficials are also trying to make sure that the electronic logging devices drivers use are accurate, and that states are following all the regulations to ensure drivers are qualified to get commercial licenses.\n\nCurrently, companies only have to pay $300 and show proof of insurance to get registered to operate, and then they might not be audited until a year or more later. And even then the audits might be done virtually, which makes it less likely to identify fraudulent companies.\n\nThat has made it easy for fraudulent companies that are known in the industry as “chameleon carriers” to register multiple times under different names and then simply switch names and registration numbers to avoid any consequences after crashes or other violations.\n\nDan Horvath, who is the chief operating officer for the American Trucking Associations trade group, said this longstanding problem has made it far too easy for companies that have been ordered to shut down to just change their name and registration number and keep operating the same way.\n\n“What we think at ATA has happened over the years is that we have a lack of true enforcement and intervention with motor carriers that are in operation,” Horvath said. Only a small fraction of trucking companies ever undergo a full compliance review with an in-person inspection, he said.\n\nAfter that Indiana crash, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration knocked the company that employed the driver out of service and pulled the DOT numbers assigned to two other companies that were linked to AJ Partners. Tutash Express and Sam Express in the Chicago area were also disqualified, and the Aydana driving school that the trucker involved in the crash attended lost its certification.\n\nImmigration authorities arrested that driver because they said the 30-year-old from Kyrgyzstan entered the country illegally. Authorities say he pulled out and tried to go around a truck that had slowed in front of him, and his truck slammed into an oncoming van.\n\nIn December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration took action to decertify up to 7,500 of the 16,000 schools nationwide, but that included many defunct operations.\n\nDuffy said the companies involved in that Indiana crash were all registered at the same apartment. In other cases, there might be hundreds of these chameleon companies registered at a single address.",

    "fullText": "In a scene that feels ripped from a procedural drama, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Scott Thomas Deiseroth, 42, was pulled off a Florida Keys highway in August 2025 after deputies say he was driving erratically on the Seven Mile Bridge with his two young sons in the truck — and body-camera footage reveals a confrontation that spiraled from a simple DUI stop into a forceful arrest and a viral controversy.\n\nDeputies from the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched around 3:24 p.m. on August 13 after multiple calls reported a pickup weaving between lanes, crossing into oncoming traffic, and nearly causing collisions on U.S. Highway 1 near Bahia Honda.\n\nWhen deputies caught up to the truck near Mile Marker 36.5, they immediately noticed a strong smell of alcohol and two children, ages 7 and 9, in the back seat.\n\nThe encounter was already tense from the first words captured on bodycam. Deiseroth identified himself as an ICE agent based in Miami, insisting he was trying to get home with his boys and that his federal status mattered in how the deputies should treat him. When asked for his Department of Homeland Security credentials, he didn’t have them on hand.\n\nThings escalated when deputies asked him to perform standardized field sobriety exercises. In the footage, Deiseroth repeatedly challenges the stop, asking “Are you Haitian?” about one of the deputies — a moment that has since become the focal point of national attention on race, privilege, and bias.\n\nDeputies insist that nationality has no bearing on the stop being conducted, but Deiseroth presses the question several times, appearing to imply that the deputy’s background should influence how the situation is handled.\n\nThe video shows Deiseroth struggling with basic coordination tasks like walking in a straight line and reciting numbers. At one point he flails and stumbles, prompting deputies to question how much he has been drinking.\n\nHe claims “about four drinks,” but cannot clearly describe what he drank, and his speech and motor skills appear impaired.\n\nWhen deputies move to place him under arrest for DUI and child endangerment — a charge bolstered by the presence of his children in the vehicle — Deiseroth resists, at times refusing to step toward the patrol car and shouting at them.\n\nHe expresses fear of losing custody of his kids, saying he is in the middle of a divorce, and continues to rail against the officers even while being handcuffed.\n\nAfter the arrest, his children were handed over to their mother, and the Florida Department of Children and Families was notified, as required in cases involving potential child endangerment. Deiseroth was booked into the Monroe County Jail on misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence and resisting without violence.\n\nThe case drew national headlines not just for the surreal body-cam footage, but for the questions it raised about accountability and privilege when a federal law enforcement officer becomes the suspect.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE reportedly said that all employees are held to the agency’s highest standards, and that the matter would be addressed appropriately after investigation. At the time the footage was released, Deiseroth remained on administrative leave pending the outcome of that review.\n\nIn late 2025, Deiseroth pleaded no contest to the DUI charge. On October 30, he was sentenced to one year of probation and had his driver’s license revoked for the same period.\n\nProsecutors declined to pursue child neglect and resisting arrest charges. That decision elicited sharp criticism from some legal observers and social commentators. But that’s not all.\n\nMeanwhile, the body-cam clip continues to circulate widely, igniting debate about how law enforcement is held to account and becoming another chapter in broader discussions about ICE conduct, racial profiling, and public trust in policing agencies.\n\nEditorial Note: Video playback may be limited or restricted on certain platforms.

    "fullText": "The Gender Liberation Movement’s Raquel Willis says trans youth “are our future” and that new HHS rules amount to a national ban on gender-affirming care for young people.\n\nRather than do something, anything, about the abysmal state of healthcare in the United States, the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services has doubled down on its attacks against trans youth, their families, and the web of providers who work to ensure young people can live comfortably and fully in their truths. Of course it’s not just HHS. Last summer, the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court ruled that it isn’t discriminatory to discriminate against trans youth. But HHS has the ability to take that bigoted opinion even further by barring institutions from providing gender-affirming care as a condition of their participation in Medicare and Medicaid. The same condition would apply to Children’s Health Insurance Program funding. In other words, these proposed rules would affect nearly all, if not all, hospitals.\n\nYet there hasn’t been much coverage about them. In this dizzying era of “flood the zone” tactics, our basic freedoms are pitted against one another. We deserve more, and young people certainly deserve better.\n\nLed by the Gender Liberation Movement, 50 parents and activists, including members of ACT UP NY and ACT UP Pittsburgh, protested outside of Health and Human Services headquarters on Tuesday, on the final day of the public comment period of the rules, to make it known that “trans youth are no debate.” Organizers held a sign that read, “HANDS OFF OUR ’MONES,” while blockading the entrance of HHS, before 25 people were taken into custody, first by Department of Homeland Security agents before being handed over to the Metropolitan Police Department. The parents and activists were held for 12 hours, and some were denied food and phone calls or experienced mistreatment because of their race or gender identity, Raquel Willis, cofounder of the Gender Liberation Movement, told The Nation. The group, which organized the inaugural Gender Liberation March in 2024, works “to build power for gender liberation in culture, organizing, and policy.”\n\nIn an email interview, Willis, who was one of the organizers at the protest who was arrested, discussed why this fight over gender-affirming care is a fight for the future and what people can do to champion trans youth.\n\nRegina Mahone: Why was it important to Gender Liberation Movement to block the entrance to the HHS building?\n\nRaquel Willis: This is a critical time in the fight against tyranny and fascism, and it was necessary for us to express our public comment to Trump, RFK Jr, and their HHS that we won’t allow these cuts to care to go unopposed. With so many fights happening at once, the attacks on trans youth, their families, and affirming, qualified service providers are largely being ignored. We saw this last summer when the Supreme Court effectively greenlit state bans on gender-affirming care with its ruling in US v. Skrmetti—and there was minimal media and movement response.\n\nWe hope that, sooner rather than later, our movement will wake up and bring back some of that energy it had during marriage equality to fight for the next generation of trans, nonbinary, queer, and intersex youth. We owe it to them.\n\nRM: Can you talk about the experiences of the protesters, yourself included, who were then held in custody for some 12 hours?\n\nRW: Over those 12 hours, the arrested protesters were held in custody of the Department of Homeland Security and the Metropolitan Police Department. We spent hours having our paperwork and processing delayed by inept officers from the former agency without clarity on when we would be released or with what we would be officially charged.\n\nSome protesters were denied food and calls to their emergency contacts and legal advisers. A few of us experienced discriminatory practices like what seemed like racial profiling due to darker skin. Additionally, some transgender and nonbinary protesters were misgendered, denied housing based on their actual gender even when their ID documents aligned, and forced into solitary confinement.\n\nRM: People don’t often consider the right to protest as an issue of bodily autonomy, but the fact of these arrests and the experiences you described while in custody make that undeniable. This administration has proven it will use force not only over how we are living in our bodies but also how we defend our rights to agency and autonomy. Why was it important to you to put your body on the line, once again, particularly in this era of ramped up state violence?\n\nRW: Just as our ancestors and elders in liberation movements before us fought for dignity and full lives, the Gender Liberation Movement believes we must do the same now. Since the start of this current Trump era, we have leaned into radical defiance, understanding that we can’t simply comply, otherwise there will be no stopping at the rights that are pried out of our hands. As well, young people are so thoroughly spoken over in our society and we wanted to send a message that we see them and we are committed to protecting and defending them. So much of this care that is being stolen from trans youth is still accessible to cisgender youth, and that is utterly immoral.\n\nRM: You’ve spoken and written about how “our liberation is bound together.” Can you talk more about how this issue of trans care isn’t solely an issue for trans youth and their families but an issue that affects all of us?\n\nRW: For too long the narrative has been that trans people are isolated and alone, but the truth is we have always had vibrant, loving communities and families around us. Trans youth give us the clearest example of this. When their care is cut off, whole entire families are disturbed, as well as the network of adults from providers to educators who affirm them.\n\nWe know that the current administration’s actions to cut off care for trans youth won’t stop there. The ages on the bans keep creeping up and it won’t be long until we see more cuts for access to care for trans adults as well. This administration wants to take more and more away from people on the margins, whether you’re trying to afford insulin or mental health medications or simply rely on Medicaid and Medicare to live the full, healthy life you deserve.\n\nRM: How can people help to minimize the harm being done right now and be a shield for trans youth in their communities who would be harmed by these rules seeking to eliminate most trans youth care in the country?\n\nRW: We must continue to raise our voices against these attacks and all anti-trans legislation. We must urge progressive and empathetic lawmakers to champion trans youth, the adults who love and support them, and all of our rights. We must educate our neighbors on why voting for these measures would be against their own interest. We must pour resources into and donate to organizations who are supporting groups on the frontlines from Gender Liberation Movement to our friends with the Trans Youth Emergency Project and Elevated Access. We must, above all, continue to build a culture that affirms and supports trans youth and their truths. They are our future and we better start acting like it.",

    "fullText": "MILAN — Polish skater Kamila Sellier suffered a serious injury in the sixth quarterfinal of Friday night’s 1500m short-track speedskate and was taken from Assago Ice Skating Arena to a nearby hospital. Polish officials indicated that she was in good spirits, even raising a thumbs-up as she left the arena.\n\nLate in the quarterfinal, Sellier appeared to lose her footing and slipped, colliding with the United States’ Kristen Santos-Griswold. In the ensuing accident, Santos-Griswold’s skate caught Sellier on the face. Sellier slid into the protective retaining wall, and medical crews raised a sheet around her to protect the scene from the audience. She was stretchered from the ice.\n\nMasakra ....\nFatalnie wyglądał wypadek Kamili Sellier podczas rywalizacji w short tracku na igrzyskach olimpijskich.

Other reports indicated that Sellier had potentially fractured a cheekbone and suffered severe swelling.\n\n“We are waiting for what the hospital tests will show,” Niedźwiedzki said, via translation.\n\nOne of Sellier’s teammates, Natalia Maliszewska, appeared visibly shaken as she spoke with reporters. “My thoughts are with her,” Maliszewska said in Polish. “I can’t think of anything else.”\n\n“These aren't common accidents, but they do happen,” Sellier’s teammate Gabriela Topolska said in Polish. “Kamila already has one of them, from a skate on her face. Kamila has a cut in her skin, with stitches.”\n\nSellier has won several European speed-skating medals, most recently a silver medal in the 2000m mixed relay at the European short track speed skating championships in January.\n\nSantos-Griswold was disqualified from the race, potentially because of an illegal pass that led to the accident. She declined to speak to media after the race, which continued after the injury timeout.",

    "description": "Versions of the alleged phone call shared online were scant on details about when the conversation supposedly took place.",
    "fullText": "In late February 2026, Snopes readers asked us about videos of internet users listening to an unidentified voice reading out a purported transcript of a phone call between two Republican politicians, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell and former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy.\n\nIn the call, McConnell and McCarthy allegedly discussed bringing back slavery, creating state-funded religious schools, banning abortion, stemming immigration and the forced impregnation of eighth-graders.\n\nWe found no credible evidence that the transcript was authentic or that any such conversation between McConnell and McCarthy ever took place. The claim is unfounded.\n\nIn February 2026, social media users wrote to Snopes on Instagram, asking about videos of internet users listening to an audio clip (archived) of an alleged transcript of a phone call between Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The transcript was supposedly a record of the two men discussing measures to ban abortion, stem immigration, create state-funded religious schools, bring back slavery and impregnate eighth graders.\n\nOne of the Instagram users who posted a video of themselves listening to the transcript wrote in text superimposed over the clip, \"Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy talk about bringing slavery back & and making it mandatory for 8th graders to get pregnant in order to graduate.\"\n\nThe claim also circulated on X (archived), Facebook (archived), Bluesky (archived) and Reddit (archived).\n\nWe found no evidence whatsoever that the audio clip or transcript represented an authentic conversation between McConnell and McCarthy.\n\nWe found no reputable news sources reporting the \"leaked\" transcript (archived, archived, archived, archived), which would have been extremely newsworthy if true. Though McConnell and McCarthy both previously voted against federal protections for abortion, a common opinion for their party, neither had publicly expressed opinions or plans that aligned with the other supposed policy points like slavery and state-funded religious education allegedly discussed on the call.\n\nWe reached out to representatives for McConnell and McCarthy to ask if the transcript read out in the videos was genuine and await replies to our queries.\n\nThe full transcript of the alleged phone call, which an unidentified voice read out, was as follows:\n\nMitch: We have to bring slavery back. Those were the good old days.\n\nKevin: How will we do that, there's no way we can do that.\n\nMitch: Black people won't do it but white people will.\n\nKevin: How will we get white people to be slaves? That sounds ridiculous.\n\nMitch: We have to get rid of the separation of church and state. We must have state-funded religious schools.\n\nKevin: I don't see where you're getting at.\n\nMitch: Those schools will have work programs for fourth through eighth graders.\n\nKevin: Ah, I think I see where you're going here. How is that going to work?\n\nMitch: We get the kids to be — to pick all the produce as a part of their work program to teach them the values of good, old-fashioned blue-collar labor and the bounty of God.\n\nKevin: I don't think that anyone will go for that.\n\nMitch: It's all about grooming, start in the first grade and by fourth grade they'll be ready to do it.\n\nKevin: But we already have people to pick the produce.\n\nMitch: We have to finish the wall.\n\nKevin: No way that's going to happen.\n\nMitch: We find better ways to get the immigrants out of the United States.\n\nKevin: This will be too busy, too hard and we'll be too busy trying to sustain this over long periods of time and generations.\n\nMitch: No, we get rid of the abortion laws in the United States and we make it mandatory that all eighth-grade females be impregnated in order to graduate.\n\nKevin: Oh, like replacing the crops. Ha ha ha. Pun intended.\n\nAlso Kevin: I will work on getting the abortion ban, you work on state-funded religious schools.\n\nMitch: We don't have to do either. Lindsey and I took care of that with the new SCOTUS.\n\n\"Lindsey\" was an apparent reference to Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina and a fellow Republican. \"SCOTUS\" is a common abbreviation for the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nThe versions of the alleged phone call shared online were scant on details about when the conversation supposedly took place. Some said the recording was from July 2022, but did not back up this claim. Online postings contained no further information about who leaked the alleged call or why.\n\nAs stated above, Snopes found no evidence that the alleged call between McConnell and McCarthy was real, nor did the call seem to reflect the politicians' publicly expressed opinions.\n\nMcConnell and McCarthy both voted against the Women's Health Protection Act, which would \"prohibit governmental restrictions on the provision of and access to abortion services.\" The bill passed the House in 2021 but failed in the Senate in 2022.\n\nSince then, McConnell has said that abortion should be dealt with at a state rather than a federal level. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a nonprofit that seeks to reduce and ultimately end abortion in the U.S., rated both McConnell and McCarthy \"A+.\"\n\nBoth McConnell and McCarthy have historically opposed slavery, a central theme of the alleged call, on their social media accounts. McCarthy spoke (archived) of the \"evils\" of slavery in 2019. That same year, McConnell wrote (archived) about \"slavery's stain on our history\" on X. However, McConnell did previously oppose the idea of reparations for slavery, saying in 2019 he didn't think \"reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea.\"\n\nLastly, McConnell allegedly advocated for \"state funded religious schools\" in the phone call transcript. These schools, he allegedly argued, would be the basis for the renewed slavery project, as students would participate in work programs. In reality, McConnell has historically been a strong advocate for school choice, co-authoring an opinion piece in 2013 that argued \"Choice breeds competition — which is the best way to improve schools,\" an opinion that would seemingly be at odds with advocating for forced attendance at state-funded schools.\n\nThis was not the first rumor Snopes has investigated about either McConnell or McCarthy. For example, we previously looked into claims that McConnell said he would not participate in 2020 election debates that included female moderators and that a photo authentically showed McCarthy watching himself lose a vote for speaker of the House.\n\nBlad, Evie. \"Senate GOP Sticks to School Choice Push in Slimmed Down Relief Proposal.\" Education Week, 8 Sep. 2020. www.edweek.org, https://www.edweek.org/education/senate-gop-sticks-to-school-choice-push-in-slimmed-down-relief-proposal/2020/09.\n\nChu, Judy. \"H.R.3755 - Women's Health Protection Act of 2021.\" Congress.Gov, 6 Aug. 2021, https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755.\n\nHuffington Post: Op-Ed by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Sens.
