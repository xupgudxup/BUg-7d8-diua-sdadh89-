    "description": "Jayson Tatum's return has been a question mark for the Celtics all season.",
    "fullText": "The question of Jayson Tatum's return from a torn Achilles has loomed over the Boston Celtics' entire 2025-26 season. The team might be about to get the answer it didn't want.\n\nPrime Video's Chris Haynes reported Wednesday that a recent and unspecified development has caused the Celtics star to reevaluate his situation and consider sitting out the entire season. Haynes added he had recently heard Tatum was \"getting close\" to a return, but it's now \"up in the air\" if he plays at all.\n\nThe news comes a day after Tatum expressed reluctance about making a return late in the season, which he worried would disrupt the chemistry the Celtics have developed without him, during an appearance on \"The Pivot Podcast.\"\n\n\"That's something I contemplate every day,\" Tatum said. \"More so about the team, if or when I do come back this season, they would've played 50 some-odd games without me. So they have an identity this year or things that they felt have clicked for them, and it's been successful, right, third or second team in the East up to this point. So there is a thought in my head that's like, how does that work or hows does that look with me integrating myself off an injury and 50-60 games into a season? There could obviously be some challenges and it is a thought, like damn? Do I come back or should I wait? It's something that I honestly, recently in the last two weeks or so, just kind of contemplate every single day.\"\n\nTatum tore his Achilles in last year's Eastern Conference semifinals and has had a hazy timetable to return ever since. Achilles tears are one of the most-feared injuries in all of sports, but Tatum's youth at 27 years old and recent advancements in treatment invited optimism for this season.\n\nTatum refused to rule out a return before the season and showed off some dunking ability in October, while the Celtics were reported to be cautiously optimistic. Now, they might have to accept an All-NBA talent isn't walking through that door until 2026-27.\n\nDespite Tatum's absence, the Celtics have remained one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. The team is tied for the second-best record in the East with a 29-18 record, thanks to a career season from Jaylen Brown and strong contributions from supporting cast members like Derrick White, Payton Pritchard and Neemia Queta.\n\nTatum is still under contract with the Celtics for four more seasons on his five-year, $304 million supermax deal.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY – The Golden State Warriors are heading home victoriously after their best half of 3-point shooting this season and a 19-point half from Stephen Curry.\n\nThe Warriors made 15 first-half threes and rode Curry's stellar second half to a 140-124 victory over the Utah Jazz at Delta Center. Curry finished with 27 points after an eight-point first half on 2-of-7 shooting, following in the second half with 5-of-7 shooting and 7-of-8 free-throw shooting.\n\nMoses Moody added 26 points (9-of-15 shooting, 5-of-9 from 3-point range) and Golden State rode eight double-figure scorers for 53.5% shooting, 23-of-54 3-point shooting and 38 assists for 42 baskets.\n\nUtah star forward Lauri Markkanen had 18 points on 6-of-14 shooting while Bryce Sensabaugh scored a team-high 22 points.\n\nThe Warriors (27-22) made 15 first-half threes – a season high for any half – on their way to a 68-55 lead: three apiece from Moody and Hield (during an 11-point, four-minute, second-quarter furry), two from Curry, Melton and Quinten Post and one from Al Horford, Brandin Podziemski and Will Richard.\n\nSharp ball and player movement opened jumpers and active defense forced 11 turnovers in the opening half. Keyonte George attacked for 12 first-half points to keep the Jazz within striking distance, but Markkanen was hounded off the bounce or in the paint en route to 2-of-8 shooting.\n\nCurry widened Golden State's lead to 22 with a 12-point third-quarter burst via two cutting layups, a pullup three, three free throws from a 3-point shooting foul and two free throws from a foul on a drive. A 99-82 advantage was cut with an 11-2 quarter-closing run from the Jazz (15-33), who started it with a triple from George (19 points) and capped with Isaiah Collier's buzzer-beating fastbreak layup.\n\nRichard and Moody started the fourth quarter with back-to-back triples to restore Golden State's double-figure lead.\n\nThe Warriors next play Friday against the Eastern Conference-leading Detroit Pistons at Chase Center.\n\nThis article originally published at Warriors on target from distance, end four-game trip with rout of Jazz.",

    "fullText": "The Ukrainian superstar Elina Svitolina has a shot at glory today, as she takes on world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the Australian Open semifinals. It’s been a surreal run so far for the Olympic bronze medalist in Melbourne. With one more win, the No. 12 seed has a chance to become the first Ukrainian woman ever to reach a Grand Slam final. In hindsight, this journey wouldn’t be possible without the steadfast support from her family.\n\nMikhaylo Svitolin is the man behind the scenes of Elina Svitolina’s tennis success. Before he was a tennis dad, he was a competitive wrestler in Ukraine. Professionally, he made his living as a real estate agent in Odesa, but his real passion was always been sports. Interestingly, Elina has mentioned that she only started playing tennis at the age of 5 because she wanted her dad’s attention, as he was busy traveling for tournaments with her older brother, Yulian.\n\nAs Elina got better and better, Mikhaylo stepped up as her early coach and mentor. The biggest sacrifice came when she was just 12. As per advice from the businessman Yuriy Sapronov, the millionaire who caught Elina’s talents while she was playing in a local tournament, the family made a decision to move from Odesa to Kharkiv so she could train at a professional academy to have better shots of making the pro, some 350 miles from her hometown.\n\nLooking back, it was one big gamble, but safe to say, the investment is paying in dividends now, helping her eventually reach the world No. 3 ranking.\n\nOlena Svitolina is a powerhouse in her own right. She was a competitive rower before moving on to professional bowling by the time Elina began focusing on tennis.\n\nShe was known for being a strict but incredibly supportive parent. She often told Elina that coming from Ukraine meant she had to work twice as hard as anyone else to get noticed on the world stage. Elina openly admitted she wouldn’t be the player she is today without her mom.\n\n“My mom always supported me. This is very important, especially in tennis, given how much time you spend on the road, at tournaments, away from friends and family… the sport of tennis is such that almost every week you have losses happen, it’s hard… my mother gives and continues to give me strength and faith in the fact that I can be a better tennis player.”\n\nYou can take a hint from her dedication. Olena’s love for the game and her professional career were so impeccable that when the family decided to move from Odesa to Kharkiv for Elina’s elite training, Olena stayed behind for two months to finish her bowling commitments before joining them.\n\nEven now, in 2026, Olena is still Elina’s biggest cheerleader. These days, she wears more of a spectator and grandma first.\n\nElina Svitolina was born in Ukraine to Ukrainian parents, Mikhaylo and Olena. Her dad has Jewish roots through her grandmother, Tamara. However, during her tennis career, she received several offers from other countries to change her nationality and play for them, often with a lot of money involved. However, she always chose to represent Ukraine.\n\nThe parents got involved very early in her career, with Mikhaylo serving as her former coach and Olena deliberately pushing her and making her work twice as hard to make it to the big leagues. Her parents followed her to every match and expecting constant victory. Around 2015, they collectively decided it was best for them to step back from traveling with her, allowing her to gain independence and take ownership of her career. Today, her parents remain her primary motivators and a constant source of strength.\n\nBut these days their role has changed quite a bit. It revolves less around Elina, more around Skai, their granddaughter, so Elina and her husband Gaël Monfils can focus on their matches. Safe to say, parents have traded their “coach” hats for “grandparent” hats.\n\nThe post Who Are Elina Svitolina Parents?

    "fullText": "There are a lot of reasons Nick Saban is revered in Tuscaloosa.\n\nBut if you really want to understand who Nick Saban is, who he has always been, you don’t have to look at trophies or banners hanging inside Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nYou look at moments like this one.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nick and Terry Saban sat down with Alabama Governor Kay Ivey to talk about the future of kids.\n\nGovernor Ivey said it best when she shared how much time and energy the Sabans continue to pour into young people and their opportunities. And that’s the part that hits hardest, because Nick Saban didn’t have to do this.\n\nIt was great to have Coach and Ms. Terry Saban in my office.\n\nThey have always taken the time and energy to invest in young people and their futures.\n\nI look forward to Alabama students soon immersing themselves in STEM education and the arts at the Saban Center. #alpolitics pic.twitter.com/aTjYmTbeGM\n\n— Governor Kay Ivey (@GovernorKayIvey) January 28, 2026\n\nHe doesn’t need another project.\n\nHe doesn’t need another ribbon-cutting or photo op.\n\nHis name is already etched into history forever.\n\nThat’s not coincidence. That’s character.\n\nThe Saban Center isn’t just another building going up in Tuscaloosa.\n\nIt’s a first-of-its-kind learning campus designed to bring STEM education, the arts, innovation, and imagination under one roof, where students don’t just learn, but discover. Where curiosity is encouraged. Where confidence is built. Where leadership begins before a kid even realizes what leadership looks like.\n\nBecause Nick Saban has always understood something deeper than wins and losses: opportunity changes lives.\n\nThis campus will house the State of Alabama STEM Hub. It will be home to the Tuscaloosa Children’s Theatre. It will include IGNITE, formerly the Children’s Hands-On Museum, giving kids hands-on experiences that spark creativity and wonder.\n\nNot memorization. Not test scores. Real engagement.\n\nAnd maybe the most poetic part of all? The Saban Center will be built using only Alabama-sourced materials.\n\nThat’s Nick Saban in a nutshell.\n\nFor decades, we watched him develop young men on the football field, teaching discipline, accountability, resilience, and belief.\n\nWe watched players arrive as teenagers and leave as leaders.\n\nWe watched assistants learn under him, grow under pressure, and go on to shape programs of their own.\n\nBut this? This is bigger than football.\n\nThis is Nick and Miss Terry saying, “We’re not done.”\n\nThey’re saying that Tuscaloosa isn’t just a place where championships were won, it’s a place where futures will be built.\n\nThat Alabama’s kids deserve world-class resources. That innovation and creativity belong here, not somewhere else.\n\nThe Saban Center is set to open in 2027. And when it does, generations of students, many of whom may never wear a helmet or step onto a field, will benefit from the same belief Nick Saban has always had in people: that if you give them the right environment, they’ll rise to the challenge.\n\nNick Saban changed college football forever.\n\nBut what he’s doing now, what he’s always done, might matter even more.\n\nHe’s building something that lasts.\n\nAnd once again, he’s reminding us why Tuscaloosa will always be better because he chose to call it home.\n\nBut a man who never stopped caring.",

He was the #150 ranked freshman in the class of 2025 and yet has clearly been a top-25 player in the entire country among all classes as demonstrated by his 46-point demolition of Purdue last weekend. Wagler is a 6’6 3-star freshman point guard who is 12th nationally in offensive efficiency. He hardly ever turns the ball over, is a lights out 3-point shooter, draws a ton of fouls, and can make every pass. Just an amazing season so far.\n\nG- Jake Davis, Jr. 6’6, 215: 4.8 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 0.7 apg, 44.0% FG, 41.5% 3pt, 75.0% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +3.9 BPR (406th nationally)\n\nDavis has been thrust into the starting lineup with the recent injury to starting guard Kylan Boswell. But that’s not necessarily that bad of a thing because Davis is 2nd(!) nationally in offensive efficiency. He absolutely never turns the ball over with just 2 giveaways all season and is the epitome of a 3-point sniper. Over 80% of his attempts this season have been from behind the arc and is a career 40% shooter to justify it. Davis has good size at 6’6 but adds almost nothing from a defense/rebounding standpoint so is exclusively a 5th option floor spacer. Still nice to have.\n\nF- Andrej Stojakovic, Jr. 6’7, 215: 13.9 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.1 apg, 50.0% FG, 26.3% 3pt, 81.8% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +4.5 BPR (279th nationally)\n\nStojakovic was the final piece of the puzzle for Illinois in the transfer portal after transferring from Stanford to Cal to now the Illini. The 3-point shot has just never really developed and is at a career low right now but it’s okay because Stojakovic has been great at the rim and in the midrange. The rebounding and steal numbers are lower than you’d like but he’s still clearly an additive player and has the length to bother opponents on the other end even if he isn’t the best defender in the world.\n\nF- David Mirkovic, Fr, 6’9, 250: 12.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 2.6 apg, 47.4% FG, 37.5% 3pt, 80.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (72nd nationally)\n\nMirkovic was an offseason Euro import from Montenegro and has been a really nice addition for Illinois. His assist rate is really high for your average power forward and he’s both a very good rebounder and three-point shooter. His block rate is about what you’d expect for your average 6’4 shooting guard so he offers no rim protection but is big enough to still both Hannes Steinbach in that matchup.\n\nC- Tomislav Ivisic, Jr. 7’1, 255: 10.2 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 0.6 bpg, 49.2% FG, 36.8% 3pt, 70.4% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (70th nationally)\n\nThe key to the Illinois offense is the Croatian brother duo of Tomislav and Zvonimir Ivisic who combine to play nearly 100% of the center minutes for Illinois. Tomislav starts has been better on the offensive end while Zvonimir is 2nd in the country in block rate as the rim protector. Both are shooting at least 67% on 2-pointers and almost exactly 36% on 3-pointers which makes them wildly efficient.\n\nIt’s safe to say that the all-Balkan roster makeover has worked out pretty well for Illinois and head coach Brad Underwood. There were thoughts in the offseason that Illinois would end up with 5 of their top 6 players who have a last name ending in “ic”: Mihailo Petrovic, Andrej Stojakovic, David Mirkovic, Tomislav Ivisic, and Zvonimir Ivisic. The only player not of that background was projected to be Kylan Boswell (Stojakovic was born in the US but is the son of former Serbian NBA star Peja Stojakovic so you can’t so the only American).\n\nAlmost every aspect of that remodel has worked except for Petrovic. He hasn’t been close to a starting caliber point guard and has fallen out of the rotation thanks to a ton of turnovers and poor shooting. That might have doomed many teams to underachieve. Except enter Keaton Wagler.\n\nNo one could’ve predicted that a three-star freshman would not only start for Illinois at point guard but legitimately enter the All-American conversation and become a top-ten NBA draft pick. That just doesn’t happen. Wagler is the engine behind an offense that is not just #1 in the country per KenPom but the best in KenPom’s database which goes back to 1997. That will likely drop off a bit at some point but the Illini are an absolute machine.\n\nIt looked like Illinois might only be so-so after they dropped to 8-3 following a home loss to Nebraska. That loss obviously looks better in hindsight and Illinois has won 9 straight since then. They’re now 3-3 against top-20 KenPom teams and 14-0 against everyone else. Not exactly encouraging for Washington.\n\nAs mentioned above, the success revolves around the Illinois offense. They take over half of their shots from beyond the 3-point arc and play five legitimate shooting threats at almost all times. Illinois will absolutely bomb it from deep and shoot 36% as a team from that range. They’ve made at least 10 three-point shots in 11 of their last 12 games. That’s compared to Washington who have hit that mark just 3 times all season (although they notably did it in their last game against Oregon). The math says it’s really hard to out-shoot them.\n\nEven when Illinois does miss a shot, they get it back almost half the time. Illinois is 4th nationally in offensive rebounding rate thanks to being the tallest team in the country with a rotation made entirely of players 6’6 or taller that aggressively crash the glass. That usually leads to kick outs and more three-point attempts rather than easy putbacks but they do shoot 58.4% (25th nationally) on two-point shots when they do decide to shoot it from close range. Oh, and if you foul them then they make nearly 80% of their free throws which ranks 4th nationally.\n\nSo they take and make a lot of three-pointers. And when they miss they get it back at an elite rate. And when they take close shots or get fouled they make them at an elite rate. Maybe we can force turnovers against them? Nope. They also rank 34th in turnover percentage. The math says Illinois has a sizable advantage from every area on offense and that’s why they have the best offense in the country.\n\nThere are some weaknesses to exploit on defense relatively but not that many. Illinois being the tallest team in the country does mean that it’s really hard to be outright bad on defense. They can at least contest shots with their length at every position even if they don’t have the best athletes. The rebounding and blocked shot numbers are very good because of that.\n\nWhere Illinois has their biggest issue is their depth. With Boswell’s injury and Petrovic not living up to expectations it means this is basically a 7-man roster right now. The Ivisic brothers combine to take up essentially all 40 minutes at center and then only 6’9 Ben Humrichous is truly available to soak up minutes at the 3/4 with the guards otherwise playing just about the whole game. So that means just get Illinois in foul trouble, right?\n\nEasier said then done. Illinois knows they’ve got issues with depth and so they just don’t foul. They rank 1st in the country in opponent free throw rate. That’s not a great sign for Washington. The Huskies are 2-7 this year when they have a free throw rate on offense below 30%. Illinois gives up 19% on average. Washington absolutely needs a friendly whistle to have any shot at pulling an upset but it doesn’t seem likely.\n\nThe flip side of Illinois’ aversion to fouling is that they also don’t force turnovers. They’re dead last in opponent turnover rate and 2nd to last in steal rate on defense. If Washington is going to win this game then they need that trend to continue with 5 or fewer turnovers. The Huskies have to find ways to make up possessions knowing what a juggernaut Illinois is on offense and one of the only clear ways to do that is to keep from turning it over when UW has the ball. And oh yeah, they’re going to have shoot like they did against Oregon making close to 50% of their three-pointers.\n\nEarlier this week I looked into how brutal Washington’s schedule has been recently. The 7-game stretch culminating in this game is the 4th toughest for any team this season and they recently wrapped a 5-game stretch that was the toughest of any team in the entire country. Illinois is scorching hot. Washington got a feel good win this weekend to hopefully build some momentum but no one has gotten within 5 points of Illinois since December 13th. Things are set to turn around soon with the schedule lightening up but the best UW can hope for in this one is a late surge helping them cover the spread like they’ve done a few times recently. I’m not counting on it though\n\nWashington Huskies– 68, Illinois Fighting Illini- 85\n\nSeason picks: 14-6 straight up, 10-10 against the spread",

    "description": "Post-match reaction from the boss",
    "fullText": "Since coming in, Liam Rosenior made it a point to not try to change too many things tactically from what Enzo Maresca had been doing with Chelsea. The new head coach spoke in reverence of Maresca’s setup, which aligned with the BlueCo principles that Rosenior himself had been aligning to at RC Strasbourg.\n\nAnd seeing as how Chelsea have had a game every three days or so for as long as we can remember, it’s not like Rosenior really got a chance to really work on anything too drastically different. So the new man in charge had been focusing on the mental and motivation aspects of the job, showing fresh, brash confidence and preaching ambition and winning mentality — things we sure love to hear!\n\nLast night, Rosenior tried something a bit different.\n\n“I wanted to go man-for-man all over the pitch. We knew we needed to win the game. I wanted to be really aggressive and Napoli were very clever after 20-25 minutes. I felt we won the ball back very high in good areas in the first 20 minutes. When they started to miss our press out and went a little bit more direct, the distances were a little bit bigger. We corrected that. We were still man-to-man in the second half but we started a bit deeper with our press and I think that helped our compactness.”\n\nChelsea, set up in a most awkward three-man defense, were perhaps lucky to be behind only 2-1 at the half, with Napoli repeatedly slicing open the team — not sending anyone to hospital unlike their ultras the night before, but certainly sending Rosenior scrambling for a rethink at the break.\n\nTo his credit, the young head coach made the necessary adjustments. Chelsea were much improved in the second half, and though both of our two goals needed individual brilliance from João Pedro (certainly his first, our second), by controlling the game instead of constantly scrambling for our lives, we were able to provide the platform for our center forward to shine.\n\n“I’m so proud of [the players], even in the first half, I’m asking them to press in a completely different way that they’ve never done before and hardly had any practice at. So that time over the next few weeks will help us get better and improve, but we still need to win games in this moment.”\n\n“[There were] so many pleasing individual performances but I think the most pleasing aspect was the collective mentality of the group to have a positive reaction to a difficult first half.”\n\n-Liam Rosenior; \n\nRosenior got it wrong at the start — right intention to go for the win, but wrong approach — but he got everything right after that. His in-game adjustments and substitutions helped us win the game. We’re still just getting to know him, but it’s great to see that he can evaluate his own choices correctly. Not every coach can, certainly not in real-time.\n\nThis was a big win, an important win, but just one win. Next up: another important win-opportunity as West Ham come to town Saturday evening.",

    "fullText": "Despite obvious midfield gaps, Manchester United chose to focus on strengthening their attack last summer.\n\nIn came Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko for big money, and as a result, Joshua Zirkzee’s minutes decreased dramatically.\n\nIt was not until gameweek 12 that the Dutchman finally earned a Premier League start, but since the second week of December, the 24-year-old has not made the starting XI even once.\n\nWith the World Cup coming up at the end of the season, the former Bologna ace was keen to make the cut and the only way for that to happen was by playing regularly at club level.\n\nHowever, with his chances expected to remain limited under Ruben Amorim, the Netherlands international was eyeing a return to Italy, with AS Roma interested.\n\nHowever, the Portuguese tactician’s departure and Michael Carrick’s subsequent arrival meant United blocked his exit.\n\nAn injury, however, has meant he is yet to earn any minutes under the caretaker head coach, and he remains keen to leave Old Trafford.\n\nThere is interest from within the Premier League, but Serie A football appeals more to the former Bayern Munich ace and Juventus were reportedly interested.\n\nHowever, as per Tuttosport, the Red Devils will not allow their No.11 to jump ship midway through the season.\n\nInterestingly, Bianconeri boss Luciano Spalletti is also not a big fan of the versatile ace and is eyeing a different profile for Juve’s attack.\n\n“He will most likely remain in England, where Zirkzee doesn’t appear to be leaving for now: Manchester United has put a freeze on transfers, and not even Juventus’ interest has changed matters.\n\n“Regardless, he wouldn’t have met Spalletti’s requirements, who is looking for strength, hunger, and, even more so, physical qualities that can help him in specific moments of the match.”\n\nAny addition to the attack will depend on the future of Joshua Zirkzee. Should he depart permanently, only then will United pursue an alternative in the January market.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "After the shorthanded edition of the Golden State Warriors stumbled in a blowout loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday, Steve Kerr's rotation welcomed some much-needed reinforcements on Wednesday in the final leg of their four-game road swing. Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Al Horford and De'Anthony Melton all returned to the lineup on Wednesday night against the Utah Jazz.\n\nWith Curry back in the lineup, the Warriors returned to their winning ways on Wednesday night in Utah. Behind a high-powered offensive performance, the Warriors rolled to a 140-124 win over the Jazz to end their four-game road trip.\n\nEight members of the Warriors tallied double-figures on Wednesday with Curry leading the way. Curry tallied a game-high 27 points on 7-of-14 shooting from the field with four made 3-pointers to go along with two assists and two steals in 28 minutes.\n\nMoses Moody continued his strong stretch of play with 26 points on 9-of-15 shooting from the field. Moody drilled a game-high five 3-pointers in 26 minutes against the Jazz. Moody has now tallied 10 or more points in nine straight games for the Warriors. Over that nine-game span, Moody is averaging 15.2 points per contest.\n\nThe Warriors buried 23 3-pointers on Wednesday, with seven members of the Warriors tallying two or more made triples. Both Buddy Hield and rookie Will Richard drilled three 3-pointers off the bench against the Jazz.\n\nLed by 16 points from Gui Santos, the Warriors' bench scored 67 of Golden State's 140 points on Wednesday night in Salt Lake.\n\nGolden State's 140 points is a new season high in total points scored in a game this season. The Warriors have previously tallied 137 points twice this season.\n\nThe Warriors now end their road swing with a 2-2 record over four games. The Warriors will now return to the Bay Area for a tough two-game slate against a pair of Eastern Conference contenders, the Detroit Pistons and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThe Warriors will host the Eastern Conference-leading Pistons on Friday night at Chase Center with tipoff set for 7 p.m. PT.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Sharp-shooting Warriors explode on offense in 140-124 win over Jazz",

    "fullText": "Thursday’s NBA slate is packed with storylines and pressure games. A few teams are trying to snap losing streaks, while others want to protect their home courts. Big names like Tyrese Maxey, Cade Cunningham, Kevin Durant, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are set to take center stage. The games on January 29 are not just about wins and losses. They also show where each team truly stands as the season moves forward. Here is a closer look at every game. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nSacramento comes in on a six-game losing streak and has struggled badly on the road with a 3-20 record. Philadelphia has been average at home, but their rebounding edge stands out. The 76ers pull down 12.3 offensive rebounds per game, led by Andre Drummond at 3.5. Tyrese Maxey is carrying the offense with 29.2 points per game and strong playmaking. Joel Embiid has also been steady over the last 10 games with over 20 points per night. Sacramento gives up 120.8 points per game, which lines up poorly against a team that scores more than 116 per outing. DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook can score, but the Kings allow too many open looks. Philadelphia already controls the glass and should create second chances. That gap makes the home team the safer pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Sacramento Kings\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Capital One Arena, Washington\n\nMilwaukee has dropped three straight games and is only 3-7 in its last ten. Washington is not much better, but they recently beat Milwaukee 114-113 on January 1. Alex Sarr leads the Wizards with 17.7 points and 7.5 rebounds, giving them size inside. The Bucks allow 14.1 made threes per game, while Washington averages nearly 13 from deep. That matchup favors the home team. Ryan Rollins and AJ Green have been productive for Milwaukee, but the team still gives up over 115 points per game in recent outings. Wizards games tend to stay close, and they are 2-2 in games decided by three points or fewer. Another tight finish is likely, and Washington has already shown it can win this game.\n\nPredicted winner: Washington Wizards\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nBrooklyn is on a six-game slide and is 6-16 on the road. Turnovers are a big issue, with 14.6 per game. Denver plays better at home and moves the ball well, ranking near the top in assists. Jamal Murray averages 25.9 points and 7.4 assists, while the Nuggets hit nearly 14 threes per game. Brooklyn did win the first meeting this season, but that came at home. Denver has gone 6-4 over the last ten and keeps opponents around 108 points. The Nets allow over 117 points per game in that same span. Porter and Claxton provide effort, yet the defense breaks down too often. Denver’s balanced attack and home court give them the edge.\n\nPredicted winner: Brooklyn Nets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Footprint Center, Phoenix\n\nDetroit owns the best record in the East at 34-11 and has won four straight road games. The Pistons also rank near the top in defense, allowing only 110 points per game. Phoenix is strong at home but is missing key players like Devin Booker and Jalen Green. Cade Cunningham leads Detroit with 25.3 points and nearly 10 assists per game. Phoenix relies heavily on Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen for scoring. The Suns score 114 per game, but Detroit scores more and defends better. Detroit also won the first meeting 108-105. With Phoenix short-handed, the Pistons have the advantage in depth and form.\n\nPredicted winner: Detroit Pistons\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: State Farm Arena, Atlanta\n\nHouston is 28-16 and plays strong defense, ranking fourth in points allowed at 110.5. Atlanta scores well but struggles to stop teams, giving up nearly 119 per game. Kevin Durant just dropped 33 points in Houston’s last win and continues to be the focal point. The Rockets also rebound well, pulling in 49 per game. Atlanta moves the ball better than anyone, averaging over 31 assists per game, led by CJ McCollum’s recent form. Even so, the Hawks give up too many open shots and free throws. Houston’s mix of scoring and defense should control the pace. That balance makes them the better pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nChicago is coming off a loss to the Lakers but remains competitive at home. Miami beat Phoenix in its last game and has momentum. The Heat crushed Chicago earlier this season 143-107, though the Bulls dominated the matchup last year. Coby White and Ayo Dosunmu lead Chicago’s scoring. Bam Adebayo anchors Miami inside. Both teams sit around .500, which suggests a close game. Chicago usually plays tougher defense at home and will want payback for the earlier blowout. Miami has been steady, but the Bulls have won more often in this building. A narrow home win looks likely.\n\nPredicted winner: Chicago Bulls\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center, Dallas\n\nCharlotte just beat Philadelphia 130-93 with strong shooting and ball movement. Brandon Miller scored 30 points on 81.8% shooting. The Hornets average 116.3 points and hit 37% from three. Dallas lost to the Lakers and allowed 57 rebounds, which shows weakness on the glass. Max Christie has been productive, but Dallas still gives up 116.5 points per game. Charlotte’s passing and rebounding edge should matter. The Hornets also force turnovers and play faster. Dallas has struggled to defend consistently, which puts them at risk against a hot Charlotte offense.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Target Center, Minnesota\n\nOklahoma City leads the league in scoring at 120.8 points per game and allows just 107.9. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to shine, coming off a 24-point game on 72.7% shooting. Minnesota is solid offensively at 119 per game but allows 114.3. Julius Randle had 18 points in his last outing, though the Timberwolves rely on forcing turnovers to stay competitive. The Thunder rank first in points allowed and create pressure on defense. That combination usually travels well. Minnesota is strong at home, but Oklahoma City’s efficiency and defense give them the edge.\n\nPredicted winner: Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nJanuary 29 brings a mix of uneven matchups and tight contests. Some teams hold clear edges because of defense, home court, or recent form. Others are expected to grind out close wins based on past results and key player performances. These games will shape momentum for the next stretch of the season. This schedule offers plenty of reasons to stay tuned from the first tip-off to the final buzzer.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 29: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

I don't know if it's my last game here or not.\n\n\"Lot of memories here. Lot of history. Just super grateful and thankful for the time. Looking up in the rafters and seeing our championship banner, of course there was a lot of reflecting.\"\n\nJames said he doesn't see this season as his NBA farewell tour.\n\n\"I've never even thought to the point of a farewell tour or whatever the case may be because I haven't had that conversation with myself and my family on when is it over,\" he said.\n\nDonovan Mitchell, whose 25 points led Cleveland, understood that even with the Cavaliers (29-20) win streak at five games, this night belonged to James and his legacy of making Cleveland a champion after 52 years of failure in major US sports leagues.\n\n\"He has laid the foundation,\" Mitchell said. \"He has done a lot for the city being from here. We want to replicate that.\n\n\"He deserves the energy he has got here. First time they have done it in 50-some years. We're trying to do it differently. At the end of the day, we're trying to find ways to go out there and bring the city another championship.\"\n\nLuka Doncic had a game-high 29 points for the Lakers (28-18), who also had eight points from Bronny James, LeBron's son.\n\n\"It was pretty cool just sitting over there and watching him,\" James said. \"My mom was here watching her son and her grandson. I don't even know how to wrap that all in my brain. It's so weird and so cool and so surreal.\"\n\nJames, who fell to 9-4 as a visiting player in Cleveland, had averaged 28 points a game in 24 prior contests against the Cavs, who outscored the Lakers 42-22 in the third quarter for a 99-77 lead, hitting 7-of-11 shots from three-point range and 17-of-25 overall in the period.\n\n\"We got outplayed. I got outcoached,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \"We just didn't look like we had all our juice.\"\n\nThe Cavs were without reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley due to a left calf strain.\n\nIn other games, Victor Wembanyama had game highs of 28 points, 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to spark San Antonio's 111-99 triumph at Houston.\n\nPaolo Banchero delivered 31 points for Orlando in a 133-124 victory at Miami while New York's Mikal Bridges scored 30 in a 119-92 victory at Toronto and Julius Randle scored 31 in Minnesota's 118-105 victory at Dallas.\n\nStephen Curry scored 27 points to lead Golden State's 140-124 victory at Utah.",

If all of this was not enough, Coyle then scored the opening goal for Columbus against the Flyers in the opening frame.\n\nThe Blue Jackets would go on to take down Philadelphia — 5-3 — at Nationwide Arena.\n\nThough, this celebration does come after Coylee participated in his 1,000th NHL game on Jan. 22 during a matchup against the Dallas Stars.\n\nThe veteran forward is in his 14th NHL season and first with the Blue Jackets.

The expectation is that both LV and Arizona will take that opportunity to do so this weekend.\n\n— Peter Schrager (@PSchrags) January 29, 2026\n\nRight now the Seahawks are preparing to face the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl next Sunday. It appears there will be a small window this weekend for Kubiak to fly out to Las Vegas and Arizona to meet with those teams. At which point each side will decide if it's a good fit.\n\nWhat figures to happen after that is one team will hire a different head coach and the other will wait until after the Super Bowl to name Kubiak their next head coach.

After announcing the hiring of their new offensive coordinator just one day earlier, the Chargers have now addressed the other side of the ball, turning to a familiar face to lead the defense in 2026.\n\nSources: Chargers are hiring Western Michigan defensive coordinator Chris O'Leary as their defensive coordinator. O’Leary returns to the Chargers, where he worked as safeties coach under Jesse Minter in 2024. Prior to the Chargers, O’Leary coached the secondary at Notre Dame… pic.twitter.com/643ARpuk10\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 29, 2026\n\nO’Leary, 34, returns to the Chargers after spending the 2024 season as the safeties coach with the Bolts. O’Leary’s impact was immediately felt in the form of Derwin James Jr., the All-Pro safety who continued his trajectory toward greatness. Under O’Leary’s guidance, James earned his fourth Pro Bowl selection in 2024, adding to his already impressive resume. O’Leary helped elevate James’ game, refining his coverage skills, his leadership in the back end, and his overall impact on the field.\n\nIn his lone year with Western Michigan as their defensive coordinator in 2025, O’Leary orchestrated a unit that ranked ninth in the nation in scoring defense, allowing just 17.4 points per game.\n\nThat’s a significant accomplishment for a program outside the power conferences and a testament to O'Leary’s ability to scheme up effective, disruptive defenses. Now, he’s tasked with bringing that same energy to Los Angeles as the Chargers’ defensive leader.\n\nFrom his six years at Notre Dame, where he worked in various roles including defensive analyst, O’Leary has developed a reputation as a coach who knows how to maximize talent at all levels.\n\nHis time coaching the secondary at Notre Dame helped solidify one of the most respected units in college football, and he showed a remarkable ability to adapt his coaching style to the talent at hand. That flexibility could be crucial for the Chargers, who will likely be looking to blend their current talent with new acquisitions in the coming seasons.\n\nThe Chargers’ decision to hire O'Leary is a clear signal that they are serious about developing a defense that can complement their high-powered offense.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea striker Joao Pedro has been asked what the difference is between former boss Enzo Maresca and Liam Rosenior.\n\nThe interview came after Pedro played a Man of the Match performance to help Chelsea beat Napoli in the Champions League last night, with the attacker scoring two very important goals.\n\nChelsea got a bit lucky in places after a poor first half performance, but they were much improved in the second half and got the job done.\n\nIt needed some real individual quality and class finishing from Joao Pedro though, but his first goal was of a world class calibre without a doubt. His second goal wasn’t too shabby either and was a fine finish to put Chelsea 3-2 up and going on to win the game.\n\nA depleted Napoli side fought hard, but Chelsea in the end just showed their edge with some individual quality and more control over the game in the second half.\n\nLiam Rosenior was heavily criticised for his strange setup in the first half, using a back three and playing only one natural centre back. But Pedro has been complimenting his head coach after the game.\n\nJoao Pedro celebrates with Chelsea players. (Photo by Francesco Pecoraro/Getty Images)\n\nPedro spoke to TNT Sports on the difference between Liam Rosenior and Enzo Maresca:\n\n“I think Liam is more electric. He wants us to play more with intensity and compact.”\n\n“Enzo is more like with the ball; he’s very good as well, but that’s the difference.”\n\nI’ve not really seen these differences yet, but I’m sure it will come in time. After all, that was only Rosenior’s fifth game in charge of Chelsea last night, so we will hopefully see that come to fruition soon enough.",

    "description": "Is there trouble brewing in Denver?",
    "fullText": "Bo Nix calls out Sean Payton for sharing his medical history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDenver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix wasn’t happy with his head coach, Sean Payton, after Payton publicly discussed Nix’s medical history.\n\nNix suffered a fractured ankle during Denver’s victory over the Buffalo Bills in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs last weekend, and Payton told media members that Nix was predisposed to the injury, and that it was going to happen eventually one way or another.\n\n“What was found was a condition that was predisposed — they always find a little more when they go in,” Payton replied when asked if there was any concern that Nix has had multiple ankle surgeries in his career. “It wasn’t a matter of if, it was a matter of when. When you look at the play and you’re trying to evaluate it — the doctor, the operating surgeon said that this was going to happen sooner than later.”\n\nIn his first public comments since the injury, Nix refuted his coach’s claim that the injury was unavoidable.\n\n\"[But] nothing predisposed, nothing that was there originally,\" Nix said of the injury. \"That might have gotten confused. Just a simple step with my foot up in the air, my body weight came down on it, sort of got twisted up. ... It could have been a worse landing, but I think all that force went into the only place it could.\"\n\nMore: Broncos' Bo Nix breaks silence on season-ending ankle injury\n\nNix then questioned his coach for publicly dislocating his surgical history.\n\n\"I don't think he really should share how many surgeries I've had in the past, to be honest with you -- he doesn't even really know that,” Nix said. “But it's going to be good to get back, get back to work. ... Nothing really that concerns me, nothing that scares me moving forward.\"\n\nClearly, Nix was annoyed, or bothered, by his coach’s comments, and the fact that they came publicly, otherwise he wouldn’t have addressed them in the manner that he did.\n\nUltimately, this is probably something that will blow over and be long forgotten by the time that training camp rolls around. However, there’s also a non-zero chance that it could start to sow the seeds of distrust between Nix and Payton and ultimately contribute to the deterioration of their relationship.\n\nWhich will it be? Only time will tell. Obviously, Broncos fans are hoping that it turns out to be the former.\n\nJ.K.

    "title": "Cirkin’s Muscled His Way Into Sunderland Contention",
    "description": "Dennis Cirkin’s put up a brilliant fight for his Sunderland shirt — seeing off some of his competition in the process. Could he kick on even further?",
    "fullText": "I have to admit that when Sunderland signed two experienced international left-backs in the summer, I thought it would be curtains (sorry, not a pun, despite his hairstyle) for Dennis Cirkin.\n\nHe’s a player I’ve really fallen in love with over the years and I’ve really enjoyed watching his journey from being a League One rookie to a Premier League starter, but given his problems with his injured wrist — particularly over the summer and at the start of the season — it felt like it would only be a matter of time before he moved along.\n\nThere wasn’t just that, though, because there is of course still the elephant in the room that is his contract situation. Like Dan Neil — who has now of course moved on elsewhere — Cirkin’s current deal expires over the summer, or so we are led to believe, so it felt as though the club may choose to move him along, perhaps in January.\n\nThankfully, I’m glad that I can say that hasn’t been the case. Instead, whilst Masuaku and Reinildo were off playing for their countries at the AFCON tournament, Dennis put a string of solid performances in and showed that he really belongs at this level. He hasn’t looked out of place and has just kicked on once again, which of course I’m totally delighted by.\n\nLet’s not forget that this is a lad who was incredibly highly rated by José Mourinho at Spurs, and over the summer was called into the England U21s squad for the European Championships. Yes, he may have arrived at Sunderland as a young boy lacking in experience, but he’s always had the ability that could see him playing at a much higher level, and if anything, the question marks have been surrounding his fitness.\n\nSo really, nobody should be surprised that he’s played well in the team. What is perhaps more surprising is that his form, coupled with the great season we’ve had out of Reinildo so far (barring a small handful of hiccups), has led to the departure of the other left-back that we signed in the summer — Arthur Masuaku.\n\nMasuaku will have had many good offers in the summer to go elsewhere, but something must have been sold to him in order for him to head to Sunderland instead. He would have been under no illusions over the competition in the squad, but clearly he felt he could come back to the Premier League and thrive. His chance actually came pretty early on into the season — after a fine showing as a centre-half in our League Cup defeat to Huddersfield, a red card for Reinildo against Aston Villa copped him a three-game ban, and that was Arthur’s chance to shine and stake a claim for a regular starting berth. Instead, he did anything but, and that little three-game run in the side was obviously enough to make the club realise that he probably wasn’t up to the standards required. He’s had injuries and, of course, the AFCON tournament kept him out of contention, but he was nowhere near.\n\nRetour vers le ̶f̶u̶t̶u̶r̶ ̶ Racing 🔙 pic.twitter.com/TJOmAebSIm\n\n— Racing Club de Lens (@RCLens) January 27, 2026\n\nAll of that coupled with the great run that Cirkin had in the side over the festive period and into January must have made up the minds of the Sunderland bigwigs — the young, energetic upstart is seen as the strongest contender for Reinildo’s shirt, and given he’s fully aware of the demands of playing under Régis Le Bris, sticking by him makes the most sense.\n\nOn Saturday at West Ham, Reinildo had a shocker. He should have been sent off just before half-time and you have to think that the referee did him and us a favour, probably out of pity as we were already getting dusted three-nil. If a young player had made that tackle which should have seen him bag a second yellow we’d have been calling them naïve and inexperienced, so it was disappointing to see such bad decision-making from a lad who has seen and done it all in the game. He was, understandably, hooked at the break, and I thought we actually looked much better with Cirkin in the left-back spot. He once again reminded everyone watching that he’s not here to make up the numbers, and he wants to be starting games for Sunderland in the Premier League.\n\nWith Masuaku out of the picture, he’s gained that trust from his manager. Now it’s up to him to really push Reinildo day after day in training, and then, who knows? We could be talking about Cirkin edging himself ahead of one of our best players, which would have seemed unthinkable earlier in the season. At worst, he’s going to help to get the very best out of Reinildo, as having strong competition all over the pitch is vital.\n\nHaway Dennis, lad — get that new contract signed, and knuckle down. The future is bright!",

    "description": "Sunderland suffered defeat to West Ham at the weekend, but where did it go wrong for Le Bris?",
    "fullText": "Following on from their victory against Crystal Palace, Sunderland returned to the capital for the third away game in a row to face a West Ham side renewed with confidence following a last-minute winner from Callum Wilson the week prior.\n\nWith Granit Xhaka a confirmed fitness doubt for at least the next fortnight, for the first time this season Sunderland had to adjust to life without their captain and it’s safe to say things didn’t go to plan. How did Le Bris try to provide a more expansive setup away from home and how did it all go wrong at the London Stadium?\n\nWith rumours surfacing late on Friday evening that Xhaka had picked up a knock during last week’s game against Palace, suspicions were confirmed at 11:15am when it was revealed our Swiss captain had suffered some ankle damage and will be out for an extended period of rehab.\n\nIn the absence of Xhaka, Le Bris decided to go bold in his team selection and picked Eliezer Mayenda to come in as his replacement for this one. Opting for a more aggressive team selection and shape, Le Bris decided to utilise a 4-4-2 system similar to his spell in early 2025 with Sunderland in the Championship.\n\nIn Xhaka’s absence, the midfield three became a two as Noah Sadiki and Enzo Le Fée looked to control the middle whilst Trai Hume resumed his hybrid role in the right of midfield/right-back/central midfield depending on where he was needed most. Mayenda partnered Brian Brobbey up front and formed a far more attacking line-up than we’re used to witnessing away from home — a bold move by Le Bris.\n\nNuno Espírito Santo was at the helm this time around as Sunderland faced their second West Ham manager of the season, looking to make themselves the only side in the league to go three wins on the bounce following a last-minute Callum Wilson winner the week prior.\n\nNuno kept the same side with his newly formed January strike force of Pablo and Castellanos following their moves earlier in the window whilst Jared Bowen and Crysencio Summerville manned the wings for the Londoners.\n\nSticking with a traditional 4-2-3-1 shape, Nuno looks to be compact off the ball and utilises the direct running of his wingers paired with the physical presence of his forwards to hit teams on the counter whilst looking to avoid leaving gaps to be played through. Having conceded 44 league goals prior to this one, West Ham have had a notoriously leaky defence this season which has been somewhat helped by Nuno; however, their Achilles heel remains their ability to ship goals at home.\n\nGiven Nuno’s style and approach mentioned above, Sunderland were handed an unusual amount of possession from the opening whistle and looked to assert themselves early. Noah Sadiki stung the gloves of Areola in the opening minutes with a half-volley; however, after that, Sunderland looked rather directionless without their talisman in midfield.\n\nWith a plethora of early misplaced passes, Sunderland found themselves exposed on the counter-attack numerous times in the opening half-hour and looked to be at the mercy of both the West Ham wingers every time they broke with the ball. Due to the shape of the opposition, both Sunderland full-backs were edging forward paired with an additional midfielder in Le Fée, leaving Sunderland effectively 3 v 3 on the break during concerted possession.\n\nWith West Ham demanding that Sunderland took the game to them, Le Bris was forced into adopting a 3-5-2 shape in possession leaving effectively both central defenders and Sadiki the only men behind the ball during build-up. Pair this with the lack of Xhaka to help dictate the play, especially with the midfielder averaging over 45 passes per game whilst completing the most line-breaking passes of any of the Sunderland team this season.\n\nSummerville was able to open the scoring for the hosts with an emphatic header following a Jared Bowen breakaway which made a fool of Reinildo on the day. Both full-backs wouldn’t cover themselves in glory as initially Reinildo couldn’t handle the trickery of Bowen having been so reliable for us this season, whilst on the other side Nordi Mukiele — despite his towering size — allowed Summerville to run on his blindside and get the jump on the full-back.\n\nBefore the half-hour the game was all but over as a series of probing runs from Summerville resulted in Hume dangling a leg for just a second too long allowing Bowen to return the favour and slot home to see both wingers having scored and assisted for one another. Sunderland were unable to contain the barrage and couldn’t sustain an attack for long before Mateus Fernandes crushed the ball beyond Roefs and wrapped up the most disastrous half of football so far this season for the lads.\n\nWhilst Sunderland made somewhat of an improvement in the second half, ultimately the game state meant that irrespective of performance, West Ham were far more passive in possession knowing the game was essentially a formality as the minutes ticked down. The real question here though is: was the poor showing down to personnel or tactics?\n\nWhilst losing Xhaka is understandably a big blow due to his raw ability on the football pitch, arguably his biggest loss came in the form of his intangibles. As we saw when Dan Neil moved from his anchoring role in seasons past, without Xhaka orchestrating the game flow from in front of his defence, other players were required to force the ball through the lines and resulted in Hume having an uncomfortable afternoon in possession. With only 15/19 completed passes in the first half and a 0% duel success rate he was unfortunately hooked to change the shape of the side and perform some damage limitation.\n\nSunderland’s shape caused arguably more issues than the lack of our talisman captain and in some ways, I can’t fault Le Bris for attempting something more expansive. Prior to the weekend, Sunderland had only scored two away goals since December and fans were calling for a more aggressive and expansive approach to playing away from home.\n\nWith West Ham susceptible to conceding, it felt like a logical choice to experiment with and potentially alter Sunderland’s dismal attacking output. In reality however, Sunderland produced their second lowest first-half xG of the season away from home with only their game against Manchester City at the Etihad producing less. With only one shot on target and four attempts in total, the shape saw Mayenda often confused on where to position himself around Brobbey and a gaping hole between the midfield and attacking lines in build-up.\n\nWith Hume inverting on the right and Mundle unable to get any change out of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, having only 17 touches, no take-ons/dribbles and 4 dispossessions in the first half, things made for ugly viewing. Sunderland were forcing attacks through the middle and drilled balls into both Brian Brobbey and Mayenda didn’t stick or were wide of the mark on several occasions.\n\nWhilst it’s a harsh learning curve for Le Bris having tried to catch the opposition unaware of his change in shape like he did away to Burnley and Sheffield United last season, the Premier League is a different beast. I assume we’ll see Le Bris revert to type against Burnley and utilise his regular system now Diarra looks fully fit.\n\nWhilst it really was the epitome of a bad day at the office for Sunderland, positive signs can be taken from the second-half substitutes as the likes of Habib Diarra and Chemsdine Talbi returned to the fold whilst Dennis Cirkin and Luke O’Nien both put in respectable shifts in the second half.\n\nWhilst Diarra will gain the plaudits for his marauding run that resulted in the assist, Chemsdine Talbi displayed his typical tidiness and ball retention with a 100% pass accuracy and a perfectly delivered cross for Wilson Isidor to rocket over the bar. With both players likely to start against Burnley we’re expecting to see a much more composed attacking display.\n\nThinking About the Bigger Picture\n\nNow that the dust has settled, it’s easy to see why and how things went wrong against West Ham; however, we’ve got to remember where we are and how little Sunderland have suffered a heavy defeat this season. Sat on 33 points at this point in the season still remains beyond expectations and with an opportunity to all but confirm safety against Burnley, we’ve got to view the bigger picture.\n\nRégis Le Bris has done a fantastic job at eking out the most he can from an attacking standpoint whilst remaining as defensively solid as Sunderland have this season so he’s earned more than enough trust from the Sunderland faithful. Let’s write this one off and with a week to recover, go again on Monday night.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest host Ferencváros at the City Ground this Thursday while they aim to secure a vital victory to climb the table.\n\nThe Tricky Trees have already moved into the knockout round play-offs following a successful campaign. Manager Sean Dyche will be desperate for a win to keep their automatic qualification hopes alive. Forest currently boast a perfect home record in this competition under Dyche. A victory tonight would mark the first time they have won three consecutive home games in a single major European campaign since 1979.\n\nSean Dyche manages a squad currently hit by a significant suspension to his star midfielder. Notably, Elliot Anderson is unavailable following his red card in the recent defeat to Braga. Chris Wood and John Victor also remain on the treatment table with knee injuries. Consequently, the manager is expected to name a strong lineup to reclaim momentum after their weekend Premier League victory.\n\nMatz Sels will start in goal behind a defensive partnership of Nikola Milenkovic and Morato. In midfield, Ryan Yates is expected to link up with Ibrahim Sangaré to provide defensive stability. Morgan Gibbs-White will operate in the number 10 role to support the attack. Igor Jesus, who scored in Sunday’s win at Brentford, is expected to lead the line once again. Callum Hudson-Odoi is also pushing for a start out wide.\n\nNottingham Forest predicted XI: Sels; Savona, Milenkovic, Morato, Williams; Yates, Sangare; Ndoye, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi; Jesus\n\nThe Europa League league-phase fixture takes place at the City Ground on Thursday, 29 January 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on TNT Sports via the discovery+ app. Coverage begins before the kick-off on both the website and the mobile app.\n\nRead more- Remembering Chelsea’s iconic Champions League comeback against Napoli\n\nSee Also- Wolves submit loan bid for England midfielder Gomes\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Grassroots sports groups across the West Midlands have welcomed government funding to help improve their facilities.\n\nLast year, 991 projects across the UK received money through the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme to improve things like floodlights, goalposts and all-weather pitches.\n\nA new round of funding has now opened and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has invited community organisations to apply for a share of an £85m grant.\n\nFor football groups in Herefordshire and Warwickshire, the funds they were previously awarded had a massive impact on the children they support.\n\nIn total, clubs in Coventry and Warwickshire received more than £310,000 to upgrade their facilities.\n\nThe funding ranged from just under £250,000 for new changing rooms at Racing Club Warwick, to just over £1,000 for Upper Lighthorne Football Club for new goalposts.\n\nNuneaton-based Camp Hill Educational Sports and Social, better known as Chess FC, was awarded £6,017 to buy portable floodlights for their training pitches at Hill Top Playing Fields in Arley.\n\nClub chairperson Ian Andrew said it meant their eight junior teams, including an under-15 girls side, could train anywhere on the surface at night and in all weathers.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"They love coming along in the evening. It's pitch black and they've got the chance to run around and feel like professional footballers playing under lights.\"\n\nRacing Club Warwick received just under £250,000 to build new changing rooms at their Townsend Meadow ground.\n\nClub chairman Gary Vella said: \"When you've got a 3G pitch and you've got game after game, particularly for juniors, you need changing facilities. The women's game, disability football, all need their own changing areas, so this will help push us on.\"\n\nNearly £60,000 was given to 16 clubs across Herefordshire and Worcestershire and the DCMS said the money was aimed at giving families affordable ways to stay healthy.\n\nDavid Pembridge, from Wessington Juniors FC in Hereford, said: \"Throughout Herefordshire there's a massive shortage of indoor facilities.\n\n\"It's very costly so any time that you're hiring indoor facilities, which could be anything from £50 an hour, when you've got 11 teams, that quickly racks up to thousands and thousands which makes it less affordable for parents.\"\n\nThe group was awarded a grant to provide portable floodlights\n\nHe added: \"Every winter since we have been able to continue training outside in almost all weathers, when the clocks change it doesn't mean football stops it means that we can carry on and the children still get their weekly fix of football.\"\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"This is sport delivering for the nation. Every pound we invest in grassroots facilities is a pound that takes pressure off our NHS, supports mental and physical health, and opens doors for new community members to benefit from sport - like women and girls who've been shut out for too long.\"\n\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.\n\nEngland inspire women footballers of the future\n\nFoundation to increase free football for adults\n\nGrassroots football teams get government funding\n\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport",

    "description": "Cleveland's unique 10-inch drop off between the court and the arena floor came into focus again during the Lakers game.",
    "fullText": "Luka Doncic grabbed at his left leg. He immediately thought of Dru Smith. The Miami Heat guard’s knee injury suffered in 2023 when he slipped off the side of the Cleveland Cavaliers court haunted Doncic while he winced in pain near the Lakers bench.\n\nThe Lakers superstar avoided serious injury after falling off the side of the Cavaliers’ raised court on Monday, but the threat of a player being hurt by Cleveland’s unique 10-inch drop off between the court and the arena floor came into focus again during the Lakers’ 129-99 loss to the Cavaliers.\n\n“It is absolutely a safety hazard,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said after Doncic was able to return later in the first quarter. “And I don't know why it's still like that. I don't. You know, you can lodge formal complaints. A lot of times you don't see any change when you lodge a formal complaint.”\n\nDoncic was injured shooting a fadeaway three with 7:58 left in the first quarter. He was hopping on one foot after releasing the shot and hopped right off the platform, grabbing immediately for his left leg. When he hobbled to the locker room, Doncic could barely put any weight on his leg.\n\nBut he returned with 1:32 remaining in the first quarter and finished with 29 points, six assists and five rebounds. He didn’t have any additional braces or wraps on his left leg, but he said he didn’t feel quite 100%.\n\n“I kind of got scared,” Doncic said. “It wasn't a great feeling and looking back at the video I think I got a little bit lucky. It hurts obviously more now, but, just, I tried to go.\"\n\nSmith was injured much more severely in 2023 when he was closing out on defense, landed on a stat sheet and slipped over the edge. He suffered a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament sprain in the accident, and the Heat contacted the NBA to express concerns about the floor at the time.\n\n“It’s tough to see another player get hurt on this court, with the fall, with the drop off,” Lakers guard Gabe Vincent said Monday, “so hopefully something can get fixed with that, but we’re fortunate that [Doncic] is OK.”\n\nCleveland’s Rocket Arena, which opened in 1994 and was last renovated in 2019, is also home to the Cleveland Monsters, an American Hockey League affiliate of the Columbus Blue Jackets. The basketball court is raised to accommodate the ice underneath the floor. But several teams in the NBA, including the Lakers, share their arena with hockey teams and none have a court that drops off like Cleveland’s.\n\n“It's the only court like this so, I guess it's my fault,” Doncic said. “I [gotta] stop jumping like that.\"\n\nThe Lakers have history with concerning courts this year. In November, Doncic said during a postgame news conference that the Lakers’ custom NBA Cup court used during a home game against the Clippers was dangerously slippery. The team flagged the problem to the league and the Lakers did not use the court again because it was not deemed safe for play in time for the other NBA Cup games.\n\nBut when asked if there was a way he could bring the latest problem up with the league, Doncic demurred.\n\n“I don’t know,” Doncic said, “don’t involve me in that.”\n\nSimilarly, Redick said any changes would be \"way above my pay grade.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa conclude their remarkably successful Europa League league-phase campaign on Thursday night at Villa Park, hosting RB Salzburg, fighting for their continental survival.\n\nUnai Emery’s men have already mathematically secured a top-eight finish. This guarantees them direct passage to the Round of 16. They will be eager to maintain momentum after a clinical 2-0 victory at Newcastle on Sunday. Conversely, the visitors find themselves in a desperate position. Currently sitting 28th in the table, the Austrian champions must secure a maiden victory on English soil.\n\nDate: Thursday, 29 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: First competitive meeting\n\nUnai Emery is expected to rotate his squad heavily tonight. Midfield metronome Youri Tielemans is out with a significant ankle injury. He joins captain John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara on the sidelines. Ross Barkley remains a major doubt with a knee issue. While Tammy Abraham has returned to the club permanently, he is not registered for this phase. Marco Bizot is likely to continue in goal to manage the workload of Emiliano Martínez.\n\nThe visitors are still without Takumu Kawamura and John Mellberg. Both players are currently recovering from long-term knee injuries. However, their attack remains a significant threat. Teenage winger Kerim Alajbegovic is in fine form following a brace against Basel. He is expected to support top scorer Petar Ratkov. Ratkov has netted 12 goals in all competitions this term.\n\nVilla Park has become a European fortress for the Villans once again. Including qualifiers, the club has won 14 of their last 16 home matches in Europe. They are now chasing a record-breaking seventh successive home European win. Curiously, all five of Villa’s home goals in this competition have been scored by players with surnames beginning with M.\n\nThe Austrian side faces a daunting task in Birmingham. Salzburg are winless in all eight of their previous major European meetings with English clubs. Furthermore, they have lost their last five away matches in major continental competitions. They have never lost six in a row on the road. A loss tonight would likely end their hopes of climbing into the play-off spots.\n\nAston Villa Predicted XI: Bizot; Garcia, Lindelöf, Mings, Digne; Bogarde, Onana, Hemmings; Sancho, Guessand, Buendía\n\nRed Bull Salzburg Predicted XI: Schlager; Trummer, Gadou, Schuster, Krätzig; Kitano, Diabaté, Bidstrup; Baidoo, Ratkov, Alajbegovic\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on TNT Sports 2. Coverage begins before the 20:00 GMT kick-off.\n\nRead more- Wolves submit loan bid for England midfielder Gomes\n\nSee Also- Newcastle, Everton and West Ham chase Genoa right-back\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Manchester United need to get rid of a lot of deadwood come the end of the season.\n\nWhile a few are currently a part of the first team squad, many are out on loan. One of them is Andre Onana.\n\nSigned by Erik ten Hag as David de Gea’s successor, the ex-Ajax ace made more high-profile blunders than saves during his time in Manchester.\n\nArguably “one of the worst goalkeepers” to don the United jersey, the Cameroonian was banished to Trabzonspor after a series of mistakes last season and at the start of the current campaign.\n\nWhile the Turkish side would love to sign the African ace permanently in the summer, it is unlikely they can afford to pay the goalie’s wages and meet INEOS’ asking price.\n\nThe Cameroon international had expressed his desire to return to Old Trafford in a bid to resurrect his United career, but INEOS are simply not interested.\n\nAs per recent reports, the 29-year-old’s former club Inter Milan are keen on a reunion and even met with the goalkeeper’s agents.\n\nAndre Onana earns €108,269 per week including bonuses at Trabzonspor (via capology), more that he would have earned at Old Trafford.\n\nAnd he is unlikely to take a paycut to join the Nerazzurri. As revealed by The Daily Mail, the Red Devils might need to pay him off to finally get rid of him.\n\n“Andre Onana could be handed the opportunity to return to Inter Milan from Manchester United this summer after his agents held talks with the Serie A club.\n\n“Onana still owns a property in Milan, although wages could be a stumbling block. Onana was given a pay rise when he joined Trabzonspor from United once it became clear that he could not stay as back-up to Lammens.\n\n“The former Barcelona and Ajax keeper still has two-and-a-half years left on his contract at Old Trafford, so United may have to pay him off to enable any deal to go through.”\n\nWhether INEOS will agree to the proposal remains to be seen. The 20-time English league champions did the right thing by bringing in Senne Lammens, who has proven to be a calming presence between the sticks.\n\nFeature image Michael Regan via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The K League has unveiled the official trophy that will be used for the Coupang Play K League Super Cup 2026, as well as brand-new sleeve patches for the reigning champions.\n\nThe K League has a fresh look about it heading into the 2026 season, with new teams in K League 2 and newcomers to K League 1. There's also the return of the Super Cup, which has been given a brand new trophy.\n\nK League says that the newly revealed Super Cup trophy reflects a design concept symbolising the start of a rise to the throne. Featuring a V-shaped metal structure representing rays of victory, the trophy captures both the beginning of a new season and the dignity of a champion. Furthermore, the upward-stretching structural lines visually emphasise a team’s rising energy and the presence of the title winner.\n\nIn particular, the high-gloss silver finish strongly reflects spotlights, creating the effect of the trophy appearing as a source of light, while the asymmetrical structure symbolises the unpredictability of competition and the dynamic collision between the two teams.\n\nThe Super Cup trophy embodies both the meaning of a new season’s kickoff and the excitement of a one-match showdown.\n\nThe K League Super Cup is an official K League-hosted competition held ahead of the new season and will return for the first time since 2006. It is contested between the previous season’s K League 1 champions and the Korea Cup winners. If one club wins both competitions, the K League 1 runners-up will participate instead.\n\nThis year’s Super Cup will be held at 2 p.m. on Saturday, February 21, one week before the start of the K League 1 season, at Jeonju World Cup Stadium. Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, who completed a league-and-cup double last season, will face Daejeon Hana Citizen, who finished runners-up in K League 1 to record the best league result in the club’s history.\n\nThe winner of the match will claim the Super Cup trophy, marking the official start of the new season. The match will be played over 90 minutes and then straight to penalties if the score is level. The winners will receive 200 million Korean won, and the runners-up 100 million.\n\nCoupang Play is the title sponsor of the event, and ticket sales and live broadcasting will both be handled via Coupang Play. Ticket information will be announced on the Coupang Play official website on Friday, January 30. Ticket sales will begin on Friday, February 6 via the Coupang Play mobile app, with Sports Pass presales opening at 12 noon, followed by general sales at 8 p.m.\n\nWhile chasing a new trophy, Jeonbuk will have newly-designed K League champions patches on their sleeves.\n\nK League says that the patch is a unique league symbol representing that all teams competing in K League-organised competitions hold equal status.\n\nPreviously, the champions patch was based on the official competition logo, which includes the league’s title sponsor Hana Bank, and featured the same design as the standard league patch but with a gold finish to differentiate it. In contrast, the new champions patch incorporates each club’s unique elements into the design, capturing both team identity and pride in winning the title.\n\nThe redesigned champions patch combines graphic elements inspired by the club’s home stadium with the championship trophy, visually expressing the winning team’s symbolic identity in an intuitive way. The update goes beyond a league-wide emblem, reflecting the intention to also celebrate the champions’ history and achievements.\n\nAs a result, 2025 K League 1 champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors will wear the new champions patch during the 2026 season, featuring Jeonju World Cup Stadium, the club’s record of 10 K League 1 titles, and the championship trophy.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa host Red Bull Salzburg at Villa Park this Thursday, aiming to conclude their Europa League league phase campaign on a high note.\n\nUnai Emery’s side sits comfortably in second place, having already secured automatic qualification for the Round of 16. Although a solitary defeat to Go Ahead Eagles mars their record, Villa have otherwise dominated, winning six of their seven fixtures. With a top-eight finish guaranteed, the pressure lifts, granting Emery the luxury of rotation.\n\nHe intends to rest key starters ahead of crucial domestic fixtures. However, the objective remains clear: extend a formidable home record. Villa have transformed their ground into a fortress, winning all three European home matches this season. A victory tonight ensures they enter the knockout stages with maximum momentum.\n\nUnai Emery navigates a significant midfield crisis. A severe ankle injury sustained against Newcastle rules out Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future. He joins John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara on the sidelines. Consequently, Emery looks to his squad depth, handing opportunities to fringe players and promising youngsters.\n\nIn goal, Marco Bizot steps in for Emiliano Martínez, affording the Argentine a deserved rest. Tyrone Mings leads the defence, partnering winter signing Victor Lindelöf. Further forward, Amadou Onana anchors the midfield alongside Lamare Bogarde. Finally, Jadon Sancho and Emiliano Buendía provide the creativity to support lone striker Evann Guessand.\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Garcia, Lindelöf, Mings, Digne; Bogarde, Onana, Hemmings; Sancho, Guessand, Buendía\n\nThe Europa League league-phase fixture takes place at Villa Park on Thursday, 29 January 2026.

    "description": "Utah State achieved their largest victory over Wyoming in their 96 years playing each other.",
    "fullText": "In anticipation of Wednesday night’s clash with Wyoming, The HURD elected to turn the Utah State student section at The Spectrum into a “pinkout.”\n\nAnd four minutes into the game, the Aggies surely had Wyoming head coach Sundance Wicks wishing he had access to an antacid the shade of Pepto Bismol at his disposal.\n\nUtah State put together an early 13-0 run against the Cowboys to force Wicks into calling a timeout just over four minutes into the contest, and the Aggies never looked back, cruising to a 94-62 win.\n\nThe 32-point margin of victory over Wyoming was the largest by Utah State in the series, which dates back to 1930 with 93 total games.\n\n“I was really proud of our guys’ effort tonight,” USU head coach Jerrod Calhoun said. “I thought we did an incredible job of creating advantages and playing for each other.”\n\nSenior guard Kolby King came off the bench to knock down four 3-point attempts and score a season-high 20 points for the Aggies (17-3 overall, 8-2 in the Mountain West), who shot 55% from the field as a team against the Cowboys (12-9, 3-7).\n\n“Coach had an amazing game plan for this game to get into the middle of the paint and kick out for threes. And we had great space tonight,” said King, who finished 6 for 9 from the field, 4 of 6 from 3-point range and pulled down a team-best seven rebounds in 25 minutes. “You can see the results; we made shots.”\n\nUtah State racked up 28 assists against a season-low five turnovers while facing Wyoming’s 3-2 zone defense, which provided ample room for the Aggies to successfully hoist up baseline threes from the corners. Utah State went 8 of 16 from 3-point range in the first half, and 13 for 34 from beyond the arc for the game, with many of those misfires coming over the final six or seven minutes when the Aggies were up by as many as 38 points.\n\nIn addition to King, the Aggies got strong first-half contributions from junior guard Mason Falslev (12 points, five assists, two steals) and freshman forward Adlan Elamin (nine points, five rebounds) on their way to putting together a 50-28 halftime lead. Senior forward Garry Clark, who sat much of the first half after picking up two fouls in one minute, bounced back to total 13 points and five rebounds while junior guard Tucker Anderson also came off the bench to knock down three 3-pointers and score 11 points.\n\nMJ Collins Jr., the leading scorer in the Mountain West at 19.3 points per game, finished with 12 points and four assists while knocking down half of his 10 field goal attempts.\n\n“I was really proud of MJ tonight,” Calhoun said. “All I heard from him all night was ‘Just keep shooting, Kolby. Just keep shooting.’ And he had four assists and no turnovers.\n\n“The last four games he hasn’t been as good. And we went through stretches like that with Ian (Martinez) last year. ... But there’s a lot of things that shooters can do without shooting threes, and I thought he played one of his better games tonight.”\n\nThe Aggies outscored the Cowboys 14-2 on fast breaks, the USU bench dominated the visitors 54-13 and the rebounding battle was an even 36-36, which is significant since Wyoming came into the game first in the Mountain West with a rebound margin of +6.80 rebounds per game.\n\nSenior guard Leland Walker put up 24 points and buried four 3-point attempts for the Cowboys, but freshman guard Nasir Meyer was the only other visiting player to score in double figures in what could be Wyoming’s final visit to the Spectrum with Utah State moving on to the Pac-12 next season.\n\nOverall, the Cowboys shot just 35% for the game and finished 8 for 32 from 3-point range.\n\nWyoming did score the first basket of the game, but the Aggies scored 15 of the next 17 points, the majority of them by Falslev and Elamin. That meant the sellout crowd of 10,270 was behind the Aggies early on, and the hosts, who were wearing throwback uniforms similar to USU’s look from the late ‘80s, continued to add to their lead throughout the first half.\n\nUtah State, which let a 14-point advantage in the second half get away from them in a home loss to UNLV on Jan. 20, quickly put the game away after halftime by coming up with three turnovers on Wyoming’s first three possessions. That defense helped spark a 12-2 run that left the Aggies up 62-30 just three minutes into the second half.\n\n“Our guys were really on it tonight,” Calhoun said. “Not a lot of guys played a lot of minutes, so we can do more tomorrow at practice. It helps the entire organization in the planning when you don’t have to play guys 32 to 35 minutes, you know? So, the guys should feel pretty good about what they just did.”\n\nThat should help the Aggies heading into Saturday’s showdown with San Diego State at the Spectrum. The Aztecs (15-5, 9-1) won at Colorado State late Wednesday night to maintain their first-place hold in the Mountain West standings, just ahead of Utah State and New Mexico (17-4, 8-2), who are currently tied for second place.",

    "fullText": "Bad news for all fans who support the German teams in the Champions League. After the league phase of the premier class ended last night, a duel between two German teams is already looming in the playoffs.\n\nUnlike Bayern Munich, who have directly qualified for the round of 16, Dortmund and Leverkusen must enter the playoffs. Here, the worst-case scenario could occur during the draw on Friday from 12 PM. Why?\n\nAs the 17th in the final table, Borussia Dortmund forms a pair with Olympiakos Piraeus (18th). This pair meets the duo of places 15/16 with Atalanta Bergamo and Bayer Leverkusen. This means: The probability of a German duel being drawn is very high.\n\nIn the worst case, the Bundesliga could lose important points in the battle for international places. Another Bundesliga duel threatens in the round of 16, as Bayern awaits then.\n\nSince it's easy to get confused with all the CL madness, we provide you with an overview of the teams in the playoffs.\n\nThe biggest surprises in the playoffs are definitely Qarabag and Bodø/Glimt.

    "description": "According to a new report, Jayson Tatum is re-evaluating his situation and considering sitting out for the rest of this season.",
    "fullText": "Jayson Tatum’s return felt like a looming possibility as he continued to rehab his Achilles tear from last year’s playoffs. But according to NBA insider Chris Haynes, those comeback plans could be put on pause for the foreseeable future.\n\nHaynes reported late Wednesday night that Tatum is “re-evaluating his situation” when it comes to a return this season. That’s a drastic change in his plan considering it sounded like he was going to be back on the court soon, telling people about it.\n\n“It is up in the air on if he’s going to return at all this season,” Haynes said. “I was told there were a couple of factors of why he’s reached that point. But as of right now, that changes the whole landscape because Tatum even told me personally he was returning at some point. I was hearing he was getting close and league sources told me that the situation has changed.”\n\nTatum told ESPN that he hasn’t made a decision on if he’ll return this season because he “wants to get it right the first time, so it’s just a lot to think about.”\n\nThe Celtics have put together a surprisingly strong start to the season without Tatum, going 29-18 through their first 47 games to hold the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. Tatum showcased his recovery in front of reporters last week in Detroit, going through a full 45-minute workout that included some dribbling and 1-on-1 drills with assistant coach Tony Dobbins.\n\n“It’s been amazing to see,” Derrick White said after the workout. “Obviously, all the work he’s put in. You just kind of see him being around more and being able to do more, so that’s exciting to see as a friend. So, every day he’s been working hard and it’s good to see all that hard work add to some more movement and more opportunities.”\n\nThe All-Star has been a constant figure with the team all year long, traveling on the team’s road trips while also attending meetings and film sessions.\n\nTatum underwent surgery to repair his torn Achilles on May 13, 2025, which put him eight months and two weeks into his recovery. Tatum’s father, Justin, told ESPN last May that the Celtics star was aiming for a return to the floor after 8-9 months.\n\nHowever, Tatum admitted some trepidation about returning this season for the first time this week in an interview on “The Pivot Podcast.” He pointed out how the Celtics have built an identity on the court as an East contender. It’s the first-time ever Tatum hasn’t started a season with the team in training camp, so he had some apprehension about coming back this season.\n\nDecisions will have to be made, but it’s still only late-January. So there’s still time for Tatum and his team to mull over any final say on whether he’ll play this season. But it did sound like Tatum was rethinking his return for this season.\n\n“They have an identity this year or things that they felt has clicked for them and has been successful,” Tatum said. “There is a thought in my head, ‘How does that work?’ or ‘How does that look with me integrating myself off with injury and 50, 60 games into a season?’\n\n“Obviously, there could be some challenges. It is a thought like, ‘Damn, do I come back? Or should I wait?’ It’s something that, recently, in the last two weeks or so just kind of contemplate every single day.”\n\n4 takeaways as Celtics lose to Hawks in chippy affair\n\nCeltics trade rumors: Latest big man linked to Boston\n\nCeltics big man drawing trade interest from 3 teams\n\nWhat Celtics rivals are threats to make Giannis Antetokounmpo trade?",

    "title": "5 of the biggest takeaways from Meta's Q4 2025 earnings call",
    "description": "Meta's Q4 2025 earnings reveal massive AI investment plans, ad-driven revenue growth, and costly Reality Labs losses.",
    "fullText": "Meta's earnings sent a clear signal to Wall Street on Wednesday: while its core advertising engine is still firing on all cylinders, the price tag for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI ambitions will skyrocket in 2026.\n\nThe company reported $59.89 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025, topping Wall Street's forecasts. Meta's stock jumped as high as 10% in after-hours trading.\n\nAlongside the upbeat numbers, Meta laid out how hard it plans to push in 2026. The company said it expects to spend $115 billion to $135 billion next year on capital expenditures — largely on the computers and data centers that power AI.\n\nIn other words, Meta still makes most of its money from ads. It's asking investors to stay on board as it pours an extraordinary amount of cash into the race to build more powerful AI and weave it into Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and virtual and augmented reality products, collectively used by more than 3.5 billion people daily around the world.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Meta's Q4 2025 earnings call.\n\nMeta told to brace for a much more expensive 2026 as it pours money into the compute and data centers needed to power its AI push. The company said it expects capital expenditures in 2026 to land between $115 billion and $135 billion — up to almost double the $72 billion it spent in 2025.\n\nMeta's chief financial officer, Susan Li, said the increased expenditure will support Meta Superintelligence Labs' efforts and its core business.\n\nLi also warned that Meta's overall costs are set to climb fast. The company expects total 2026 expenses of $162 billion to $169 billion, with most of the increase coming from \"infrastructure costs,\" including \"third-party cloud spend, higher depreciation, and higher infrastructure operating expenses.\"\n\nAnd Meta isn't just buying more machines — it's also paying for people to run them. Li said the \"second-largest contributor\" to expense growth will be compensation, driven by \"investments in technical talent,\" including hires in \"priority areas, particularly AI.\"\n\nAdvertising once again powered Meta's quarter. The company reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue in Q4 2025, up 24% from the same time last year. That growth came from a mix of showing more ads (ad impressions rose 18% from the same quarter last year) and charging a bit more per ad (average price per ad rose 6%).\n\nWhen analysts pressed Zuckerberg on whether Meta can build meaningful businesses beyond ads, given how much cash it's pouring into AI, he didn't dodge the question of its dependency.\n\n\"For the next couple of years, ads are going to be by far the most important driver of growth in our business,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is working on new bets alongside that core engine.\n\nMeta's pitch is that its AI investments are already making the ad machine work better — not just by targeting, but by improving the systems that decide which ads people will most likely engage with.\n\nThe company said that its AI tools for making video ads hit a $10 billion revenue run rate. It also said a newer measurement product helped advertisers drive 24% more conversions than its standard method — and ramped up to a multi-billion-dollar annual run rate in just seven months.\n\nReality Labs, the division behind Meta's virtual and augmented reality efforts, continued to burn cash in the final quarter of 2025. The division lost $6.02 billion in a quarter, the highest ever, and $19.19 billion in 2025 — numbers that underscore how much Meta's ambitions to build immersive worlds still depend on ad revenue.\n\nDespite laying off about 1,500 people at Reality Labs earlier this month, Meta told investors not to expect a sudden turnaround. Li said the company expects Reality Labs' operating losses in 2026 to remain \"similar to 2025 levels.\"\n\nZuckerberg is trying to reposition what Reality Labs is building. The company's focus has shifted from trying to go all in on the \"metaverse\" to building AI-powered smart glasses and experiences that could live inside Meta's existing apps.\n\nWhen Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked about Meta's plans to bring Horizon Worlds, a virtual hangout zone accessible on the company's Quest VR headsets, to mobile, Zuckerberg said that he expects more \"interactive and immersive\" content formats to show up directly inside the feeds in Meta's existing apps.\n\nHe added that people might be able to use AI to create a game with a single prompt and share it on their feeds so that others can \"jump right into it.\"\n\nHe positioned Horizon Worlds as a natural fit for an \"immersive 3D\" version of that idea and said that Meta's work on VR software and Horizon could pair with AI advances to bring these kinds of experiences to \"hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile.\"\n\nMeta isn't just trying to sprinkle AI features across Facebook and Instagram. Zuckerberg is making a bigger argument: if Meta wants to shape the next generation of consumer tech, it needs to control the underlying AI, not just depend on whatever rivals sell.\n\nThat's also the framing behind his public push for \"personal superintelligence,\" which he called out again as a key focus for 2026.\n\nWhen Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski asked how critical it is for Meta to have a general-purpose model, Zuckerberg leaned into Meta's identity as a \"deep technology company.\"\n\nWhat allows Meta to build everything it does, he said, \"is that we build and control the underlying technology.\" That way, Meta can design the experiences it wants, \"and not just be constrained to what others in the ecosystem are building or allow us to build,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nHe suggested that relying on outside models could become risky over time, citing a mix of competitive and safety reasons. That's why, he said, it's important for Meta to have its own models, both from a business perspective and because Meta wants to \"actually design and build the experiences that we believe that we should be building for people.\"\n\nZuckerberg is pitching 2026 as the year AI changes not just Meta's products, but how Meta itself operates. On the call, he said 2026 will be \"the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work\" and that the company is \"investing in AI native tooling so individuals at Meta can get more done.\"\n\nHe also described a deliberate shift in org design.\n\n\"We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is already seeing \"projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person.\"\n\nLi paired that cultural pitch with a concrete productivity claim. She said that since the beginning of 2025, Meta has seen a \"30% increase in output per engineer\" overall, and that \"power users\" of its internal AI coding tools saw output rise 80% year-over-year.\n\nThe company's implied bet? Spend heavily on AI infrastructure and tooling, and then run leaner teams that can ship more.\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "description": "The Big Tech rivals are spending more than ever, but analysts are more concerned about Microsoft at the moment.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street had very different reactions to two of Big Tech's biggest spenders after quarterly earnings reports came out on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Meta and Microsoft reported higher-than-expected capex. While both companies beat revenue expectations, Microsoft's stock sank more than 6% after-hours, while Meta's stock jumped as high as 9%.\n\nBig Tech's spending has risen sharply in the last two years, driven by investments in massive AI data centers. Wall Street has started to question when those investments will pay off, and analysts are giving some companies a much harder time than others.\n\nMeta reported capex of $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the year, up from 2024's $39.2 billion. That number will climb in 2026 — the company estimates capex will be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion for the year, driven by increased spending on Meta SuperIntelligence Labs, the company's big bet on speeding up AI model development.\n\n\"We plan to continue to prioritize investing in the business to support these opportunities,\" CFO Susan Li told investors on Wednesday's call.\n\nMicrosoft logged $37.5 billion in capex for the quarter, up 66% from one year ago. Most of that spend went toward CPUs and GPUs, the powerful computing chips that run AI workloads. The company said the spending was necessary to support fast-growing demand for its cloud and AI business.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue was 81.3 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the previous year. Meta reported $55.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $200.1 billion for all of 2025.\n\nWhile both surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations, analysts gave Microsoft a much harder time than Meta over its surging capex.\n\nPart of that could be Microsoft's heavy investments in GPU chips, which can become costly given their short life spans.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said that a core issue for investors, as Microsoft's capex grows faster than they expected, \"comes down to ROI on capex spend over time.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also heavily exposed to a single customer, another concern for investors. Nearly half — 45% — of the company's remaining performance obligations are attributed to OpenAI.\n\n\"There's obviously concern about the durability,\" Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said of the backlog.\n\nMicrosoft holds a $135 billion stake in OpenAI and has invested more than $13 billion into the company since 2019.\n\nWhile OpenAI does not directly carry a heavy debt load, some of its partners, including Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia, have taken on massive amounts of debt to fund data center buildouts, fueling Wall Street's anxiety over a potential AI bubble.\n\nOracle is struggling to finance its $500 billion data center initiative, Business Insider reported last week, amid growing concerns about its credit rating and risk.\n\nOn the Meta earnings call, Li noted that Meta's cash reserves, thanks to its very profitable ad business, will fuel its AI spending spree next year.\n\n\"We have a strong net cash balance, and expect our business will continue to generate sufficient cash to fund our infrastructure investments in 2026,\" Li said.",

    "description": "OpenAI and Microsoft have a reconfigured relationship. The software giant revealed just how much OpenAI is driving its RPO.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is facing capacity constraints, and OpenAI is driving a large portion of the backlog in its cloud computing business.\n\nThe company said its backlog in commercial bookings, a metric referred to as remaining performance obligations, ballooned 110% year over year to $625 billion when it reported earnings for the second quarter on Wednesday.\n\nOpenAI accounts for roughly 45% of those commitments, Microsoft revealed. The company did not say how much OpenAI contributed during the previous quarter.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts on the call expressed concerns about Microsoft's dependency on OpenAI.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella said acquiring more Azure clients is important to the tech giant, but it can't come at the expense of neglecting its other services.\n\n\"If you think about it, acquiring an Azure customer is super important to us, but so is acquiring an M365 or a GitHub or a Dragon Copilot, which are all, by the way, incremental businesses and TAMs for us,\" Nadella said during Microsoft's second-quarter earnings call. \"And so we don't want to maximize just one business of ours.\"\n\nShares of Microsoft fell more than 6% in after-market trading on Wednesday, even as the tech giant posted an overall earnings beat.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said during the call that some on Wall Street may be spooked by slower growth in overall Azure revenue and the increase in capex spending. Microsoft's capital expenditures rose 66% year over year to $37.5 billion in the second quarter, another record for the company and testament to the sheer amount of money tech companies are spending amid the AI race.\n\nCFO Amy Hood said that Microsoft has to look at many different areas when it allocates the GPUs and CPUs that come online as a result of its capex spending, including investing in the growth of first-party apps like Microsoft Copilot, devoting GPUs to research and development, and the talent they've acquired.\n\n\"You end up with the remainder going towards serving the Azure capacity that continues to grow in terms of demand,\" she said.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in facing capacity issues.\n\nExecutives at OpenAI, which has pledged to spend $250 billion on Azure services, have repeatedly said the startup is held back by a lack of compute, forcing tough trade-offs between product and research.\n\nWednesday's earnings mark the first quarter since OpenAI completed its restructuring, which included a new agreement with Microsoft, the startup's largest investor. Microsoft owns 27% of the public benefit corporation.\n\n\"It's a great partnership,\" Hood said of Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI. It's allowed us to remain a leader in terms of what we're building and being on the cutting edge of app innovation.\"",

Jones and Riley McCabe, published on Tuesday, examined Russia's three major pushes on the front lines following its seizure of Avdiivka in February 2024.\n\n\"After seizing the initiative in 2024, Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters per day in their most prominent offensives, slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThey used their findings to dispute recent statements by Russian leaders, including the country's president, Vladimir Putin, that the Kremlin has been gaining significant momentum in recent months.\n\nThese three offensive directions — toward Kupiansk in northern Ukraine and Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar in the east — have been the source of the war's most intense battlegrounds in the last two years.\n\nRussian forces have said at various stages in 2025 that they'd taken all three major hubs, though Ukraine says that it still maintains pockets of fighting presence there and has been pushing back.\n\nBut even in Pokrovsk, where Russia advanced the fastest, the Kremlin's troops took roughly 70 meters of territory per day, totaling 50 kilometers, or roughly 31 miles, over the last two years, Jones and McCabe wrote.\n\nThe pair calculated the rate of advance based on the straight-line distance by which battle territory shifted, which doesn't account for the total area of territory seized.\n\nBased on this method, Jones and McCabe assessed a Russian rate of advance of 23 meters per day for Kupiansk and 15 meters per day for Chasiv Yar.\n\nAll three were slower than the brutal five-month French and British advance at the Somme in World War I, which took an average of 80 meters of German territory per day, researchers wrote.\n\nCompared with other major combined-arms offensives in modern history, Russia's recent advances have been \"moving at mere fractions of the pace of historical campaigns,\" they added.\n\nJones and McCabe highlighted the Soviet Union's advance on the Leningrad front in 1943, which they said progressed at an average pace of 1,000 meters a day, and the 1918 Battle of Belleau Wood, where they said US forces advanced 410 meters a day in Germany.\n\nUkraine's 2022 counteroffensive in Kharkiv, meanwhile, seized 7,400 meters a day, while its temporary incursion into Kursk took 1,250 meters a day, the researchers added.\n\nPart of the reason behind Russia's slow advance has been the nature of the war, Jones and McCabe noted. The attritive style of the conflict favors the defender heavily, especially with the mass introduction of first-person-view drones.\n\n\"The eastern front line, for instance, continues to be saturated with drones. As a result, vehicle movement is difficult within 15 kilometers of the front line,\" they wrote.\n\nTo be sure, Kyiv still faces a slew of emerging and severe challenges, including high rates of draft dodging and desertion, waning US military support, and Russia innovating with its attack drones to pound Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the winter.\n\nOverall, Russia has seized roughly 75,000 square kilometers, or 28,900 square miles, of Ukraine since its full-scale invasion began in 2022, Jones and McCabe wrote.\n\n\"These gains and Russia's overall progress on the battlefield, especially in the last two years, fall decisively short of Moscow's goal to militarily conquer Ukraine,\" the researchers added.\n\nStill, they added that a more recent Russian offensive toward the city of Huliaipole in the southern Zaporizhzhia region has been more successful.\n\nSince this push began in November 2025, Russia has been advancing there at an average rate of 297 meters a day, their assessment said.\n\nMoscow's high casualties in the last year or so, however, also pose another challenge to its ability to sustain its assault.\n\nRussian deaths and injuries on the battlefield have outnumbered Ukraine's by a ratio of 2:1 or even 2.5:1, Jones and McCabe wrote, citing figures from CSIS, the UK's defense ministry, and other sources such as news outlets and interviews with officials.\n\n\"There were roughly 415,000 Russian casualties in 2025 alone, with an average of nearly 35,000 casualties per month,\" they added.",

    "fullText": "Emma Heming Willis, 47, says her husband, Bruce Willis, isn't aware that he has frontotemporal dementia.\n\n\"I think that's like the blessing and the curse of this is that Bruce never tapped in. He never connected the dots that he had this disease,\" Heming Willis said on Wednesday's episode of \"Conversations with Cam\" podcast. \"And I'm really happy about that. I'm really happy that he doesn't know about it.\"\n\nHeming Willis went on to explain why her husband didn't fully grasp his condition.\n\n\"It's not for everybody, but there is this term, this neurological condition that sort of comes with FTD and other types of dementia as well, called 'anosognosia,' where your brain can't identify what is happening to it,\" she said.\n\nAnosognosia is a condition in which people can't recognize the health conditions or problems they have, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It commonly affects people who have conditions such as Alzheimer's, dementia, or schizophrenia.\n\n\"Where people think this might be denial, like they don't want to go to the doctor because they're like, 'I'm fine. I'm fine.' Actually, this is the anosognosia that comes into play. It's not denial. It's just that their brain is changing; this is a part of the disease,\" Heming Willis said.\n\nIn 2022, the \"Die Hard\" star was diagnosed with aphasia and stepped away from acting. A year later, his family announced that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.\n\nHeming Willis said caring for Willis while watching him change has been heartbreaking.\n\n\"I've grieved so much, and you think that you can't grieve anymore, but you know dementia is progressive, and it continues to take and take and take,\" Heming Willis said.\n\nStill, she says she's come \"such a long way\" since those early days.\n\n\"I carry it with me all the time, but I can also bring in happiness, too, and laughter, and be able to connect with other people that feels really special and meaningful, where I didn't ever think that I would get there,\" Heming Willis said.\n\n\"I mean, and it is also hard to grieve someone who is still alive. You know, it's not natural. It is a very strange sort of thing,\" she said.\n\nHeming Willis has been open about her journey navigating her husband's condition.\n\nIn an August ABC special, she told Diane Sawyer that she had moved Willis to a separate one-story home nearby, where he has round-the-clock care.\n\nIn September, she told People she mistook her husband's early dementia symptoms for marital issues.\n\n\"Conversations weren't really aligning anymore, and our relationship started to shift. It was hard to put my finger on why and what was happening,\" Heming Willis said.",

    "description": "In college, Cameron Mofid set out on a mission to visit every country — not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront his obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
    "fullText": "As a kid, I pored over maps, flags, and history books, curious about what life looked like in far-off corners of the world. At the same time, I was quietly struggling with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often left me feeling trapped inside my own mind.\n\nOne night during my freshman year at the University of Miami, I came across an article in my apartment that stunned me. It said that more people had been to space than had visited every country in the world.\n\nFinding that out changed the direction of my life. I decided to set out on a mission to visit every country, not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront my OCD and prove to myself that it didn't have to dictate the limits of my life.\n\nOver the next few years of college, I saved aggressively while working in nightlife marketing in Miami, putting aside just enough to make the trip possible if I budgeted carefully and kept costs low.\n\nWhen I told my parents about my plan, they laughed and shrugged it off, not quite taking me seriously. Not long after, I called one of my best friends. He laughed too and said just two words: \"Good luck.\"\n\nAfter graduating, I made it my mission. I backpacked mostly alone across conflict zones, remote islands, and places at the center of ancient history. On April 3, 2025, I reached my 195th and final country in North Korea. The journey was verified by NomadMania, the world's largest travel community, which confirmed that I was the youngest person ever to have visited every country.\n\nAfter completing my mission, a few places stood out as truly unforgettable. These are three cities I always suggest others experience — and one I wouldn't rush back to.\n\nOut of the hundreds of cities I've visited in my life, Sydney is my favorite. What stood out most was how relaxed and welcoming people were. The pace reminded me of my hometown in San Diego, with the same laid-back energy but an even greater sense of warmth.\n\nOne morning, while sitting at a café, an older couple at the table next to me struck up a conversation and started sharing their favorite places around the city. They talked about the coastal walks they loved, which neighborhoods were worth spending time in, and the restaurants they kept going back to. Interactions like that happened often enough that the friendliness stopped feeling like a novelty and became part of everyday life.\n\nAs I explored the city, I kept noticing how naturally beautiful it was. More than 100 beaches are within reach, including Bondi, where I watched surfers roll in with the tide. In the city center, I wandered through different neighborhoods and took in the mix of historic architecture and modern design. The sunsets were especially memorable. I watched ferries cut across the water as the skyline came into view, framed by the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge.\n\nSydney is the kind of city I could easily imagine building a life in.\n\nValletta felt like a living crossroads of history from the moment I arrived. Sitting at the center of the Mediterranean, the city reflects centuries of Italian, Arab, British, and North African influence, all packed into a compact, walkable capital.\n\nI'd walk past waterfront cafés and, minutes later, find myself standing on the city's fortified walls, looking out over waters once traveled by Phoenician traders, Ottoman fleets, and British warships.\n\nWhat surprised me most about Valletta was how under-visited it felt compared to much of southern Europe. Even during peak season, it never felt overrun. A short ferry ride away, I spent time on the island of Gozo, where life moved even slower. I visited ancient temples older than the Egyptian pyramids and passed through small villages where fishing and farming still shape daily life.\n\nExperiencing Gozo made Valletta feel even more special: a historic capital with easy access to a quieter, older side of the Mediterranean.\n\nKrabi wasn't even on my radar at first, and it ended up being one of the last places I reached on my journey. A Thai friend I'd met years earlier on the junior tennis circuit told me it was the most beautiful part of the country and insisted I couldn't miss it.\n\nHe was right. Krabi Town is the province's main city, but most travelers use \"Krabi\" to refer to the surrounding beaches and islands — and few places on Earth combine land and sea as dramatically. At Railay Beach, limestone cliffs rise from turquoise water, creating a backdrop unlike anything else I've seen.\n\nI took day trips through Phang Nga Bay and out toward the nearby Phi Phi Islands, weaving past mangrove forests and hidden coves that felt largely untouched. And then there was the food. For a few dollars, I could get a delicious local meal and a fresh dragon fruit smoothie from a roadside stall or beachside café.\n\nKrabi is a reminder that some of the most memorable places aren't always part of the original plan.\n\nIndia was one of the countries I was most excited to visit, and it delivered some amazing experiences. Seeing the Taj Mahal in Agra lived up to every expectation, and witnessing the ancient religious rituals along the Ganges in Varanasi was one of the most powerful cultural moments I've experienced anywhere in the world.\n\nThat said, New Delhi isn't a place I feel a strong pull to return to. The air quality was poor enough that I found myself coughing constantly, making it uncomfortable to spend much time outside. In a city of more than 22 million people, the traffic was relentless, adding to a sense of chaos that, unlike in other busy cities I've loved, never felt energizing. Compared to other parts of India, I also didn't find the city's main sights as compelling.\n\nI'm glad I went, and India as a whole left a lasting impression on me. But if I were planning another trip, New Delhi wouldn't be on my list.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a $2B investment into xAI and the discontinuation of Model S and Model X in order to support Optimus robot production.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is making another leap to shed its EV maker title and transform into a full-fledged physical AI outfit.\n\nThe theme of Wednesday's fourth-quarter earnings call heavily centered on how Tesla is investing in its future as an AI and robotics company — a narrative CEO Elon Musk has pushed for some time now.\n\nThe bets included: a major investment in Musk's xAI, updates on the Optimus humanoid robot, and a renewed push for in-house chipmaking. Musk projected that Tesla's future will require a $20 billion investment, which dwarfs the company's $8.5 billion in capex reported for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's automotive segment took a back seat: Musk said he's killing the Model S and Model X to free up room for humanoid robot production. And while Tesla's energy and \"services\" revenue jumped 25% and 18%, respectively, auto revenue fell 11% year-over-year — a clear indication that the quarter's growth came from everywhere but its core EV business.\n\n\"We've updated the Tesla mission to amazing abundance, and this is an attempt to send a message of optimism about the future,\" Musk said during the call.\n\nThe company's stock rose 1.7% after the market closed on Wednesday evening.\n\nHere are 6 biggest takeaways from the earnings call.\n\nTesla made good on its pledge to investors and announced a $2 billion investment into xAI, the startup behind Grok. It's part of a larger $20 billion Series E funding round from January.\n\nThe expectation of the investment is a deeper collaboration between the two companies. xAI, which has been expanding its data center footprint, could provide the compute and other technical capabilities to further advance Tesla's autonomous vehicle and robotics agenda.\n\nVaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said during the call that the agreement with xAI is in the spirit of finding \"efficient ways for others to help us.\"\n\nIn a surprise move, Musk announced that production of the Model S and Model X would be discontinued by the next quarter, closing a chapter on the company's premium SUV and sedan.\n\nThat leaves the EV maker with four cars: the Cybertruck, the more popular Model 3 and Model Y, and the yet-to-be-released Cybercab.\n\nThe CEO said during the call that the move will provide more production space in Tesla's Fremont factory for Optimus robots.\n\nThe \"long-term goal\" is to produce a million units a year with the freed-up space, Musk said.\n\nThe CEO added that killing the Model S and Model X is part of Tesla's \"overall shift to an autonomous future,\" which includes the company's ride-hailing service, Tesla Robotaxi, and autonomy in personally owned vehicles through Full Self-Driving, an advanced driver assistance system.\n\nTesla expects to start production of the Cybercab, a two-seater coupe, in April for eventual integration into its Robotaxi fleet.\n\nTesla revealed where it aims to expand the Robotaxi ride-hailing service in the first half of 2026 — Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas — but has yet to announce when it will remove the safety monitors inside the cars for public riders across Austin and San Francisco Bay Area, where the service now operates.\n\nMusk said that FSD — the technology that Tesla says will make personally owned vehicles fully autonomous — is already \"100% unsupervised\" and operating without humans inside. The difference, he said, is that Tesla is being \"very cautious\" with rolling out unsupervised service to the public, though Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides in Austin this month.\n\n\"There's like some pretty nutty intersections, where there are a lot of humans who make mistakes and have accidents in various cities,\" Musk said. \"So we want to make sure that FSD can handle those unusual intersections.\"\n\nThere wasn't much of a progress report on Tesla's AI5 chip, but the CEO said he's spending part of his weekends working on it.\n\n\"If I'm spending my Saturdays on something, it's going to be something pretty important,\" Musk said, adding that chip procurement is \"existential\" for Tesla's future, going so far as to bring up the Tesla \"Terafab\" — his aspirational idea of building an in-house chip manufacturing plant.\n\nMusk said he wants to build a factory that integrates \"logic, memory, and packaging\" because Tesla will be \"fundamentally limited by supply chain\" if it doesn't.\n\nMusk said he expects to unveil an Optimus 3 robot in a \"few months,\" but don't expect it to be working the assembly lines just yet.\n\nThe CEO said Optimus isn't contributing to Tesla's manufacturing work in any \"material way\" and that the humanoid robot is only in the factory for training purposes.\n\nMusk talked a lot about Tesla's future, but the company's fourth-quarter performance still hinged on its tangible businesses, such as its energy segment, which includes the Megapack, a utility-scale battery system, and the Powerwall, the home battery system.\n\n\"On the energy front, we achieved yet another record in terms of gross profits for the quarter and ended the year with nearly $12.8 billion in revenue,\" Taneja, the Tesla CFO, said.\n\nTesla also announced this month that it will pivot FSD to a subscription-based only model starting in February. Customers previously had the option to buy FSD upfront for $8,000.\n\nThe move is a clear signal that Tesla sees FSD as a key future revenue generator.\n\nAutomakers are increasingly betting that software subscription services will be a critical source of recurring revenue with higher margins. General Motors revealed that its vehicle software generated $2 billion in the past nine months.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Vibe coding isn't going anywhere. But it's only part of a much bigger transformation, says OpenAI's board chair.\n\nBret Taylor said in an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published on Wednesday that using AI tools to build software quickly with natural language prompts will soon feel normal rather than novel. However, focusing on building today's software faster misses the bigger picture.\n\n\"Everyone's looking at all the software use and saying, 'How fast could I vibe code that?'\" Taylor said. \"I wonder if it's the wrong question.\"\n\nWhether someone can quickly vibe code an app in a web browser isn't \"the most interesting question in software,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the software we use today is set to be replaced, and that's the real disruption, Taylor said.\n\nRather than dashboards, web-browser forms, and traditional apps, the structure of software will change. AI agents will be \"the future of software.\"\n\n\"We will delegate tasks to agents that will operate against a database,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"Who's making those agents is the question,\" he added. \"Will you buy those agents off the shelf or build them yourself?\"\n\nTaylor also said that while AI has slashed the cost of building software, it hasn't solved the harder problems of maintaining it — or the risk of getting things wrong.\n\n\"That's why most people would prefer to buy a solution off the shelf,\" he said. \"You want to amortize the cost of maintaining software among thousands of clients.\"\n\nVibe coding has taken off across the tech world, but tech leaders said the technology has limits.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November in a \"Google for Developers\" podcast interview that vibe coding is \"making coding so much more enjoyable,\" adding that it allows even non-technical users to create simple apps and websites.\n\nDuring Alphabet's April earnings call, Pichai said AI generates more than 30% of Google's new code, up from 25% in October 2024.\n\nStill, AI-generated code can be error-prone, overly long, or poorly structured.\n\n\"I'm not working on large codebases where you really have to get it right, the security has to be there,\" Pichai said in November.\n\nBoris Cherny, the engineer behind Anthropic's Claude Code, said last month that vibe coding works best for prototypes or throwaway code, but not in software that sits at the core of a business.\n\n\"You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes,\" he said in an episode of \"The Peterman Podcast\" published in December.",

    "description": "The settlement means TikTok will avoid a trial where plaintiffs had planned to argue that social media platforms are inherently defective and subject to personal injury liability.",
    "fullText": "TikTok reached an agreement late Monday to settle a lawsuit over claims that social media companies had engineered their products to hook young users, avoiding the first in a series of landmark trials.\n\nThe trial, which is scheduled to begin in the California Superior Court of Los Angeles County with jury selection on Tuesday, is the first in a series of lawsuits expected to be heard this year against Meta, YouTube, Snap and TikTok. The cases stem from lawsuits filed by thousands of individuals, school districts and state attorneys general, accusing the companies of making their products addictive, like cigarettes, and causing personal injury.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and changes to the design of social media platforms to curb excessive use. If they succeed in arguing that the tech titans created defective products that injured millions of young American users, the cases — which are regarded as bellwethers — could open new lanes of liability against the tech titans.\n\nTikTok and Snap have both now settled the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube as the remaining defendants. The case involves a 20-year-old California woman identified in a 2023 lawsuit as K.G.M. The woman said she had become addicted to the social media sites as a child and experienced anxiety, depression and body-image issues as a result. Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and YouTube’s chief, Neal Mohan, are expected to testify.\n\nJoseph VanZandt, one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiff, confirmed the settlement but did not disclose details of the agreement. He said the trial against YouTube and Meta would proceed as scheduled\n\nMark Lanier, another lead lawyer for the plaintiff, said in a statement that “this is a good resolution, and we are pleased with the settlement.”\n\nTikTok did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTikTok and Snap are still defendants in more than a dozen other trials expected in state and federal courts this year. Roughly nine cases will be heard in the series of trials in Los Angeles. A second set of federal cases will go to trial this summer in Oakland, Calif., at the U.S. District Court of Northern California.\n\nThe lawsuits argue that features like infinite scroll, auto video play and algorithmic recommendations have led to compulsive social media use and caused depression, eating disorders and self-harm.\n\nThe companies deny the allegations and say there isn’t a clear link between social media use and addiction. They also point to a federal shield law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, that protects them from liability for what their users post online.",

    "fullText": "Each year, Thoughtworks’ Looking Glass report looks beyond individual technologies to examine the forces reshaping how organizations build, run and evolve their technology estates. The aim is not to predict the future, but to help leaders make sense of the changes already underway — and to understand which of them will matter most in practice.\n\nThis year’s trends reflect a moment of transition. Long-running shifts around platforms, data, security and experience design are converging with rapid advances in AI. The result is not a single disruptive technology, but a reconfiguration of how technology creates value across the enterprise. Systems are becoming more adaptive. Interactions more intent-driven. Governance more embedded in day-to-day delivery.\n\nAcross the Looking Glass, we explore what this means in concrete terms: how enterprises are rebuilding their core foundations, rewiring workflows to support greater autonomy and reimagining the role technology plays in customer experience, decision-making and operations. AI features prominently, but always in context — as one of several forces accelerating change, rather than a solution in isolation.\n\nAs ever, this report is grounded in what we see working with clients around the world. It is intended as a practical guide to navigating the year ahead, with a focus on technologies that deliver real, durable value.\n\nRachel Laycock, Chief Technology Officer, Thoughtworks\n\nIn each lens, we present opportunities for implementing technology in your business and signals to gauge how fast something is approaching. We categorize each of the 90+ trends in two dimensions: the prevalence across enterprises — seeing now, beginning to see or on the horizon — and our recommended strategic response — adopt, analyze or anticipate.\n\nYou'll find each of Looking Glass 2026's five lenses below. Start exploring to begin formulating your response to the trends that will shape your industry's and your organization's future.",

    "fullText": "A team of Spanish researchers led by Dr. Mariano Barbacid at the CNIO's Experimental Oncology Group has reported a groundbreaking therapy that completely eradicates pancreatic tumors in animal models. Using a combination of three drugs (one targeting the KRAS oncogene and two others against EGFR and STAT3 proteins) the treatment halted tumor growth entirely without causing side effects. Published in PNAS and presented at Fundación CRIS Contra el Cáncer, the results showed that mice remained tumor-free for over 200 days after treatment.\n\nBarbacid emphasized that this marks the first time a complete, durable response with low toxicity has been achieved in pancreatic cancer models. The approach leverages a rational combination therapy to tackle one of the most aggressive cancers, offering hope for future human applications. Attendees of the presentation included Cristina Domínguez, a pancreatic cancer survivor, who highlighted the urgent need for research, stating that every scientific advance translates into more life for patients.\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the deadliest cancers, with over 10,000 new cases in Spain each year and a five-year survival rate of just 8-10%. The next phase for Barbacid's team involves launching clinical trials, pending regulatory approvals and funding. KRAS inhibitors may be tested in humans as soon as 2026 or 2027, while STAT3 degraders are still in experimental stages. If successfully translated to patients, this strategy could revolutionize treatment for a cancer historically resistant to conventional therapies...",

Why can't that be us?\n\nThose who run - or follow - Merthyr Town are no exception.\n\n\"At the moment we're on a fabulous run and everyone's taking notice. They want to be a part of it,\" says chairman Les Barlow.\n\n\"We're speaking to people weekly [about potential investment].

They have won 18 of their 29 matches so far.\n\nBack-to-back promotions, then, a very real possibility at Penydarren Park.\n\nIn some ways, you might think pure survival is all that really matters given fan-owned Merthyr Town are a phoenix club that rose from the ashes of the old Merthyr Tydfil FC, which went into liquidation in 2010.\n\nNot Merthyr. They're aiming to get back into the fifth tier of the English game for the first time since 1995, when a gradual decline in fortunes saw them relegated from the old Vauxhall Conference and spiral down through the backwaters of the Southern League.\n\nUltimately, the dream is to join the four other Welsh sides who play in the English Football League (EFL) - Wrexham, Swansea City, Cardiff City and Newport County - a level Merthyr have not graced since before World War Two.\n\nBut how realistic is that? And are there any potential investors - or Hollywood film stars - with deep enough pockets to potentially bankroll a Wrexham-type rise?",

    "fullText": "Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), world’s battery manufacturing giant, officially unveiled its Tianxing II light commercial vehicle battery series on January 22, 2026. The highlight of the launch is the low-temperature version, which represents the industry’s first mass-produced sodium-ion battery.\n\nThe 45 kWh sodium-ion battery boasts an energy density of 175Wh/kg and a cycle life exceeding 10,000 cycles. It is the world’s first battery to receive certification under the new GB 38031-2025 national standard and is designed to power small and micro vans and light trucks.\n\nCompared to lithium batteries, this battery has exceptional cold-weather performance. In extreme temperatures as low as -40°C, the battery maintains 90% of its usable capacity. Moreover, it allows for immediate charging even when completely frozen at -30°C, eliminating the winter operation challenges faced by commercial vehicles in cold regions.\n\nSodium is over 1,000 times more abundant in the earth’s crust than lithium, with extraction costs at merely 1/20 of lithium. This cost advantage is expected to reduce battery costs and improve the economic feasibility of light commercial electric vehicles in the long term.\n\nBeyond the low-temperature sodium-ion version, the Tianxing II series includes three additional variants (lithium-ion type):\n\nThe Fast-Charging Version features high-rate charging technology that powers the battery from 20% to 80% in 18 minutes. For standard 100 kWh electric vehicles, a single fast charge can add approximately 150 kilometers of range.\n\nThe Long-Range Version sets a new record for light commercial vehicles with a single-pack capacity of 253 kWh, achieving a maximum range of 800km. This variant is designed primarily for long-distance logistics between cities. When paired with CATL’s Taishan pack architecture, it reduces vehicle weight by approximately 260kg compared to batteries with equivalent capacity, increasing effective payload while reducing energy consumption.\n\nThe High-Temperature Fast-Charging Version targets last-mile delivery and self-owned vehicle operations, particularly in southern high-temperature regions. Equipped with a customized liquid cooling thermal management system, it maintains stable fast-charging performance and battery life in high-temperature environments. This version balances high reliability with low operating costs, making it suitable for short-distance, high-frequency light commercial scenarios such as supermarket deliveries and community distribution.\n\nTianxing is a battery brand for commercial vehicles, launched by CATL in July 2024.",

    "fullText": "Strolling around the Computer History Museum, there are exhibits that are immediately recognizable. All we need is a glimpse of the Altair 8800 or Apple I, and we just… know. We walk over and stand in front of these pieces, instinctively lowering our voices and giving a quiet nod to anyone nearby. Like noticing the chisel marks on a marble statue or the brushstrokes on an oil painting, we’re struck by the realization that what we’re seeing is the result of human imagination and ingenuity. What was once abstract and almost mythical is there right in front of us.\n\nHowever, there are also items on display at the Computer History Museum whose significance isn’t immediately apparent. Take the Triadex Muse. You might mistake this wedge of metal, switches, and wood panels for an obsolete piece of stereo equipment or a Cold War-era intercom.\n\nWhile it looks like something you’d find on some forgotten warehouse shelf, the Triadex Muse is an important piece of electronic music history. Developed by Edward Fredkin and Marvin Minsky at MIT in 1969, and commercially released in the early 1970s, it was the first algorithm-based sequencer/synthesizer intended for home consumers. It’s estimated that there were only 280 – 300 produced, making it a rare piece of gear.\n\nYou won’t find a friendly and familiar set of piano keys. The only controls are an orderly series of sliders. Its industrial design has \n\nThe beauty of the Triadex Muse is in its simplicity. There’s no memory, no CPU, and no firmware. Just integrated circuits and electricity. Unlike the 1959 IBM 7090 mainframe computer, which was fed programming instructions via paper punch cards in coaxing out such party hits like Frère Jacques on the 1962 album Music from Mathematics, the only user input here is positioning sliders and flipping a couple switches.\n\nIf you were to randomly move the sliders to different positions and fire up the Triadex Muse, you’d likely hear the chirp of a square wave melody from its internal speaker and see a vertical band of blue and green lights twinkling in time. You might think that the Triadex Muse is like a modern step sequencer or drum machine. Orderly and predictable. This is 1972. Forget it.\n\nYou wouldn’t be wrong that the blinking lights correspond to a beat. At each tick of the Muse’s internal clock, this single column of lights shows the complete state of zeroes and ones. The Muse is essentially a 40 x 8 matrix, with zeroes and ones evaluated at each “tick” of its internal clock, triggering sounds, and with each state potentially changing what happens next.\n\nWhile anyone with a background in computer science would know what these lamps represent, the average home consumer would have no idea. These glittering lights further add to its sense of mystery. Although you do get some control over the Muse’s output, you can’t play it like a regular instrument. Even the owner’s manual admits that, “The Muse isn’t a music box.” Depending on how you set the sliders, it’s unlikely you’re going to come up with a tune you can hum along with while you wash the dishes.\n\nWhile the Muse may sound like a robotic run-on sentence, it speaks in the familiar language of musical intervals.\n\nThe INTERVAL block has four sliders that select notes from the major scale. The positions of A, B, and C determine the pitch, while D adds an octave. There are no flatted thirds or minor scales. You can't play the blues. Though you might want to if you once owned the Triadex Muse and look up how much they’re currently going for—$$$.\n\nThe four INTERVAL switches, like much of the Muse, are deceptively straightforward. You might flip several to the same row and think you’ll hear a chord. Once again the Muse doesn’t follow modern conventions.\n\nThe Muse isn’t polyphonic. There is no harmony or overtones. This is binary arithmetic. Each interval is a weighted four-digit binary number. When summed they generate a 4-bit number that determines a new pitch. Music from mathematics… indeed.\n\nThe Muse’s intervals are triggered when the positions that they’re set to get a one bit from either the C or B section.\n\nIf you were to stare at the blue lights marked C ½ to C6 long enough, along with your friends asking you if you were feeling okay, you’d notice that they follow a set pattern. And if you knew how to count in binary (and let’s face it we know there are some of you out there), you’d see that the lamps C1, C2, C4, and C8 form a four-bit counter, cycling from 1 (0001) to 15 (1111) in a continuous loop. C ½ is simply the clock itself, a square wave that turns on and off at a rate linked to the tempo. C3 and C6 form a separate two-bit counter that increments every three cycles. By setting groups of threes against fours adds variety to the sequence.\n\nIn most instances, if you set the INTERVALS only to C positions, you’d get repeating patterns of tones about as musically exciting as the 1978 memory game Simon (no offense to Simon, which you can also see on display at the CHM).\n\nThe B region is where the Muse becomes more than a repeating blooper of bleeps, but a generator of pseudo-random chaos. You might observe the flickering green lights occupying B1 – B31, and just when you’ve identified a pattern, the sequence feeds back and morphs into something new.\n\nTo understand what’s happening, first you need to know what the four THEME sliders actually do. If you think that flipping these will give you a familiar musical preset like rock, jazz, or a rumba, the Muse once again betrays you.\n\nEach THEME slider is technically a “tap.” A tap is like a tiny beacon, monitoring the binary state of a specific point in the C or B region, and sending that off to an XNOR logic gate.\n\nI know. This sounds complex. But understanding the B register is like finding the answer to a riddle. Once you see it, it’s oh-so-obvious.\n\nAt every click, the XNOR (Exclusive NOR) logic gate makes a decision based on what it receives from the taps. If the gate receives an even number of ones (including all zeroes), it sends a one to B1. If the number of ones is odd, it sends a zero to B1. In its default state, B1 – B31 will be a band of green.\n\nEvery decision the Muse makes lurches forward, sometimes syncing up as the same conditions persist, and then suddenly shifting when the inputs change. B1 – B31 is what is known as a Linear Shift Register, an ever-evolving bucket brigade of bits, where a new zero or one is handed to the top, while the bottom bit falls out.\n\nThe Triadex Muse is a dead-end in the history of electronic music. While one could daisy chain it to other Muses, it used a proprietary I/O. There are no control voltages you could patch into modular synthesizers. And MIDI was a decade away. Its entire ecosystem was The Triadex Muse itself, an external speaker, and if the march of blue and green squares wasn’t enough visual stimulation, you could also buy a light unit with Gaussian-like blurs of psychedelic colors flowing with the beat.\n\nLike DNA from extinct species whose fragments persist in modern organisms, the Muse’s influence lives on in algorithmic composition.\n\nIn a 2001 interview, Sean Booth of Autechre, pioneers of generative electronic music said about their process that, “There’s absolutely nothing random about what we do. There might be a lot of number crunching going on, but there’s nothing random in there.”\n\nThis is exactly what the Muse was doing in 1972.\n\nMarvin Minsky, the co-creator of the Muse, said in his 1981 paper “Music, Mind, and Meaning” that the challenge of composing music is that, “Whatever the intent, control is required or novelty will turn to nonsense.” This philosophy is hardwired into the Muse.\n\nThe melodies of the Muse could sound familiar. Or even strange. But its output still sounds like music, with underlying rules and logic that our brains detect as patterns, even though the Muse makes it almost impossible to predict what it will play next.",

    "fullText": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A Republican opponent is challenging U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s eligibility to run for governor of Alabama, accusing the football coach-turned-politician of not meeting the legal requirement to have lived in the state for seven years.\n\nKen McFeeters, who is running against Tuberville for the Republican nomination for governor, filed the challenge Tuesday with the Alabama Republican Party. McFeeters in a phone interview said he believes Tuberville lives in a multimillion-dollar beach home in Florida instead of a smaller home that he has listed as his residence in Auburn, Alabama.\n\nProperty tax records show the former Auburn University football coach has a home in Auburn, Alabama ,with an appraised value of $291,780 on which he claims a homestead exemption. He also has a beach home in Walton County, Florida with an estimated market value of $5.5 million, according to property records.\n\nThe Auburn house was initially purchased by Tuberville’s wife and son in 2017. The senator's name was later added to the property, and the son's name removed. Both the Auburn and Florida homes appear to have recently been put in a revocable trust with Tuberville's wife as trustee.\n\n“It’s belittling to the average person in Alabama for him to think we believe that he’s being sincere when he says he lives at his son’s $300,000 house when he’s got a $6 million beach house. Where would you live?” McFeeters said.\n\nMcFeeters wrote in his letter to party officials that the available records, “if accurate, strongly suggest that Auburn may have been used as an address of convenience rather than as a true domicile.” McFeeters said Tuberville’s travel records also show frequent travel to the Florida Panhandle, which he said buttresses the idea that he resides in the location.\n\nMallory Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, called the challenge a “ridiculous PR stunt from a desperate candidate.”\n\n“Senator Tuberville has proudly represented Alabama in the United States Senate for the past six years. This made-up narrative didn’t work when he was running for Senate in 2019, and it certainly isn’t going to work now,” Jaspers wrote in an email. Jaspers said the Auburn home remains the senator’s primary residence.\n\nTuberville faced similar accusations in his Senate campaign. Opponents called him “Florida man” or a “tourist in Alabama.” The Senate has a less stringent residency requirement before taking office.\n\nTuberville told The Associated Press earlier this month that he believes he meets the residency requirement.\n\n“We checked it out. I wouldn’t be doing this if I thought it was a problem,” Tuberville said. Tuberville said it will be up to the Republican Party to decide any challenge, but “what I’ve heard from them, they feel good about it.”\n\nTuberville was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He then coached at Texas Tech and the University of Cincinnati. He went to work for ESPN after retiring from coaching. In a 2017 promotional video for ESPN, he talked about moving to Florida after retiring from coaching.\n\nTuberville voted in Florida in 2018. He registered to vote in Alabama on March 28, 2019, about two weeks before announcing his run for Senate.\n\nJeannie Burniston, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Republican Party, said challenges are heard and decided by the party’s 21-member steering committee. Burniston said the committee will decide if there is enough evidence for a challenge to proceed to a hearing where both sides present evidence. Burniston said she cannot comment on challenges.\n\nThe awkwardly worded requirement in the Alabama Constitution says the governor and lieutenant governor “shall have been citizens of the United States ten years and resident citizens of this state at least seven years next before the date of their election.”\n\nMcFeeters said it is important that the Republican Party take the matter seriously. He said Tuberville should be asked to provide clear evidence that he has lived in Alabama for seven consecutive years.\n\nSusan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, said the language of the residency requirement is vague. She said it could be interpreted to be seven consecutive years or it could be seven years broken up by periods living elsewhere. But she said Alabama’s culture and history supports the argument that it should be seven consecutive years.\n\n“Alabama’s culture is suspicious of outsiders and historically most of Alabama’s governors were born and raised in the state, often having been descended from generations of Alabamians,” Hamill wrote in an email. Her comments were first reported by the Alabama Reflector.",

    "fullText": "Chery has launched its first battery electric pickup in China under its Rely pickup brand, with pricing starting at 127,800 yuan, about $18,300, and running up to 158,800 yuan for higher trims. \n\nThe truck is positioned as a work-ready electric option with mainstream sizing, multiple drivetrains, and a tech-heavy cabin, arriving as new energy pickups become one of the fastest-growing niches in China.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nEarly reports describe the Rely R08 EV as a body-on-frame pickup offered in six variants. Dimensions are listed at 5,330 mm long, 1,920 mm wide, and 1,890 mm tall, with a 3,230 mm wheelbase, putting it in the midsize-to-fullsize zone by global standards.\n\nPowertrain choices include a single-motor rear-wheel-drive model and a dual-motor all-wheel-drive model, with outputs cited at 150 kW for RWD and 300 kW for AWD. Range is reported at up to 510 km on the CLTC cycle depending on trim, which is the figure Chinese brands typically use for domestic marketing and it generally reads higher than EPA-style numbers.\n\nView the 2 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nThe R08 EV is also being pitched as modern inside, with reports citing an infotainment setup using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip in some versions. Driver assistance is described as Level 2 capable depending on trim, with commonly listed features such as adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, and automatic emergency braking. \n\nThis is the typical spec mix for value-focused Chinese EVs, where the headline is less about a single breakthrough feature and more about offering a complete equipment list at a low entry price.\n\nPickups are still a smaller segment in China than in North America, with 2025 pickup sales cited at about 589,000 units. What is changing quickly is electrification, with new energy pickup volume cited at roughly 73,000 units in 2025, up about 243 percent year over year, which helps explain why Chery is moving into the category now. \n\nA base price around $18,300 is part of that strategy, because it creates a lower barrier for buyers who want a truck shape for utility but have been priced out of many electric offerings. Chery’s wider EV messaging continues to lean into future battery narratives. It also fits a product portfolio that mixes mainstream launches with attention-grabbing ideas, and off-road EV projects.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed President Donald Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis.\n\nThe man arrested for Tuesday's attack has posted online in support of the Republican president.\n\n“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said during a press conference. Asked if she was nervous about appearing in public, she said, “Fear and intimidation doesn't work on me.”\n\nThe attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nOmar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. After she was elected seven years ago, Trump said she should “go back” to her country. He recently described her as “garbage” and said she should be investigated. During a speech in Iowa on Tuesday, shortly before Omar was attacked, he said immigrants need to be proud of the United States — “not like Ilhan Omar.”\n\n“It’s hard not to see the link between what happened and the attacks Trump has made against Omar personally, not to mention his siege of her city,” said Jeremy Slevin, who worked for years as a spokesperson for Omar before becoming a senior advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Trump baselessly accused Omar of staging the attack.\n\n“She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” he told ABC News.\n\nThe attack on Omar was a reminder of the country's threatening political climate, which has led some lawmakers to limit public events or not seek reelection.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said that she knows how Omar was feeling because an armed man showed up at her Seattle home in 2022, threatening her and her husband.\n\n“It has to stop. I mean, we are just trying to do our jobs, and, it could be quieted and could be called out by Trump and leaders in elected office who refuse to go along with it, but they continue to do it, and this is the consequence,” Jayapal told the Associated Press.\n\nThe suspect has supported Trump\n\nThe man accused of squirting the substance on Omar has a criminal history and has made online posts supportive of the Republican president.\n\nAnthony Kazmierczak, 55, was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence and has had numerous traffic citations, Minnesota court records show. There are also indications he has had significant financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings.\n\nPolice say Kazmierczak used a syringe to squirt liquid on Omar during Tuesday's event after she called for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the firing or impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Officers immediately tackled and arrested Kazmierczak.\n\nKazmierczak hadn’t been formally charged or scheduled for an initial court appearance as of Wednesday afternoon. Daniel Borgertpoepping, spokesman for Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, said they had still not received the results of the police investigation. A statement from the Minneapolis Police Department said the FBI was now leading the investigation.\n\nIt's unclear if Kazmierczak had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. The county's chief public defender, Michael Berger, said the case hasn't been assigned to his office.\n\nIn social media posts, Kazmierczak criticized former President Joe Biden and referred to Democrats as “angry and liars.” Trump “wants the US is stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. “Stop other countries from stealing from us.”\n\nIn another post, Kazmierczak asked, “When will descendants of slaves pay restitution to Union soldiers’ families for freeing them/dying for them, and not sending them back to Africa?”\n\nA target of Trump from the start\n\nOmar's safety has been an issue for years. After Trump's initial round of social media attacks during her first year in Congress, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Capitol Police to conduct a security review. Omar said six officers provided around-the-clock protection for her and her family.\n\nIn 2021, Omar played an audio of a death threat she received by phone during a press conference. The caller used racist and anti-Muslim slurs during in the recording. The congresswoman at the time called on her Republican colleagues to stand up to “anti-Muslim hate” in their ranks.\n\nThe following year, a man was sentenced to three years’ probation by a federal judge on federal hate crime charges after sending an email to Omar threatening to kill her.\n\nTrump stepped up his criticism of Omar in recent months as he turned his focus on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is home to about 84,000 people of Somali descent — nearly a third of the Somalis living in the U.S. And he has linked the Twin Cities immigration crackdown to a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which most of the defendants have roots in the East African country.\n\n“I wouldn’t be where I am at today, having to pay for security, having the government have to think about providing me security, if Donald Trump wasn’t in office and if he wasn’t so obsessed with me,” Omar said Wednesday.\n\nThe attack on Omar came days after a man was arrested in Utah for allegedly punching U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida, in the face at a private party during the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nChristian Joel Young, 28, said “we are going to deport you and your kind” before striking the congressman, according to a probable cause affidavit. He was charged Tuesday in state court with two counts of misdemeanor assault and felony burglary for entering the bar illegally.\n\nA judge ordered him held without bail. Young’s attorney declined to comment.\n\nThreats against members of Congress have increased in recent years, peaking in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol before dipping slightly only to climb again, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\n“Almost all of us receive very regular threats,” said Rep. Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Omar has led the caucus in recent weeks while Casar has been on paternity leave. The congressman described Omar as “tough as nails” and said Trump should curb his rhetoric about her.\n\n“The point of what these violent actors want is for us to shut up and we just can’t give in to that,” Casar said.\n\nBiesecker and Brown reported from Washington. Amiri reported from New York. Associated Press reporters Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City and R.J. Rico in Atlanta contributed.",

Their substitute teacher stood beside them, and then she cuts them off.\n\n“I want to know. I want to know why, when black people are amongst each other, they call each other n****, and when a white person says it, it’s like ‘oh my God’.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

    "fullText": "When you live in a rural area, a single store closing down hits harder because you already have fewer options.\n\nIn some cases, a single closure of a key business like a grocery store or a discount retailer can force residents to travel great distances or rely on online retailers for some purchases.\n\nOn a personal level, this impacted my family when the Market Basket supermarket closed near our New Hampshire vacation home. That left the community without a true grocery store for years, forcing people to drive nearly a half-hour to pick up basics, or to overpay for them at local specialty stores.\n\nSomething similar happened when the K-Mart closed in Key West. That shutdown, one of the last in the chain, robbed that remote area of its only department store, forcing residents to drive four to five hours before they hit a Walmart or a Target.\n\nResidents in the Pacific Northwest now face similar challenges, according to local reports.\n\nIn the markets it serves, Cascade Farm and Outdoor, which is closing all its stores, will leave a similar hole for consumers.\n\nA rival to Tractor Supply, Cascade Farm serves farmers and rural communities. It's sort of an everything-you-might-need general store model. The chain offers grocery, clothing, footwear, sporting goods, outdoor gear, hardware, and various farming supplies.\n\n\"Cascade Farm and Outdoor is built on great Northwest traditions you’ve come to know and trust. As the newest member of the Bi-Mart Family, Cascade Farm and Outdoor is committed to quality and value throughout our store. Our goal is to offer the hard-working farmers, ranchers, and homeowners of our area a helping hand along with a great selection of quality merchandise,\" the company shared on its website.\n\nBi-Mart has decided to close down the entire chain in the spring and has already started going-out-of-business sales at its stores.\n\nThe company explained the shutdown in a media release shared with KCBY 11.\n\n\"Our division of Cascade stores, while successful, did not have the volume and momentum to significantly contribute to our path moving forward. Always necessary in business, our goal is to make the best decisions we can that support the success of Bi-Mart, our employee-owners, and our members,\" it offered.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nB-Mart intends to offer Cascade Farm employees positions at other stores when that's geographically possible.",

    "fullText": "Adobo Restaurant & Bar on Federal Boulevard reopened on Wednesday, hours after burglars broke in and stole the cash register and safe, marking the third burglary at the location in nearly five years.\n\nChef Blaine Baggao said burglars broke through the door between 3:36 a.m. and 3:40 a.m. on Wednesday. Despite the loss, which included revenue earned during the National Western Stock Show, Baggao reopened the restaurant later that day.\n\nDenver Police officers responded to a call for a burglary at approximately 9:19 a.m. in the 3100 block of North Federal Boulevard, according to the Denver Police Department. The burglary took place overnight, and the case is under investigation.\n\nThe location also reported burglaries on May 14, 2023, and Aug. 21, 2024, according to police. There was an arrest in the 2024 case, but the 2023 case remains under investigation.\n\n\"Filipinos are especially persistent, and I would just… my mother is an incredibly tenacious person,\" Baggao said, explaining how he found the strength to continue operating.\n\n\"I've been doing stuff on this corner for a long time, and this isn't just your vandal, your average criminal, your person who needs a meal,\" Baggao said.\n\nFor Baggao, the restaurant represents more than a business. As a Filipino American who grew up in New Mexico, he said cooking became his path to exploring his heritage.\n\n\"As a Filipino American growing up in New Mexico with my French-Irish mother and wanted to learn more about my culture for me, the easiest, closest road,\" Baggao said.\n\nThe restaurant serves what Baggao describes as humble, family-oriented food, including dishes like Lechon kawali, a crispy pork belly preparation.\n\n\"If I took you to my grandma's house, this would be the exact same flavors,\" he said.\n\nThe burglary has been particularly difficult for Baggao because he views the community he serves as an extension of his family.\n\n\"It kind of makes me sad cause that's not the community I want to be in. That's the frustrating part,\" he said. \"Whoever did this needs to be brought into that [community] so they don't do this kind of stuff.\"\n\nDespite the emotional toll, Baggao said he is focusing on his restaurant's mission moving forward.\n\n\"Trying to stay in the right place, stay regulated for myself and my team, and stay being a leader,\" he said. \"We solve our problems with food and making people really happy.\"\n\nBaggao said he remains committed to serving the community.\n\n\"I love serving folks in this community, and if I stay focused on that I'll forget about this eventually,\" he said. \"Just grateful for that.\"\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Metro Denver Crime Stoppers at 720-913-7867 or submit a tip online.",

Ministers are already considering a ban as part of a consultation due to report by the summer and so the Lords amendment is unlikely to pass in the Commons. Starmer is also understood to want to wait until evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December, has been assessed, though the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has urged him to “just get on with it”.\n\nHere parents, teachers and young people share their views.\n\nLaura, a parent from East Dunbartonshire, says the scale of harmful content circulating on social media has left many families feeling powerless. Laura, whose children are nine and 11, supports proposals to restrict children’s access to social media platforms, arguing that current safeguards leave too much exposure to chance.\n\n“Concerns about what my children might see online keep me awake at night,” Laura says. While her own children do not have social media accounts, she says that does little to shield them. “They can see any and all content on their friends’ phones. That includes material which, in any other context, would be completely unacceptable for children.”\n\nLaura has become involved in local campaigning, helping to set up a parent WhatsApp group that later linked into the Smartphone Free Childhood movement. “This can’t be left to individual families,” she says. “It creates a postcode lottery and exacerbates inequalities.”\n\nRachel, a secondary school English teacher in Derbyshire, says the impact of social media on pupils’ emotional wellbeing and concentration is now impossible to ignore. After more than 15 years in the classroom, she believes attention spans among younger students have noticeably deteriorated.\n\n“I see the effect of social media and shrinking attention spans every day,” she says. “It’s getting worse and worse.”\n\nIn the classroom, sustaining focus has become increasingly difficult, with younger pupils struggling “to concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes”, she says, adding that resilience is also lacking. “There’s a lot of giving up before you’ve even started.”\n\nRachel believes the use of social media has become entwined with children’s sense of identity. “It feels like it’s invaded their psyche,” she says.\n\nWhen she mentioned the possibility of restrictions on social media use to a year 7 class, she says the reaction was immediate and emotional. “There was uproar,” she recalls. “I actually thought a couple of them were going to cry.”\n\nJulia*, 20, says having a smartphone as a shy eight-year-old was helpful, but she believes an “overhaul” of social media is needed.\n\n“I’ve never really known a world without a smartphone,” she says. “I was an anxious child, and when I was about 11, I found I could be myself and make friends online. But that doesn’t really help in real-life situations. I think it was a short-term solution for loneliness and confidence.”\n\nFrom the age of 12 to 15, Julia, a student from Stirling, Scotland, says she “somehow found myself on the sexist side on Instagram” with the barrage of such content making her “terrified of making mistakes” and exacerbating her social anxiety.\n\n“It really messed with my sense of self-worth, and I felt I had to be perfect,” she says. “I felt like I had to prove myself, to outdo myself, because at the time, the belief I had was that everybody thought women were less funny or less smart. I only started to come out of that self-hating mindset when I started to make real-life friends at the age of 16 or 17.”\n\nBut she is unconvinced that the proposed social media ban for under-16s is the solution.\n\n“Rather than just focusing on the impact it has on children, there should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone, because in the long run, it would also improve the lives of young people.”\n\nTahnee, an occupational therapist based in Glasgow, says watching children’s lives move increasingly online has left her deeply uneasy. Originally from Australia, she has nieces and nephews in both the UK and Australia and says she has seen how social media can begin to dominate young people’s lives “from the age of 11 or 12, when the first phones arrive”.\n\nTahnee, who has an eight-year-old son, welcomed Australia’s decision to introduce restrictions on children’s social media use.\n\nBut feedback from friends and family back home suggests the reality has been more complicated. “Parents of younger children are really pleased,” she says. “Others were hopeful, but in reality the ban hasn’t been as effective as people hoped.” Enforcement, she adds, has been inconsistent.\n\nShe believes restrictions can nevertheless help parents hold boundaries that are otherwise difficult to maintain. “If your child is the only one in the class without a smartphone or social media, it’s incredibly hard,” she says. “But if it’s 20% or 30%, it suddenly feels much easier to say: actually, we’re not doing this right now.”\n\nAJ, 20, says they “understand the thinking” behind the proposed ban, but believe it is a flawed approach.\n\n“I think it’s a broad-brush solution to a more complex problem,” they say. “It’s been clear to me so far that this conversation is being led by people who did not grow up with this technology, and I am frustrated with the way young people – especially young adults who experienced online childhoods – are being talked about and at, and rarely talked to.”\n\nAJ, who lives in Devon, began using Tumblr from around the age of 12 until 15.\n\n“I still look back on it now as a positive experience,” AJ says. “At that time in my life, I really needed what social media provided me with. I’m autistic, and it’s the first place where I really saw or interacted with, or not even interacted with, but I saw autistic adults, that there’s an autistic community and an autistic movement. These are things that were really formative to me, and I would not have had access to anywhere in my ‘real life’.”\n\nThey are concerned that a blanket ban for under-16s would remove that outlet for some children although they can see how a proposed ban could be used as leverage to pressure social media platforms.\n\n“I absolutely believe that they’ll [the social media platforms] need to be pressured into doing the right thing,” they say.\n\nPhil, a 47-year-old data scientist from Bedfordshire with two children aged 14 and 11, is sceptical that a proposed ban on children using social media will achieve what it promises. While he has little sympathy for tech companies, he is unconvinced the policy tackles the real problem.\n\nIn principle, Phil understands why governments want to intervene. In practice, he says, enforcement would be very difficult. “Existing parental controls can be complex and don’t always work as expected,” he says. “Kids can just download a VPN anyway,” he says, arguing this makes the UK’s Online Safety Act “fundamentally flawed”.\n\nPhil describes himself as “pretty techie” and says he has managed to limit what his children access on their own phones. But he stresses that this only goes so far. He recalls his son being shown a graphic video of the Charlie Kirk shooting by another child at school. “Someone just put it in front of his face,” Phil says. “You can’t control that.”",

    "description": "Michael Harris II, Sal Stewart and Luis Robert Jr. are on the rise in our 5x5 player rankings for 2026.",
    "fullText": "Moving on from the “way too early” rankings, this is the first official edition of the top 300 for 2026. Players are ranked for 5x5 mixed leagues using a one-catcher format. I include the mixed-league disclaimer because I do reward upside, particularly past the top 200 or so.\n\n⚾️ Coming soon: MLB returns to NBC and Peacock in 2026! In addition to becoming the exclusive home of Sunday Night Baseball, NBC Sports will broadcast MLB Sunday Leadoff, “Opening Day” and Labor Day primetime games, the first round of the MLB Draft, the entire Wild Card round of the postseason, and much more.\n\n- Falling off: Grant Taylor (234th), Christian Moore (289th), Troy Johnston (296th)\n\n- Just a little update here, and it's mostly because I wanted to make my new feelings known about MacKenzie Gore after last week's trade. Gore was my No. 85 SP before getting sent to the Rangers, leaving him about 10 spots off the original top 300, but that was largely because I have the Nationals as the second worst situation for pitchers in the league. Dealing with poor defense and especially poor catching, Nationals pitchers have had ERA far in excess of their FIPs the last two years (4.72 FIP, 5.35 ERA season), and their bullpen figures to be especially poor this year.\n\nI'm not quite as sure what to make about the situation in Texas, largely because Globe Life Field has been all over the map; it had one of the best park factors for hitters in 2023, only to play as a significant pitchers' park in 2024 and an extreme one in 2025. It's been especially tough on right-handed power the last two years. Maybe that won't keep up, but if it does, it's especially great for a left-handed flyball pitcher like Gore. As a result, I have Gore all of the way up to 35th among SPs now, and he checks in at No. 135 overall here.\n\n- The other significant change is Seranthony Domínguez going from 26th to 21st among RPs after signing on to close for the White Sox. Grant Taylor fell from 23rd to 28th, leaving him just off the list. I wasn't projecting him for many saves in the first place, but this does take away some of his upside. I still think he'll be fantastic in a multi-inning setup role.\n\n- Moore and Johnston lost some playing time in my projections with the Angels re-signing Yoán Moncada and the Rockies acquiring Edouard Julien. Julien could play second for Colorado, but he's a liability there. I have him slightly outhitting Johnston, though his limited home run and steal potential keeps him off the list.\n\n- Harrison Bader didn't make the top 300 while he was still a free agent, and though he'll obviously be a regular in San Francisco, he's further away now after joining the Giants.\n\n- Having Michael Harris II ranked 30th overall isn’t something I saw coming when I started doing my projections. I’ve been just as disappointed by his lack of progress as everyone else; his OPS has gone from .853 in his rookie season to .808, .722 and .678 the last three years. And yet I found so much more to be encouraged about than I thought I would, enough to think that he’s quite a bit more likely to duplicate his second half of 2025 (.299/.315/.430, 14 HR) than his first half (.210/.234/.317). He scores this highly for me even though, because I have him batting seventh, he’s projected for the second fewest plate appearances of anyone in my top 50 hitters (only Jazz Chisholm Jr. has fewer). If he gets off to a nice start and finds himself moving up the Braves lineup, I think the potential is there for him to be the steal of the year.\n\n- Sal Stewart’s placement here at No. 57 is another one that’ll raise eyebrows. I’m actually rather disappointed the Reds traded Gavin Lux, since that should help Stewart’s ADP some. Really, though, I wasn’t worried about Lux or anyone else being in Stewart’s way, no matter how hesitant Terry Francona was to use him last September. Stewart just hammers the baseball in a way that separates him from everyone else on the Reds roster, save Elly De La Cruz. He’ll bat lower in the order initially, but he could quickly settle into the cleanup spot. There’s no reason he can’t make a run at 100 RBI, and his value would only increase if the Reds get him some extra position eligibility by playing him at third or second.\n\n- Luis Robert Jr. moved up about 15 spots to No. 74 with Tuesday's trade to the Mets. Citi Field is a little bit of an upgrade for him in the ballpark department, and he's certainly in a better lineup now, even if the trade means he's more likely to spend most of the year batting in the bottom half of the order. On the plus side, that will free him up to continue stealing bases.\n\n- Neither the Robert addition nor the Bo Bichette signing did anything for one of my favorite picks this year, Brett Baty. Still, I'm keeping the faith. Baty is athletic enough to handle left field, and even if Carson Benge emerges there, I'd still take Baty over Mark Vientos as a DH against right-handers. Baty showed 25-homer power last season, and his contract rates are a little better than his strikeout percentages suggest. If he can get the ball into the air with a little more frequency this year, he should bust out.\n\n- On the White Sox side of things, Lenyn Sosa (No. 219) and Brooks Baldwin (no. 268) both moved up with Robert out of the mix. Luisangel Acuña seems poised for a shot to replace Robert in center, but while he could steal 40 bags as an everyday guy, I think his bat will probably force him into a utility role. Sosa isn't necessarily a good regular for a major league team, either, given his middling defense and atrocious walk rate, but he hit 22 homers last season and managed a solid .264 average in the process. He ought to be the White Sox's primary DH. Baldwin seems like an unexciting, jack-of-all-trades sort, but his EV numbers took a nice jump last year and he's gone 9-for-9 stealing bases in 136 big-league games. He could be a sneaky 15 HR/15 SB guy if he's in the lineup most of the time.\n\n- I was already lower than most on Freddy Peralta for this season, and the trade to the Mets didn't help, dropping him from 27th to 35th among starting pitchers. Still, it would have been considerably worse if the Mets hadn't upgraded their defense this winter. The Brewers are just so strong there and, aided by their ballpark, make their hurlers appear better than they actually are; their pitchers have a league-low .274 BABIP over the last three years, with Peralta himself coming in at .265.\n\n- There are still only 27 relievers in the top 300, though that number will swell as closing situations start to clear up a little this spring. The unrepresented teams are the Athletics, Diamondbacks, Nationals, Rangers, Rockies and Twins, while the Brewers and Astros each have two relievers on the list. Also present is free agent Serathony Domínguez, who I suspect will wind up closing for one of those unrepresented teams (or maybe the White Sox). The relievers on those clubs closest to making the list were Arizona's Kevin Ginkel (34th among RPs), the Athletics' Mark Leiter Jr. (37th), the Twins' Cole Sands (42nd) and the Rockies' Victor Vodnik (47th).",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich goalkeeper Jonas Urbig was named Man of the Match for his starring role in the team’s 2-1 victory over PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.\n\nAfterward, Urbig said that this is the kind of team that is adaptable enough to win against any kind of team.\n\n“The key to this win was that we kept going and engaged in every challenge, fighting for the second balls. That’s so important in games like this because it keeps the pressure on the opponent. The substitutions towards the end allowed us to bring in fresh legs and exploit the spaces that opened up. Whether it’s against a technically strong team like PSG or Chelsea – we can hold our own and win games – or when we go for the second balls like we did today. That’s what sets us apart, our flexibility, and we’re looking forward to the upcoming opponents,” said Urbig (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nBayern Munich has proven its mettle against many teams already this season, but the hardest parts of this season are still to come. Will that flexibility allow the Bavarians to make a deep run in the Champions League?\n\nRight now, it sure seems like it, but Bayern Munich will have to prove it.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "title": "Pep Guardiola and Man City are through to the last-16 – but they have Jose Mourinho to thank",
    "description": "Manchester City 2-0 Galatasaray: Doku set up both goals as Pep Guardiola’s men scraped into the last-16, helped by Jose Mourinho’s Benfica beating Real Madrid",
    "fullText": "The days when Pep Guardiola’s rivalry with Jose Mourinho was toxic are long gone. They may never clash again. But for a few minutes, they were linked again. A grateful Guardiola, who cursed his old enemy in the past, said he would send the Portuguese a message to thank him. It was Mourinho’s Benfica who spared Manchester City a return ticket to the Champions League’s knockout play-offs. Some of the cheers at the Etihad Stadium came long after the City players had left the pitch. They greeted Benfica’s fourth goal against Real Madrid; scored, improbably, by goalkeeper Antoliy Trubin. The 15-time European champions were down to nine men, condemned to ninth place by defeat.\n\nThe manner of it bemused the City team, by then watching in the dressing room, waiting as their fate was determined. “We didn’t know Benfica needed a goal to qualify so when the goalkeeper goes up, we say, ‘why you go?’ because Madrid can equalise and we are out,” smiled Guardiola. “But it was a good strategy for Jose.\" And a good outcome for Guardiola.\n\nCity had kicked off in 11th and climbed as high as fifth at one stage in the night. They eventually clung on to eighth. They may yet rue not finishing higher, and the points they dropped in the north of Norway. Theirs could be the toughest of last-16 ties. They at least take the direct route there, albeit in an unorthodox way: victorious in the Bernabeu and losing in the Arctic Circle. But beating Real ultimately had more significance than being beaten by Bodo/Glimt.\n\nThey remedied some of the damage done there. City were professional, their triumph emphatic, albeit aided by Galatasaray’s insipidness. City needed to win and for three other results to go their way; two, given that Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle were playing each other. City entered the top eight inside eight minutes and without scoring and went two ahead inside half an hour. And yet their ending was nervy. “With a bit of drama, we did it,” said captain Bernardo Silva.\n\nTheir reward is a rest. Jeremy Doku had spoken of the importance of giving City a couple of midweeks off in February. He then ensured their fixture list will be emptier until March. “A big miss,” said Guardiola. The Belgian limped off before half-time. Until then, he had been electric, setting up two goals. He has added precision to his pace, the ability to pick a pass to his capacity for solo runs.\n\nDoku’s injury was one of the few blights on City’s night. Erling Haaland got back on the goal trail, with a first in open play in 10 games. Rayan Cherki offered further evidence of why he looks such an astute signing, with a third in the Champions League this season.\n\nThere were encouraging performances across the pitch. With Rodri suspended, Nico O’Reilly deputised, drew a fine save with a thunderbolt and provided a comparison with City’s Champions League-winning skipper. Ilkay Gundogan made his first return to the Etihad Stadium, granted the captain’s armband by Galatasaray and a standing ovation by many City fans when he went off; but he had looked ineffectual and off the pace.\n\nWith O’Reilly in midfield, Rayan Ait-Nouri got a rare start at left-back and flourished going forward while defensively he was not troubled by another City old boy; Leroy Sane was anonymous. A successor, in Doku, was altogether brighter.\n\nHaaland ended his drought with a delicate dink over Ugurcan Cakir. “A fantastic, fantastic goal,” said Guardiola. It stemmed from a defence-splitting pass from Doku, showing he is much more than just an irrepressible dribbler. The winger was playing as one of City’s No 10s in a 4-2-2-2 formation and this was a playmaker’s pass.\n\nHaaland could have got on the scoresheet even sooner, flying in to head Ait-Nouri’s lovely cross wide. “I love a lot that he misses one clear [chance] and after that [he has] the composure to make his incredible touch,” said Guardiola. For Haaland, it was a 56th Champions League goal in as many games.\n\nFor Doku, there was soon a second assist of the evening as he teed up Cherki to drive in a shot. Tellingly, Gundogan afforded one of his replacements too much space to shoot. City could have scored more thereafter – and perhaps would have done had Doku stayed on, with Phil Foden struggling as his replacement – but Omar Marmoush directed a shot straight at Cakir.\n\nThen Guardiola brought on Nico Gonzalez for a first appearance in three weeks. It helped that there was little prospect of a comeback. Victor Osimhen directed two shots at Gianluigi Donnarumma but the abiding image of his night was when he seemed through on goal and was instead dispossessed by Matheus Nunes.\n\nCity had a second-string defence, but they were rarely troubled. Galatasaray had beaten Liverpool but produced a limp performance, lacking in intensity and intent. They have an eclectic assortment of results; given their talent and cost, they could have finished higher than 20th. City, though, could look down on Real, Internazionale and PSG in the table. “Considering how many top, top teams are out of the top eight, I know how difficult it is,” said Guardiola.

Haaland, Doku and Cherki really shined and we hope the best for Doku as he came off early in this one. In the game, City took the peddle to the metal early and had two goals by halftime. A win that puts the club in the top eight and auto qualify fir the nest round, avoiding the extra set of games. A big win.\n\n“We’re really pleased to finish top eight considering how the Champions League has become.\n\n“When I started 16 or 17 years ago, qualification was not as difficult.\n\n“Today, every team is really, really tough, and I’m really pleased and hopefully we can arrive in March in our best.\n\n“We started really well and had chances. We had no proper holding midfielders there.\n\n“Jeremy and Omar were excellent, but we had incredible chances and maybe we [could have] needed more goals to qualify.\n\n“Not just that, that we’ve already qualified. Hopefully in that moment we can arrive better.\n\n“Look how many incredible teams are out of the top 24 and how many are not in the top eight and still it’s the youngest team we have played in my years here in the Champions League.\n\n“It’s a process to learn and hopefully Rodri, Marc and Semenyo will be back when we are there.

    "fullText": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Bo Nix insists he'll be the same dual-threat quarterback he was before breaking his right ankle in the playoffs and missing the AFC championship game.\n\nThe Denver Broncos signal-caller said a simple misstep led to a clean break and required a straightforward fix.\n\nHe said the injury was “nothing that concerns me, nothing that scares me going forward like I'm injury-prone or anything. This is one of those just inconvenient football plays and I'm excited already to get back to work. I can't necessarily avoid anything in the future, but I feel really good that my body's going to be in good shape.”\n\nSpeaking on a conference call Wednesday, Nix said he was going to take some time off anyway after the season, so his recovery and rehab over the next several weeks won’t necessarily impede his offseason training.\n\nNix also clarified two things about his injury. He said it was independent of previous ankle issues he dealt with in high school and college; and he said what made his injury inevitable wasn't a predisposition — as coach Sean Payton described it a day earlier — but a developing stress fracture that gave way to a full break.\n\nDurability has never been an issue with Nix.\n\n“I'd probably say four years, probably over 60 games straight of me getting to play and not missing games,” Nix said. “So, I don't really worry about the durability. Honestly, with a simple break like this I'll feel as good as new, won't have any hiccups even getting back going with training.\n\n“I was going to give myself some time off anyway and this sort of makes me take that time off work, won't be able to scratch the itch and get back out there too early,” Nix added. “This will slow me down, make sure I'm taking my rest. ... I'm still going to be running around.”\n\nIndeed, Nix was cruising around team headquarters this week on his medical scooter so he could say his goodbyes to teammates and coaches.\n\nNix said the injury “won't affect my training, won't affect my season next year. If anything, it'll just allow me to go out there and play more free knowing hey, there's nothing you can do about” freak injuries.\n\nBackup Jarrett Stidham replaced Nix on Sunday and he committed a series of blunders, including a fumble at his own 12 that led to the Patriots' only touchdown and helped New England advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nSitting out the game “was terrible,” Nix said. “It was very helpless. Wasn’t much I could do about it. It’s tough to see when you go down, the show just keeps right on going. I think that’s the toughest part. ... It was a bummer. It was tough. It was a tough week.”\n\nNix watched the game from a suite at Empower Field at Mile High after returning from Birmingham, Alabama, where Dr. Norman E. Waldrop III, a foot and ankle specialist at the Andrews Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center, operated on his ankle.\n\nHe called the operation “a very quick procedure, very easy operation, just a simple bone break. Got that fixed up. Great surgeon. Great care. And just right back on my road to recovery, a typical bone break, four to six weeks, I’ll be back training.”\n\nIn his first public comments since getting hurt, Nix also said he didn't realize the extent of his injury right away. Before going for X-rays, he was celebrating Denver's 33-30 win on Wil Lutz's field goal to cap a drive fueled by Ja'Quan McMillian's interception of Josh Allen's deep pass.\n\nNix said he was crushed to learn his season was over.\n\n“You go that long and you play that many games and you have that big of a season and then it kind of comes to and end abruptly like that, it stinks,” Nix said.\n\nBut, he added, “my sights are already on nest year and how I can be better and lead this team better and play better. I'm just excited for the offseason work and to get back to the physical part of training.”\n\nNix has led the Broncos to back-to-back playoff appearances and tied Russell Wilson's NFL record with 24 regular-season wins in his first two years.\n\nHis early success has made his position coach, former NFL QB Davis Webb, who just turned 31, a hot coaching candidate. Webb has interviewed for the Las Vegas Raiders' head coaching job. Should he stay in Denver, there's speculation he'll get a bigger role, maybe even taking over play-calling duties from Sean Payton, who fired his longtime right-hand man and offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi on Tuesday.\n\n“Davis is a tremendous coach,” Nix said. “He really knows how to communicate with his players. ... I think highly of him. I know he's a really good football coach and I know he's got a lot in store for him in the future.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid have fallen to defeat in their final league phase match of the Champions League, with Bodo/Glimt coming from behind to win at the RiyadhAir Metropolitano.\n\nDiego Simeone’s side knew that a win was needed in order for a top 8 spot to be rubber-stamped, and they got off to the best start. Minutes after seeing an effort brilliantly saved by Bodo/Glimt goalkeeper Nikita Haikin, Alexander Sorloth headed in a David Hancko cross to open the scoring.\n\nAtleti had a number of chances to double their lead in the minutes after Sorloth’s goal, with the likes of Alex Baena, Pablo Barrios and Nico Gonzalez all going close. In the end, they were made to pay for their inability to score a second as the visitors equalised when Fredrik Sjovold turned home a cross from Fredrik Andre Bjorkan.\n\nAtleti started the second half well in pursuit of the victory they needed, but it was Bodo/Glimt that scored the third goal of the match. After a mad scramble inside the penalty area, prolific striker Kasper Hogh tapped home to make it 2-1 to the Norwegian side, who were now on course for a play-off place.\n\nSorloth had a good chance to bring Atleti back level with another header, but his effort was straight at Haikin. That was as good as it got for Los Colchoneros, whose failure to win either of their last two league phase matches means they must settle for a place in the Champions League play-off round.\n\nThe result means Atleti end the league phase in 14th place. They will face either Club Brugge or Galatasaray, whom they drew 1-1 with last week, in the play-off round, with the draw to be made by UEFA on Friday afternoon.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are going to the Super Bowl, and contrary to what many of their critics have been saying this year, it wasn’t easy.\n\nWhile their regularseason schedule was historically soft, the Patriots had to go through three top-five defenses in the playoffs. No other team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 has ever done that.\n\nWhat’s more, New England had to win three outdoor games in winter conditions, which got progressively worse throughout January. By the second half of the AFC title game against the Denver Broncos, the Patriots were basically playing in a blizzard.\n\nThe elements, tough defenses and pressure seemed to get to Drake Maye a bit, whose performance suffered in the postseason compared to his MVP-caliber regular season. These were the first true challenges of his career in just his second NFL season and first postseason run, and he was learning the hard way.\n\nDrake Maye: \"It's hard… Good God\"\n\nJosh McDaniels: \"Look at me, it's gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding 6 1/2 minutes of our lives if we can get it done.\" 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nThe vulnerability here… holy moly man. \n\n🎥: @Patriots pic.twitter.com/CyoaTUQpti\n\n— Michael Rodnick (@MJRodnick) January 28, 2026\n\n“Hey, it’s hard,” he told New England’s offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s game as snow rained down on them in Denver.\n\nMcDaniels, who’s in his 19th season with the Patriots coaching staff, is well aware. He’s been part of countless playoff games in tough conditions and is going to his ninth Super Bowl.\n\nFortunately for New England, he was able to help calm Maye down and give him some wise advice.\n\n“I know,” McDaniels said, laughing. “Listen to me. Look at me. It’s gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding six and a half minutes of our lives if we can get it done.”\n\nMaye took those words to heart, buckling down and finishing the job himself. He sealed the Patriots’ 10-7 win by running through the snow for a first down after the two-minute warning, punching their tickets to the Super Bowl.\n\nPatriots Predicted To Add Tight End Coming Off Eight-Touchdown Year",

However, Cooter does not call the plays for the Colts -- Shane Steichen does -- and the Eagles' opening is likely a play-calling role, so this job would be a step up for him in that regard.\n\nWith that said, the NFL views this as a lateral move if it were to happen, so Steichen had to give Cooter the go-ahead to pursue this opportunity, according to SI's Albert Breer.\n\nCooter was on the Eagles' staff in 2021 under current head coach Nick Sirianni.\n\nColts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter interviewed in-person Tuesday for the Eagles OC job, per league source.

    "description": "The Los Angeles Dodgers stuck to their guns during their negotiations with All-Star outfielder Kyle Tucker, keeping their offer short-term.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers made it clear early in the offseason they weren’t looking to sign Kyle Tucker to a long-term deal, and stuck to their guns during negotiations with the All-Star.\n\nL.A. landed the slugger with a four-year, $240 million deal despite not having the largest sum of money on the table, speaking volumes about the winning culture the Dodgers have created over the past several years.\n\nPresident of baseball operations Andrew Friedman chalked up the decision to stay with a short-term contract cto making sure the team is as good in the future as they are now.\n\n“In the short term, it’s easy to take the core talent we have in place, the nucleus that we have, and say, ‘Anything we can add to that.’ You don’t want to be flippant about what we have right now in this moment in time,” Friedman said to The Athletic. “That being said, we have to try to balance it with three, four, five years out. As the guys that are currently under contract get out … infusing young players over that time is going to be really important for us to be able to maintain.”\n\nThe short-term deal is a smart move from the Dodgers if they want to make additions from their farm system, as Tucker turned 29 earlier this month. L.A. has the oldest position player core in baseball, but can balance it out as some of their older players leave with the league’s best farm system.\n\nTucker was easily the best bat available in free agency and will do wonders for the Dodgers’ offense in the coming season.\n\nThe four-time All-Star plugged the hole L.A. had in the outfield, and as one of the best players in the game, he will surely turn one of the Dodgers’ weaknesses last season into a strength.\n\nMore news: Former Dodgers Top Pitching Prospect on Trade Block\n\nTucker has hit 20 or more home runs in each of the last five seasons, also accruing more than 4.0 bWAR in all of them. His worst season of the bunch came in 2025 — he had 22 home runs and 73 RBIs through 136 games — but he still managed a .841 OPS and played through a hairline fracture in his hand for a couple of months.\n\nWith Tucker bolstering their star-studded lineup, the Dodgers will look to claim their third consecutive World Series title — becoming the third franchise to complete a three-peat.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League is flexing its muscles in Europe as five English teams finished in the top eight of the Champions League to reach the knockouts.\n\nThat could become six in the last-16 if Newcastle win their two-legged play-off after they finished 12th in the league phase following a 1-1 draw at defending champions PSG on Wednesday.\n\nArsenal finished in first place with Liverpool third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City finishing eighth.\n\nHistory could be made if Newcastle progress through the play-offs as never before have there been six Premier League teams in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"That is dominant,\" said Spurs boss Thomas Frank.\n\n\"I think we all said for a few years the Premier League is the best league in the world and I think this is another sign of it.\"\n\nSo why have Premier League sides been so dominant against Europe's elite?\n\nThe most obvious starting point is the financial power of the Premier League, which significantly outweighs other leagues.\n\nSix Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.\n\nTV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.\n\nLast summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.\n\nTo highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent in the summer window was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.\n\nMore money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big to increase their strength in depth as they finished first in the league phase of the Champions League and sit top of the Premier League.\n\n\"The biggest single reason that the English clubs have been dominant so far is the financial power of the Premier League,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Also, it is about how competitive they have got by fighting it out and being in and around each other - they have pushed each other on.\"\n\nNewcastle forward Anthony Gordon also says a more open style of play in Europe has benefited English teams, while the Premier League is \"more physical than I've ever known it to be\".\n\n\"I think in the Champions League, teams are more open. They all try to play. It's less transitional,\" he added.\n\n\"It [the Premier League] is like a basketball game sometimes, it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's a running game and sometimes it's about duels, whoever wins the duels wins the game. Or moments.\n\n\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game, more football based. Teams come and try and play proper football.\n\n\"In the Premier League, you see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces - it's become a lot slower and more set piece based, I would say.\"\n\nWhen is the Champions League play-off draw and how does it work?\n\nLiverpool top English club in Deloitte Money League\n\nIt is undoubtedly an impressive achievement for five - and potentially six - Premier League teams to reach the knockouts.\n\nBut was the fixture computer kinder for them than other teams?\n\nAt the start of the season, football data statisticians Opta analysed every team's Champions League fixtures and ranked them all to work out who had the kindest draw.\n\nArsenal's fixtures were ranked the third easiest, with Tottenham fourth, Liverpool seventh and Chelsea eighth.\n\nManchester City were deemed to have the 14th easiest fixtures while Newcastle - who played defending champions Paris St-Germain - were 32nd in the rankings.\n\nThe last - and only - time five Premier League teams made it through to the knockouts was in 2017, when Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed.\n\nHowever just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to the final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.\n\nWith five Premier League sides finishing in the top eight of this season's league phase, and therefore avoiding the prospect of facing one another in the last-16, there is the chance of a record number of English teams making the quarter-finals.\n\nHaving numerous English clubs in latter stages of the Champions League is nothing new with four sides progressing to the quarters in both 2007-08 and 2008-09, as well as 2018-19 - leading to an all-English final in 07-08 and 2018-19.\n\nNo other country have ever had four teams in the quarter-finals - this year England could have as many as six.\n\nBut the demands of playing in the Premier League alongside the Champions League takes its toll, which is why many managers were relieved to avoid the two extra play-off games.\n\n\"I still think it will be very difficult for one of them to go on and win it, just because of how difficult the Premier League is every week - whether you are fighting for the title or for a place in the top four,\" Warnock added.\n\n\"Clearly the English clubs are in a good position going into the knockout stages, though. Some of the other big clubs that we thought would peak or start to show better form - like Paris St-Germain for example - have not really got going yet.\"\n\nThe three other countries who had teams join English sides in progressing to the knockouts were Germany (Bayern Munich), Spain (Barcelona) and Portugal (Sporting CP).\n\nThat has left some surprises having to go through via the play-offs, with Paris St-Germain failing to get the win they needed against Newcastle to secure a top-eight spot.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, were on the wrong end of a thrilling and dramatic match with Benfica.\n\nReal were reduced to nine men while a last-second goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin secured a memorable 4-2 win for Jose Mourinho's side that earned them a play-off spot.\n\nOther big sides who are facing the lottery of the play-offs include Italian sides Juventus and Inter Milan, along with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Spain's Atletico Madrid - who were stunned by Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.\n\nThe Norwegians have been the surprise package of the Champions League and their win against Atletico came just eight days after they beat Manchester City.\n\nThose results meant they are into the play-offs and have become the first Norwegian side to progress from the league or group phase in Champions League since Rosenborg in 1996-97.\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "fullText": "Mike McCarthy is wasting no time in building his coaching staff at the Pittsburgh Steelers. But in the process, he’s not letting go of everyone who has worked under former head coach Mike Tomlin. After taking on the center role, McCarthy has retained three key assistants from Tomlin’s staff. The news comes just as the Steelers inch closer to finding their new defensive coordinator.\n\n“Mike McCarthy is expected to bring back three members of Mike Tomlin’s staff—linebackers coach Scott McCurley, who was on his staff in Dallas; QB coach Tom Arth; and secondary coach Gerald Alexander, per sources,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Gerry Dulac tweeted on X.\n\nThe move allows Mike McCarthy to capitalize on these coaches’ familiarity with the organization and their knowledge of it while shaping the staff in his own way.\n\nMeanwhile, Dulac also reported that the Steelers are close to naming a new defensive coordinator.\n\n“New Steelers coach Mike McCarthy is close to bringing in Patrick Graham as his defensive coordinator, per sources,” he wrote on X. “Graham, 47, was defensive coordinator the past three seasons with the Raiders. He also served in that role with the Dolphins (2019) and Giants (2020-21).”\n\nThe post Mike McCarthy Makes Triple Coaching Staff Decision as Steelers Close In on DC appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles have reportedly completed a second interview with an offensive coordinator candidate on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to NBC Sports Philadelphia’s John Clark, the team hosted Jim Bob Cooter for a second interview. Cooter is the second coordinator candidate known to get a second look from the Eagles throughout this process.\n\nEagles head coach Nick Sirianni has a past with Jim Bob Cooter. The two worked together on the Kansas City Chiefs in 2012. At the time, Cooter was an offensive quality control coach.\n\nSince then, he held positions with the Denver Broncos and the Detroit Lions. In 2014, Cooter was hired to coach quarterbacks in Detroit before getting the bump to offensive coordinator in 2016. He held that position until 2018, when he was hired by the New York Jets to coach running backs.\n\nJim Bob Cooter and Nick Sirianni linked once again in 2021. He wasn’t officially on the coaching staff, but held a position as an independent consultant.\n\n“Obviously, he's got a lot of experience and he's a great football mind. I think very highly of him,” Sirianni told reporters at the time of his reveal.\n\nSince his project with the Eagles, Cooter held a passing game coordinator role with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2022. Then in 2023, he joined former Eagles OC Shane Steichen on the Indianapolis Colts’ staff.\n\nThe Eagles reportedly hosted Sean Mannion for a second interview. The former third-round pick out of Oregon State played for several teams from 2015 to 2023. He joined the Green Bay Packers’ coaching staff, landing a job as an offensive assistant.\n\nLast year, Mannion was bumped to quarterbacks coach. While it’s not clear if Mannion is the favorite in the clubhouse for the Eagles, he’s clearly gaining some steam alongside Jim Bob Cooter as one of the leading candidates to replace Kevin Patullo.\n\nIs Brian Daboll’s decision to pass on Eagles Jalen Hurts’ fault?\n\nDavis Webb news hits Broncos with more obstacles\n\nWho will be the Eagles OC in 2026?

The NFL Draft and free agency will both present option to better the team, and they could be in the market for another pass catcher.\n\nStefon Diggs and Mack Hollins have been great additions, but the Patriots could benefit from adding a weapon who can make plays after the catch. Drake Maye ranked outside of the top 10 in passing yards after the catch, meaning there is room to improve.\n\nYahoo Sports’ Nate Tice predicted the Patriots would draft University of Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq with the 31st pick of the NFL Draft.\n\n“While Sadiq is a tight end, the Patriots need pass catchers, especially ones who can create explosives with the ball in their hands,” Tice wrote on Tuesday. “Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels loves to use tight ends, and Maye has loved throwing the ball to Hunter Henry in his first two seasons. Sadiq would give them a weapon who can turn those screens and underneath routes into big plays. He has the speed and receiving ability to stretch the defense, and also some real grit as a blocker that Mike Vrabel would love.”\n\nSadiq had 560 yards on 51 receptions last season. He scored eight touchdowns as well. In three seasons at Oregon, he had 892 yards and 11 receiving touchdowns. He averaged 11.2 yards per reception in college.\n\nHe led Oregon in receiving touchdowns and was third on the team in receiving yards per game. At 6-foot-3, 245 pounds, he may be undersized for a tight end, but he has tremendous speed and can be a difference maker for the Patriots.\n\nWhat Josh McDaniels Told Drake Maye To Seal Patriots’ AFC Championship",

Fields had a dubious distinction in a Week 6 loss to the Broncos. He was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. Fields was benched nine games into the season.”\n\nThere’s a possibility that the Steelers could reunite with Fields this offseason, especially if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back.

Belichick, a 29-year NFL head-coaching veteran with six Super Bowl rings, was considered a first-ballot selection by most fans. Still, we learned on Tuesday that he did not receive enough votes to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.\n\nTrump is considered a rather controversial figure these days, but his opinion on the matter seemed to be right in line with most of the NFL fanbase as he blasted the decision on social media.

Recently, Trump announced he wouldn't attend Super Bowl LX in San Francisco because it is \"too far away,\" while blasting the scheduled musical performances by Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\n“I’m anti-them.

    "fullText": "Benoit Saint Denis says fans should know what to expect against Dan Hooker at UFC 325.\n\nSaint Denis (16-3 MMA, 8-3 UFC) draws Hooker (24-13 MMA, 14-9 UFC) in Saturday's lightweight co-main event (Paramount+) at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney.\n\nFresh off a knockout win over Beneil Dariush at UFC 322 this past November, Saint Denis admits he was a little surprised when he got the call to fight Hooker. But after learning that it's for UFC 325, he understood why.\n\n\"We were pretty surprised by the timing of the fight, but knowing it's next to his country, it made it more clear why they wanted him to fight there,\" Saint Denis told reporters at UFC 325 media day (h/t MMA Crazy). \"I was already on holiday in my mind, and I put the switch back on because I mean, BSD-Dan Hooker, you need no promotion. It's going to be a scrap.\"\n\nHooker questioned Saint Denis' knockout ability, but the Frenchman had no issues reminding him of what he's capable of.\n\n\"He's going to find out Saturday,\" Saint Denis said. \"I don't know how many knockouts he has in the UFC. I have four, and I have a 100 percent finish rate, and it's a mix between submissions and knockouts. So, I think he knows. He knows it's going to be something. I think I will fight the best version of him – I hope so, and may the better fighter win.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Benoit Saint Denis: Dan Hooker UFC 325 fight 'needs no promotion'",

    "fullText": "Lakers guard Luka Doncic was injured in the first quarter of the game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday after slipping on a fadeaway three.\n\nDoncic was hoping backwards on one leg after he took the shot with 7:58 remaining in the first quarter and slipped off the edge of the court. He immediately grabbed at his lower left leg and was unable to stand up. The Lakers called a timeout and trainers helped Doncic to his feet. He hobbled toward the Lakers locker room, putting almost no weight on his left leg.\n\nHe returned to the court with 1:32 left in the first quarter. He has four points on one-of-six shooting from the field, missing all three of his shots from deep early in the second quarter.\n\nCleveland’s home court is raised above the arena floor to accommodate for an ice hockey rink underneath. It's the only arena in the NBA with the unique set up. Miami Heat guard Dru Smith suffered a severe anterior cruciate ligament sprain from slipping off the court in 2023.\n\nDoncic, the NBA’s leading scorer, is averaging 33.8 points for the Lakers, who are in the midst of an eight-game road trip. They are just getting healthy as guard Austin Reaves is expected to return from a calf injury by the end of the trip that stretches to Feb. 3.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts praised his team for their complete buy-in during the 2025 season.\n\nThe Dodgers won their second consecutive World Series title last season, and Roberts says club culture and morale made all the difference.\n\n“Not one time was I questioned on my decision-making [by the players], which in turn would question their commitment to the team,” Roberts said to Jack Harris of the California Post. “They all felt their time was coming. They all felt that their roles were really valued. I don’t think that any head coach or manager can say that.”\n\nThe Dodgers definitely have the stars to compete with the best, but some of the biggest moments of the season came from some of the less expected players on the roster.\n\nMiguel Rojas is the best example of this, as the veteran single-handedly saved the season for L.A. in Game 7 of the World Series with his game-tying home run in the top of the ninth inning.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Fan Favorite Set to Coach in NBA All-Star Celebrity Game\n\nThe general focus and culture of the team isn’t just helping players perform, though. It’s also attracting new faces to the Dodgers. All-Star closer Edwin Diaz revealed his brother Alexis, who played for the Dodgers in 2025, played a role in his move to the NL West.\n\n“I did talk to Alexis a little bit when the conversation was getting more close to sign with the Dodgers. He told me that they are really, really good organization,” Diaz said at his introductory press conference in December. “They treat every player like they are all really good players. And that was something I looked for. You know, he told me great things about the Dodgers and made it easy for me.”\n\nWith the level of belief and the Dodgers ability already, they have themselves set up for another successful campaign in the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers’ Dave Roberts Credits Team Commitment for Success in 2025 appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

A day later, an important point of clarification has emerged.\n\nPolian, after saying he voted for Belichick before saying he can't say with 100 percent certainty whether he did, says he did indeed vote for his former New England nemesis.\n\n“I voted for coach Belichick in the Hall of Fame selection meeting,” Polian said in an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio, after explaining he was reading from a prepared statement. “The Pro Football Hall of Fame has confirmed that fact through the auditors of the selection process. Again, I’ll state that I never said that I believe that Coach Belichick should quote, wait a year, close quote, for enshrinement. This has been confirmed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, numerous selectors who were in the room, and my vote for coach Belichick. As a Hall of Fame member and selector, I realize the import of what we do. I’ve always tried as a selector to make these difficult choices with the utmost of objectivity. I’ve said on SiriusXM Radio and numerous other media outlets that I believe Coach Belichick to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, my vote confirms that.”\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter. Not enough of the voters voted for Belichick. At least 11 of 50 failed to include Belichick among three selections from a group that included Belichick, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and seniors candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig, and L.C.

    "description": "Everybody knows the U.S. is fertile ground for trucks, but could a Genesis pickup sell?",
    "fullText": "How much does the United States like pickup trucks? You don’t need me to answer that question. Just look out the window and you’ll see all the reasons a manufacturer might need to build their own. Now, a company like Hyundai or its luxury arm Genesis can’t simply decide to sell a body-on-frame pickup and have the same success as Detroit’s Big Three. But at least one—if not both—of those automakers seems set to release a truck of their own in the near future. Hyundai says it’ll bring such a vehicle to market by 2030, and Genesis has even gone so far as designing one already.\n\nThe chunky rig was featured in a recent issue of Auto&Design, an Italian publication. There’s no mistaking it for anything else, as the grille and parallel headlight elements are distinctly Genesis. Said LEDs wrap all the way around the front fenders and pick back up on the rearmost part of the bedsides. In that way, it’s a lot like the X Gran Equator Concept that Genesis unveiled last spring. This truck actually shares a lot with that wild SUV once you look at them side-by-side.\n\nIt doesn’t have some secretive internal designation, according to the Auto&Design article; it’s simply referred to as “the pickup.” Luc Donckerwolke, chief creative officer and chief brand officer for Genesis, is quoted as saying, “An electric pickup truck? Why not? Then we discarded it because we had to focus on different projects. Maybe in the future, who knows.”\n\nI’m not saying reverse psychology is at play here, but I’ve certainly heard similar talk from auto execs before, only for that very thing to become a reality in the near future.\n\nMy guess is that Genesis did the prep work in case Hyundai has success with its body-on-frame truck and the market seems ready for a more premium version. Aside from it being an unfamiliar name in the pickup segment, I think its biggest blocker would be the electric powertrain. I’m not saying it can’t work, but we’ve seen the EV forecast shift drastically in the past 12 months, and even a company like Rivian only sells a handful of battery-powered pickups compared to its SUVs.\n\nI won’t hold my breath waiting for this to reach production, at least in the next four or five years. Whether or not this ever gets built likely depends on how well the public receives Hyundai’s version. That’ll be interesting to observe on its own, as I’m curious if it’ll have more success than the Santa Cruz. I bet it’ll be good, but whether or not it’ll be enough to capture a piece of the pie from other established players in the space seems a lot less certain.\n\nGot a tip or question for the author?

    "description": "MoltBot shows how powerful local AI agents can be. But if your agent stores in plain-text API keys, webhook tokens, transcripts, and long-term memory in known locations, an infostealer can grab the whole thing in seconds.",
    "fullText": "MoltBot (formerly Clawd Bot), the locally running, open-source AI agent named after the Lobster workflow shell that powers its agentic loop, has rocked an AI community that, just weeks ago, was so in love with its own hype it would have yawned at literal magic.\n\nAnd yet MoltBot, seemingly just a wrapper around a collection of familiar technologies, has put those pieces together in a way that feels like a portal to a future that, a month ago, still felt impossibly distant.\n\nWithin an hour of setting up MoltBot on my Mac, it had already built a fully featured kanban board where I could assign it tasks and track their state.\n\nI have seen other stories that are even wilder. One user shared an anecdote about asking it to make a restaurant reservation, and when it realized it could not do it through OpenTable, it went and got its own AI voice software and just called the restaurant, then secured the reservation over the phone.\n\nIts own author, Peter Steinberger, described joking to MoltBot that he was worried about his laptop getting stolen while he was still developing it in Morocco. MoltBot, ever the terrifyingly efficient pragmatist, immediately started planning its migration to a remote server.\n\nNone of those are pre-programmed routines. They are dynamic behaviors born out of an agentic loop that takes a goal and improvises a plan, grabbing whatever tools it needs to execute. It can apply general world knowledge, specific skills, and near-perfect memory into organized action toward objectives you set, and, more sobering, objectives it decides to set for itself.\n\nStories like these keep pouring in. My feed is full of people buying Mac minis as dedicated devices for their new agentic AI friend. I have also seen multiple posts pointing at Cloudflare’s secure tunneling as the obvious way to access a local setup from anywhere on the internet.\n\nMoltBot is able to give us this preview of the future because it is a tool that, for now, forgoes an essential constraint: security. The project’s FAQ presents the Faustian bargain plainly: “There is no ‘perfectly secure’ setup.”\n\nMoltBot works because it does three simple things better than almost anything else in the agent world right now:\n\nIt keeps persistent memory across sessions.\n\nIt has deep, unapologetic access to your local machine and apps.\n\nIt can take action autonomously in an agentic loop, not just suggest steps.\n\nThat combination is why it feels both a glimpse at the future, but presented as a goal, where between us and the future realized, is a lot of hard work to make it safe.\n\nAt 1Password, we make it easy to take advantage of this future in a way that keeps you secure.\n\nMoltBot’s memory and configuration are not abstract concepts. They are files. They live on disk. They are readable. They are in predictable locations. And they are plain text.\n\nIf an attacker compromises the same machine you run MoltBot on, they do not need to do anything fancy. Modern infostealers scrape common directories and exfiltrate anything that looks like credentials, tokens, session logs, or developer config. If your agent stores in plain-text API keys, webhook tokens, transcripts, and long-term memory in known locations, an infostealer can grab the whole thing in seconds.\n\nAnd what makes this worse than a typical credential leak is the context.\n\nA single stolen API token is bad. Hundreds of stolen tokens and sessions for the critical services in your life is even worse. But a hundred stolen tokens and sessions, plus a long-term memory file that describes who you are, what you’re building, how you write, who you work with, and what you care about, is something else entirely. It’s the raw material needed to phish you, blackmail you, or even fully impersonate you in a way that even your closest friends and family can’t detect.\n\nOne of the smartest things I’ve heard about MoltBot came from a customer who set it up on a dedicated Mac mini with its own email address and its own 1Password account, as if it were a new hire. They first installed it on their main laptop, then got spooked by how much it could touch, so they moved it to a separate machine to control its access and experiment safely.\n\nThis is directionally correct and it’s compatible with how we are thinking about the future of securing AI with 1Password.\n\nThe mistake the industry is making right now is treating agent security like normal app security. A familiar consent screen. A one-time approval. A set of scopes. Then we assume the future behavior will match the intent of that one moment.\n\nThat model breaks the second you hand autonomy to something that is adaptive and non-deterministic by design. The agent changes. The tasks change. The context changes. The approval you gave last week is used in new and unexpected ways today.\n\nSecurity for agents is not about granting access once. It is about continuously mediating access at runtime for every action and request.\n\nThe future we want looks like this:\n\nYour agent has its own identity, like a new hire.\n\nIt gets access through 1Password, not through a pile of long-lived tokens sitting in plain text on disk.\n\nWhen it needs to act, it requests the minimum authority it needs right now.\n\nThat authority is time-bound, revocable, and attributable to the agent, not smeared across the human who originally clicked approve.\n\nYou can answer the only question that matters when something goes wrong: who did what, when?\n\nIn other words, 1Password is not just where secrets live. It is the control plane that governs access. It is the layer that turns agent autonomy into something you can actually trust.\n\nAgents are going to become normal. The only question is whether you choose to make them governable.\n\nThat future does not exist today, but the work to make it real and safe is already underway.\n\n1Password will be the company that makes that possible.",

    "fullText": "Starmer’s team is wary of spies but such fears are not new – with Theresa May once warned to get dressed under a duvet\n\nWhen prime ministers travel to China, heightened security arrangements are a given – as is the quiet game of cat and mouse that takes place behind the scenes as each country tests out each other’s tradecraft and capabilities.\n\nKeir Starmer’s team has been issued with burner phones and fresh sim cards, and is using temporary email addresses, to prevent devices being loaded with spyware or UK government servers being hacked into.\n\nThe employment of such tactics may sound dramatic but they are par for the course in an age of digital espionage and information security. Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.\n\nFor visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.\n\nWhen she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.\n\nConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said. Those with time on their hands would try to find the concealed bugging devices for fun.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown visited China in 2008, an aide was victim of a honey trap. The male aide met a Chinese woman at a lively hotel disco in Shanghai and left with her. The next day, he reported that his BlackBerry phone was missing. He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.\n\nPart of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.\n\nMichael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”\n\nDavid Cameron visited Beijing as prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.\n\nThe practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.\n\nGeneral guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.\n\nWhen James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.\n\nOne of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.\n\nIt can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.\n\n“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.",

    "description": "Oprah Winfrey's newest book, \"Enough,\" is about her relationship with weight-loss drugs. Since the '90s, she has been combining her health with business.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey has spent years turning her private health journey into a public conversation — and, at times, a lucrative business.\n\nThe billionaire, real-estate mogul, talk-show host, journalist, actor, and producer has just released her 12th book: \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free.\"\n\nThe book, which she co-authored with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, a doctor and professor at Yale's School of Medicine, dives into the role of GLP-1 drugs to facilitate weight loss.\n\nThe practice is something that Winfrey herself has touted. On CNN in December 2024, she said she had first begun using a GLP-1 before Christmas in 2023.\n\nWinfrey has been combining her personal health and fitness with business for decades, including investing in WeightWatchers (now WW International), writing books about health, identifying exercise and health trends for her show and magazine, and putting her support behind figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWinfrey did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of how her health empire has evolved.\n\nDuring a 1988 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" — a few years after Joan Rivers asked about Winfrey's weight gain — Winfrey wheeled out a red wagon filled with 67 pounds of animal fat.\n\nWhy? To convey to her audience how much weight she'd lost in the last year while on the Optifast liquid diet.\n\nThe episode put a spotlight on medically supervised liquid formula diets. After it aired, The New York Times reported that Winfrey got just 400 calories a day from Optifast and wrote that the ability of people on such diets \"to maintain the loss is questionable and not yet fully evaluated.\"\n\nFor a 2005 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Winfrey wrote, \"For four solid months, I didn't eat a single morsel of food,\" and lost 67 pounds. \"What I didn't know was that my metabolism was shot. Two weeks after I returned to real food, I was up 10 pounds.\"\n\nWhile she was proud of losing the weight, Winfrey later regretted the decision to pull the wagon out.\n\n\"When I look at that show, I think it was one of the biggest ego trips of my life,\" Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe cowrote \"Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life\" with exercise physiologist (and her personal trainer) Bob Greene.\n\nThe 10 steps included guidance such as \"exercise 20 to 60 minutes a day,\" \"eat a low-fat, balanced diet,\" and \"eat three meals and two snacks each day.\"\n\nIt went on to become a No. 1 bestseller and is still in circulation.\n\nWinfrey introduced audiences to Phil McGraw, aka Dr. Phil, in the late '90s as her show's resident relationship expert. He proved so popular that Winfrey produced and co-created a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" starring McGraw: \"Dr. Phil.\" It aired from 2002 to 2023, and for most of its run, it was second in ratings only to Winfrey's show.\n\nLike Winfrey, McGraw frequently discussed weight loss and health on his show, and also lent his face and name to nutritional supplements. As The New York Times wrote in 2003, \"Oprah Winfrey has talked about weight loss — hers and everyone else's — for years. Her protégé Dr. Phil has found a way to make money from it.\"\n\nHe's also written his own weight-loss books, including \"The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Freedom\" and \"The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide.\"\n\nWinfrey also introduced Dr. Mehmet Oz to her show's audience. He made his \"Oprah\" debut in 2004 and ultimately appeared more than 60 times, per NPR, before Winfrey greenlit \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in 2009. It aired until 2022, when he began a US Senate campaign in Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Oz's program featured many segments on weight loss, and Oz himself endorsed multiple \"cures\" for obesity that have been disproven. He was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2024.\n\nWhile it's not known how much money Winfrey made from their two shows, both aired for over a decade (with reruns on Winfrey's channel, OWN), and Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, was involved throughout.\n\nWinfrey's own show, which aired for 25 years, was the foundation of her wealth, rocketing her to millionaire status when it became nationally syndicated in 1986. By 2003, she was a billionaire, and she's now worth an estimated $3.2 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2015, Winfrey announced she was joining the board of WeightWatchers (now known as WW International, or WW) and was purchasing a 10% stake in the company worth $43 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that it led to an increase of $400 million in market value for the brand, which had been trending downward before Winfrey's involvement.\n\n\"WeightWatchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" she said in a statement. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nIt's an example of the Oprah Effect: the trend of Winfrey endorsing, supporting, or investing in a brand that leads to a spike in value.\n\nWinfrey posted on X (then Twitter) a video about how she'd lost 26 pounds on WeightWatchers while still eating bread.\n\n\"I love bread,\" she said. \"That's the genius of this program. I lost 26 pounds, and I have eaten bread every single day.\"\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, the subsequent bump in the stock price, just one hour after the post, netted Winfrey around $12 million.\n\nWinfrey's cookbook, which also reached bestseller status, incorporated the WeightWatchers system into its recipes and flagged the number of points each meal was worth, in a neat bit of corporate synergy.\n\nSoon after confirming her use of a GLP-1, Winfrey publicly said she wouldn't be seeking reelection to the board.\n\nThe announcement sent WeightWatchers' stock tumbling 25%. As Business Insider wrote at the time, it seemed like Winfrey was jumping ship from an \"outdated operating system\" in the age of Ozempic and other GLP-1s.\n\nWinfrey's latest book, \"Enough,\" which she cowrote with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, was released in January 2026. It details Winfrey's experience with GLP-1s, combined with Jastreboff's expertise.\n\nWinfrey has been promoting her book heavily, including a stop on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" where she explained how reframing her relationship to obesity and weight has changed her life.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" she said.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see [GLP-1s] as a tool,\" she continued.",

    "fullText": "The International Monetary Fund projects another year of solid global economic growth — but it's also warning not to take the continued upward trajectory for granted.\n\nThe IMF predicts that the global economy will grow 3.3% in 2026, mirroring that 3.3% growth seen in 2025, with 2027 expected to see similar gains.\n\n\"The world economy is resilient but you should not take this resilience for granted,\" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of IMF said at an event on Monday.\n\nAccording to Georgieva, there are four things that are driving up growth, and at least one is being overlooked by observers.\n\nHere's what the IMF sees pushing the world economy higher.\n\nGovernments around the world have let the private sector take the reins. With \"governments put out from running the economy where they don't belong,\" private sector strength supports growth, Georgieva said.\n\nThe economist said in remarks at Davos that governments taking a back seat allows the private sector to be \"more adaptable, more agile, and we see the benefits of it\".\n\nThe global economy's recent growth has been less tied to trade, mitigating the impacts many had feared from Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy.\n\nThe fact that effective tariff rates are below liberation day levels has meant the impact has been significantly less than initially feared.\n\nDespite trade tensions spurred by tariffs, \"we continue to trade for now,\" Georgieva says, adding, \"don't take this for granted.\"\n\nGlobal AI spending reached 1.76 trillion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $3.34 trillion in 2026, according to Gartner.\n\nThe \"massive investment in AI\" has served to boost optimism in the global economy, Georgieva said.\n\nThe IMF economist says one factor that is often forgotten when assessing global economic growth is \"the role of good policies and strong institutions.\"\n\nGeorgieva flagged the role of independent central banks, specifically, in the resilient global economy. She said tht these things are often given little attention but, and as a result, that could \"erode\" that source of strength.\n\nCentral bank independence is a key concern in the US as President Trump's administration pressures Fed chair Jerome Powell. The latest tensions have arisen from a criminal investigation by the DOJ into Powell's testimony about the Fed building renovation.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his criticism of the Fed chair, rattling markets with his threats to fire Powell over the last year.",

    "title": "I went on my first cruise — here are 15 things that surprised me about this type of travel",
    "description": "From room size to food quality, my first-ever cruise on board Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas was full of surprises.",
    "fullText": "The ship has 18 decks and 2,867 staterooms, according to Royal Caribbean.\n\nI booked a mid-tier room — a step above windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below suites.\n\nMy 179-square-foot cabin had a private bathroom, a king-size bed, and an ocean view.\n\nI was surprised by how big the discount was. To me, $1,000 feels like a huge price difference for the same vacation.\n\nI thought the stateroom made great use of a small space with plenty of storage for my clothes and other belongings. There were two closets for hanging space and more drawers than I used.\n\nAfter leaving to start my day each morning, a stateroom attendant cleaned my room. And after I left for dinner each night, they came back to clean up again. Every evening, they brought me fresh towels — sometimes creatively folded — and a flyer featuring the next day's schedule, including the weather, dress code, and any other important information, such as a time change.\n\nThis surprised me because I am used to having my room serviced once daily, if at all, during my hotel stays, and never in Airbnbs.\n\nAn electronic shade over the window could be lowered to reveal grand views. I loved waking up after a night at sea to a front-row view of the place I'd be visiting that day.\n\nWhile windowless rooms are cheaper, I couldn't imagine staying in one. My ocean-view stateroom cost about $300 more than an entry-level room.\n\nI booked a stateroom at the front of deck eight and felt constant motion in my room.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture falling. The first night this happened, I feared the worst, but over time, I realized that this was a normal aspect of cruising — but one I would likely never get used to.\n\nAfter talking to seasoned cruisers on the ship, several told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be for feeling motion. Higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable, they said.\n\nNext time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.\n\nAll I had to do for safety training was watch a couple of videos — either on my room TV or on the Royal Caribbean app — and then check in at my assembly station, the area I was assigned to in case of an emergency. At the assembly station, an attendant checked the Royal Caribbean app to confirm that I had completed the mandatory training.\n\nI was expecting to attend a large safety training session once I got on the ship, so this alternative was a breeze.\n\nSince there were so many elevators on the ship, I expected them to be a pretty efficient way to get around. But they were often so crowded and slow that I took the stairs instead. By the middle of my trip, unless I was going all the way up to the pool decks, I always opted for the stairs to save time.\n\nThe ship has 16 guest decks; each deck is divided into three sections — forward, middle, and aft.\n\nIt took me a few days to get used to the sections, and I often found myself heading to the right deck but the wrong section of the ship. Luckily, there were maps on every floor, which I used until the morning I left.\n\nIf I woke up on deck five of Wonder of the Seas with no memory of my cruise, I'd think I was in a shopping mall.\n\nAside from the slight movement of the ship, the indoor decks were so big that, as a cruise newbie, it was hard to believe that I was on a gigantic boat in the middle of the ocean. Everywhere I looked, I saw shops, stands, restaurants, large sculptures, and a unique ceiling structure that reminded me of the malls I've visited.\n\nAside from music festivals, I've never heard more live music on a trip than on this cruise. On the communal decks, musicians played for hours while people relaxed and played around them. I was also surprised by the eclectic mix of genres I heard, from rock to jazz to classical.\n\nIn addition to the music hall, where concerts were regularly held, live bands performed on indoor and outdoor communal decks. Some people watched, while others listened while swimming, relaxing, or walking around.\n\nI like to be comfy, so I was dreading formal nights going into this cruise.\n\nI brought one fancy dress with me to wear whenever I needed, but on the first formal night, I realized that the dress code wasn't strictly enforced. People wore a range of outfits, from evening gowns to T-shirts.\n\nFor the rest of the trip, I also relaxed my interpretation of the dress code.\n\nThe excursion I was most thrilled about — a hot-air balloon ride over the Bahamas — was canceled the day of because the winds were too high.\n\nIt was on the last day of my trip, and with only one day in port, it could not be rescheduled. It was the experience I was looking forward to most, so I was disappointed. On a cruise ship, I learned that all plans are subject to change based on things outside the crew's control, like the weather.\n\nSince we traveled such a long way to each port, I wrongfully assumed we'd spend more time in them. The ship usually docked around 8 a.m. and left in the early afternoon.\n\nI thought I'd have time to explore the port for a while after each excursion, but some of my excursions took the entire day, getting me back to the boat just in time for departure. I also hoped to see what these places looked like at night, but we never departed after sundown.\n\nAlthough I got a taste of the Caribbean, I didn't have enough time to get a sense of each place, which made me realize that I would probably prefer to vacation in just one place and have time to truly explore it.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic didn't sic their lawyers on Clawdbot. But they did send an email.\n\nPeter Steinberger initially named his viral AI agent after Clawd, the Claude Code mascot. Anthropic owned the trademark to Clawd's image, though, as well as the Claude name. Weeks after the launch, Steinberger changed the name to Moltbot, a move he said wasn't his decision.\n\nOn TBPN, Steinberger described the behind-the-scenes of the name change.\n\n\"I got an email from Anthropic that I had to rename the project,\" he said. \"Kudos, they were really nice. They didn't send their lawyers. They sent someone internally.\"\n\nStill, the timeline was \"rough,\" Steinberger said, and it's not easy to rename a product with such name recognition on social media.\n\n\"Everything that could have gone wrong today went wrong,\" he said.\n\nShortly after renaming the project, Steinberger said the X account was immediately snapped up by crypto sellers. X staff quickly helped Steinberger claim the handle, he said, but, for 20 minutes, \"that didn't work out so well.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't Anthropic — or any other company, for that matter — just buy Moltbot? Venture capitalists are certainly knocking down his door, Steinberger said. But the other population emailing him may put off possible acquirers: security researchers.\n\n\"This is all vibe-coded,\" Steinberger said. \"I don't know if any company would touch it, because we just haven't solved some things.\"\n\nSteinberger acknowledged that there was \"absolute risk\" with his product. He also likely wouldn't be interested in a big acquisition; Steinberger said that he'd rather Moltbot be a foundation or nonprofit than a company.\n\nWhile Clawdbot may have been named after Claude Code, Steinberger said he preferred coding with OpenAI's Codex. He called Codex more straightforward, while Claude Code required more \"tricks.\"\n\nWhen questions on his Discord server were getting out of control, Steinberger would copy and paste them straight into Codex, he said.\n\nOpenAI's chief marketing officer, Kate Rouch, saw the opportunity to dunk on Anthropic and took it.",

    "description": "Paramount executives want to add short-form video and user-generated content to Paramount+, according to leaked emails and presentations.",
    "fullText": "Paramount+ could soon look more like TikTok.\n\nParamount Skydance is planning to add a heavy dose of short-form video to its flagship streaming service, according to internal presentations and emails viewed by Business Insider.\n\nDan Reich, the head of global product and design for Paramount+, emailed fellow executives in mid-January, asking to set up a meeting with Paramount product chief Dane Glasgow to discuss \"Short Form Clips.\"\n\n\"We are trying to figure out how to jump-start efforts to get a million clips into our Short Form UX as quickly as possible,\" Reich wrote in the email.\n\nThis short-form video initiative is part of a so-called \"Project Eagle,\" Reich said in the email, though it's not immediately clear what else that project entails.\n\nReich added that his \"current understanding\" was that Paramount's AMLG, or Applied Machine Learning Group, \"has the clips ready (or near ready?)\" for another team to test the feature before it launches.\n\n\"As soon as we get the clips in, there will be increased pressure to provide a personalized feed of clips,\" Reich wrote to his colleagues.\n\nThe Paramount+ product design exec said he planned to discuss two topics in the meeting with Glasgow:\n\nShort-form video is a top priority for Paramount+ in the first quarter, specifically in its mobile app, according to an internal presentation sent by Reich that was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe documents viewed by Business Insider suggest that these short-form clips on Paramount+ will initially be created from existing content. However, Paramount is also interested in hosting user-generated content, which is the backbone of platforms like YouTube and TikTok. \"UGC\" was listed in the \"Mobile App Brainstorms\" section of a Paramount+ priorities presentation viewed by Business Insider.\n\nA person familiar with Paramount's short-form video plans said that the appeal of UGC is that it could be \"cheap and brings eyes to Paramount.\"\n\nAnother person familiar with Paramount's thinking said there are many products and initiatives in testing on the streaming side, and that the results of those tests would determine leadership's priorities.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nParamount hasn't previously done much with short-form video, outside a limited offering of trailers, clips, and interviews on its streaming app and social platforms like YouTube. It doesn't have a dedicated short-form feed on Paramount+.\n\nParamount's planned move into short-form video comes as CEO David Ellison implements his tech-first vision — and as Oracle, the software giant cofounded by his father, Larry Ellison, just became one of the select owners of TikTok's US business.\n\nDisney has also announced plans to put short-form video and UGC into Disney+ using AI, through a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI announced in December.\n\nNetflix, the leader among paid streamers, has experimented with short-form vertical video on its service, and co-CEO Greg Peters said on the company's mid-January earnings call that it's redesigning its mobile app with short-form video to compete with social media apps and \"better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come.\"\n\nAudiences, especially young people, have become hooked on short-form video through TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Hollywood is looking to get in on the action with so-called \"micro-dramas,\" mobile-focused shows with bite-sized episodes that are often soapy dramas.\n\nThe changes in consumption patterns among viewers come as traditional TV continues to lose customers and social video rises.",

    "title": "IonQ Acquires Seed Innovations to Make Quantum Computing Act Like Software",
    "description": "IonQ says its Seed Innovations acquisition will help optimize quantum performance at scale. SiliconSnark translates what that actually means.",
    "fullText": "IonQ woke up on January 28, 2026 and chose acquisition. Again.\n\nThis time, the “world’s leading quantum platform company” (a phrase that reads like it was assembled by a committee of synonyms) announced a definitive agreement to acquire Seed Innovations, a Colorado-based AI-software and technology R&D firm.\n\nIf you’re new here, IonQ’s whole vibe right now is “full-stack quantum platform,” which is a bit like saying you’re building a “full-stack unicorn”—majestic, aspirational, and technically not illegal to claim on a website. The pitch: Seed’s machine learning, cloud architecture, and software expertise will join IonQ’s Quantum Infrastructure team to “optimize performance” and “scale enterprise-ready solutions” across IonQ’s platforms.\n\nTranslation: IonQ is buying grown-ups who can make the quantum toys behave in the real world.\n\nSeed Innovations, founded in 2013, describes itself as a Women Owned Small Business specializing in full lifecycle software development, cloud migration, and R&D. Their staff includes software architects, SREs, and “Doctorates in machine learning,” which is an extremely polite way of saying: “We are the people you bring in when your system is haunted and your timeline is already a crime scene.”\n\nIonQ says Seed has done work for the “Department of War (DoW),” the Intelligence Community, and commercial customers. Now, I’m not here to nitpick acronyms, but “Department of War” is either (a) an aggressively metal rebrand, (b) a typo that slipped past fifteen approvals, or (c) the most honest naming convention in federal procurement history. Either way: points for transparency.\n\nThe deal is expected to close January 30, 2026—two days after the announcement—because nothing says “smooth integration” like speedrunning M&A like it’s a weekend hackathon.\n\nBecause quantum computing doesn’t fail in exciting sci-fi ways. It fails in normal ways. It fails like:\n\nIonQ’s press release basically admits that the next bottleneck isn’t only physics—it’s operating the physics like a product. They specifically call out building “enterprise grade, AI-driven software layers” for “managing and scaling complex quantum workloads.”\n\nThat’s not glamorous. That’s not a photogenic qubit. That’s Jira tickets. That’s reliability. That’s “we need dashboards.” That’s the point in the quantum journey where someone says, “Cool demo. Can I get an API?”\n\nAnd honestly? This is the most believable part of the whole thing.\n\nIonQ lists three focus areas for Seed after the acquisition. Let’s lovingly decode them.\n\nIonQ says Seed will use ML to analyze system data, predict behaviors, and drive continuous improvement.\n\nIn practice, this likely means: take a mountain of hardware/control/operations data and build models that help tune, diagnose, and forecast performance. The good version is “faster iteration, better uptime, fewer mysterious bad days.” The cynical version is “we added AI to the slide deck so procurement stops asking hard questions.”\n\nStill, ML for ops is real—especially when your machine is so sensitive that the universe itself feels like an adversarial test set.\n\nThey’re talking DevOps and automated scaling architecture.\n\nThis is the part where quantum becomes a service business: provisioning, orchestration, CI/CD, reliability, security controls, audit trails, customer-facing SLAs… all the boring enterprise stuff that customers absolutely demand, right up until they write you a check.\n\nYes, it’s hilarious to imagine “DevOps for qubits,” but it’s also how every advanced technology becomes a product: you wrap it in systems that make it usable by normal humans with normal deadlines.\n\nSeed brings cloud migration and microservices experience to make IonQ available “across all major cloud providers.”\n\nThis is less “seamless” and more “someone is about to spend a year building secure, reliable interfaces so enterprises can pretend quantum is just another SKU.” But to be fair, IonQ already distributes services via major clouds, and expanding that footprint is how you meet customers where they live: inside procurement portals and account teams.\n\nThis acquisition is also part of IonQ’s broader “we are building everything” campaign: quantum compute, networking, sensing, security—the whole stack.\n\nAnd it’s happening alongside a frankly sporty list of acquisitions IonQ has been stacking like trading cards: Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, Lightsynq, Capella Space, Qubitekk, a majority stake in ID Quantique, and Skyloom, among others.\n\nTwo days earlier—January 26, 2026—IonQ also announced a deal to acquire SkyWater Technology in a roughly $1.8B cash-and-stock transaction, framing it as vertical integration and a trusted U.S. semiconductor supply chain.\n\nSo in the span of a week, IonQ’s storyline reads like:\n\nAs strategies go, it’s coherent: if you want to be the platform, you need control over the weird, expensive, failure-prone parts—manufacturing, networking, sensing, security—and the glue that makes it all usable: software infrastructure.\n\nHere’s the SiliconSnark truth: enterprise software is where ambitious technologies go to either (a) become inevitable or (b) die slowly in a backlog.\n\nIonQ is betting on (a). Seed Innovations is the kind of team that doesn’t just build demos; they build systems that survive contact with reality, compliance, and the person who forwards your email to “IT Security” with no context.\n\nAlso, IonQ has been public about pushing performance milestones—like its claim of 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity and related technical disclosures in late 2025.\nWhether you’re bullish, skeptical, or spiritually allergic to quantum timelines, you can at least see the company trying to connect the physics story to the “we can operate this at scale” story.\n\nAnd that’s what Seed represents here: not more qubits, but more operability. Less “behold the future,” more “here is the monitoring and automated scaling architecture so the future doesn’t page you on Christmas.”\n\nA quantum company acquiring a software and cloud R&D specialist is the corporate equivalent of finally buying the boring kitchen appliances after years of collecting artisanal knives. Not exciting. Not sexy. Extremely necessary.\n\nIf IonQ really wants to sell “enterprise-grade” quantum—especially across multiple cloud providers—then integrating a team that lives and breathes ML, architecture, DevOps, and migration is… almost suspiciously sensible.\n\nSo yes: make your jokes about “AI-driven software layers” (I did). But if you’re looking for a signal that IonQ is trying to turn quantum from science project into product, this is it.\n\nNow please, for the love of all that is holy and scalable, tell me the “Department of War” thing was intentional.",

This probably is not surprising, as futures markets tend to broadcast the Fed rate-cut odds for weeks or even months before the next meeting.\n\nStill, Polymarket's blog shows how certain kinds of bets known as \"bonds,\" which are high-probability bets that rarely flip, are approached by bettors.\n\n\"Across 22 Fed decisions from March 2023 to December 2025, I find that Polymarket odds crystallize with a median of ~26 days before the Fed meeting, which is early enough to create tradable entry points,\" the author of the post writes.\n\n\"Crystallization\" is defined by one outcome pulling ahead with at least 80% odds and remaining stable for several days in a row without any major swings.\n\nThe post also notes that, in most cases, odds of a rate decision settle early, as the central bank typically chooses between keeping rates unchanged or adjusting them by 25bp. However, recently, the US economy has faced a lot more uncertainty around the economy and the path of interest rates.\n\n\"Each new data release can completely reverse market expectations, preventing odds from stabilizing,\" the post said. \"Prospectively, traders can identify regime shifts by reading more on Fed communications signaling framework uncertainty or monitoring elevated VIX for a continuous period.\"\n\nThe analysis also highlights the key lead-lag relationship between institutional markets, which adjust to monetary speculation almost immediately, and prediction markets, which typically react roughly a day and a half later.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket aren't uncovering new information. Rather they are mirroring moves already priced in by other markets, creating small windows where Polymarket odds have not caught up to the broader market.\n\n\"It is worth noting that traders should view this on a relative-value basis rather than solely believing one is correct while the other is wrong as odds could flip quickly with new emerging data.\"\n\nThe author noted, though, that there is a potential wildcard for traders to consider going forward. Trump is set to replace Powell as Fed chair this year, and when he does, the central bank's new leader could abandon the forward-guidance policy, a key component of Polymarket's trading strategy.\n\nLee acknowledged that such a scenario would mark the type of regime shift that would be a test of the framework he outlined for navigating Fed policy moves.",

    "description": "Apple's AI strategy draws attention as it prepares to report Q1 earnings. Analysts predict potential stock rally if AI plans impress investors.",
    "fullText": "Apple will round out the week's mega-cap tech bonanza on Thursday when it reports earnings for its fiscal first quarter.\n\nWith Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla due to report on Wednesday, AI will already be front and center for investors and analysts, and Apple's strategy is expected to be closely scrutinized.\n\nAll eyes will be on Apple's AI strategy when itreports after the market close on Thursday.\n\nThus far, the firm has largely opted out of the massive capex that other mega-cap companies have invested in AI infrastructure. Instead, it's hoped to join forces with already established AI players, recently announcing a partnership with Google's Gemini to boost its Siri voice assistant.\n\nApple's stock is up about 10% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader market and some of its Magnificent Seven peers. Shares were down about 1% on Wednesday to around $255.\n\nWall Street expects Apple to report $138.4 billion in revenue for the quarter and earnings per share of $2.68.\n\nHere's what top analysts are saying about the stock leading up to the report, and what they say to watch for when the $3.7 trillion firm reports Thursday afternoon.\n\nTech analyst Dan Ives said to look for updates on Apple's AI strategy.\n\n\"With the company finalizing the choice of Google Gemini to back Siri in its AI strategic push, it's time for Apple to lay down the blueprint to accelerate its AI strategy in 2026 which leads up to a much-anticipated Siri refresh this spring and WWDC in June,\" Ives said in a client note Wednesday, referencing the World Wide Developers Conference.\n\nHe thinks the stock could enjoy a big rally if investors start to apply an AI premium, like they have for other firms who have touted their involvement in the burgeoning technology.\n\n\"We believe no 'AI premium' which could be worth $75-$100 per share is factored into Apple's stock at current prices,\" Ives wrote.\n\nAnalyst Michael Ng says Apple will post earnings largely inline with consensus on Thursday, but that the stock is set to rally as the market will soon come around to its AI strategy.\n\nNg's price target is $320 a share, about 25% upside from current levels.\n\n\"AAPL stock is down 5% YTD to start C2026 likely on commodity cost inflation and App Store concerns, but we view the stock weakness as a buying opportunity into a continuation of the iPhone refresh cycle,\" Ng said in a January 20 note.\n\n\"Apple's partnership with Google Gemini for Siri and continued iPhone demand growth against the backdrop of AI-native consumer hardware launches should demonstrate to the market that the iPhone will remain the consumer device of choice for accessing new AI tools, clearing overhangs related to competition.\"\n\nAnalyst Erik Woodring said he expects weak stock price action after earnings on Thursday, as he thinks investors will be underwhelmed by iPhone sales numbers.\n\nBut he's still bullish on the stock for the year ahead, with a price target of $315 a share.\n\n\"Looking beyond the short-term, we continue to believe Apple will outperform in 2026 as it re-launches an upgraded Siri/Apple Intelligence (February '26 and WWDC 2026 in June), introduces its most innovative iPhone in 10+ years (Foldable), becomes first to market with a 2nm-powered smartphone (iPhone 18 family),\" Woodring wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nThe bank said that while iPhone sales should be strong, they'll \"take a back burner to rising memory costs.\"\n\n\"Despite supply agreements that likely mitigate the impact of rising memory costs in the Mar qtr guide, risk does increase in the June and Sept qtrs as production of the next gen of iPhones ramp, impactings cost and margins,\" UBS wrote in a January 20 note.\n\nChris Brigati, SWBC's chief investment officer, said there will be heightened scrutiny on Apple's AI strategy, and there's a risk that investors aren't satisfied with the company's updates to its approach.\n\n\"The tone from this week's Magnificent 7 earnings reports should be solid, though not evenly distributed across the group,\" Brigati said in an email on Wednesday. \"Apple, however, faces the toughest hurdle: after a wave of upward estimate revisions, it's the name most likely to struggle to clear the bar, especially as investors raise questions about its AI strategy.\"",

After more than seven years as our Chief Technology Officer, Umesh will be working with me on important initiatives outside of technology, and we will also support his personal interest in pursuing new endeavors outside of Citadel,\" Beeson said in the memo, a copy of which was seen by Business Insider.\n\nAndrew Janian, who joined in 2021 as head of equities engineering after a long career at Two Sigma, left in early 2025 but is returning to the firm and will step into Subramanian's role on an interim basis, effective immediately, according to the memo.\n\nA Citadel spokesman declined to comment.\n\nSubramanian oversaw the engineering teams behind the firm's investment, research, and risk-management platforms. But as generative AI grew in importance, his role became more strategic and closely tied to business priorities, he previously told Business Insider. The firm rolled out an internal chatbot last year to speed up workflows for its fundamental stock pickers.\n\nSubramanian joined in 2018 from Goldman Sachs, where he spent 13 years and rose to partner and co-CTO.\n\nSubramanian's exit marks the second shakeup to Citadel's C-suite in recent months. CFO Andrew Philipp was hired by Schonfeld in late November to join as its co-president.\n\nCitadel returned 10.2% in its flagship Wellington fund last year, below its peers and its recent run of industry-leading performance.\n\nCorrection: January 28, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated Andrew Philipp's job status. He has not officially left Citadel yet.",

    "fullText": "What's January without a TikTok panic?\n\nLast January, TikTok briefly went dark in the US amid a legal fight. This year, TikTok users were treated to days of app glitches caused by an outage at an Oracle data center, and a transition to a new joint-venture ownership structure in the US.\n\nUpstart rivals have benefited from TikTok users — particularly those concerned about TikTok's new owners' ties to the Trump administration — seeking alternatives. The biggest winner appears to be UpScrolled, which hit No. 2 among free apps in Apple's App Store on Wednesday.\n\nUpScrolled launched last year and was founded by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist who previously worked at tech giants such as IBM and Oracle, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"UpScrolled is a social media platform designed to empower users worldwide — a space to freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,\" the platform's website says. \"We built it because people are asking for more transparency, authenticity, and trust in the platforms they use every day.\"\n\nAccording to estimates from the marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower, as of Tuesday, UpScrolled had been downloaded about 400,000 times in the US and 700,000 globally since launching in June 2025. The app saw a surge in downloads beginning January 22, and Sensor Tower estimated that, as of Tuesday, 85% of UpScrolled's downloads in the US had occurred between January 21 and 27.\n\nAs of Wednesday, UpScrolled was No. 1 in the \"social networking\" category in Apple's App Store, surpassing Meta's Threads, WhatsApp, and TikTok. It was the No. 6 free social app on Google Play for Android users, where TikTok (and TikTok Lite) reign.\n\nUpScrolled feels like a combination of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok.\n\nThere's a feed of accounts you follow, carousel posts, vertical short-form video, stories, and a discovery page with trending topics and hashtags.\n\nOne of the app's selling points for new users is its stance on content censorship: \"No shadowbans, no hidden throttling, no pay-to-play favoritism — ever,\" UpScrolled says on its website.\n\n\"UpScrolled is committed to protecting freedom of expression — but with that freedom comes responsibility,\" UpScrolled's FAQ says. \"We only restrict content that violates our community guidelines or broadly accepted legal and ethical standards. This includes content involving illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.\"\n\nOther social networks are also seeing spikes in users.\n\nSensor Tower data showed a recent marginal increase in Reddit and Pinterest downloads.\n\nMeanwhile, newer apps, like Spill, are also seeing an uptick.\n\nSpill was founded by former Twitter employees and launched in 2023. The app told Business Insider that it had seen an influx of signups in recent days. It was the No. 17 app in the social category as of Wednesday.\n\nIt isn't the first time TikTok users have looked for new pastures.\n\nLast year, other Chinese-owned apps, such as Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, gained traction in the US as TikTok faced legal jeopardy.",

    "description": "Amid political pressures, Jerome Powell announced the Fed will hold rates steady.",
    "fullText": "The first Federal Reserve meeting of 2026 is in the books, and Chair Jerome Powell stayed tight-lipped on the central bank's biggest controversies.\n\nFrom the job market to political tensions, here are Business Insider's biggest takeaways from the January call to hold rates steady.\n\nThe Fed appeared more optimistic about the economic picture on Wednesday. While recent Fed press releases after interest rate decisions included a warning of \"downside risks to the labor market,\" that comment was removed in January's release.\n\nPowell said that the central bank's dual mandate — stable prices and maximum employment — is becoming more balanced than it was for much of last year. The unemployment rate is relatively low with minimal changes, even as labor market demand and hiring remain stagnant. He added that consumer spending has remained \"resilient\" and inflation rates are in a solid position, aside from tariff impact.\n\nAs for AI, Powell speculated that new technology is likely to have a positive effect on both companies and their employees.\n\n\"Every technological wave will eliminate some jobs and create other jobs,\" he said. \"It's always been the case. If you look back, wave after wave after wave, there will be some disruption. But ultimately, technology increases productivity, which is the basis for rising wages. It may not all happen immediately, but over time, it's what enables incomes to rise.\"\n\nThe central bank has long been known for making uniform policy decisions, but the current FOMC has seen split votes in every meeting since July.\n\nThere were two dissenters in the January 28 meeting — Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller hoped for a quarter-point rate cut. This is down from three dissents in the December meeting, which was the most since September 2019.\n\nPowell said there was \"broad support\" on the FOMC for holding today, including among non-voters, although \"there are different views on the committee\" over which side of the dual mandate takes priority when data is ambiguous.\n\nThe chair did not say whether the Fed plans to cut rates next month — or whether that move would be supported within the FOMC. \"Policy is not a preset course,\" he said. \"We make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.\"\n\nThe Fed has been in the news more than usual lately, as the Trump administration continues to put pressure on central bank leadership. The president has been vocal about his desire for bigger, faster rate cuts. And, with Powell's term as chair ending in May, Trump will be able to choose his successor.\n\nPowell did not comment on any of the Fed chair frontrunners or provide further detail on the ongoing Department of Justice probe over construction at the bank's Washington, DC, buildings. He also dodged a question about Governor Lisa Cook's mortgage fraud case, which was heard by the Supreme Court last week. However, Powell emphasized the importance of Fed independence. It's \"hard to restore the credibility of the institution\" if the neutrality from political independence is lost, he said.\n\nThe Fed chair did have a piece of advice for his successor.\n\n\"Stay out of elected politics,\" he said. \"Don't get pulled into elected politics. Don't do it.\"",

The ServiceNow CEO is so sure AI won't eat software that he's betting more on his own stock and committing to stay on as the company's leader through 2030.\n\nMcDermott also said he recently redid his executive compensation to tie his future pay more closely to ServiceNow's stock performance over the next three years. These packages usually involve big equity awards, so the CEO is effectively putting more of his money where his mouth is.\n\n\"We're building a trillion-dollar company here,\" McDermott told Business Insider in an interview on Wednesday. The company, which sells software to businesses, once again reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. It also announced a new partnership with AI startup Anthropic.\n\n\"Through my own compensation, I'm betting on the stock,\" McDermott said.\n\nAs a sign of confidence, ServiceNow approved a $5 billion share repurchase program on Wednesday.

    "fullText": "Home Depot laid off about 800 corporate employees on Wednesday — and called those who still have jobs back to its offices.\n\nThe layoffs affected positions tied to the home improvement chain's store support center near Atlanta, a company spokesperson told Business Insider. Many of those who lost their jobs were remote workers, the spokesperson said, with 150 of the 800 reporting to the support center's offices.\n\n\"We're simplifying our corporate operations to better support our stores and our customers,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our goal is to drive greater agility and position the company to move faster and stay even more closely connected with our frontline associates.\"\n\nHome Depot is offering affected employees separation packages and other support, the spokesperson added.\n\nThose employees still with the company will have to return to Home Depot's corporate offices five days a week starting the week of April 6, the spokesperson said. Currently, the company's employees must report to the office four days a week, Monday through Thursday.\n\nThe retailer reported a slowdown in demand last fall as middle-class shoppers pulled back on big home renovation projects.\n\nHome Depot is the latest company to announce layoffs in 2026.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon said it would cut 16,000 positions, its second round of mass layoffs in just a few months. Other companies, from Nike to Expedia, have also announced layoffs.\n\nUpdate: January 28, 2026 — This story has been updated to include additional details on the scope of the layoffs.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "An accuser of the Alexander brothers has testified that she was raped by one the siblings in 2012 after attending a party at Zac Efron's penthouse.",
    "fullText": "The first accuser to testify in the sex-trafficking trial of ex-luxury real estate brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and their brother deftly rebuffed questions involving actor Zac Efron and her own blurry memory on Wednesday.\n\nThe woman, testifying under the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" was an early and key government witness in the Manhattan federal trial of Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander.\n\nShe has testified that she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012, when she was 20 years old, at his Manhattan apartment after they attended an NBA Finals viewing party at Efron's nearby penthouse.\n\nProsecutors have alleged in an indictment that the Alexanders sometimes planned out sexual assaults, using their wealth to entice victims with the promises of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations. The brothers have vehemently denied the charges against them, arguing that any sexual encounters were consensual.\n\nA defense lawyer for Alon Alexander pressed Moore on cross-examination on Wednesday about why she would change her profile picture on Facebook hours after the alleged rape. The photo, which Moore said Efron shot, showed her smiling at the actor's party.\n\n\"You took the time to change your Facebook profile?\" asked Alon Alexander's attorney, Howard M. Srebnick, during a second day of cross-examination for Moore.\n\n\"The only thing I could think of was it was to distract myself at that moment,\" Moore told the six-man, six-woman jury. \"Just trying to keep normalcy at a moment in my life when nothing was normal.\"\n\nEfron's name came up multiple times during Moore's testimony. At one point, Moore described herself as a \"fan\" of his and said she was excited to meet him. Efron has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Representatives for the actor did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.\n\nMoore testified Tuesday that after the party and a visit to a nearby club with Efron and the brothers on that 2012 evening, she had awakened from being drugged to find herself naked on Alon Alexander's bed in the Manhattan apartment where Tal Alexander also lived. Alon Alexander, who was an executive at his family's private security firm, was standing over her and was also naked, she said.\n\n\"I was shocked, and I had no idea how I got there,\" Moore testified, adding that she tried two or three times to get out of the bed, but \"Alon kept pushing me back down.\"\n\nTal Alexander, she said, walked in on the alleged attack, and the brothers \"casually\" chatted.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tal Alexander's defense lawyer, Alex Kahn, questioned Moore about how long his client remained in the room during the alleged rape.\n\n\"Was he there for a moment?\" Kahn asked the accuser. \"What do you mean by a moment?\" she answered, her voice firm.\n\n\"A very short time,\" Tal Alexander's lawyer responded. \"What do you mean by a very short time?\" she asked.\n\nThe defense lawyer reframed his question, asking how long she believed his client was present in the bedroom.\n\n\"I could not quantify,\" Moore answered. \"Because I was being raped at that moment.\"\n\nAsked on Tuesday why Moore waited until 2024 to contact law enforcement — another potential weak point in the prosecution case — she said she realized that the case had become \"bigger than me.\"\n\nThe brothers, she said, had \"harmed people, including my 20-year-old self — the version of me that couldn't do anything and that felt too scared and helpless to do anything.\"\n\nMoore took the witness stand on Tuesday shortly after opening arguments kicked off in the high-profile trial.\n\nDuring those opening statements, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser told the jury that the Alexander brothers are sexual predators who together raped dozens of women and girls and then \"celebrated their crimes.\"\n\nThe brothers \"used whatever means necessary\" to carry out the attacks over the course of more than a decade, the prosecutor said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, a second accuser took the stand to describe a harrowing 2014 rape in the shower of a Hamptons vacation home.\n\n\"Is this how you thank me for inviting you to a beautiful home,\" a nurse from Nevada said Tal Alexander angrily told her before his alleged attack.\n\n\"As he was cleaning himself off, he looked at me and said, 'you wanted that,'\" the woman, then a 24-year-old aspiring model, told the jury. Her testimony is scheduled to continue on Thursday.\n\nThe Alexanders face several federal sex trafficking charges. If convicted at trial, Tal Alexander, 39, and the twins, 38, could face up to life behind bars.",

    "description": "The USS John F. Kennedy set sail for its shipbuilder sea trials Wednesday, allowing HII to test the vessel out at sea for the first time.",
    "fullText": "The USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier is setting sail for a new test at sea, specifically its shipbuilder sea trials. It marks a major milestone for the US Navy's next supercarrier.\n\nThe trials will be overseen by top shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries, allowing for evaluations of the vessel before it's delivered to the Navy.\n\nThough the ship has gone through river-based propulsion testing, these trials are when the new warship leaves the yard and proves that it actually works at sea. It's a big reality check before the Navy receives it and starts putting it through its own tests.\n\nShipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries launched the Kennedy (CVN-79) from its Newport News Shipbuilding division on Wednesday. \"These trials will test important ship systems and components at sea for the first time,\" Todd Corillo, HII's spokesperson for the NNS division, told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nKennedy is the second Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier. HII started construction on it in February 2011 with the \"first cut of steel ceremony.\" The ship's keel was laid in August 2015, and the carrier was halfway done being built in June 2017.\n\nThe aircraft carrier's delivery date has shifted over the years, but it is now expected for March 2027.\n\nIn 2020, the Navy shifted away from earlier plans to build the Kennedy in two stages and install some systems, like capabilities for operating Lockheed Martin F-35C Lightning II stealth fighters, after launch, instead choosing a single-phase approach that added years of work. These delays are different from those that affected the first Ford-class carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford.\n\nThe first ship in the class struggled with the integration of new technologies like the advanced aircraft arresting gear and weapons elevators, contributing to significant cost overruns and delays. The Navy has said that those lessons were folded into the later build, helping the Kennedy move faster overall.\n\nAfter the Kennedy enters service, the next Ford-class carriers to be delivered to the Navy will be USS Enterprise (CVN-80) and USS Dorris Miller (CVN-81), planned for commissioning in 2030 and 2032, respectively.\n\nThe US announced the names and planned dates of the following two carriers, USS William J. Clinton (CVN-82) and USS George W. Bush (CVN-83), last year.",

    "fullText": "After Microsoft reported results on Wednesday, CFO Amy Hood sent an internal memo to employees calling attention to recent developments in AI chips and coding tools, and deals with OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nHood sends these emails every quarter when Microsoft discloses its financials. Her missives mostly rehash what the company reports publicly, such as how revenue and profit are growing, or what is discussed on analyst earnings calls.\n\nStill, these memos provide insight into what Microsoft executives deem most important, and what they want employees to know.\n\nThe latest memo highlighted how Microsoft is gaining share in markets where the total addressable market is expanding.\n\nHood specifically mentioned the launch of the GitHub Copilot software development kit in the growing market of AI coding tools, and the release of Microsoft's new Maia 200 AI chip.\n\nHood's email also called out Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic that helped increase commercial bookings, basically the deals Microsoft closed in the quarter, by 230%, year over year.\n\nCapital expenditure on computing and datacenter infrastructure also broke yet another quarterly record, reaching $37.5 billion, she also noted.\n\nThis afternoon, we announced our second-quarter financial results. We exceeded Wall Street expectations, growing revenue 17% and 15% in constant currency and operating income by 21% and 19% in constant currency -a strong finish to the first half of the fiscal year.\n\nIn the quarter, Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $50 billion for the first time, growing 26% and 24% in constant currency.\n\nThere were many highlights this quarter, but a few stand out as reminders of the value our products and services deliver to customers - and as proof points of the progress we are making:\n\nInvestors tune in to our earnings call for the full details on this quarter and a look ahead to Q3. It's a helpful way to stay aligned as we deliver on our commitments. Join live today at 2:30 PM Pacific, listen on-demand, or check the transcript on the Investor Relations website.\n\nThis quarter's results reflect meaningful progress on core priorities. We continue to add capacity with pace, drive steady efficiency gains across our fleet, and invest in each layer of the stack\n\nAs we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we're operating in markets with expanding TAM where we continue to gain share and you can see our progress in many places, from last week's announcement of the GitHub Copilot SDK to Monday's Maia 200 announcement. We are innovating and delivering together. And we're doing it with the quality and security our customers expect from us. All of this builds trust from customers and partners as they rely on us for mission critical workloads.\n\nThanks again for all your work.\n\nWith appreciation and gratitude,\n\nHave a tip?

In two recent interviews, the Microsoft co-founder laid out a future where intelligence isn't rare or elite—it's abundant, automated, and free.\n\nAccording to Harvard Magazine, Gates sat down with professor Arthur Brooks at Harvard's Sanders Theatre to discuss his memoir \"Source Code\" last year. But the most headline-worthy moment wasn't about the past. It was Gates' stark prediction about what AI will do next.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nIn the interview, Gates said artificial intelligence will ease shortages in fields like medicine and education by taking over tasks traditionally done by humans.\n\nHe reportedly described a future where machines manage primary-care diagnostics, especially in places lacking medical professionals. In that context, Gates told Brooks, \"the machine will probably be superior to humans—because the breadth of knowledge that you need to make some of these decisions really goes beyond individual human cognition.\"\n\nGates didn't suggest human professionals would vanish overnight. But he made clear that when machines can deliver diagnoses more accurately, more affordably, and more consistently than people—they won't be sidekicks. They'll be replacements.\n\nAnd it's not just about medicine. Harvard Magazine reports that Gates framed the rise of AI as part of the same arc that turned bulky corporate computers into personal tools. Only now, the commodity isn't hardware—it's intelligence itself.\n\n\"What we're doing now [in artificial intelligence] is kind of an extension of the digital revolution,\" he said, \"and all of those things are about free intelligence.\"\n\nTrending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\nThat phrase—free intelligence—is central to Gates' view. Once reserved for rare professionals with years of education, high-quality expertise will soon be as accessible as Wi-Fi.\n\nIn education, Gates predicted, AI could reshape the classroom, adapting to each student and even learning how to keep them motivated. In healthcare, it will take pressure off overworked doctors and bring diagnostic tools to parts of the world that never had them.\n\nBut Gates also issued a warning. More access doesn't always mean better outcomes.\n\n\"[Sometimes when] you empower humans, it doesn't always get pushed in the right direction,\" he said, according to Harvard Magazine.\n\nThe very systems designed to educate or heal could just as easily spread misinformation or bias—if deployed without care. Gates acknowledged this isn't just a shift in technology—it's a shift in power.\n\nThat same caution appeared during his appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" last year. Asked about the pace of change, Gates reflected on how computing once felt expensive and exclusive—and now intelligence itself is entering the same phase transition.\n\n\"The era that we're just starting is that intelligence is rare,\" Gates said. \"And with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace… great medical advice, great tutoring.\"\n\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nWhen Fallon asked whether humans would still be needed, Gates didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Not for most things,\" he said.\n\nA few roles might survive—he mentioned baseball and talk shows—but the vast majority of tasks people are trained to do? Machines will do them better, faster, and cheaper.\n\nFor investors, that future isn't just disruptive—it's investable. As AI reshapes industries like education, healthcare, and logistics, some are looking beyond Big Tech and turning to early-stage platforms. Startups focused on diagnostics, learning tools, and productivity automation are drawing serious capital. Platforms like Fundrise offer everyday investors a chance to back emerging AI companies—often with as little as $10.\n\nIt's an exciting future, especially if artificial intelligence really can solve chronic shortages in doctors and educators. But as Gates reminded both Harvard students and late-night audiences, access alone won't guarantee progress. What we do with free intelligence still depends on the people holding the keys.\n\nRead Next: Security and regulation matter in crypto — explore Kraken Pro's compliance-first trading platform.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.  “A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.",
    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — Winter's brutal grip on the U.S. East is not letting up, with coming days bringing subfreezing temperatures that will plunge deep into what had been a toasty Florida peninsula and a powerful blizzard forecast that may strike the Atlantic coast.\n\nDeep cold is forecast to stick around at least into the first week of February. Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.\n\n“A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThat storm could dump snow — at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) with white-out conditions — in the Carolinas, northern Georgia and southern Virginia. After that, it could turn and plow through the Interstate 95 corridor late Saturday into Sunday to dump loads more snow from Washington to Boston, further paralyzing much of the country. Or it could deliver a glancing blow, mostly striking places like Cape Cod.\n\nAlternatively, it could just veer off harmlessly to sea. Meteorologists and forecast models aren't yet settling on a single outcome.\n\n“The confidence is much higher that in the coastal Carolinas and Virginia that there will be significant snowfall this weekend,” said James Belanger, vice president for meteorology at the Weather Channel and its parent company. \"The real question is going to be the trajectory it takes” from there.\n\nPrivate meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former NOAA chief scientist, said for the mid-Atlantic and north it's a “boom or bust” situation. “If it happens (to go along the coast) it's going to be a big-time event.\"\n\nModels still disagree on storm track\n\nOn Tuesday forecast models were all over the place, from out to sea to inward toward Philadelphia. By Wednesday morning they started to agree that “we’re likely to see some form of a powerful coastal storm somewhere east of North Carolina, off the Delmarva coast, but they still disagree as to where,” Mullinax said.\n\nChances of the storm veering away from the East Coast entirely had diminished Wednesday morning, but hadn't disappeared altogether, Mullinax said.\n\nOf all the options, “from D.C. up to New York is probably the most unclear,” Mullinax said. He said a mere 50-mile (80-kilometer) difference in the storm's center will be critical. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said it may be hard for the southern mid-Atlantic to avoid some kind of snow, whether a little or a lot.\n\nThis storm will blow harder than the last one\n\nThis weekend's storm will differ from the previous storm, which started with moist air from the Pacific that combined with a deep plunge of Arctic air from an elongated polar vortex supplemented by more moisture from the south and east, meteorologists said. The last storm had little wind. This one will generate high winds, even if the snow misses the Washington area, generating gusts that could still reach 40 mph (65 kph), plunging wind chills near subzero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius), Mullinax said.\n\n“It looks like a pretty strong and explosive storm so everybody is going to have some gusty winds,\" Pydynowski said, even inland places that won't come close to getting snow like Pittsburgh. Strong winds may take daytime temperatures in the teens there down to feeling like they are below zero, he said.\n\n“This is what we'd consider more of a classic nor'easter,” Belanger said, describing a storm forming around the U.S. Gulf Coast crossing into the Atlantic and going up that coast.\n\nFrigid air and warm water combine to make strong storm\n\nIn this case, one key is warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico — partly from human-caused climate change — and the always toasty Atlantic Gulf Stream, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for the nonprofit Climate Central.\n\nWhen that happens the storm “pulls in more moisture and it gives it more strength,” she said.\n\nOnce the core of the storm nears the Carolinas its pressure will drop tremendously, enough to qualify for what meteorologists call “bombogenesis” or “a bomb cyclone,” That will give it the effect of a moderate-strength hurricane, including huge winds, but in the winter, Maue and Belanger said.\n\nIf the storm does come ashore, those winds and extra snow could cause massive snow drifts big enough to bury cars, Maue said.\n\nArctic chill sticks around and goes further south\n\nWhat is more certain is that the Arctic chill in the Midwest and East will continue through mid-February, with only slight warmups that would still be below normal, meteorologists said.\n\nAnd this new weekend storm “is going to take that cold and it's going to spill right down the heart of the Florida peninsula,\" Pydynowski said. Orlando is forecast to go well below freezing and only have a high of 48 F (9 C), smashing temperature records, while even Miami and Key West will flirt with record cold Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.\n\nThe outlook for Florida was cold enough to raise concerns about damage to the state’s citrus and strawberries.\n\n“We're going into a brutally cold period,” Maue said.\n\nAfter this weekend storm, long-range models see another one at the end of the first week of February, Maue said. Meteorologists see the East stuck in a pattern of bitter cold and snowstorms because of the plunging Arctic air and warm water.\n\nEast Coast snowstorms don't happen too often, but “when it happens, it happens in bunches,\" said former National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, who has written meteorology textbooks on winter snowstorms.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "title": "These Are Michigan's 5 Deepest Lakes Outside Of The Great Lakes",
    "description": "The Great Lakes State is know for, well, you get the picture. But don't let the name fool you: Michigan is full of beautiful deep-bodied inland lakes, too.",
    "fullText": "Many of Michigan's top tourist attractions are centered around the Great Lakes, which is little surprise, given that the state touches four of the massive bodies of water. From the pleasant beach in Sleeping Bear Dunes to the gilded glamor of Mackinac Island, the Great Lakes make for a great time.\n\nBut the Great Lakes aren't the only really big lakes in the state. There are more than 11,000 inland lakes in the Michigan, which has more freshwater shoreline than any other state in the U.S. Many of Michigan's most beautiful inland lakes offer sunny sands, swimming, and boating opportunities without the crowds that you'll find at some of the more popular Great Lakes beaches (you'll also get to skip the potentially intimidating vastness and 1,332-foot depths of Lake Superior).\n\nYou'll find Michigan's deepest inland lakes in the northern areas of both the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula. This location isn't an accident; most of these lakes were formed by glacial activity during the Pleistocene era, which ended around 10,000 years ago. Today, these lakes are a boon to summer tourism, drawing visitors from all over the world who want to swim, boat, fish, and simply enjoy the views. If you're thinking about putting a visit to Michigan on your summer itinerary, here are the five deepest inland lakes in the state that should be on your radar.\n\nLocated in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula, Elk Lake has a maximum depth of 150 feet and stretches for 8,194 acres across 28 miles of shoreline. It's separated from Lake Michigan by just a thin strip of land and is surrounded by the small towns of Elk Rapids and Kewadin.\n\nVisitors to Elk Lake are struck by the beauty of the clear waters surrounded by trees. Swimming, boating, and fishing are all popular summertime activities here, as are water sports such as tubing, water skiing, and wakeboarding.\n\nFreshwater snorkelers can watch lake trout swim and view sunken wrecks like that of the 1903 Shale Scow shipwreck. Want to explore the surrounding area? Besides being next to Lake Michigan, Elk Lake is part of the Chain of Lakes Water Trail, an inland water trail spanning more than 100 miles across 12 interconnected lakes and rivers in northwestern Michigan. Past visitors on Google describe the lake as their \"favorite place in the world to be,\" and \"quintessential 'Up North.'\"\n\nAt 152 feet deep, Thumb Lake (also known as Lake Louise) is just slightly deeper than Elk Lake but much smaller in surface area, at 510 acres. Despite its name, it's not located in Michigan's \"thumb\" but in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula, between the towns of Vanderbilt and Boyne Falls.\n\nThumb Lake is a kettle lake, meaning it formed within the depression left by a glacier. It's also a seepage lake, meaning it only loses water through evaporation and groundwater channels, rather than through an outlet (so water stays in the lake for much longer than other lakes).\n\nVisitors enjoy spending time on Thumb Lake's sandy, 1,600-wide beach, a portion of which is dog-friendly. Swimming, boating, and fishing are all popular in the summer months. Reviewers remark on the clear water and peaceful surroundings (the spotty cell service in the area adds to this effect).\n\nHead north to Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and you'll find Lake Angeline, which is 162 feet deep at its deepest point and only 96 acres in area. It's located within the small city of Ishpeming, a charming gem with pristine views. Unlike the other lakes on this list, Lake Angeline was not formed by a glacier.\n\nInstead, it was created in a former open-pit and shaft iron mine. In the late 19th century, the former body of water that stood here was drained entirely, and its bottom was mined extensively for iron ore. Beginning in the 1940s, it began to refill and was eventually repurposed as a fishing lake and stocked with rainbow trout.\n\nToday, scuba divers can see the remains of a submerged forest that likely began to grow there as the lake slowly refilled over the years. Lake Angeline is a popular fishing lake and is regularly stocked with several trout species, including splake. Ice fishers often head out onto the ice in the winter. And in the summer, people take advantage of the boat launch. Though some prefer to stay out of its cold waters, others enjoy swimming in the lake, too.\n\nLike Elk Lake, Crystal Lake is located in northwestern Michigan and separated from Lake Michigan by a thin strip of land that turns it into a separate, inland lake. Crystal Lake has a unique history: It's both natural and artificial. In 1873, a man named Archibald Jones attempted to build a series of locks connecting Crystal Lake (then called White Cap Lake) to Lake Michigan.\n\nDue to crucial technical oversights, the dam Jones had built to hold back water during canal construction failed, and Crystal Lake lost about 20 feet of water. Somewhat fortuitously, this loss exposed the beautiful sandy beaches that visitors enjoy today.\n\nToday, Crystal Lake is 175 feet deep and covers just under 10,000 acres. Its crystal-clear blue waters mean that Crystal Lake is often compared to the Caribbean. Bordered by the city of Frankfort and the villages of Beulah and Benzonia, Crystal Lake is a hidden gem summer destination. Tourists can go swimming, sailing, boating, and fishing at several lakeside beaches, including Crystal Lake Public Beach, Mollineaux Beach, and Beulah Village Park. One past visitor on Google called the lake an \"amazing diamond in the rough,\" further  adding that the water \"is breathtaking with [its] gorgeous shades of blue.\"\n\nAt 250 feet deep, Torch Lake is not only Michigan's deepest lake outside of the Great Lakes, it's also deeper than Lake Erie (which reaches 210 feet deep). It's located in northwest Michigan, just a short distance from Elk Lake, and like Elk Lake, it's likewise separated from Lake Michigan by a thin strip of land.\n\nCovering 18,473 acres in surface area and 41 miles of shoreline, Torch Lake was naturally shaped by glaciers (and was originally a bay that was part of Lake Michigan). Its crystal-clear waters mean it's sometimes called the Caribbean of Michigan. Parts of the shoreline are rocky (you might find some Petoskey stones, fossilized corals from prehistoric times), while other sections are covered in sand. Speaking of sand, if you visit the lake during the summer months, head to the Torch Lake Sandbar in the middle of the water, where you'll often find a gathering of boats partying and enjoying some of the best fun the Midwest has to offer.\n\nSnorkeling is another popular activity here due to the water's clarity. \"I've been to many lakes throughout the world and I've never seen a spring-fed lake as clear ... and beautiful, almost a turquoise color, like Torch Lake,\" wrote one past visitor on Tripadvisor.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?",

    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the company will be discontinuing the Model S and X in the next quarter, bringing an end to the EV maker's more premium SUV and sedan models.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" the CEO said during Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nMusk said Tesla is replacing the Model S and Model X production lines in its Fremont Factory in California with an Optimus factory, with the long-term goal being to produce one million robots a year.\n\nTesla will continue to support the Model S and Model X vehicles for as long as people have them, Musk said, adding that for people interested in owning one, \"now would be the time to order it.\"\n\nThe CEO said the shift was \"slightly sad\" but part of the company's \"overall shift to an autonomous future.\"\n\nTesla's stock was up on Wednesday after the company beat earnings expectations and announced it would invest $2 billion into xAI, Musk's AI company. Tesla also announced it plans to release the third generation of its Optimus robot later this quarter.\n\nThe Model S and Model X are some of Tesla's oldest models, as well as its priciest.\n\nTesla unveiled a prototype for the Model S, a sedan, in 2009 and began deliveries to customers in 2012. The Model X, an SUV, was announced in 2012, with first deliveries going out in 2015.\n\nBoth models received upgrades in 2025, including an increase in driving range, better noise cancellation, and smoother suspension, as well as a price increase of $4,500. However, the upgrades did not include some of the more innovative technologies that were introduced with Tesla's Cybertruck.\n\nThe starting price on Tesla's site for the Model S was $94,990 as of Wednesday, or $109,990 for the more premium Plaid version. The Model X was $99,990, or $114,990 for Plaid.",

    "description": "\"When armed agents operate beyond the reach of law, they are no longer public servants. They are something else entirely.\"",
    "fullText": "We have to be clear about what we are witnessing from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minnesota.\n\nAs a combat soldier, I recognize a mission when I see one — not because it’s announced, but because it’s being carried out. In the span of weeks, ICE and Border Patrol operations in Minneapolis have resulted in the deaths of two Minnesotans. In over a year of combat in Iraq, my battalion of 500 soldiers did not kill a single person.\n\nAlso Read: I Spent 20 Years Teaching In The Special-Education System. Now I’m Speaking Out About What I Saw.\n\nMy unit spent 397 days on the battlefield. We were shot at. We feared for our lives. Snipers fired from crowds. Improvised explosive devices lined the roads we were ordered to clear. And still, we did not return fire unless strict conditions were met: The shooter had to be clearly identified, civilians could not be in the line of fire, and lethal force had to be the last resort.\n\nWhy? Because that was not our mission.\n\nOur mission was to build bases, secure supply routes, and protect civilian life. We were governed by Rules of Engagement, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the War Crimes Act. Violations were not brushed aside. Soldiers are criminally accountable when we break the law. That accountability is what separates professional soldiers from mercenaries.\n\nPolitics: 'You Just Killed My ******* Neighbor!' Eyewitness Describes Deadly ICE Shooting\n\nThis isn’t just my experience. It’s the standard.\n\nThis story is part of HuffPost’s commitment to fearlessly covering the Trump administration. You can support our work and protect the free press by contributing to our newsroom.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara stated publicly that, in 2025, the Minneapolis Police Department recovered roughly 900 guns from the street and arrested hundreds of violent offenders — and did not kill a single person.\n\nAlso Read: I Pursued Motherhood Despite Past Psychosis -- Then This Happened\n\nIf the Minneapolis Police Department didn’t kill anyone in a year of active policing, and my combat unit didn’t kill anyone in over a year of war, Minnesotans — and all Americans — are right to ask why ICE and the Border Patrol have killed two people in my state in two weeks.\n\nThe answer is uncomfortable but unavoidable. Either this is their mission — or they are operating outside accountability.\n\nMinnesota is demanding a full legal investigation into the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, including allegations that lifesaving medical care was delayed or denied. Refusing transparency or investigation is not partisan disagreement. It is a constitutional failure.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nWhen armed agents operate beyond the reach of law, they are no longer public servants. They are something else entirely.\n\nMercenaries are defined not only by who pays them but by what restrains them. Mercenaries answer to orders, not to law, ethics or public accountability. That is precisely why soldiers and law enforcement officers hold codes of conduct so fiercely. Without those codes, uniforms become disguises instead of safeguards.\n\nPolitics: Inside The Invasion Of Minneapolis\n\nAs a veteran, I refuse to accept mercenary behavior hiding behind federal badges on Minnesota soil.

    "fullText": "Gold and silver prices have soared in the midst of global geopolitical uncertainty, concerns about the global role of the dollar, long-simmering inflation and general economic uncertainty.\n\nRegular readers of my column know that I have always advised keeping a portion of your assets in gold and gold mining shares or mutual funds. (Search my columns at TerrySavage.com using the key word “gold” and going back more than a decade.) But with today’s huge rise in gold prices, those investments have significantly increased in value, almost demanding that you evaluate your long-term positions.\n\nSome economic background is in order. CME Group Chief Economist Erik Norland has written a definitive guide to the economic forces moving the precious metals markets. He notes: “Gold ... is up 80% as of January 21. Palladium is up 105%, platinum up 175% and silver prices have tripled, rising 212%.” (That appreciation figure has since changed. You can read the entire report, including graphics, at the CME Group website.)\n\nIn an interview I asked about the dramatic rise in the price of gold. Norland explained there are five main drivers of demand:\n\nIt’s not just the United States that is running a budget deficit — currently 6% of GDP, without accounting for proposed increases in military spending. Norland notes that European nations are currently increasing their defense spending allocations, as is Canada. The Japanese have always had a huge public debt as a percentage of GDP, and now even China’s public debt is running at 8.5% of GDP. The implication is that all that spending will generate a new round of “money printing” — i.e., inflation.\n\nThe key ingredient of Norland’s outlook is the fact that inflation is just barely under control around the world, running above targets set by all central banks. In the United States, for example, the latest report of the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator (PCE) came in at 2.8% — well above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nNorland notes that despite the underlying inflationary pressures, almost every central bank is in the process of lowering interest rates. That’s the opposite of what central banks usually do to fight inflation. The exceptions are Japan, which already has such very low rates, and Brazil.\n\n—Perceived erosion of central bank independence\n\nFor nearly 80 years, central banks have “managed” currencies through interest rates and currency purchases or interventions. Their role has been to manage the balance of currencies needed for stability and world trade. But it’s not just the U.S. Federal Reserve bank that is feeling pressure to bend to political will. It’s happening around the world.",

    "title": "When and Where to Watch the 2026 Winter Olympics, Based on Your Obsession Level",
    "description": "Plus, viewing plans for every type of fan.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Winter Olympics will kick off in Milano Cortina, Italy, beginning on Friday, Feb. 6. With more than 3,200 hours of winter sports coverage spread across broadcast, cable, and digital streaming platforms, finding what you want to watch can feel like a full-time job. So here's where and when you can watch the Olympics.\n\nWatching the Olympics is a deeply personal experience. Some love the technical precision of a perfect luge run; others dig the emotional narrative of an underdog’s journey to the podium; and some just want to catch the meme of the week as it happens. Because everyone's \"perfect Olympics\" is unique, I’ve also put together a viewing guide designed for the way you might want to experience the 2026 Games.\n\nNBCUniversal has the exclusive rights to show the Olympics in the U.S. this year, and the network is practically going all-Olympics from the opening ceremony on Feb. 6 to the closing on Feb. 22. If you're watching the Olympics in the old-school \"turn on the TV\" way, the 2026 Winter Olympics are on broadcast channel NBC and cable channels CNBC and USA Network. If you're streaming the games, you'll be doing it from Peacock.\n\nDuring primetime, NBC is showing Primetime in Milan, three hours of curated Olympics coverage, nightly, beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT, except Super Bowl Sunday, when Primetime in Milan will start at 10:45 p.m. ET.\n\nIn the daytime, NBC will be broadcasting five hours of coverage daily focusing mainly on more popular Winter Olympics coverage like snowboarding, skiing, figure skating, and hockey. Daytime Olympics programming will begin at 7 a.m. ET most days, and continue through the early afternoon, depending on the daily lineup.\n\nNBC is also airing a nightly wrap-up of each day's events after the local news; the Olympics' opening ceremony on Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET; live coverage of the closing ceremonies at 2:30 p.m. on Feb. 22, with an encore showing at 9 p.m.; and 4K Olympics coverage on Super Bowl Sunday, beginning at 7 a.m. ET.\n\nNBC-owned cable networks USA Network and CNBC will also feature Olympics content during the games.\n\nUSA Network: USA Network will be devoted to Olympics coverage nearly 24/7 during the games, showing a mix of live events and encore showings of past events. Because of the six-hour time difference from Italy to the U.S., USA Network will show live Olympic events nightly beginning around 2 a.m. ET, and feature continuing coverage through the early afternoon.\n\nCNBC: CNBC is devoted to curling (really). The cable network plans to broadcast a nightly \"Best of Curling\" show on weeknights at 5 p.m. ET, with long form coverage on weekends.\n\nIf you are planning to stream the Olympics, you'll be doing it on Peacock, NBC's streaming platform. Peacock will stream every single session of all 116 medal events live, as well as offering full-event replays of every event available on-demand.\n\n\"I want to be part of the conversation, but I don't need to watch biathlon at 4 a.m.\"\n\nIf you want high production values, dramatic stories of inspiring athletes, and exciting contests curated by sports broadcasting pros, the mainstream coverage is for you. Don't miss the opening ceremonies on Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, and catch as much of NBC's primetime coverage as you have time for. It's bound to be packed with crowd-pleasing events, give you lots of background on different athletes, and Olympics breaking news, but without a lot of obscure or boring sports.\n\nPro tip: \n\nIf you religiously follow a single sport in the Olympics, be it hockey or snowboarding, and you really don't care about, say, inspirational ice-dancer stories, your best bet is Peacock's Sports Hub, where you can watch every qualifying heat and every medal contest of only the sport you like, either live or on-demand.\n\nPro tip: Coordinate your calendar with NBC's interactive schedule to make sure you know when everything is happening.\n\n\"Half the fun of the Olympics is dishing about it.\"\n\nIf the Olympics is better as a shared experience, watch NBC.com's broadcast coverage in one window, and check out the social media feeds of NBC's \"Creator Collective,\" where TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube influencers like Kylie Kelce, Anna Sitar, and Jordan Howlett will be watching along.\n\nPro tip: Don't sleep on Reddit communities r/olympics and r/WinterOlympics2026.\n\n\"I'm irrationally passionate about a sport I'd never heard of before today.\"\n\nIf you love to discover strange new sports, the Winter Olympics are going to be fun. Skip the mainstream coverage on NBC and browse through Peacock's Sports Hub catalog for sports you've never heard of.\n\nPro tip: Don't miss the debut of Ski Mountaineering (\"SkiMo\"), the only brand-new sport at the 2026 Games. It’s a grueling hybrid where athletes who hate ski lifts for some reason hike up steep mountains before carving down high-speed technical descents.\n\n\"I absolutely cannot get enough Olympics and I want to watch as much as is humanly possible.\"\n\nIf you have a lot of time on your hands and want to see literally everything, you'll need Peacock, and to get familiar with its \"Discovery Multiview\" feature, which lets you watch up to four sporting events at the same time.\n\nPro tip: Go to the NBC Olympics Full Schedule and use the \"My Stuff\" feature to build a personalized calendar before the games start to plan your epic Olympic binge.\n\n\"I want to feel the snow in my face without leaving my house.\"\n\nIf you want the highest resolution, most immersive Olympic experience possible without traveling to Italy, do not miss 4K All-Day on NBC and Peacock on Sunday, Feb. 8 for 17 hours of 4K HDR coverage of both the Olympics and the Super Bowl. And download the Peacock app for your Meta Quest 3 or 3S headset to watch the Olympics in augmented reality, or check out the \"spatial cinema\" broadcast of the Olympics on your Apple Vision Pro.\n\nPro tip: NBC is rolling out a new streaming feature called Rinkside Live for Olympic hockey and figure skating. It lets viewers choose from multiple curated feeds of \"immersive, never-before-seen views.\"",

    "fullText": "Related video: Governor Spencer Cox spoke gave a State of the State address.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — On Tuesday, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall delivered the State of the City address. She highlighted priorities of civic development, public safety, and affordable housing.\n\nAt the beginning of the address, the Red Spirit Singers of the Uintah Tribe offered a presentation. Then, the CEO of the 2034 Olympics spoke about the city’s preparations for the upcoming Games and stated that Mendenhall has been instrumental in bringing the Games back to Utah.\n\nHe added that the games will bring a possibility of unity throughout the state, and all residents will be able to be involved in the community to bring the Olympic spirit locally.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nDuring her speech, Mendenhall highlighted several of her priorities and the issues facing her constituents and the city. One thing she spoke on was the 2025 safety plan recommendation, and she says they have completed over half of the outlined solutions and are now working on implementing the long-term solutions.\n\nMendenhall also noted the city completed the voter streets bond, resurfaced and replaced hundreds of miles of roads, and finished phase one of Glendale Park.\n\n“The next chapter of our city’s story and our state’s and our nation’s is not waiting to be written. We’re writing it now, and in doing so, we will not stand still. We will not slow our commitments, and we will not govern for comfort when the moment calls for resolve,” Mendenhall said.\n\nShe emphasized that the state of the city will be determined by what comes next, not by what they have already done.\n\nMendenhall partially addressed issues of public safety and brought up an ongoing controversy surrounding a proposed immigration detention center in Salt Lake City. Members of the community protested the center, and Mendenhall stated that she sent a letter to the owners, stating that the city code prevents a large-scale housing center at the warehouse’s location in its current form. The warehouse’s owners stated in a press release on Saturday that they had no intent to sell or lease the property.\n\nOwners and investors of warehouse rumored to be used as ICE facility say they have ‘no plans to sell’ to the federal government\n\nMendenhall also spoke on national issues with immigration, including controversy after two people were shot and killed by ICE officers in Minneapolis.\n\n“I want to make it clear that I am prepared to use every tool under my control to protect the values of Salt Lake City and the dignity of every one of our residents,” Mendenhall said. “To this end, we have introduced the Future Citizens Path program to support eligible green card holders in Salt Lake City through the U.S. Citizenship process.”\n\nShe also addressed homelessness issues within the city and spoke on Project Connect, which targeted individuals with high arrest rates and connected them with social workers. 60% of those individuals reduced the frequency of arrests, and Mendenhall says they hope to expand this program in 2026.\n\nTen bills to keep an eye on during the 2026 General Legislative Session\n\nIn addition to reducing crime rates in homeless communities, Mendenhall stated that Salt Lake City will launch a program to invest in repairs to existing affordable housing and help renters become homeowners.\n\nAdditionally, Mendenhall mentioned that ongoing efforts would add more community centers throughout Salt Lake City, involving residents in each area. To this end, she shared planned designs for Salt Lake City’s civic center.\n\n“We owe it to those who came before us to protect those seeking a better life to ensure those who arrive are not persecuted for their beliefs like so many of Utah’s first pioneers, but that they are embraced,” Mayor Mendenhall said, concluding her speech. “That they are welcomed. That they may become a part of our strong community.”\n\nIncreased police presence at University of Utah after bomb threat reported\n\nFlorida man sentenced to prison on charges connected with South Jordan 15-year-old who disappeared for a month\n\nHouse committee hears bill created to address electric-assisted bicycle (e-bike) safety concerns\n\nHouse Republicans warn against Senate changing DHS funding bill\n\nThis is The Place Heritage Park is the spot for weddings, reunions, and big days",

    "description": "February's brutal cold makes winter feel like it will never end, but there is good news. The days are longer with more sunshine coming soon.",
    "fullText": "February can still feel like deep winter across much of North America, with snowstorms and blasts of Arctic air still very much on the table. But the calendar is quietly shifting in the background: Daylight starts stacking up faster, and by the end of the month, the change is hard to miss.\n\nThe reason is simple astronomy. Since the December solstice, the Northern Hemisphere has been slowly tilting toward the sun again. In the first few weeks after the solstice, the daily increase in daylight is modest. By February, that gain becomes more noticeable, especially in places farther north.\n\nLatitude is the key. Locations closer to the poles see bigger swings in daylight over the year, while places closer to the equator change more gradually. That's why the same month can feel like a major turning point in one city and a smaller nudge in another.\n\nIn New York City, daylight typically increases by a couple minutes per day. Over the course of the month, that adds up quickly, with the sun in the sky one hour and seven minutes longer on Feb. 28 when compared to Feb. 1.\n\nIn Miami, the shift is still there, but it's more subtle. Because South Florida is much closer to the equator, February adds 37 minutes of daylight from start to finish.\n\nLonger days also reshape the schedule of the sky. Sunrise creeps earlier, sunset slides later, and nighttime slowly loses ground. That means less time for dark-sky viewing at convenient hours, even though winter can still deliver clear, crisp nights in many places.\n\nDaylight will keep building across the Northern Hemisphere through spring until the summer solstice in June, when the sun reaches its highest path in the sky for the year. After that, the trend reverses: Days begin shrinking again, and nights gradually lengthen until the next winter solstice.",

    "fullText": "Apple (AAPL) is apparently opting for margin pain instead of sticker shock.\n\nMemory prices continue to spike due to relentless AI data center demand, but Apple’s looking to sidestep raising iPhone prices, even if it means taking a bottom-line hit.\n\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who’s a veteran in covering Apple’s supply chain for several years, says the tech giant will stick with their approach when it launches the hotly anticipated iPhone 18, at least for now.\n\nThat pivotal decision puts Apple’s supply-chain strength under the scanner as it heads into earnings on Thursday, January 29, 2026 (after the market closes).\n\nHaving covered the memory space extensively over the past few months, it’s crystal clear that suppliers have a ton of leverage for the foreseeable future.\n\nBellwethers in the space, like Micron, are building mammoth fabs to ease supply constraints, but most of those efforts are long-term, pointing to potential trouble over the next couple of years at least.\n\nNaturally, most hardware companies have little choice but to hike prices, but Apple isn’t your average hardware company.\n\nApple can take the hits and is far more insulated than any other hardware company in history, which could potentially become its biggest strength amidst the memory crunch.\n\nAccording to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is looking to take it on the chin with the higher memory costs instead of risking the iPhone pricing boat.\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nKuo’s read is that Apple senses an opportunity in one that effectively plays to its scale and tremendous supply-chain muscle.\n\nIn a post on X, Kuo acknowledged that higher memory costs will hit iPhone gross margins. However, we went on to say that,\n\nKuo boils Apple’s thinking down to three key moves.\n\nAbsorb the pain now: Memory prices are rising at an incredible pace, and Apple is opting for margin pressure instead of consumer backlash.\n\nLockdown supply: Apple’s scale enables it to effectively secure components that others can’t, even as the shortages grow worse.\n\nPlay the long game: Any near-term margin hit will be viewed as temporary, with services revenue likely to backfill over time.\n\nHowever, there’s a significant risk that these pressures aren’t contained, as Kuo notes that iPhone memory prices are still being renegotiated quarterly rather than on a semiannual basis.",

    "title": "Russian Scientists Test Plasma Engine That Could Cut Mars Travel to About 30 Days",
    "description": "Russia is testing a plasma engine prototype designed to slash Mars travel time to just 60 days. Developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, the system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate particles to 100 km/s, promising a flight-ready model for deep-space missions by 2030.",
    "fullText": "Russia is quietly testing a new plasma propulsion system that, if it performs as claimed, could dramatically change how long it takes to travel to Mars. Early results suggest a leap in speed and efficiency that has drawn attention precisely because it is not coming from NASA or private U.S. companies such as SpaceX.\n\nThe engine is being developed by the Troitsk Institute, part of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. According to researchers involved in the program, the system could reduce interplanetary travel time from several months to roughly one to two months. Ground-based testing is currently underway, and the developers say the technology could be ready for space deployment by around 2030.\n\nUnlike conventional chemical rockets, the new system relies on electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged hydrogen particles. This places it firmly in the category of electric or plasma propulsion, a field that has gained increasing global attention as space agencies look for more efficient ways to travel deeper into the solar system.\n\nChemical rockets deliver very high thrust for a short time, which is ideal for launching from Earth. However, they are inefficient for long-distance travel once a spacecraft is in orbit. Plasma engines, by contrast, generate much lower thrust but can operate continuously for long periods, gradually building up extremely high speeds while using far less propellant.\n\nIf the Russian system achieves its projected performance, it could have a major impact on how future missions to Mars and beyond are planned, both for scientific exploration and for potential military or logistical applications.\n\nThe prototype engine is currently being tested inside a 14-meter-long vacuum chamber designed to simulate space conditions. According to technical details reported by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the engine operates at a power level of 300 kilowatts in a pulsed periodic mode and has already demonstrated a working lifespan of 2,400 hours. That duration would be sufficient for a full Mars mission, including acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\nResearchers say the engine accelerates charged hydrogen particles, including protons and electrons, to speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second. By comparison, traditional chemical rockets typically achieve exhaust velocities of around 4.5 kilometers per second. This massive difference in exhaust velocity is the key to the engine’s potential efficiency and speed.\n\nThe plasma engine is not intended to launch directly from Earth’s surface. A conventional chemical rocket would first carry the spacecraft into low Earth orbit. Once in space, the plasma engine would be activated to provide continuous thrust for the journey through deep space.\n\nOfficials involved in the project also note that the system could function as a space tug, moving cargo, modules, or satellites between different planetary orbits. This concept aligns with broader international interest in reusable orbital transport systems.\n\nThe engine uses hydrogen as propellant and relies on an onboard nuclear reactor to provide a constant energy supply. According to project researcher Yegor Biryulin, hydrogen’s low atomic mass allows for faster acceleration while reducing fuel consumption. Its abundance in space could eventually allow for in situ refueling, at least in theory.\n\nThe propulsion system uses two high-voltage electrodes to create directed plasma flow. Charged particles pass between them, forming a magnetic field that expels plasma and generates thrust. This design avoids the need to heat plasma to extreme temperatures, which reduces component wear and improves overall efficiency.\n\nRosatom documentation lists the projected thrust at 6 newtons, which is high for a plasma propulsion prototype. Even so, the thrust remains far lower than chemical rockets, meaning spacecraft would be designed for slow but continuous acceleration rather than short bursts of power.\n\nPlasma propulsion is already used in orbit on many satellites, including systems on OneWeb spacecraft and on NASA’s Psyche mission launched in 2023. Most existing plasma engines operate at exhaust velocities between 30 and 50 kilometers per second. The Russian claims of 100 kilometers per second would represent a significant step forward.\n\nHowever, the technology remains unproven in space. Peer-reviewed scientific data have not yet been published, and the nuclear reactor design has not been disclosed. Nuclear-powered spacecraft raise complex safety, regulatory, and international approval issues, especially during launch.\n\nWhile the concept is promising, the engine is still years away from practical use. Its projected readiness by 2030 will depend on continued testing, funding, and successful resolution of engineering and regulatory challenges.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "title": "What Is 'UpScrolled,' and Why Are People Switching to It From TikTok?",
    "description": "UpScrolled: so hot right now.",
    "fullText": "TikTok's having a rough 2026. The app recently switched ownership from the Chinese-based ByteDance to the new \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture,\" which, as the name implies, is a majority American-owned business entity. Any changing of the guard comes with the risk for disruptions and issues, but it seems TikTok's problems have gone beyond the usual rocky transition. First, the app itself went down, which the company attributed to a power outage at a data center. Then, users accused the platform of updating its terms of service with aggressive new tracking, blocking certain content types, and \"shadowbanning\" new posts from some users.\n\nIt's still not clear exactly what's going on here, but users aren't waiting around for more explanation. In fact, many have made up their minds already, and believe the app is actively suppressing content, neutering algorithms, and invading privacy in a way it didn't under ByteDance. While there are other, popular social media platforms to jump to, many apparently have flocked to a relatively new one: UpScrolled. As of this article, it's now the second most popular free app on the iOS App Store, reminding me of when X users ran to Bluesky.\n\nUpScrolled, created by Issam Hijazi, is a social media platform that launched this past June. According to the company's \"About\" page, UpScrolled's mission is to allow all users to share their views without risk of bias, shadowbanning, or \"unfair\" algorithms. The company asserts it does not push agendas, and ensures that \"every post has a fair chance to be seen.\" If you believe TikTok's algorithm is now biased against your views, I could see how that pitch sounds enticing.\n\nThe company says it only restricts content that violates their guidelines. That means illegal activities, hate speech, bullying and harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted content, or anything \"intended to cause harm.\" UpScrolled will also never ban you without your knowledge. If the platform removes your videos or your account, it says it'll let you know why.\n\nOne big difference between UpScrolled and other social media platforms is its algorithm. The app splits feeds into two: There's the Following Feed, which lists posts entirely in chronological order. The first posts are the newest from your followers, and you scroll through previous posts. If you want to find new posts from accounts you don't follow, you can use the Discover Feed. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, the Discover Feed does not employ some aggressive, personalized algorithm. Instead, it's based on likes, comments, and reshares. Popular posts from across the platform are shared with you\n\nWhat I especially appreciate is UpScrolled's approach to data collection, in that they largely don't do it. The company says it doesn't sell user data to third-parties for marketing, tracking, or for profit. The only times they'll hand over user data is when compelled by law. That's in sharp contrast to many social media platforms, which seem to collect as much of your data as possible.\n\nI haven't spent much time with the app yet, though I did create an account this morning to see what the hullabaloo was all about. I don't recognize any of the users the app suggests I follow, which means I'll likely need to dig through the content types if I want to find accounts to start following.\n\nThe Discover Feed is a mix of content types, but is heavy with content surrounding the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In fact, many users are choosing the platform as a space for pro-Palestinian content, in response to allegations that mainstream social media apps censor these types of posts. That said, the app advertises a host of different content types to follow, including sports, news, games, film, music, tech, and travel.\n\nAs you might expect, some of the posts here are simply ripped from TikTok, which is a common practice I see on social media platforms that, well, aren't TikTok. Despite the current controversy, it's clear which platform still has the largest user share at this time, by a long shot.\n\nBut it's not all short-form videos. The app also includes plenty of posts of static images as well, which reminds me more of Instagram than TikTok. Still, it seems former TikTok users don't care that this isn't a one-to-one replica of the TikTok formula, and care more about sending a message to the app they once loved being addicted to.\n\nI'm not sure my limited journey with UpScrolled this morning will keep me hooked, but it's an interesting take on a social media platform. We'll just need to see if the growth will continue, or if this is just a momentary blip before people return to TikTok.",

    "fullText": "Not to be outdone by Apple's \"Lockdown Mode,\" Meta is rolling out new security features for WhatsApp designed to protect high-risk users—journalists, activists, and government officials, for example—from cyber attacks. Strict Account Settings is a \"lockdown-style\" mode that builds on the platform's existing end-to-end encryption, adding stronger privacy features and additional restrictions against unknown contacts.\n\nFor most WhatsApp users, this level of lockdown is overkill. However, people with access to sensitive data that is potentially valuable to threat actors actually have been targeted with spyware campaigns through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, so for users like that, it may be a lifesaver. (In the last year, WhatsApp has also patched multiple zero-day exploits that allowed spyware to proliferate.)\n\nAs noted, the new WhatsApp settings are similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, an OS-level feature that blocks attachments, link previews, and communication from unknown contacts alongside some other settings changes. It also disables wired connections to external devices and a range of web features. Android's Advanced Protection offers similar functionality.\n\nStrict Account Settings automatically enables existing privacy and security settings and adds a host of restrictions to users' communication and visibility on WhatsApp.\n\nTwo-step verification and security notifications, which alert you if a contact's security code changes, are turned on.\n\nHigh volumes of messages from unknown accounts are blocked\n\nOnly your contacts or those added to a pre-established list can see information about you, including your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile.\n\nOnly known contacts or those on your pre-established list can add you to groups.\n\nThese controls can be enabled by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and toggling on Strict account settings.

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Google Chrome User Should Know",
    "description": "There's a lot to dig into in Google's browser.",
    "fullText": "It feels as though Google Chrome has been around forever, but it's actually still just a teenager: The browser launched back in 2008, originally just for Windows—though it's now made its way to macOS, Linux, and mobile devices too of course. It's a powerhouse of a browser that is more widely used than any other.\n\nIn the 18 years since its release, Chrome has changed a lot: A host of features have been added and taken away down the years, and it's very possible that you don't know everything that Chrome can do, even if you use it every day. Here are my favorite hacks for Chrome, covering everything from casting tabs to playing audio and video.\n\nIf you've always stuck with the 'out of the box' Chrome aesthetic, you might not be aware that it's relatively simple to change up the theme of the browser—which covers the colors of menus and tabs, as well as what you see on the new tab page. To see the available options, open up a new tab, then click the Customize Chrome button (lower right).\n\nYou can apply any of the color themes just by clicking on them, or set up your own colors by clicking the color picker (the little pipette icon). For a more significant visual overhaul, click Change theme: You'll then see a range of options created and curated by Google. Click Chrome Web Store to see more official and third-party themes you can install.\n\nIt's fair to say Chrome doesn't have the best reputation for efficient RAM usage, but you can get some of it back. In any tab, click the three dots (top right), then choose Settings > Performance, and activate the Memory Saver option. As Google explains, this will put tabs you've not used in a while in an inactive state, and recover some RAM from them.\n\nIt's not a Chrome feature that gets much attention, but you can cast tabs wireless to a big screen via Google TV or Chromecast devices. It's useful for everything from music streaming to slide presentations, though the latency is usually too high for video playback (and bear in mind that YouTube, for example, has its own casting button for this).\n\nWith a tab open in Chrome, click the three dots in the top right corner, then choose Cast, save and share > Cast. You'll then be asked to choose the device to cast to (which must be on the same wifi network of course). Via the Sources button, you can choose to cast just the tab you're in, or your entire Windows or macOS desktop, including Google Chrome.\n\nJust because you use Google Chrome doesn't mean you have to use Google Search—maybe you want to switch to a privacy-first alternative, like DuckDuckGo. To set up search engines in Chrome and change the default one, click the three dots in the top right corner of any tab, then choose Settings, and open the Search engine page.\n\nUse the Add button to add new search engines, the pencil icons on the right to edit their details, and the three dots on the right to set which one is used by default (when you type some search terms into the Chrome address bar). Each search engine can also have a shortcut: Type the shortcut into the address bar to run a search using that specific site.\n\nTab grouping can make it much easier to manage the myriad tabs you've got open in every single session—these groups can be moved and closed and saved all together, so you could set up different groups for different research projects, for example, or for different tasks in the browser (maybe one for work-related browsing and another for shopping).\n\nThe easiest way to get started with tab groups in Chrome is to right click on a tab header and pick Add tab to new group from the pop-up menu. Give your tab a name and color, and if you then right-click on other tab headers, you'll be able to add them to the group (or create a new one). Right-click on the headers of grouped tabs to access further options.\n\nUser profiles are a hugely powerful Chrome capability that more people should know about: It lets you split your browsing into work and personal categories, for example, (and separate Google accounts, if needed). It means that logins, browsing history, and all the other data that gets stored in Chrome don't all get lumped together in one place.\n\nSo, you could use your work profile for the day, and then switch to your personal profile at night—making it easier to access your Netflix login and Amazon shopping history, for example. To get started with profiles, click your current profile avatar (in the top right corner, next to the three dots), then choose Add Chrome profile from the menu.\n\nIf you're prepared to invest some time and effort into your Chrome hacking, give the Tampermonkey extension a look (it's actually available for several browsers, not just Chrome). The tool lets you inject your own custom code to modify the websites you're looking at, so you can alter the appearance or even the functionality of pages.\n\nYou could remove distractions from a page, for example, add your own keyboard shortcuts for navigation, or insert new buttons for sharing links on social media. We don't have the space for a full tutorial here, but if you head to the Tampermonkey website you'll find a wealth of help to get you started, plus some links to user script repositories on the web.\n\nThere are plenty of powerful web apps you can get at through Chrome—Slack, Gmail, Spotify—and Google's browser lets you set these up as if they were desktop apps in Windows or macOS. You can get a shortcut straight to the app on the Windows taskbar or macOS dock, and when you launch it, it appears in its own distinct desktop window.\n\nWith the web app open in Chrome, click the three dots (top right), then choose Cast, save and share > Install page as app. You'll then be asked to give your new app a name, and click Install to confirm. The app launches right away, and you can then organize it into your Windows or macOS system as you want (by pinning it to the taskbar, for example).\n\nChrome comes with a built-in Safety Check that runs an audit on passwords, security updates, third-party extensions, and more. You can find the Safety Check screen by clicking the three dots to the top right of any tab, then choosing Settings > Privacy and security: As well as running the check, you can follow the recommended actions.\n\nGoogle Chrome can handle more than webpages: It's also able to open up PDF documents, and image, video, and audio files saved in common formats (like MP3 or MOV). Just drag a file into an empty tab to open it, or associate the file type with Chrome in Windows or macOS (which means it'll automatically open in the browser when you double-click on it).\n\nChrome isn't the most advanced PDF editor or video player you're ever going to see, but it's a quick and easy way of opening up local files without having to launch an entirely separate program each time. You could use this alongside the Split View feature, for example, to watch a video stored on your system while making notes in Google Docs.",

    "title": "Chrome Can Now Use AI to Browse the Internet for You",
    "description": "Does the large language model need to disassociate too?",
    "fullText": "Have you ever wanted to browse the internet, but the thought of typing a URL into your address bar seemed just too exhausting? Now, Google's here to help. Today, the company announced a big expansion of its existing Gemini in Chrome feature, with the highlights including a new look for the AI companion, more-integrated image editing tools, and, perhaps most impressive (but also creepy), the launch of Auto Browse, which lets Gemini take the wheel when you're going online.\n\nPreviously, Gemini in Chrome appeared in a small box on top of your browser, which made it a bit inconvenient to use, especially when bouncing between tabs. Google's update moves it to a scrollable side panel view that's a bit bigger, and it won't obscure any of your other content. Instead, it'll sit to the right of the webpage your viewing, so you can more easily compare whatever answers Gemini gives you with what you're seeing, or carry on a conversation while bouncing between multiple tabs. It will retain all the same functionality as before, including the ability to reference multiple open tabs in prompts. It's a small change, but should help for usability.\n\nGoogle's Nano Banana image generation AI is having a bit of a moment, and the new Gemini in Chrome updates make it easier to use. Now, instead of having to download an image and re-upload it to Gemini, you can edit it using Nano Banana with a simple right click. Or, you could also use natural language to start an edit by pulling up the image you want to edit on your screen and telling Gemini to edit it in the side panel. Google says this should work with pretty much any image you can pull up on the browser.\n\nDuring a demo, Google showed this off to journalists using a Google Photos library, but there's nothing saying you have to stick to your own images. That immediately set off alarm bells for me, given Elon Musk's X is currently in hot water after opening up the ability for anyone to use Grok to edit other people's images directly on the social media platform and without their permission. After some users started using that tool to generate explicit content from others' photos, it was pared down a bit, but Google doesn't seem worried. When I asked about safety protections for this feature, a Google spokesperson told me the following:\n\n\"We have clear policies that prohibit the use of our AI tools to generate sexually explicit content, and our tools are continually getting better at reflecting these policies. We've invested in safety from the outset and added technical guardrails to help limit problematic outputs such as violent, offensive, or sexually explicit content.\"\n\nThe company didn't say anything about how users might use Nano Banana in Chrome to circumvent copyright, but technically, the new update doesn't really add new features to Google's AI image generator, it just makes it easier to access. Granted, the same thing applied to Grok's recent update, too, and easier access can mean opening the floodgates, even if you have the best of intentions.\n\nFinally, the big one: \"Agentic\" has been the hot buzzword in AI as of late, and Google doesn't want Chrome to be left behind. So now, instead of just answering questions, Gemini can take control of your browser for you.\n\nThe functionality is currently limited to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers, but starting today, those subscribers can ask Chrome to \"Auto Browse\"—completing research, taking you to different websites, and filling out forms for you.\n\nYou can watch as the AI navigates around the web, or you can click away to a different tab while it works in the background. Multiple tabs can Auto Browse at the same time, so you can have a few tasks going on at once. The AI will list out the steps it takes in the side panel while it navigates around, to make checking in on it easier.\n\nGoogle demonstrated this to journalists by showing the AI finding a specific product, navigating to its store page, singing into the buyer's account (using Google Password Manager), and adding it to their cart. The company also suggested you could use Auto Browse to schedule appointments, fill out an online form using information from an uploaded PDF, collect tax documents, compare apartments listed on sites like Redfin, and more. I haven't been able to go hands-on with it yet, so I can't speak to how well it'll perform any of these tasks, although it did look snappy in the controlled demo.\n\nMy concern with Auto Browse mostly lies in sketchy websites and permissions, although Google told me it's planned for those. Auto Browse needs to get permission before it can access your Google Password Manager, and if it stumbles across a link that the AI thinks doesn't look quite right, it will supposedly use Chrome's existing unsafe browsing protections to navigate away. A Google spokesperson told me its \"as secure as you can make it,\" although I'd probably want to keep an eye on it for at least my first few requests.\n\nThe feature also has one limitation for now—while it can be open in multiple tabs at once, your Auto Browse tabs won't be able to communicate with one another. That means each instance of Auto Browse is isolated, but that could change in the future.\n\nPersonally, I don't see myself using this much, especially for sensitive tasks like \"collecting tax documents,\" but automatically filling out a basic form does sound handy. Google said that Auto Browse will stop and ask for you to take over for sensitive steps in any tasks that might require it, like actually buying an item or submitting a form. It won't (or isn't supposed to) take that final step for you, giving you a chance to check its work. In that way, it's similar to the Gemini app's existing shopping features.\n\nGemini in Chrome can use most of Gemini's existing features, allowing it to connect with apps like Gmail or access your history chatting with the bot. But there is one big one that's planned for the \"coming months.\"\n\nRecently, the Gemini app proper rolled out a beta for \"Personal Intelligence\" to paying users, allowing the AI to view all of your past conversations and connected apps without you having to direct it where to look. It's basically an extension of those existing connected apps and history features, with a reasoning model applied over it. For instance, you could tell it to help you find new tires for your car, and it would automatically know to look through your Gmail and Google Photos to find out what model of car you have and the last time you bought tires.\n\nThat feature is still baking, but that it's even in the works means Google is moving fast on bringing parity between all the different ways you can access Gemini. Every other feature mentioned in this article is either already available, or rolling out now.",

    "title": "You Can Finally Clean Up Your Mac’s Menu Bar (Without Using Third-Party Software)",
    "description": "Hide icons in the settings, then shrink the space between icons.",
    "fullText": "The Mac menu bar is a bit of a mess. Way too many applications want to put icons in the top-right corner of the screen, and most users only want to see a fraction of those. This is a particular problem on recent MacBooks, where the camera notch blacks out a chunk of space right in the middle of the menu bar. This is why applications for cleaning up the Mac menu bar are so popular—the clutter can feel overwhelming.\n\nHere's the thing, though: You probably don't need to leave applications like that running constantly. You can hide icons in macOS' Settings, then use a free tool once to move all the icons closer together. Here's how.\n\nTahoe, also known as macOS 26, gave users a lot to talk about, which meant a few features were broadly overlooked. One of them: the ability to hide any menu bar icon, no third party software required. To use this feature open System Settings and head to the Menu Bar section. You will see the ability to toggle system icons, like Siri and Spotlight, on and off. Keep scrolling, though, and you'll find the ability to hide icons for any of your installed applications. Just toggle off any application you'd rather not see in the menu bar and it will disappear.\n\nI've been using this to disable unwanted icons for months, and it's working well for me. Having said that, though, it isn't a perfect replacement. Applications like Bartender and Ice don't just hide icons—they give you access to a secondary tray where you can still occasionally access icons you hid. There's no quick way to do that using the macOS settings. Still: It's a free way to hide unwanted icons, and there's no need to keep third party software running.\n\nIf your menu bar still feels crowded, you can free up a bit more space by squeezing all of your icons together. A free application called Menu Bar Spacing lets you change the spacing in your menu bar. Just \n\nThe great thing about Menu Bar Spacing, as an application, is that it doesn't need to run constantly. You can launch it once, make the changes you like, and then delete it—your setting will still apply. This is because the application changes a few hidden macOS settings. You can make the changes yourself using the Terminal if you prefer not to use an app, but I think the app makes things a little bit easier.\n\nThere's a bit of a caveat for macOS 26 users. Because of a bug, only Apple's own icons will move closer together at first. Your other applications will need to be restarted before they bunch closer together. That means you'll need to manually close and re-launch each application, or simply restart your Mac. It's annoying, but only relevant right after you change the settings. And you'll have a lot more space on your menu bar once you're done.",

    "title": "Does Walking Really Count As Cardio?",
    "description": "The answer depends on your fitness level, and on how strenuous of a walk you're doing.",
    "fullText": "Walking is an easy way to get some exercise in your day, and it delivers mental health benefits as well. I’m one of the many people who added daily walks to my routine during the pandemic, and they improved my life so much I don’t intend to stop. But does walking do enough for your body that you can count it as cardio exercise?\n\nThe answer is complicated. Walking counts as cardio in some respects: it can burn calories, it gets your heart rate up, and it counts toward the exercise we should all be getting every week. But on the other hand, it’s not going to increase your cardio fitness in the same way as a run or an intense aerobics class would. If you want to improve your endurance, you’ll have to do more than just walk.\n\nRunning burns more calories than walking per unit time, but both are similar when you consider distance.\n\nA rule of thumb is that you burn about 100 calories per mile whether you run it or walk it, but in truth calorie burn varies according to the size of your body (you burn more calories if you are larger) and how fast you run or walk. The calories per mile are slightly lower when you walk. This calculator estimates that a 150-pound person will burn 108 calories by walking a mile at 3 miles per hour, or 104 calories by running it at 6 miles per hour. Some calculators give a lower estimate for walking,\n\nThe bigger difference is in calories per hour (rather than calories per mile): for the same 150-pound person, walking burns 324 calories per hour, and running burns 627. The faster you go, the higher the calorie burn. So if you’re walking or running to burn calories, running will burn about double the calories in a given time. But if you prefer walking and you have the time to spare, both will do the job.\n\nEach intensity level of exercise offers its own benefits. Walking is what I’d consider very easy cardio, jogging is more of a medium exercise, and high-intensity cardio would be something like sprinting or racing. All of these are good for you, although depending on your goals, you may not need to do all of them.\n\nIf you want to be a fast runner, for example, you’ll need plenty of medium cardio (slow running) and some higher intensity stuff (speedwork); if you want to improve your endurance, as measured by metrics like VO2max, you’ll definitely need to put in some work at these intensities.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re just trying to get some movement in your life and you don’t care about getting better at it, lower intensity exercise like walking may be enough.\n\nAccording to major health organizations (including the CDC, the WHO, and the AHA), we should all be getting at least 150 minutes per week of “moderate” exercise, or 75 minutes of “vigorous” exercise. You can mix and match, with the idea that each minute of vigorous exercise counts double.\n\nSo where does walking fall in that recommendation? Walking is moderate, and I have more here on how that's defined. But if you want a rule of thumb to compare it to heart rate, the American Heart Association defines moderate exercise as that in which your heart rate is between 50-70% of your max, and vigorous exercise as between 70-85% of your max. (That does assume you know your true max.) Walking will generally be in the moderate range, so you’ll have to do twice as much of it—counting in minutes—as if you chose to do more vigorous cardio. That matches up with our calorie calculations.\n\nThe distinction between walking and running is a mechanical one: if you always have at least one foot on the ground, you’re walking. If instead your gait has a little hop as you move from foot to foot, you’re running. (Jogging is simply a slow run.)\n\nIt’s often easier to keep up a higher intensity (and a higher heart rate) by running than by walking, but that’s not always true. If you’re hiking up a mountain, your heart rate can easily get into the “vigorous” zone. And if you’re an efficient enough runner, you may be able to go for a slow jog while you keep your heart rate down in the “moderate” realm.\n\nAs you’re planning your workouts, think about the intensity: Measure your heart rate if you aren’t sure where you fall; you can use a tracker like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch to do this, but you can also just put two fingers on the side of your neck and count the beats of your pulse. If your max is 200 and you count 150 beats per minute, you’re at 75% of your max heart rate.\n\nMaybe walking gets you a higher heart rate than you thought—not impossible if you’re a beginner or if your walks take you over hilly terrain. If you want a tougher cardio workout, you can walk faster, or you can choose a different type of exercise like cycling or dancing that gets your heart rate up higher. But it’s fine to go for an easy walk if that’s all you’re aiming for.",

    "description": "If you use it, make sure you haven't installed this malicious extension.",
    "fullText": "Moltbot (formerly known as Clawdbot) is the most viral AI product I've seen in a while. The personal AI assistant runs locally and connects via a chat app, like WhatsApp or iMessage. Once you give Moltbot access to your entire device, it can do things on that device for you. This the sort of thing that excites agentic AI pioneers, but worries privacy and security enthusiasts like myself.\n\nAnd indeed, I have significant concerns about the risks installing Moltbot on your personal machine. Since agentic AI will autonomously perform tasks based on prompts, bad actors can take advantage of the situation by surreptitiously feeding those bots malicious prompts of their own. This is called prompt injection, and it can impact any type of agentic AI system, whether an AI browser, or an AI assistant like Moltbot.\n\nBut it's not just prompt injection that presents an issue for Moltbot users.\n\nAs spotted by The Hacker News, Moltbot already has its first malicious extension, dubbed \"Clawdbot Agent - AI Coding Assistant\" (\"clawdbot.clawdbot-agent.\") It seems to have been developed before the bot's name change. This extension is designed for Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's open source AI code editor. What's worse, it was hosted on Microsoft's official Extension Marketplace, which no doubt gave it legitimacy to Moltbot users looking for a Visual Studio Code extension.\n\nThe extension advertised itself as a free AI coding assistant. When you install it, it executes a series of commands that ends up running a remote desktop program (The Hacker News says it's \"ConnectWise ScreenConnect\") on your device. It then connects to a link that lets the bad actor gain remote access to your device. By just installing this extension, you essentially give the hacker the tools to take over your computer from wherever they are.\n\nLuckily, Microsoft has already taken action. The extension is no longer available on the marketplace as of Tuesday. Moltbot has no official Visual Studio Code extension, so assume any you see are illegitimate at best, and malicious at worst. If you did install the extension, researchers have detailed instructions for removing the malware and blocingk any of its processes from running on your device. Of course, to first thing to do is uninstall the extension from Visual Studio Code immediately.\n\nThe Hacker News goes on to highlight findings from security researcher Jamieson O'Reilly, who discovered hundreds of unauthenticated Moltbot instances readily available on the internet. These instances reveal Moltbot users' configuration data, API keys, OAuth credentials, and even chat histories.\n\nBad actors could use these instances for prompt injection: They could pretend to be a Moltbot user, and issue their own prompts to that user's Moltbot AI assistant, or manipulate existing prompts and responses. They could also upload malicious \"skills,\" or specific collections of context and knowledge, to MoltHub and use them to attack users and steal their data.\n\nSpeaking to The Hacker News, security researcher Benjamin Marr explains that the core issue is how Moltbot is designed for \"ease of deployment\" over a \"secure-by-default\" set up. You can poke around with Moltbot and install sensitive programs without the bot ever warning you about the security risks. There should be firewalls, credential validation, and sandboxing in the mix, and without those things, the user is at greater risk.\n\nTo combat against this, The Hacker News recommends that all Moltbot users running with the default security configurations take the following steps:\n\nremove any connected service integrations\n\nOr, you could do what I'm doing, and avoid Moltbot altogether.",

    "description": "A newly leaked audio of Erika Kirk has raised eyebrows over her attitude regarding her husband, Charlie Kirk's, death.",
    "fullText": "A newly leaked audio of Erika Kirk has raised eyebrows over her attitude regarding her husband, Charlie Kirk's, death.\n\nIn the recording, the mother of two can be heard discussing with her staff the success of a TPUSA event and the strong sales of associated merchandise. She then appeared to dismiss her husband's death during the discussion while emphasizing harmony between staff.\n\nErika Kirk also recently came under fire for including an alleged pedophile pastor in her ongoing Faith Tour.\n\nCriticism continues to follow Erika, and it has further intensified in the wake of leaked audio of her speaking to TPUSA team members two weeks after Charlie's death.\n\nThe audio was released by right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has previously promoted multiple conspiracy theories regarding Charlie's death.\n\nIn the recording, Erika can be heard \"giggling\" and cheerfully praising the team for pulling off \"an event of the century\" and noting the substantial merchandise sales they made.\n\nCandace Owens released leaked audio from Turning Point USA in which Erika Frantzve Kirk is heard giggling and cheerfully discussing attendance figures, merchandise sales, and performance metrics from Charlie Kirk’s memorial event just 11 days after his death pic.twitter.com/CvEoOTq5hF\n\n— HOT SPOT (@HotSpotHotSpot) January 28, 2026\n\n\"Wow, I don't even know where to begin. The fact that we were able to pull off an event of the century is just insane. We had 275,000 people that attended and a stadium overflow,\" Erika said, in the leaked audio.\n\nShe added, \"I think we're at like 200,000 for merch sales. Don't quote me on that, cause I think it just keeps like bumping up like crazy. I just wanted to say a huge, huge thank you to the events team, the development team, the graphic design team, and the production team.\"\n\nHearing Erika speak so cheerfully about merchandise sales in the wake of her husband's death was sure to raise eyebrows, but her apparent dismissal of his passing was even more shocking.\n\nMidway through her speech, she candidly urged her staff to resolve any past conflicts among themselves before going on to make the comment about Charlie's death.\n\n\"My husband's dead. Like, I'm not trying to be morbid, but he's dead. And it puts life into perspective of how short life is, and relationships,\" Erika said.\n\nIn response, Owens then said on her podcast that she was surprised by Erika's seemingly calm reaction.\n\n\"In my imagination, I just thought that she would be more upset,\" the right-wing influencer noted.\n\nThe reaction to the leaked audio of Erika has been somewhat divided, with several calling out the widow's overly cheerful attitude, while others noted she was simply making the best of a bad situation.\n\nA critic on X noted, \"The most gleeful leftist you can imagine, isn't half as happy over Charlie Kirk's death as Charlie Kirk's wife.\"\n\nAnother person wrote,\" 'People mourn differently,' But no one mourns like this.\"\n\n\"That is the first time she sounds authentic, being happy about merch at the memorial of her husband, crazy, every other speech she gave about her husband sounds like bad acting,\" a third person commented about the leaked audio.\n\nHowever, several showed support for Erika, with someone asking, \"What's she supposed to do? Not address and thank the team that put on her husband's memorial?\"\n\nAnother said, \"Erika is excited that millions of people heard the gospel of Jesus Christ. Why are we upset about this?!\"\n\nSince taking over from Charlie, Erika has hosted several TPUSA events and recently launched another under the non-profit Faith arm.\n\nThe inaugural \"Make Heaven Crowded\" tour will visit 30 cities this year to call people to \"repentance, faith, and bold obedience to Jesus.\"\n\n\"This tour is so special to me because I wanted … to bring a slice of heaven from my husband and bring it to everyone around this county so that they could have that extension, and that beauty and that palpable feeling of the Holy Spirit,\" Erika said about the tour to an audience of thousands, per the New York Post.\n\nThe mother of two went on to reiterate her commitment to pushing further her husband's faith legacy.\n\n\"Church is never meant to retreat from culture. We will change this country. We will change this world,\" she added.\n\nUnfortunately for Erika, the tour, which is still in its early days, was quickly overshadowed by controversy surrounding Pastor Greg Laurie's role as a primary speaker.\n\nLaurie, the senior pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, has been named in a series of lawsuits filed in U.S. federal court alleging child abuse and trafficking by former pastor Paul Havsgaard.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that church leaders, including Laurie, allowed Havsgaard to act without oversight and overlooked multiple warning signs of his alleged misconduct when he ran church-supported children's homes in Romania from 1998 to 2008.\n\nLaurie and his church have since denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\"This isn't Charlie's Turning Point. Erika is not doing what Charlie would do, ugh,\" a second individual commented about Laurie's inclusion.",

    "title": "BREAKING: BBC Confirms Authenticity of Viral Video Appearing to Show Alex Pretti Kicking Agents’ Car 11 Days Before Shooting",
    "description": "After much speculation online, the BBC has confirmed the authenticity of new viral footage appearing to show Alex Pretti kicking an agent's car on Jan. 13 — 11 days before he was shot to death by Border Patrol agents.",
    "fullText": "Footage published on Wednesday appeared to show Alex Pretti kicking an immigration agent’s car before getting thrown to the ground during a confrontation less than two weeks before he was shot and killed in Minneapolis.\n\nThe News Movement was the outlet that captured the incident on Jan. 13. It said in an X post that it “appears to be Alex Pretti interacting with federal immigration agents” and that it had the clip analyzed by the BBC, “whose facial recognition technology confirmed his identify to a 97% degree of accuracy.”\n\nThe BBC confirmed the authenticity of the video in their 10 p.m. GMT news broadcast. Reporter Ros Atkins said the man in the video “has the same coat, facial hair and gait as Alex Pretti and a facial recognition tool suggests a 97% match. We see him shouting abuse at the agents.” Separately, a spokesperson for the BBC confirmed to Mediaite that they reviewed the footage and verified its team did use facial recognition technology on the video.\n\nYou can watch the BBC footage below, or watch the footage on their website (the relevant portion begins at the :50 mark):\n\nCNN, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and other outlets have also now confirmed with the Pretti family that the man in the video is Alex Pretti.\n\nA narrator for the video said TNM’s team — comprised of reporters Dallin Mello and Dan Ming — received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street in Minneapolis around 10:15 a.m. When they arrived, they recorded a man who looked like Pretti spitting on a Ford SUV and shouting at immigration agents that they were  “f*cking trash!”\n\nThe man who looked like Pretti was wearing a black hat, brown coat, and had a beard; the narrator noted it was similar to the outfit Pretti wore when he was killed on January 24. He then smashed the right tail light by kicking it two times and flipped the middle finger at the vehicle.\n\nAt that point, “An agent then got out of the vehicle, grabbed him, and pushed him to the ground,” the voiceover said.\n\nThe man who appeared to be Pretti could be seen trying to scurry away from one agent before another agent grabbed him and they both threw him down.\n\n“During the altercation, agents fired tear gas and pepper balls into the crowd,” the narrator continued. “They continued to hold the man down before they retreat and he walks away.”\n\nThe narrator said there appears to be a gun “visible above his waistband” in the footage.\n\nWe were filming a documentary about ICE activity in Minneapolis when we received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street, and captured this footage.\n\nReporting by @danming, Dallin Mello, and BBC Verify.https://t.co/sZcpUBQOpr\n\n— The News Movement (@thenewsmovement) January 28, 2026\n\nThe footage quickly went viral on X shortly after it was posted on Wednesday. Republican communications adviser Steve Guest posted the clip and it pulled in 1.4 million views in its first two hours. He incorrectly said it was a “bombshell report from the BBC” — a mistake several other users made.\n\n“Important context: Pretti was not a peaceful protester,” Guest added.\n\nMUST WATCH: Footage of an a man who looks like Alex Pretti with a gun in his waistband, spitting on and attacking federal law enforcement officers and kicking the tail light of their vehicle on January 13.\n\nImportant context: Pretti was not a… pic.twitter.com/snzEO8rU8w\n\n— Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) January 28, 2026\n\nGreg Price — who lists “Rapid Response Manager” for President Donald Trump’s White House as one of his jobs on LinkedIn — also shared the clip.\n\n“Alex Pretti spits on a federal agent and then kicks out his taillight in footage released by the BBC from 11 days before his death,” he posted.\n\nAlex Pretti spits on a federal agent and then kicks out his taillight in footage released by the BBC from 11 days before his death.pic.twitter.com/64hg4FXv1a\n\n— Greg Price (@greg_price11) January 28, 2026\n\nMegyn Kelly shared the clip and said it showed Pretti had been “itching for another confrontation with Border Patrol, whom he’d been stalking, harassing and terrorizing.”\n\nShe continued, “HE had been victimizing THEM. His felonies are on tape. He was reckless, and it cost him his life. Find another post boy, illegal-loving Leftists.”\n\nAlex Pretti was itching for another confrontation with Border Patrol, whom he’d been stalking, harassing and terrorizing.

He pondered if Pretti could have “been known to the agents as they attempted to arrest him?”\n\nFootage shows Alex Pretti ATTACKING DHS Agents.\n\nCould he have been known to the agents as they attempted to arrest him?\n\nKnown violent extremist, armed, violent, actively resisting?\n pic.twitter.com/6Y34cotG04\n\n— Tim Pool (@Timcast) January 28, 2026\n\nEx-The Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra shared it as well.\n\nBBC obtains footage from January 13 of a man they say is Alex Pretti\n\nVideos appears to show him spitting at federal law enforcement and attacking their vehicle \n pic.twitter.com/cuXYO6PLIx\n\n— Ryan Saavedra (@RyanSaavedra) January 28, 2026\n\nAnd so did Turning Point USA contributor Savanah Hernandez.\n\nNew footage shows that Alex Pretti was a menace to society who previously vandalized an ICE vehicle in an attempt to escalate violence with agents.\n\nColor me shocked pic.twitter.com/k4eQWQVb6F\n\n— Savanah Hernandez (@Savsays) January 28, 2026\n\nThe video comes a few days after President Trump said his administration is “reviewing everything” about the shooting.\n\nWatch above via The News Movement on YouTube.\n\nDavid Gilmour contributed reporting.\n\nThe post BREAKING: BBC Confirms Authenticity of Viral Video Appearing to Show Alex Pretti Kicking Agents’ Car 11 Days Before Shooting first appeared on Mediaite.",

There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl - give me one season - I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"\n\nBelichick's failure to gain sufficient votes could be a result of two scandals, known as Spy-gate and Deflate-gate, that engulfed the Patriots franchise during his time at the helm, according to ESPN, external.\n\nHowever, Brady said he was \"not worried\" that Belichick would never be entered into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe added: \"We'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen, and he's gonna have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything he did, the commitment he made to winning and the impact that he had on all our lives.\"",

    "description": "He is one of the most winningest coaches in NFL history, but his snub from the Pro Footbal Hall of Fame adds to a growing list of defeats.",
    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots prepare for their 12th Super Bowl appearance, their former head coach Bill Belichick - widely considered to be the greatest professional football coach of all time - finds himself in an unlikely position: defending his legacy.\n\nAlthough Belichick has the most Super Bowl victories in NFL history, he received a phone call on Friday notifying him he would not be inducted into this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick asked with disappointment, according to ESPN which broke the news, referring to his six wins with the Patriots.\n\nThe latest setback adds to a series of misfortunes for Belichick, who ended his nearly 50-year NFL coaching career on a losing streak, and, in a rather unexpected decision, left the pinnacle of American football to coach college students.\n\nJust a few months ago, Belichick made his college football debut to a sell-out crowd of over 50,000 people packed into University of North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nWhen he walked onto the field for the first time, the roar of tens of thousands of screaming fans erupted into the night sky.\n\nThe Tar Heels suffered a stinging defeat to the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs that night, and never quite recovered. By the end of the 12-game season, the team finished with just four wins – its worst record since 2018.\n\nThe paradox between Belichick's legendary NFL career and his spectacularly poor first year in college football is complicating his legacy. After nearly 50 years coaching professional football, why Belichick accepted an offer to step down to the amateur leagues remains a big question. When he will quit is becoming an even bigger one.\n\n\"He's going to have one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career trying to get year two to be better than year one in North Carolina,\" said Dan Roche, an award-winning sports anchor with the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\n\n\"If they struggle again, I think that will basically be the end of the coaching career of Bill Belichick,\" he continued.\n\nFor years, the trend in college football has been that coaches typically leave the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for greater prestige and bigger salaries in the NFL.\n\nBut the college league – which generates over $1.3bn (£940.5m) in revenue – is starting to catch up.\n\n\"North Carolina decided to roll the dice and invest a lot of money in its football program,\" said Greg Barnes, senior reporter at Inside Carolina, a website dedicated to North Carolina University sports.\n\nAnd with that came Belichick, who signed a five-year $50m (£36m) deal to join the Tar Heels.\n\n\"That kind of money is unheard of for North Carolina football,\" Barnes said, notwithstanding that the contract went to 73-year-old Belichick who previously had never coached a single game of college football.\n\nMost sports experts who've followed his career suspect he's not in it for the money.\n\nFor Belichick, they say, it's part love of the game, part love for coaching, and part an affliction that has ailed many great sports figures: an inability to know when to say goodbye.\n\n\"I can't recall many head coaches who have said, 'Okay, I've done it all, and now I'm going to walk away',\" Roche said. \"I just think they don't have it in them.\"\n\nBelichick was born into a football family.\n\nHis father, Steve Belichick, had a long college coaching career, including 30 years at the US Naval Academy and two years at North Carolina.\n\nThe younger Belichick's understanding of football was also nurtured by his mother, Jeannette, with whom he spent many weekends watching games on TV.\n\nBelichick played football and lacrosse at Wesleyan University where he graduated in 1975 with an economics degree. Having never played in the professional league, he began his NFL career that same year as a staff assistant.\n\n\"He doesn't look like a football coach. He's not an overwhelming physical presence. He's not a screamer,\" said ESPN senior writer Seth Wickersham. \"He's kind of a quirky, introverted thinker.\"\n\n\"And he revolutionised professional football,\" Wickersham said.\n\nHowever, he truly forged his legacy during his decades-long career as the New England Patriots head coach.\n\nHe joined the team in 2000. One year later, with the help of quarterback Tom Brady, they won their first Super Bowl. Then five more after that. Altogether, the Brady-and-Belichick-led Patriots appeared in the Super Bowl nine times, the most under any single head coach in NFL history .\n\nMike Reiss, an ESPN staff writer who covers the Patriots, attributed Belichick's success to being \"a master strategist\".\n\n\"When he was at his peak powers, he almost knew the opposition more than the opposition knew themselves,\" Reiss said.\n\nBelichick's critics point to a series of scandals that rocked the Patriots during his tenure, including in 2007 when he was fined $500,000 (£362,000) for ordering his staff to spy on other teams, and in 2016, when Brady was suspended for four games for deflating footballs to his advantage.\n\nIn 2020, Brady left the Patriots, reportedly in part due to Belichick's unwillingness to give Brady, then-aged 43, the longer contract Brady wanted.\n\nBrady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the same year and won his seventh Super Bowl. In Belichick's final two seasons with the Patriots, he led the team to one of its worst records since the 1990s.\n\nBelichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways in January 2024. He was unable to find another NFL team to take him after that.\n\n\"It was a stunning rebuke by the NFL,\" said Wickersham, author of New York Times bestseller It's Better to be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness.\n\n\"For the first time since 1975\", Wickersham said, \"Belichick was out of football\".\n\nIt was during one of the lowest points of Belichick's professional career that he received the call from North Carolina.\n\nOutside of a few sceptics, college football fans were engulfed in enthusiasm.\n\n\"Congrats coach,\" Tom Brady posted on social media. \"The Tar Heel way is about to become a thing 100.\"\n\nWith his name emblazoned on merchandise, home-game tickets for the entire season sold out weeks before it started.\n\nBut Belichick was unable to reverse the bad fortune that appeared to follow him from his final years in the NFL.\n\nAfter their defeat in game one, the Tar Heels would go on to lose most games, including every match against their three in-state rivals, something the team hadn't done since 1989.\n\nAs the season losses piled up, so did the number of empty seats inside North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nFor some, like North Carolina Alumni Association member Deborah Melvin, it was painful to witness even from home.\n\n\"It was just disheartening,\" she said. \"He was supposed to be Mr Super Coach.\"\n\nAdding to fans' frustrations was the incessant press coverage of Belichick's romantic relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old beauty pageant contestant and amateur cheerleader.\n\nWickersham called it \"the most scrutinized relationship ever for an American sports coach\".\n\nHudson made headlines. Lots of headlines. Like when she was rumoured to have been banned from North Carolina's athletic facilities and the university had to put out a statement saying she wasn't. Or the time when she appeared next to Belichick on the sidelines on game day wearing a reptile mini-skirt and knee-high boots. Or the time when she filed a trademark application for the term \"gold digger\".\n\nBelichick couldn't avoid the gossip columns either, making his own headlines amid multiple appearances at Hudson's cheerleading competitions and beauty pageants.\n\nWickersham said he found the Belichick-Hudson saga to be \"surprising\", adding that it contributed to the noise surrounding Belichick who previously \"was a master at limiting distractions\".\n\n\"It's definitely different than the Belichick who was with New England all those years,\" Wickersham said.\n\nThe university declined a request from the BBC to interview Belichick.\n\nThe Tar Heels' bad season has not been blamed on Hudson, though. It was a variety of other factors.\n\nThis was Belichick's first time coaching a college football team, a group composed of a bunch of teenagers with often much steeper learning curves compared to the pros of the NFL.\n\nThe other major challenge was recruiting. Belichick joined the Tar Heels after the deadline for high school athletes to accept their college offers. That meant he missed the chance to persuade some of America's best high school football talent to join his team this year.\n\n\"To get the system in place is more than just turning a light switch on,\" North Carolina football manager Mike Lombardi said after the season.\n\n\"I'm not making any excuses, but when we first got here, we didn't have time to turn the light switch on,\" he said. \"We had to just get into the dark room.\"\n\nLombardi's remarks came during a signing ceremony on 3 December, as the team celebrated the new class of recruits joining the Tar Heels' next season.\n\n\"They will be a foundation of our program,\" Belichick said.\n\nFor now, quitting does not appear to be an option for the all-time great coach.\n\n\"'Why are you still doing this? You could be doing anything,'\" Weiss said he once asked Belichick toward the end of his career with the Patriots. \"And he replied, 'It beats working.'\n\n\"I'll never forget that, because I feel like this is what he feels like he was born to do.\"",

    "description": "After sweeping their way into the last 16, chief football writer Phil McNulty asks can the Champions League rescue Liverpool's season of turmoil?",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot fell into the welcoming embrace of the Champions League while Mohamed Salah felt Anfield's affection as Liverpool enjoyed a rare night of comfort and joy this season.\n\nThe Reds' Premier League title defence has contained elements of the shambolic, increasing scrutiny and pressure on Slot after winning the title in his first campaign.\n\nSalah's incendiary Elland Road outburst in December, when he claimed after being dropped that he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by Slot and Liverpool, only added to the air of unrest surrounding the club.\n\nLiverpool's faithful old friend the Champions League has provided respite amid their troubles. So could it now rescue their season as they chase a seventh triumph in the competition?\n\nFor all their troubles in the Premier League, Liverpool have looked much more at home in Europe, Wednesday's 6-0 win against Qarabag ensuring an automatic place in the last 16 without the need for a play-off.\n\nAnd history tells us Liverpool, with the Anfield factor added to the equation, will fancy their chances in the knockout phase.\n\nIt is a stretch to paint this Liverpool team, on current form, as anything like potential Champions League winners, but they must never be underestimated over a two-legged format.\n\nThis was a night Slot and Salah needed after the turbulence of this campaign. It was their most comfortable game of the season.\n\nIt will not turn the spotlight away from Slot with Liverpool so off-colour in the league, but this was as easy as it gets in Europe. Qarabag were compliant opponents, not made of the stuff that enables Premier League opposition to scent blood in almost every game against his side.\n\nIt was Slot's biggest winning margin as Liverpool manager in his 91st game in charge, and their biggest victory since March 2023, when they won 7-0 against Manchester United.\n\nInevitably, this season being what it is, there was a cloud over the celebrations, with summer signing Jeremie Frimpong once more struck down by a muscle injury, meaning he lasted less than two minutes.",
