    "title": "10 big plays that defined the Seahawks season-long run to the Super Bowl",
    "description": "They were game-turning, result-changing and decisive: the 10 biggest plays of the Seahawks season",
    "fullText": "The Seahawks have run 1,132 plays on offense this season.\n\nThey have defended 1,183 snaps.\n\nThrow in 139 punts, 141 kick-off returns and 84 field-goal attempts, and you’ve got a total of more than 2,500 football plays spread across 19 total games.\n\nOnly an obsessed lunatic or abject moron would choose to sift through all of those in the belief that they could determine which were most important to Seattle reaching its fourth Super Bowl.\n\nWell, I am something of a lunatic and I’m also enough of a moron to believe that I can rank those using three exceedingly specific criteria:\n\nExpected points added (EPA). This is the stat preferred by nerds. It looks at how much a single play changes the likelihood of scoring, taking into account down, distance, field position and time remaining.\n\nWithout further ado, here’s my totally definitive, not-at-all debatable countdown of the 10 plays most responsible for getting Seattle to its fourth Super Bowl:\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba needed just 8 seconds in the second quarter to run past the cornerback and catch Sam Darnold’s pass in stride for a 61-yard touchdown that turned a three-point deficit into a four-point lead.\n\nIt was one of Smith-Njigba’s two touchdown catches of more than 60 yards this season, evidence that he is as dangerous lined up on the outside as he was in the slot last season.\n\nSmith-Njigba led the league with eight catches of 40 or more yards this season. No one else in the NFL had more than five.\n\nDemarcus Lawrence’s fumble return for a touchdown in the first half against the Cardinals was a huge moment as the Seahawks began to hit their stride as a team.\n\nOh wait. That doesn’t really narrow things down.\n\nLawrence scored twice in the first half of this game on strikingly similar plays as a Seahawk pass-rusher hit Cardinals quarterback Jacoby Brissett in mid-delivery, knocking the ball free to Lawrence, who doubled his career touchdown total in a single half.\n\nA fumble gifted Minnesota the ball at the Seattle 13 with 5:09 left in the first half, and the Seahawks leading 3-0. When Jordan Addison was tackled on third down, 1 yard short of what the Vikings needed for the first, they decided to go for it.\n\nDemarcus Lawrence wasn’t fooled on the play action, and as he grabbed hold of Max Brosmer, the Vikings rookie decided he might as well fling it downfield because anything would be better than a sack.\n\nErnest Jones caught the fluttering butterfly of a pass in stride and ran 85 yards for the touchdown.\n\nThe Seahawks led 17-6 entering the fourth quarter and had held the Cardinals to 147 yards of total offense. The Cardinals mounted their two longest drives of the game in the final period, scoring two touchdowns and tying the game with 28 seconds left.\n\nThe Seahawks got the ball at their own 40 thanks to a botched kickoff. They had one timeout left and after an incompletion on first down, Jaxon Smith-Njigba made a sideline catch so acrobatic that the officials needed replay to see that he got both feet down in-bounds for a 22-yard gain.\n\nTwo plays later, Jason Myers kicked a 52-yard field goal to win the game 23-20 on the final play.\n\nThree minutes into the fourth quarter against the Steelers, Jason Myers kicked a 54-yard field goal that put Seattle up 17-14. His ensuing kickoff landed at the Pittsburgh 3, bouncing up and over the head of Caleb Johnson, who assumed the ball was dead once it crossed into the end zone. That’s because Johnson’s a rookie, and that’s the way it works in college.\n\nIn the NFL? That’s a live ball, and George Holani recovered it for a Seattle touchdown.\n\nWhen the Seahawks traded two draft picks to acquire Rashid Shaheed, one of the fastest receivers in the league, the expectation was he’d serve as a downfield receiving threat.\n\nAnd he has, as his 51-yard reception in the NFC Championship Game showed.\n\nBut his biggest impact has come on special teams, and this was the third time he’s ran a kick (or punt) back for a touchdown.\n\nIt was still a one-score game against the 49ers at this point. A botched snap on first down put Seattle at a disadvantage and when Seattle pitched the ball to Walker on a third-down play in which the Seahawks needed 17 yards, it sure looked like the Seahawks were content to punt.\n\nReceiver Jake Bobo stood up a 49ers linebacker with a block and center Jalen Sundell cleared out room for Walker to get the first down and drop 49ers president John Lynch into agony as he watched from a suite.\n\nIt was one of five times this season that the Seahawks handed the ball off on third down, needing 15 yards or more, and wound up gaining the first down. Walker is responsible for three of those, including a touchdown at Pittsburgh back in Week 2.\n\nThe Seahawks had nine defenders at the line of scrimmage as the Rams prepared to snap the ball, and Rams coach Sean McVay was running toward the official as if he was going to call a timeout, but he held off.\n\nMatthew Stafford scanned through his options before coming late to Terrance Ferguson, the rookie tight end, who was boxed out of position by Seattle cornerback Devon Witherspoon. Witherspoon protested to the official that Ferguson should have been flagged for pass interference, which was hilarious, because even if he had been, Seattle would have declined the penalty to take over on downs.\n\nAfter the game, McVay said that one of Seattle’s defenders must have blown his assignment because there were two players covering running back Kyren Williams.\n\n“They kind of lucked into having two guys peel on Kyren right there,” McVay said. “I know that can’t be part of their design. It’s a fortuitous bust by them.”\n\nIt’s possible McVay has a point. Safety Julian Love was preparing to run past Williams when he turned around to follow the running back as defensive end Demarcus Lawrence was also dropping into that area. However, that is the first time I’ve ever heard a coach point to an opponent’s flawed coverage to explain why his super-smart play didn’t work.\n\nStatistically, the most important play of this remarkable game against the Rams was either Smith-Njigba’s 4-yard touchdown catch in overtime or Dallas Saubert’s catch on the two-point conversion to win the game.\n\nIt is my opinion that Rashid Shaheed’s punt return is the single most important regular-season play I have seen in the 20 years that I’ve been paid to write and/or talk about Seahawks football.\n\nBefore that play, Seahawks fans were almost entirely convinced that Seattle needed a new quarterback given the previous possession ending with Darnold’s sixth (!!!) interception in seven quarters against the Rams.\n\nShaheed’s return gave Seattle the jolt it needed, not only to come back.\n\nIf he doesn’t score on that punt return, I don’t believe Seattle wins that game.\n\nIf Seattle doesn’t win that game, the Seahawks don’t win the division.\n\nDanny O’Neil was born in Oregon, the son of a logger, but had the good sense to attend college in Washington.

    "fullText": "Steelers interviewing former Aaron Rodgers teammate for offensive coordinator job originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and new head coach Mike McCarthy have begun building the coaching staff for the 2026 offseason, and it appears the team could have its eye on a former teammate of pending free-agent quarterback Aaron Rodgers to be the offensive coordinator.\n\nAccording to Jeremy Fowler of ESPN, Pittsburgh plans to interview New Orleans Saints quarterbacks coach Scott Tolzien for its vacant offensive coordinator position.\n\n\"The Steelers have notified the Saints that they plan to interview assistant Scott Tolzien for offensive coordinator, per sources,\" Fowler reported on X. \"Tolzien was a Mike McCarthy quarterback in Green Bay and assistant in Dallas. He coached Saints quarterbacks Tyler Shough this year.\"\n\nTolzien played in the NFL for eight years, including three seasons with McCarthy, Rodgers, and the Green Bay Packers from 2013 to 2015.\n\nSince retiring from football in 2019, Tolzien has gotten into coaching. He started as an analyst for Wisconsin in the college ranks, but moved to the NFL to work with McCarthy with the Dallas Cowboys in 2023.\n\nTolzien served in the Cowboys' coaching staff for two seasons and was Dallas' quarterbacks coach in 2024.\n\nIn 2025, after McCarthy was let go by the team, Tolzien went to New Orleans and played an instrumental role in rookie quarterback Tyler Shough's development. Shough showed a ton of promise during his rookie year in 2025.\n\nTolzien and McCarthy have a strong working relationship, so it would make sense for the rising offensive coach to join the Steelers. Tolzien is also familiar with Rodgers, which could give the future Hall of Fame signal-caller another reason to stay in Pittsburgh for one more season.\n\nVikings rumor reveals Minnesota's interest in 2 former first-round quarterbacks\n\nCowboys rumor reveals likely George Pickens outcome ahead of free agency\n\nNFL insider names Patriots possible landing spot for future Hall of Famer\n\nColts, Cardinals, Vikings named top landing spots for $14 million veteran quarterback\n\nBills rumor from Adam Schefter pinpoints Broncos assistant as Buffalo's leading DC candidate\n\nRaiders predicted to hire Kyle Shanahan disciple as next head coach",

    "fullText": "Bruno Fernandes continues to be the central figure for Manchester United, six years after first dazzling fans with an impressive debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Portuguese joined the Red Devils in January 2020 from Sporting, and has been one of the club’s best signings in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.\n\nNow the club’s talisman by some distance, Fernandes is the player who makes the Premier League giants tick, the one the team turns to when seeking solutions on the pitch. The 31 year old has registered 103 goals and 97 assists from 312 games for the Premier League giants to date and remains indispensable to the first team right now.\n\nFernandes was heavily linked with an exit from the Theatre of Dreams at the beginning of this season, but ended up staying. However, with the player set to turn 32 in September and already in the final 18 months of his contract, speculation is rife regarding his next move.\n\nFernandes started the season in a deeper role under former head coach Ruben Amorim, but remained as influential as ever. While the trio of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko initially hogged the limelight following their summer arrivals, it was soon clear that the Portuguese remains United’s main man.\n\nFernandes continued to pull the strings from deep, justifying his position as one of the most creative players in Europe. Following Amorim’s departure in January and a shift in formation, the Red Devils skipper was reinstalled in his preferred No. 10 position, and he has been outstanding once again.\n\nFernandes has registered an assist in each of his last four appearances, and is leading the Premier League’s assist charts this season. The Portuguese Magnifico has scored five goals and set up 11 more in 22 appearances across competitions.\n\nThere is a belief that the key to stopping United is keeping their mercurial skipper quiet. However, it now appears that keeping Fernandes at bay is no mean feat.\n\nAccording to Gradient Sports via Football365, Fernandes is the toughest player to take the ball off in the Premier League. Gradient has compiled a list of top 10 tackle-proof players in the top tier of English football, assessing players on the basis of execution and outcome and grading them on a scale of 100.\n\nThe Portuguese maestro received 87.8 points, putting him at the top of the list, and ahead of Joelinton (87.4) and Ryan Gravenberch (86.7), who make up the top three.\n\nThe report states: “Even if you take an approach of ‘stop Bruno, stop United’, it’s easier said than done.”\n\n“Fernandes may have played most of the season in a deeper role but even in an unfamiliar position, only four midfielders came out on top of a higher percentage of tackles faced, and none of them faced more tackles than the United skipper.”\n\nBruno Fernandes has a very strong bond with fans, and many would like to see him spend the rest of his career at United. With Casemiro set to leave this summer and Harry Maguire’s future also uncertain, the Portuguese’s experience, leadership and world-class abilities could become even more vital for the Red Devils going forward.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Liverpool are taking a massive risk with Xabi Alonso. It's one they might just live to regret.\n\nLiverpool's season has been a mess. They're miles away from where they were last season and given it's nearly February, it looks unlikely that things will turn around quickly.\n\nThe Reds have already seen their worst run of form in the league since the 1950s. They've won five Premier League fixtures since September, with none in 2026.\n\nBut it does look as though they'll stick with Arne Slot. It's worth pointing out that, really, this poor run of form stretches back a year now - Liverpool were not the same team post-January last season, struggling for consistency in much the same way they are now.\n\nDavid Ornstein, however, is one of those reporting that it would take a dramatically negative downturn in results for Liverpool to act before the summer.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\n“It seems like the club are giving him time, even if many supporters aren’t,\" he told Sky Sports. \"Every time you make checks on this, you’re told nothing before the summer. Clearly the summer – like we see at many clubs – is a time for review, and it’ll be fascinating to see which way Liverpool and other teams go at that point.\n\n“Naturally, if results deteriorate to an alarming degree, I presume the hierarchy at any club – even though they are backing their head coach – will have to think about it, but I think the intention at Liverpool is to back him.”\n\nAnd that's particularly interesting because Xabi Alonso is available. Liverpool are set to ignore the Spaniard for now, though - and that's an almighty risk.\n\nAlonso is about as easy a hire as Liverpool could find. If Slot were to resign, for instance, there is essentially no question that they'd hire him.\n\nHe's proven as a title-winner, he's built a club up to be a contender, and he's even worked with two of the summer signings. Importantly, Alonso got the best out of Florian Wirtz - a player Liverpool are now desperate to get going.\n\nOn top of it all, there's the fact he's a club legend who actively wants to work for Liverpool. It doesn't get easier than this.",

    "description": "Premier League clubs always had the money, but now they also have the know-how they have dominated this season's Champions League.",
    "fullText": "It has been quite the season in the Champions League for Premier League clubs.\n\nAll six teams are still in business in European football's elite club competition.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester City are guaranteed to be in the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nAnd they could be joined by Newcastle, if they navigate a two-legged play-off against Monaco or Qarabag.\n\nEngland is the only country to have every team - nine of them - through to the knockout rounds across the three European competitions.\n\nHow is this success being viewed across Europe? Does it denigrate the new format? And why are Premier League clubs proving so powerful?\n\nSpain, which like England gained one of the two European Performance Spots for this season, has not fared well so far.\n\nOnly Barcelona are sure of the being in the last 16, with Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in the playoff round. Athletic Club and Villarreal have been eliminated.\n\nWhereas Spanish clubs used to dominate in Europe - Real Madrid won the competition twice in the past four seasons - this time they lost all but one of 10 meetings against Premier League teams in the group stage. La Liga clubs failed to score in seven matches and were beaten by an aggregate score of 21-5.\n\nBBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague describes it as \"a near-perfect storm\" which has been driven by \"collective wealth, elite decision-making off the pitch, plus a league environment that forces constant tactical evolution\".\n\nBalague added: \"The Premier League has the biggest budgets, but also professional structures - recruitment departments, data analysis, coaching teams and sporting directors - all working at a level that allows clubs to choose better profiles of players and managers.\n\n\"There is an advantage even before a ball is kicked.\"\n\nBalague believes only Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich can match English clubs in all the four areas of \"organised attack, structured defence, attacking transition and defensive transition\".\n\nEnglish clubs are now fully attuned to the European style, Balague says.\n\n\"Rather than imposing something radically different, they are adapting to what Europe now requires,\" he explained.\n\n\"Defensive composure, winning the duels, squeezing space and time, control of transitions and clarity in decisive moments have become more important than dominating by possession. All prepared in training by top managers and coaches.\"\n\nBalague pointed out that success in the league phase does not mean anything. The competition only really begins in the knockout rounds \"where English domination has been far less pronounced\".\n\nBut Balague added: \"In any case it feels almost impossible to stop for ever the domination of a league that brings every year double or more the income of other competitions.\"\n\nOf the seven meetings between German and English clubs in the league phase the Bundesliga clubs only picked up two victories.\n\nBut Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund are all through to the knockout stages, although only Bayern go straight into the last 16.\n\nGerman football expert Raphael Honigstein says few people are placing too much focus on the English success so far.\n\n\"The Premier League's dominance is just denoted as a matter of fact,\" Honigstein said.\n\n\"Kicker today wrote that the top eight reflect the hegemony [dominance] of the Premier League, or reinforces it. So it's just seen as a given.\"\n\nDortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt in the last week both lost to Spurs, who are languishing in 14th in the Premier League.\n\nIt is not just about the money but how it is being used too, though.\n\n\"The days of stupid English money are gone,\" Honigstein added. \"Suddeutsche Zeitung wrote that the Premier League had learned to actually use its riches more effectively, which explains their improved performances relative to recent years.\"\n\nHonigstein also said Borussia Monchengladbach and Qarabag having enjoyed success they could not not achieved in the old group-stage format.\n\nHe added: \"The fact that Inter and Paris St-Germain, last year's finalists, both didn't qualify for the top eight suggests that there is a healthy sense of competition and a bit of randomness.\n\n\"I haven't seen anyone make the link that the Premier League dominance somehow invalidates or diminishes the current format.\n\n\"That is again a very English obsession to think that everyone is always thinking about England. People are not.\"\n\nWhy have English teams dominated as Real & PSG face play-offs?\n\nEngland on course for fifth Champions League spot\n\nTrubin's 'miracle' - how Mourinho's Benfica stunned Real Madrid\n\nThe BBC World Service's Sport Today show debated the topic on Thursday.\n\nFilippo Ricci, the La Liga correspondent for Gazzetta dello Sport, said the best young stars now all go to England.\n\nRicci told the story of Carlos Vicente, who was considered to be Alaves' best player. Such is the financial strength of English football that on Wednesday he joined Championship club Birmingham.\n\nFrench football expert Julien Laurens believes the English dominance paints a picture of a low-quality season in which \"every league is suffering because of the calendar and the fixtures\".\n\nConstantin Eckner, a German football expert, backs the assertion that the competition is only just getting going.\n\n\"We don't know how Tottenham or maybe Liverpool will do in the knockout stage,\" Eckner said. \"There's still time and maybe the English dominance won't be that overbearing.\"\n\nAnd he stated only Bayern can compete as the \"second-best team in Europe behind Arsenal\" - a statement reflected by the final league phase table.\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "fullText": "Jannik Sinner has weighed in on Coco Gauff’s Australian Open racket smash, a moment that has sparked plenty of debate across the tennis world.\n\nIt has become one of the main storylines over the past few days, even with several high-profile matches taking place.\n\nPart of that may be down to what has felt like a lack of drama throughout the tournament, which has pushed more attention towards incidents happening off the court.\n\nThe situation unfolded after Gauff lost to Elina Svitolina, with her decision to smash her racket coming away from the cameras. Even so, it was picked up and shared widely.\n\nGauff kept her emotions in check throughout what was a tough defeat and waited until she was off the court before letting her frustration show.\n\nDespite that, footage of the incident still found its way into public view, adding unnecessary attention to an already disappointing day for her.\n\nSpeaking about the moment, Sinner said he understood where she was coming from.\n\n“It can happen, no? We’re athletes, we invest our whole life to be the best version of ourselves. But sometimes losses hurt. I understand the frustration as a player.”\n\nHe added: “She gives everything on court, she never says a word out of place, she’s a good girl.”\n\nSinner has bigger things to focus on at this point in the tournament with his upcoming semi-final clash against Novak Djokovic taking priority over any off-court topics.\n\nSinner came into this tournament as the clear favourite, aiming for a third straight title.\n\nBut Carlos Alcaraz has put together an impressive run of his own. The young Spaniard has already made it further in this tournament than ever before, and is quickly joining Sinner at the top of pre-match discussions.\n\nMeanwhile, Djokovic’s path to the last four has not been smooth, but he has benefited from a couple of key breaks along the way.\n\nFirst, there was Jakub Mensik’s withdrawal before their fourth-round match. Then in his quarter-final, Lorenzo Musetti was forced to retire with an injury despite being two sets up on the scoreboard.\n\nRemarkably, Djokovic has reached the semi-finals of this Grand Slam despite having played only 11 sets of tennis.\n\nThis year luck does appear to be favouring him more than usual, giving him some much-needed time to recover before facing Sinner.\n\nThis is likely his best opportunity to secure a 25th Grand Slam title.",

    "fullText": "Former Arsenal academy youngster Vlad Dragomir currently plays for Pafos in Cyprus, often captaining the side, and his team had the chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League on Wednesday night.\n\nWith so many other teams around them, Pafos needed a big win and to hope results went their way elsewhere, and Dragomir set them on the right path with a fantastic opening goal against Slavia Praha.\n\nPicking up the ball well outside the penalty area, the 26-year-old fired a left-footed effort across the goalkeeper and into the far top corner, with the ball arrowing into the net at some pace. Dragomir has only scored five goals this season, but that was surely the pick of the bunch.\n\nSlavia scored an equaliser just before half time, but Pafos continued to push in the second half and ultimately won the match 4-1.\n\nYet the night ended in heartbreak, with Benfica and Marseille racking up just marginally better goal difference than Dragomir’s side. Two more goals or one more point would have seen the Cypriot side into the knockouts.\n\nPafos will feel they did all they could on the night, and they’ll perhaps look back on a frustrating 0-0 draw with Kairat Almaty earlier in the tournament as the biggest missed opportunity. 36th-placed Kairat only picked up one point in the entire League Phase, and it was in that game.\n\nVlad Dragomir signing his Arsenal contract.

    "description": "Alabama departing tight end Josh Cuevas has shared his key to the Crimson Tide's success during the 2026 season.",
    "fullText": "Alabama tight end Josh Cuevas is one-of-multiple Crimson Tide players this week at the Senior Bowl.\n\nCuevas played a key role on the Tide's offense in 2025, as the playmaker recorded 411 yards and four touchdowns on 37 receptions. Cuevas transferred to Alabama from Washington following the 2023 campaign, as the playmaker thrived as one of the Tide's top tight ends over the past two seasons.\n\nThe talented route runner could quickly become an excellent pick for any team that choses to select him in this year's NFL draft, as Cuevas will now turn his full attention towards the Senior Bowl.\n\nRecently, Cuevas also did an interview with On3's Andy Staples at the Senior Bowl, and in this, was able to share his thoughts as to how Alabama could succeed in 2026, with the Crimson Tide star saying communication will be an X-factor.\n\n\"We have a whole bunch of younger guys kind of going in.\" Cuevas stated. \"I can tell you right now, our communication is kind of up front, whether it be the offensive line, tight ends, stuff like that, like protection checks and stuff from the quarterback. That can get tremendously better. I think we had a little bit of trouble handling pressure and blitzes and stuff from defenses all year. So I think the communication part absolutely just needs to get better.\n\n\"We have a whole bunch of younger guys, but coach DeBoer is so good at buying into those younger guys, and taking them under his wing, and just kind of sitting them down every single time, support staff around them, and telling everybody this is what you need to work on. He's coached national championship teams. He's capable of doing it, and doing it at a high level.\"\n\nCuevas was targeted on a regular basis throughout the 2025 campaign. Alabama went 11-4 over 15 games played last season, as the Tide will have a multitude of new faces on both sides of the football in 2026, with tight end one of the key positions featuring new faces.\n\nAlabama will begin the 2026 season against East Carolina on Sept. 5.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Josh Cuevas shares key to Alabama football success in 2026",

    "fullText": "Penn State picked up its two biggest wins of its seven-game winning streak, a road sweep of top 10 Wisconsin. The Nittany Lions jumped up to No. 4 in the NPI with the wins, and as of this morning, PSU is in a tie for the No. 3 spot with North Dakota. As we turn the calendar to February next week, the tournament picture continues to tighten up.\n\nAs of this morning, the NCAA Tournament picture looks like this, based on NPI and conference standings. Please note that projected conference tournament winners are in italics and are based on current in-conference point percentage:\n\nLocks (5): Michigan, Michigan State, North Dakota, Penn State, Western Michigan\nSafe (5): Minnesota-Duluth, Quinnipiac, Providence, Cornell, Wisconsin\nBubble In (5): St. Thomas, Dartmouth, Denver, Boston College, UConn\nAutomatic Qualifiers (1): Bentley\n\nBubble Out (5): Augustana, St. Cloud State, Minnesota State, Harvard, Bowling Green\n\nMy projected bracket looks like this:\n\nNorth Dakota vs. Boston College\n\nMinnesota-Duluth vs. St. Thomas\n\nThankfully selection is not for another seven weeks, because this would be the worst possible region for Penn State. Having to travel all the way to Colorado to face host Denver is no easy feat. And if they were to get past the Pioneers, red-hot defending champion Western Michigan or upstart Cornell would be waiting. But after Penn State got a home regional as a four seed last year, I can’t be too upset if this ends up happening.\n\nQuinnipiac took over the lead in the ECAC after Dartmouth lost both of its weekend games. The Bobcats are in excellent shape.\n\nUConn won non-conference games against Quinnipiac and Yale to enter this week’s field. Augustana dropped its only game of the weekend, a 4-1 decision to Minnesota State, to drop out. Otherwise, all other teams in the bracket are the same as last week.\n\nSt. Thomas has been a great story and leads the CCHA, but they are not yet safe. They have a five-point lead in the conference standings but will face each of the No. 2-4 teams in the CCHA in their next six games.\n\nNo. 2 Michigan State at No. 4 Penn State- Friday (6pm on Big Ten Plus) and Saturday (1pm on BTN)\n\nI will have the full preview tomorrow. All attention will be on the outdoor game on Saturday, but don’t forget the Friday game at what should be a raucous Pegula Ice Arena.\n\nNo. 1 Michigan at Ohio State- Friday (6:30pm on Big Ten Plus) and Saturday (5pm on Big Ten Plus)\n\nThe Wolverines travel to Ohio State for what could be a sneaky tough series on the road. Any slippage by Michigan could have the winner of the MSU-PSU series in the Big Ten lead on Saturday night.\n\nNo. 6 Minnesota-Duluth at No. 13 Denver- Friday at 9pm, Saturday at 8pm\n\nDenver is looking for a quality win at home to stay in the NCAA Tournament field, while Minnesota-Duluth will try to climb back into position for a No. 1 seed.\n\nNo. 24 Michigan Tech at No. 11 St. Thomas- Friday at 8pm, Saturday at 8pm\n\nThe Tommies begin their critical six-game stretch at home against Michigan Tech. St. Thomas has a decent lead in the CCHA standings, but they will need to at least earn a split to maintain it.",

    "fullText": "Joe Brady Bills press conference highlights: Buffalo introduces new head coach as new era begins originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter a long, emotional opening statement, Joe Brady turned to his players in attendance and said, \"I love you guys, and go Bills.\"\n\nWith an injured Josh Allen and co. in the house for his introductory press conference, the newest head coach of the Buffalo Bills — and the youngest head coach in the NFL — Brady made sure to express how much he loves the city of Buffalo, stating \"it changed his life.\" He said there's no place he'd rather be than \"right here, right now.\"\n\nBrady and general manager Brandon Beane were asked a variety of questions throughout the presser, ranging from the interview process to hiring coordinators to how they will help the team get over the hump. Beane said that the Bills treated Brady like an out-of-house candidate, with the new coach calling it one of the hardest interviews he's ever had.\n\nThe Bills are in the process of selecting coordinators, but they officially have a new head coach: Brady, who led the offense for the past two seasons. He made sure to say that every decision the organization makes is with Allen and the players in mind. \"Josh Allen is the best player in the NFL, and I have to grow,\" Brady said. \"All I want is for him to get everything he deserves. That's all I do for him.\"\n\nThe new head coach also made sure to thank the Bills' former coach, Sean McDermott, who hired Brady in 2022 and gave him the opportunity to work for the Bills. While he said the team will be taking new direction, the past nine years matter deeply and deserve respect.\n\nThough, it's officially a new era for the Buffalo Bills. With the 2024 MVP in Allen and plenty of talent on the roster, there's no doubt the team is a championship contender. It's up to Brady and his staff to put them over the hump and get the city of Buffalo its first ever Super Bowl title.\n\nThe Sporting News followed Brady's introductory press conference from a frigid Buffalo where new life has been injected into the Bills. Check out all the highlights below.\n\n12:55 p.m.: Brady and Beane have finished answering questions and his first Buffalo Bills press conference is over.\n\nThe Joe Brady Buffalo Bills era has officially begun.\n\n12:53 p.m.: \"What do you have to do to make this team more functional downfield?\"\n\nBrady said that there are a lot of ways to attack the defense, and they have to do that vertically as well.\n\n\"We're going to continue to evolve and grow our offense based on the personnel we have,\" Brady said. \"We have to make sure we're effective at it as well.\"\n\n12:49 p.m.: There's been a few times in the press conference where Brady or Beane has said that the organization treated him as an out of house candidate.\n\nThe coach said that he didn't treat the interview like it was in house and they did not throw him any curveballs.\n\n12:48 p.m.: Beane said that \"while no one was going to check every single box, Joe checked a lot of boxes.\"\n\nHe went on to say everyone will make mistakes, but he will compliment Brady as they move forward in this new operation.\n\n12:42 p.m.: For the coordinator search, Brady said \"You don't make players fit a system, you make a system fit the players.\"\n\n12:40 p.m.: Beane was asked about his interviewing process and said that there are candidates that the Bills could not interview on the remaining team.\n\n\"I don't know if it would be fair to them or the Bills to make them wait longer,\" Beane said. \"My job is to make sure I'm always doing what's best for the Buffalo Bills.\"\n\n12:34 p.m.: Brady was asked about how his offense will change as the next head coach of the Bills.\n\nHe said he believes there are so many elements to grow, and he plans to keep calling plays as a head coach.\n\n12:29 p.m.: \"When our guys play well, it's because of them, and when they don't, it's because of me,\" the new head coach states.\n\nBrady has made sure to state how he is accountable and at the forefront of everything.\n\n12:26 p.m.: When asked about why he hired in-house, Beane said \"Some people have a problem where they view you as what you were and not what you can be.\"\n\nThe general manager went into how they spoke about most topics besides the Bills offense, going into every single detail about \"what this operation is going to be.\"\n\n12:23 p.m.: \"Josh Allen is the best player in the NFL, and I have to grow,\" Brady says. \"All I want is for him to get everything he deserves. That's all I do for him.\"\n\n12:21 p.m.: When asked about what he will change, Brady said he's not necessarily focused on changing things and more on where the team can go from here.\n\n12:18 p.m.: Beane said that when interviewing candidates, everyone started from scratch.\n\nHe wanted to be fair to every candidate, getting Brady back on a zoom call. He then went on to say \"about halfway through that process, I was like 'he's our guy.\"\n\nJoe Brady on taking Bills’ head coaching job: “Full transparency, I couldn’t sleep for the last week.

    "fullText": "One of the NHL’s newest and most hotly-contested rivalries is set to begin a new chapter tonight.\n\nOn Thursday, the Golden Knights begin a run of five straight Western Conference opponents before the Olympic break, starting with the Dallas Stars.\n\nVenue: T-Mobile Arena, Paradise, NV\n\nRight now, the Golden Knights appear to be on the wrong side of being streaky. Last time out, they fell to the Montreal Canadiens to drop their fourth game out of their last five. Inconsistency continues to be a theme this season for the Golden Knights, and they need to find some way to get it out quickly.\n\nHere is how one of the more challenging games left on the docket can be a starting point.\n\nIf there is one thing the Golden Knights need to avoid like the plague, it is taking unnecessary penalties.\n\nWhile the exploits of the Golden Knights and Pavel Dorofeyev on the power play have been excellent, the Stars are one of the few teams that have an edge against them on the man advantage. Dallas boasts the league’s most efficient power play unit, clocking in at a 29.9% success rate and lead by Vegas nemesis Wyatt Johnston’s 17 goals. A lack of discipline could lead to the Golden Knights once again falling on the wrong side of a blowout.\n\nIt feels as though the formula for beating the Golden Knights has become too apparent: take advantage of their mistakes.\n\nThe numbers unfortunately back this up, with the Golden Knights featuring the sixth-most giveaways per game (16.1) and sitting in the bottom five in save percentage (.877). Too many mistakes have ended up in the back of their own net, and Bruce Cassidy’s attempts to clean things up have had varying degrees of success. Starting with this game, the Golden Knights will have to be more responsible with the puck to help their goaltenders out.\n\nIf there is one thing the Golden Knights do have in their favor, it is that they rise to the challenge when the situation calls for it.\n\nDorofeyev’s equalizer against the Canadiens marked the 68th third period goal for the Golden Knights, placing the team second in that category. Whether aiming to hold a lead or trying to chase to force overtime, something about the final stanza pushes the team into overdrive. If the Golden Knights can establish themselves early on, their late-game effectiveness could prove crucial in securing a big win.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea’s January transfer activity was predicted to be pretty limited, and it’s proving to be just that so far.\n\nThe Blues have been heavily linked with bids to sign a new central defender, but so far their main activity at the back has been recalling Aaron Anselmino from Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAaron Anselmino looks sad after his recall from Dortmund.\n\nIt’s a slightly mysterious move, but Matt Law’s piece on our transfers for the Daily Telegraph attempts to explain more. He notes that Anselmino is helping to provide some cover while Tosin is out injured, but given that’s a pretty short term problem, we can’t imagine that was the real reason the young Argentine was brought back.\n\nLaw points out that Anselmino could be used as a makeweight in a deal for one of our defender targets, with Rennes apparently wanting a player back for Jeremy Jacquet should we buy him. It’s also suggested that Anselmino could go to sister club Strasbourg.\n\n“Were a move for Jacquet to fall through, then Anselmino could even stay at Stamford Bridge,” he concludes. Right now, that seems the most likely option, as we don’t see a player coming in as things stand.\n\nIs sitting on the bench at Stamford Bridge really going to help him or us? It doesn’t feel like it.\n\nLaw also covered the situation with Jacquet – Chelsea want to buy and Rennes are willing to sell, but it’s hard to see the two sides reaching a compromise in the limited time left in the window.\n\nWe always said that part of the problem with both Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this season was that Enzo Maresca’s system wasn’t set up for them to do well. That’s changing now – we’re seeing success on the pitch and JP explained why.",

    "fullText": "One day after the Buffalo Bills saw former defensive coordinator Bobby Babich and wide receivers coach Adam Henry sign elsewhere, perhaps the biggest loss has hit the defensive coaching staff, with cornerbacks coach Jahmile Addae joining the Miami Dolphins’ in the same role, per ESPN’s Pete Thamel.\n\nAddae, 41, played college football for four years at West Virginia at the safety position before entering the NFL as an undrafted free agent. He has been with the Bills since 2024 and was a big part of the secondary’s development, particularly cornerback Christian Benford, who earned All-Pro votes during Addae’s first year on the staff. Veteran cornerback Tre’Davious White also resurrected his career until the guidance of Addae during the 2025 NFL season.\n\nAside from the news of offensive line coach Aaron Kromer retiring, this loss will likely sting the most for the Bills, as the new coaching staff undergoes significant changes under new head coach Joe Brady. The rumors of Jim Leonhard as defensive coordinator is interesting to think about, however, as he is a former NFL safety and would have great knowledge and hopefully development of the secondary.\n\nIt’s beginning to look as though One Bills Drive could see a complete overhaul of their defensive coaching staff. That will likely occupy most of Brady’s time in the early going, so that they can then properly evaluate how each player in-house fits with the intended scheme.\n\nSources: The Miami Dolphins are set to hire Bills cornerbacks coach Jahmile Addae in the same role. He’s a veteran secondary coach who spent time in college coaching defensive backs at Miami, Georgia, West Virginia, Minnesota and Arizona.

    "fullText": "The Las Vegas Raiders will interview Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak over the weekend before making a head coach decision, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.\n\nOne source told Fowler that “it’s probably (Kubiak’s) job to lose.”\n\nDenver Broncos offensive pass game coordinator and quarterbacks coach Davis Webb is also a candidate for the Las Vegas job, and it appears that it might be down to Kubiak and Webb. If the Raiders end up hiring Kubiak, Webb will have plenty of offensive coordinator offers.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants all requested OC interviews with Webb, and he will presumably be a candidate for Denver's own OC opening after the team fired Joe Lombardi.\n\nIn addition to Las Vegas, the Arizona Cardinals are also yet to hire a head coach, and Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph is a candidate (but perhaps not the favorite) for that position. Arizona also plans to interview Kubiak this weekend, and he seems to be the top candidate for both openings. If Kubiak ends up with the Raiders, it's possible that Joseph could still be in play for the Cardinals.\n\nMeanwhile, Denver assistant head coach and defensive pass game coordinator Jim Leonhard interviewed for the Los Angeles Chargers' defensive coordinator role before L.A. hired Chris O'Leary. Leonhard is believed to be a top candidate for the Buffalo Bills' DC opening, and the Baltimore Ravens have requested a DC interview with him.\n\nIf Joseph does land the HC job in Arizona, Leonhard would presumably be a top in-house candidate to replace him with the Broncos. As it stands now, though, Joseph does not appear to be the clear favorite for the Cards' job, and Leonhard will have no shortage of suitors with DC openings.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: Denver Broncos: Davis Webb, Vance Joseph and Jim Leonhard updates",

    "description": "Former Lions QB Dan Orlovsky shared a jaw-dropping story about an offensive coordinator falling asleep mid-game during his time in Detroit.",
    "fullText": "Before former Detroit Lions QB Dan Orlovsky became one of ESPN’s most recognizable analysts, he lived through some of the strangest and most painful years in Lions history as a quarterback in Detroit. And during a recent appearance on Unsportsmanlike, he reminded everyone just how surreal that era truly was.\n\nThe conversation turned to how quarterbacks and coaches communicate during games. That’s when Orlovsky casually revealed a moment that feels more like a movie scene than real life.\n\n“We had a couple of coaches, experience-wise, where the coach would call the play into me, I was on the sideline as the backup, and we would relay the play to the starting quarterback,” Orlovsky said. “I don’t know why the mechanism was like that.”\n\nThen came the unbelievable part.\n\n“There was a change of possession. Punt, commercial, we come out of the commercial, the play clock is starting, and I’m waiting for the playcall,” Orlovsky explained. “And all I’m hearing is [snoring]. The coach, our playcaller, our offensive coordinator, fell asleep in the middle of the game and didn’t get a call in.”\n\nYes. Snoring. In the headset. From the offensive coordinator.\n\nOrlovsky didn’t name the coach, but he did hint that it happened during a home game in Detroit. That narrows the list to the offensive coordinators he worked with during his two stints with the team.\n\nFrom 2005–2008, including the infamous 0–16 season, the Lions cycled through:\n\nLater, from 2014–2016, Detroit’s offense was run by:\n\nSomewhere in that group is the coordinator who literally fell asleep while calling plays in an NFL game.\n\nFor longtime fans, the story is both hilarious and painfully familiar. The early-2000s Lions were defined by dysfunction, constant turnover, and moments so bizarre they almost defy belief.\n\nA play-caller nodding off during live action somehow fits right into that chapter of franchise history.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Detroit has since transformed into one of the league’s most stable and respected organizations. But stories like this remain a reminder of just how far the Lions have come — and how wild things once were on the sidelines at Ford Field.\n\nThe post Former Lions QB Says Offensive Coordinator Fell Asleep During the Game appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

Ahead of his season debut, Bruins head coach Marco Sturm sent a clear message to the young forward.\n\n“​I think first of all, he’s got to be himself,” Sturm said pregame on Thursday. “I don’t need to see anything special out of him. I want to see him go up and down, and play really good defensively.\n\n“He is going to play with a guy like (Marat Khusnutdinov) today; he’s going to have his back. Today, he just has to play hockey. That’s going to be the main thing.”\n\nPoitras will draw into the lineup as forward Elias Lindholm is day-to-day with an upper-body injury.\n\nThe 21-year-old forward skated in 33 games last season with the Bruins, recording one goal and 10 assists for 11 points. In the AHL this season, Poitras has eight goals and 16 assists for 24 points in 39 games.\n\nAhead of his return to the NHL, Poitras believes he’s found more confidence in his game and expects to make an impact for the Bruins.\n\n​”I think just simplifying my game,” Poitras said. “Trying to play fast and move my feet. When I simplify my game, the other stuff kind of just takes care of itself.\n\n“I think the mindset was not to kind of sit and wait. For me, it was just go down and not worry about what’s going on up here. Do my thing and worry about where I am.”\n\nPoitras has skated in 66 career NHL games, recording six goals and 20 assists. The Bruins selected Poitras in the second round of the 2022 NHL Draft.\n\nThe Bruins will host the Flyers on Thursday at 7 p.m. ET in their final home game before the Olympic break. Boston will then go play outside on Sunday as the Bruins will take on the Tampa Bay Lightning at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\n\nBruins Believe OT Win Over Predators Shows ‘Character Of The Group’",

There's excitement in the air, but also a sense that Steve Bisciotti and Eric DeCosta's meeting of the minds got this hire right.\n\nThey expressed during Coach Minter's introductory press conference that he was the candidate that they wanted. He echoed a similar sentiment: once the job became available, it was the one that seemed to call to him.\n\nAfter waiting almost a full week to share a conversation, the media were allowed a little over half an hour with him. The expected conversations were addressed: Kyle Hamilton, whether he has spoken with Lamar Jackson, and whether he'll call the defensive plays.\n\nThe next order of business is assembling his staff. Two important questions center around who'll fill the offensive and defensive coordinator roles.

    "description": "Debunking false narratives about one of the most creatives players in world football",
    "fullText": "Coveted by many top European teams before signing with Real Madrid in the summer of 2023 at the age of 18, Arda Güler arrived in Madrid with lofty expectations.  Madrid paid Fenerbahçe approximately €26 million to secure the services of the Turkish phenom at a time when various Barcelona journalists reported he was close to signing with the Catalan club.  Today Transfermarkt values Güler at €90 million, up from €45 million at the start of 2025, an indication of his progression over the last year.\n\nInjuries derailed Güler first season at Madrid, but once healthy he quickly demonstrated his scoring prowess with six goals in La Liga in only 373 minutes, an outrageous goal every 62 minutes on the pitch.  Two years later, Güler is firmly establishing himself as one of the top creative midfielders in Europe.\n\nStarting as a 10 under Xabi Alonso at the Club World Cup before transitioning to a deep-lying playmaker role, Güler has been playing in a more advanced position since the arrival of coach Álvaro Arbeloa.  It was said at times this season that Madrid was expecting too much from Güler – to initiate play from the back, while also producing goals.  That is, be a combination of Toni Kroos and Kevin De Bruyne.  A difficult task for anyone, but especially a player that is still only 20 years of age.\n\nWith little fanfare, the Real Madrid midfielder this past weekend became the leader in La Liga with 52 chances created (key passes, including assists).  That is a title that Xavi Hernández, Mesut Özil, Ángel Di María, Neymar and Lionel Messi, amongst others, have held over the last two decades.  None did so at such a precocious age.\n\nGüler’s superlative passing ability has him currently seoncd in La Liga with seven assists and third in big chances created with nine.  With his assist against Benfica, he also led Champions League midfielders with four assists, tied with Liverpool’s Dominik Szoboszlai.  The Real Madrid midfielder has provided a total of 14 assists since the start of the Club World Cup.  It has largely gone under the radar that among players from the top five European leagues since July in official club competitions, Güler’s 14 assists with Madrid are surpassed only by Michael Olise’s 18 assists with Bayern Munich.\n\nWhat is particularly impressive is that the amount of shot opportunities the Real Madrid midfielder is providing for teammates.  Güler is averaging an exceptional 3.64 chances created per 90 minutes in league play, the highest average for a leader in chances created in La Liga since his compatriot and former teammate Mesut Özil distributed 4.17 key passes/assists per 90 in the 2010/2011 season (see graph below). Also noteworthy is that nearly 35% of the Turkish midfielder’s chances have come through long passes (as defined by Opta).  Güler could become the first Real Madrid player to lead La Liga in chances created since Ángel Di María’s last season at the club over a decade ago. With sufficient playing time in a more advanced role and with Mbappé, Vinicius and Gonzalo all off to a strong 2026, Arda has an outside chance to become the first La Liga player in the last 4 seasons to distribute 100+ key passes in a season.\n\nGüler performances in Champions League play has been no less stellar where he finished the group phase 2nd in chances created with 24, averaging 3.9 per 90.  This season saw him earn his first Player of the Match award in Champions League play vs. Juventus, in what was only his fourth start on Europe’s biggest club competition stage, after distributing six key passes and collecting 10 ball recoveries.  Keep in mind that Pedri earned his first such award last season in his fifth season (25th start in Champions) at Barcelona.\n\nGüler’s partnership with Kylian Mbappé has been especially lethal.  The two have combined to produce 10 goals since the Club World Cup, nine of which were passes from the Turkish phenom to the Frenchman.  That includes six goals in league play, the most goals where two teammates combined to score in the top five European leagues this season.  In limited playing time together, Güler also seems to have developed a strong understanding with Gonzalo García, providing three assists on the Spaniard centre-forward’s goals.\n\nSkeptics point to Güler as being primarily a set-piece specialist who is weak defensively.  There are various data points that negate these false narratives.\n\n36 of 52 of Güler’s key passes in La Liga, over 69%, have come with the ball in play.  That is fifth most in La Liga, trailing only Mbappé (51), Yamal (40), Vinicius (39) and Pedri (38).\n\nDespite his slender build, Güler is a much better defender than what is commonly perceived.\n\nAccording to Statsbomb data, the Turkish midfielder leads Real Madrid in total pressures in La Liga this season with 406 and in counterpressures (pressure immediately after losing possession) with 96.\n\nEarlier this season Statsbomb data indicated that through the first nine weeks of the season, Güler was leading all La Liga players in pressure regains per 90 minutes, indicating his pressures are well-timed.\n\nMany will be surprised to learn Güler is averaging 1.20 successful tackles per 90 minutes in league play, more than Tchouaméni (1.16 per 90) and Valverde (1.09 per 90).\n\nGüler continues to improve as a ball winner. He has had 10 ball recoveries in two (Juventus, Monaco) of the six Champions League matches he started this season, an exceptional amount for anyone, but especially an attacking midfielder. His interception last week on Monaco’s half of the pitch initiated the play that led to his assist for Vinicius’s goal.\n\nPerhaps Arda needs that one special match in a Champions League elimination tie to consecrate himself as the best attacking midfielder in Europe and receive the accolades he deserves.  Don’t be surprised if that occurs this spring.",

    "fullText": "Emma Raducanu has parted ways with coach Francisco Roig after a disappointing start to the 2026 season.\n\nRaducanu brought in Roig after Wimbledon in 2025, but results haven’t improved under Rafael Nadal’s former coach.\n\nShe opened the new campaign with three wins and three losses across the United Cup, Hobart International and Australian Open.\n\nNo replacement has been named yet, though Andy Murray’s name is already being linked to the role once again.\n\nMurray’s name often comes up when discussing potential coaching roles, especially after his brief spell with Novak Djokovic.\n\nHe was even linked to Carlos Alcaraz following the Spaniard’s split from Juan Carlos Ferrero at the end of 2025.\n\nBut Murray has hinted that working with someone closer to home might be more practical, given his current lifestyle. Speaking to The Daily Express in 2025, he explained that it’s not coaching itself that puts him off, but the travel involved.\n\n“It becomes easier because the off weeks, at least you are close to home,” he said last year. “But if it is a player who lives elsewhere, it means a lot of time away from the family, and I have no interest in doing that just now because I don’t want to be away from them.”\n\nThat might not be the only appeal for Murray to come back out of retirement to join Raducanu as an advisor.\n\nRaducanu took part in 22 tournaments in 2025 and has already stated she wants to cut that number back even further in 2026.\n\n“I would say next year I hope to play less than I did this year, but I think also just incorporating into my warm-ups fitness, so it’s not just my fitness sessions which are set for it,” she said to the BBC back in December 2025.\n\nIf Raducanu ends up playing between 15 and 20 events next season, that lighter schedule might suit Murray perfectly if he’s considering a coaching role.\n\nMurray knows exactly what kind of scrutiny comes with being a British player and could offer valuable support on the mental side of the game. The Scot also found his own stride physically around the same age Raducanu is now, making him well-placed to guide her through similar challenges.",

    "title": "WWE Royal Rumble: Ranking 2026's potential winners, from most likely to least likely",
    "description": "Who's most likely to win the 2026 WWE Royal Rumble on Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia? Ranking the top contenders on both the men's and women's side.",
    "fullText": "If last year’s Royal Rumble proved one thing, it’s that predicting the winner can be a fool’s errand. Then again, maybe Jey Uso’s questionable win at WrestleMania 41 is a good argument for why it’s better for WWE to go with more obvious winners rather than trying to swerve us at every turn.\n\nIf that’s the case, then who are the most credible names for potential Rumble winners this time around as the WWE heads to Saudi Arabia? Here are the names I’d pick as plausible winners as the Royal Rumble descends on Riyadh this weekend:\n\nRoman Reigns (Likelihood: 4 out of 5)\n\nComing out of last year’s Survivor Series, “The Tribal Chief” looked like the obvious pick for this year’s Rumble, with big hints that WWE was planning Rhodes vs. Reigns at 'Mania.\n\nThen came the infamous McIntyre swerve earlier this month, and that assumption appeared to go out the window — or at least the first part of it did.\n\nSure, Rhodes might not be champ, but why does that mean Reigns can’t win Saturday? He has the kind of superstar credentials that would surely please the Saudi government, which is spending so heavily on this event. On top of that, a Roman victory could also deliver a second outing for one of the best main events this decade, with Reigns vs. McIntyre II at 'Mania 42.\n\nIn other words, Drew’s shock win may have shaken up the chessboard, but I don’t think it’s dislodged Roman as the man to beat Saturday.\n\nBron Breakker (Likelihood: 3.5 out of 5)\n\nWhat’s that old Paul Heyman catchphrase about predictions and spoilers? By now, most of us have learned to take it with a big pinch of kayfabe salt. But when “The Oracle” referred to Bron Breakker as a “future WrestleMania main eventer” in shoot interviews, the old maxim seemed like less of an exaggeration and more like, well, a spoiler.\n\nSo is there a case for Bron winning this time around and getting his main event right now? No one would argue that Breakker vs. CM Punk II would be an excellent curtain raiser for 'Mania 42. But is the Rumble really the best route for Breakker? Given his absurd levels of badassery, I’d say that the notoriously brutal Elimination Chamber is better suited to give him a statement victory.\n\nAfter all, just imagine seeing one of those famous spears bombing through one of those plexiglass pods. Tell me that wouldn’t make you more excited for WrestleMania.\n\nBrock Lesnar (Likelihood: 3 out of 5)\n\nThat he’s featured in both the WrestleMania poster and teaser trailer suggests that “The Beast Incarnate” will play a big role in this year’s “Showcase of the Immortals.” But the question remains as to what WWE will choose to do with their long-standing man monster and future Hall of Famer.\n\nA slobberknocker with Gunther probably remains the wish-list option for wrestling nerds. But should we be so quick to rule out an old-fashioned world title match? Not only do Brock Lesnar and Drew McIntyre have history, but their previous vendetta (from 2021) felt like one of those stories that had much longer to run. Maybe this could be the moment to tie up some loose ends.\n\nOn the other hand, it would make Lesnar only the third person in history to win three separate Rumbles. He might be a legend of the game, but WWE doesn’t like to throw those kinds of records around like confetti.\n\nOba Femi (Likelihood: 3 out of 5)\n\nThe notion of having an NXT call-up win the Rumble in his first proper main roster appearance should be absurd. But this is Oba Femi we’re talking about. Not only is he perhaps the most physically imposing NXT star in history, but he has already achieved the near unthinkable for a developmental talent: getting a one-on-one with the WWE’s then-undisputed champion during John Cena’s retirement tour.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, an Oba Femi victory would still be a very bold call. But it probably wouldn’t take long for it to start making sense.\n\nLogan Paul (Likelihood: 2.5 out of 5)\n\nFor wrestling purists, it’s the kind of nightmare vision they would have laughed off just a few years ago. Logan Paul? Winning the Royal Rumble in an event paid for by the Saudi government? Unthinkable. But now, while it might still be a provocative scenario, it seems not entirely unlikely.\n\nGiven his incredible athleticism and growing commitment to the squared circle, I’ve long considered a Logan Paul win at the Rumble to be an underpriced scenario. So perhaps this is the year it happens.\n\nWe all know that the current WWE leadership remains head-over-heels for Logan Paul. We can also assume they probably offered a few special perks to get the influencer megastar to agree to a full-time contract. So don’t be too surprised if those two things come to a rather controversial culmination Saturday.\n\nLA Knight (Likelihood: 2 out of 5)\n\nLook, I get it: rooting for an LA Knight world title run can feel like a masochistic pursuit at this point. But weren’t there reports that his recent break from televised shows — the result of a kayfabe beatdown by The Vision — was all a ploy to set up one hell of a babyface comeback?\n\nAdd to that the reports of those LA Knight “Yeah!” signs going up in Riyadh, and you can see why his fans might be tempted to get their hopes up for Saturday.\n\nAll things considered, it remains unlikely. But it would be one hell of a story for \"WWE Unreal\" …\n\nLiv Morgan (Likelihood: 4 out of 5)\n\nIf you thought the men’s picture for 'Mania 42 was uncertain, just take a look at the women’s side of things. Arguably, neither of the two world champions (Stephanie Vaquer and Jade Cargill) has any obvious challengers right now.\n\nSo why is Liv Morgan such a good pick to win the Rumble? That she’s a bona fide superstar is a given by now. But the fact that she was passed over for the big matches at last year’s 'Mania makes me think that 2026 could be her turn to shine. And we know that WWE likes to keep things rotating between different stars in the women’s division.\n\nOn top of all that, a Liv win could finally provide the catalyst to move to the next phase of the Judgment Day storyline and bring all of those long-standing tensions to a boil. Just how long have they been stewing away for now?\n\nBianca Belair (Likelihood: 4 out of 5)\n\nThere’s no way WWE books WrestleMania 42 without Bianca Belair. That’s clear. And if we’re picking potential Rumble winners, then it helps that Belair surely has to be the most logical contender to clash with the current Women’s Champion, Jade Cargill, given that the two of them used to be partners.\n\nIf Belair vs. Cargill is indeed the plan, then Belair has to win either the Rumble or the Chamber. Since she won the latter last year, you’d assume the former is the more likely choice this time around.\n\nThat’s a lot of assumptions, admittedly. But you can’t say that the winds aren't blowing in Belair’s favor.\n\nTiffany Stratton (Likelihood: 3 out of 5\n\nGiven how much has happened since then, it’s easy to forget just how hot WWE was on Tiffany Stratton for much of last year. Having her win the Women’s Championship was just the start of it. She then went on to have the longest singles title run of the year, including scoring massive wins over Charlotte Flair at WrestleMania and Jade Cargill at SummerSlam.\n\nHaving been absent from television since dropping her title, a Tiffy comeback at the Rumble feels like a certainty. And given how highly the WWE thinks of her, I wouldn’t rule out the former NXT champion going on to win the whole thing. What a relaunch that would be.\n\nLyra Valkyria (Likelihood: 2.5 out of 5)\n\nThe second season of \"Unreal\" provided a welcome reminder of just what a barnstorming rookie year Lyra Valkyria delivered in 2025. By now, the Irish youngster is a solid bet for a world title run this decade. And a Rumble win is a tried-and-tested way to make that happen. So why not strike while the iron is hot and have her win in the year of our Lord 2026?\n\nIt would be a surprise outcome, according to the Vegas odds. But you get the sense that most wrestling fans would get behind it.\n\nRhea Ripley (Likelihood: 2.5 out of 5)\n\nWhenever there’s a prize to be had in the women’s division, Rhea Ripley is always a good pick to take it. So could this year’s Rumble mark the great Ripley relaunch, propelling her straight into a goth-vs.-goth title match with Stephanie Vaquer at WrestleMania? That has to be a plausible outcome on Saturday.\n\nOn balance, I still think it’s more likely that we’re getting that WrestleMania showdown between RhIyo and Flair/Bliss — a match that has been teased more than GTA 6 at this point. But the sight of “The Eradicator” winning her second Rumble (putting her level with Charlotte Flair, incidentally) would be one hell of a way to kick off this year’s WrestleMania season.",

With his particular medical treatment, it’s some place pretty soon he gets to just a pain tolerance,” said Pope. “I’d like to make all kinds of jokes on that, but, you know, we’ll see.\n\n“There’s maybe an outside, outside, outside chance that Kam could rejoin us at some point in the season. We’ll see.”\n\nWith that wording, we probably shouldn’t expect Williams to play again this season, and that’s probably the best call. With Kentucky going through so many injuries — for whatever mysterious reason that may be — having foot surgery and then returning within two months sounds far too risky.\n\nHere’s to hoping Williams is able to recover 100%, however long that may take.",

    "description": "The external, artificial-lung system could be used to treat other people who are critically unwell and awaiting transplants.",
    "fullText": "A 33-year-old man survived for 48 hours without his lungs, after a medical team replaced the organs with an external artificial-lung system1 that it developed to keep him alive until he could receive a double lung transplant.\n\nThere have been cases in which people have had their lungs removed and been connected to an external device to maintain oxygen levels. But, the devices used in these cases don’t count as artificial lungs because they do not maintain blood flow across the heart, meaning it cannot function normally, says Ankit Bharat, a thoracic surgeon at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, who helped to develop the artificial system.\n\nBharat says his team’s design is unique because it maintains a balanced and continuous flow of blood to the heart, reducing the risk of blood clots that could trigger a heart attack. The findings were published today in the journal Med.\n\nThe engineering behind the artificial-lung system is remarkable, says Natasha Rogers, a transplant clinician at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia. It is difficult to maintain normal heart function in the absence of lungs, she says. “They were really very brave.”\n\nThe team’s artificial-lung system could be used in other critically unwell people while they become healthy enough to receive lung transplants, she adds.\n\nBefore being placed on the artificial-lung system, the man had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome — an often-life-threatening condition in which the lungs cannot absorb enough oxygen — triggered by the influenza virus. He was then placed on a ventilator but developed a drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The infection caused parts of his lungs to fill with pus, and he went into septic shock, at which point his heart and kidneys began to fail.\n\n“He was so sick, he had a cardiac arrest and he was actively dying,” says Bharat. Because the man was too unwell to receive a lung transplant, the team decided to remove his lungs — the source of the infection.\n\nSurprisingly, the man began to improve quickly. “Within 48 hours, he was off all the medication to support his blood pressure, his kidney function was completely restored and his heart was working normally,” says Bharat. At that point, the man received a double lung transplant and has showed no signs of organ rejection or impaired lung function years later. “We are now approaching almost three years since we did this, and the patient is doing really great,” says Bharat.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00239-y\n\nYan, Y. et al.

    "title": "Multi-Die Assemblies Require More Detailed Test Plan Earlier",
    "description": "Understanding connectivity issues and interactions are only part of the problem; ECOs can cause unexpected problems in other areas.",
    "fullText": "Multi-die assemblies are forcing engineering teams to map out how the various components will function and interact much earlier in the design process, and to develop a detailed plan for how they will be verified and tested.\n\nWhile the “shift left” and “extend right” concepts have been in place for at least the past few years, the level of detail required at the leading edge of design and the amount of data that needs to be considered are exploding. Designs now must include interconnects for chiplets developed at different process nodes, various types of memory, as well as thermal mapping based upon workload-specific gradients, monitors to track aging effects, and much more detailed characterization of hard and soft IP.\n\nThese designs can involve multiple chiplets and some type of interposer or advanced substrate, and there are even some full 3D-ICs in development. Development costs for the most advanced chips may run $100 million or more, so the stakes for ensuring these devices are functioning properly and reliably are significant.\n\n“Designs are getting huge, and if you’re doing billion-gate designs, validating connectivity at RTL becomes important instead of waiting for validating connectivity at the net list, because you cannot load those designs,” said Kiran Vittal, executive director for product management at Synopsys. “Some techniques that are being used today, including ad hoc methods, may not even work on these kinds of designs. The size of the SoC is growing in terms of gate count, in terms of reusing IPs, and there are more and more power and clock domains.”\n\nFig. 1: IP for multi-die test, including embedded memory test, support for IEEE 1838 DFT, and high-speed access and test for intra-die logic test. \n\nAny missteps throughout the flow can snowball, making it imperative to identify and solve problems as early as possible, particularly if there are changes in any part of the design. Any changes on the design side need to be reflected in updates to the design for test plan, which has become increasingly complicated.\n\nNew DFT challenges\n\n“A small change for a functional ECO can impact the DFT,” Vittal said. “This means the changes must be validated at RTL and then taken through the design implementation. Along with that, every design now uses complex DFT structures like test compression, which previously was added at the SoC level. But now the design team is also adding test compression at a block level or a subsystem level. There may be multiple layers of test compression, with connections from the block through the subsystem to the SoC, with numerous new connections within the DFT part.”\n\nThat’s just for starters. “At RTL there are functional DFT issues, such as combinational loops, as well as Shift/Capture mode issues related to the controllability of clocks, resets, and clock gates,” explained Kanwarpal Singh, product engineering group director at Cadence. “There can be additional issues like clock/data intersection, memories not bypassed in test mode, and latches not being transparent.”\n\nThe level of detail required for DFT needs to reflect the massive increases in complexity of these multi-die assemblies. This is made all the more challenging by the fact that all the leads or signal paths may not be accessible to testers, and chiplets and memories may be different heights and shapes. On top of that, many advanced packages are integral parts of the design, and may be highly customized.\n\n“DFT is all about controllability and observability, and to ensure that the design is testable, designers need to make sure test clocks are properly connected, resets are reaching the desired flops, clock gates are enabled/controllable, and test signals are correctly connected to the memories,” Singh said. “Any issues in the connectivity of the DFT logic can lead to design flops becoming non-scannable and loss of test coverage. The RTL stage is the best place to find these issues and fix them. This will save costly iterations later.”\n\nOthers agree. William Wang, CEO of ChipAgents, noted that most DFT failures today are integration failures, and that missing or broken propagation of scan, test, and reset signals across hierarchy, power domains, and reused IP are structural connectivity problems, not synthesis problems. “RTL is the last place where fixes are cheap. After DFT insertion and physical implementation, connectivity bugs cause ECO cascades and schedule slips. Catching them at RTL is the highest ROI point.”\n\nThat’s easier said than done, however. “Test controls, such as scan_enable, test_mode, test clocks, and resets, are not reaching all intended endpoints,” Wang said. “Power-aware DFT bugs where scan paths cross powered-down domains or isolation and retention are not test-safe. There are clock and reset inconsistencies between functional and test modes, and there are wrapper and top-level integration mistakes caused by parameterization and the generation of logic.”\n\nWhat’s the plan?\n\nEngineers may be contending with hundreds of different interface IPs in multi-die designs. “It’s very common nowadays to see a million connections,” Vittal said. “Recently, a customer told us that they have 6 billion connections/nodes that they need to verify at their SoC level. These are the kind of challenges that exist and need to be addressed. The shift left methodology to catch issues upfront at RTL is the best way to address these challenges.”\n\nThat means chip architects must determine where the testing will happen, what will be tested, and how the results will be interpreted.\n\n“The diagnosis part is not too difficult,” noted John Ferguson, senior director of product management at Siemens EDA. “We have some of the standards already in place. And for the most part, if you’re LVS-clean and you’ve designed everything carefully, then from an input pin to an output pin, you can do the diagnosis anywhere within that three-dimensional system. There are some challenges around how to do the physical test. You can put a standalone die or chiplet on a test bench, and if it’s a known-good die, you can put this into the system, and everything’s going to work great. The problem is that when you put it into the system, it’s getting hot, it’s working, it’s being stressed, and it’s not going to behave the same. Now the question is whether it’s within my specs. That’s a whole new question. We need to figure that out.”\n\nHow this gets resolved can vary. “Some companies will do known-good die, known-good stacks, and known-good packages, and they’ll put those together and get it a little bit better,” Ferguson said. “But there’s still a problem. Even if you want to take the whole 3D-IC assembly and say, ‘The whole thing is known-good, and I can use this in whatever I’m putting it into,’ you still have a problem. It’s gone through this manufacturing process where you’ve heated it, and it has warpages. Now I put it on the test bench and probe it, but is it connecting to the right things? Probably not. So now you’ve got a whole new issue. There probably are some ways to do it right. We can do modeling of the warpages, and we can tell you where you may need to have a longer one in this location, and a shorter one in this location. But this still needs to be solved. It’s an outstanding issue.”\n\nFig. 2: DFT challenges in multi-die assemblies. \n\nMore dies equals more potential problems. “One is the performance testing,” said Chris Mueth, senior director of new markets and strategic initiatives at Keysight EDA. “It’s hard to get test points on a chiplet, but following some industry standards, test equipment companies will innovate around that. If you’re looking at how to get to a one-test solution, where you have a magic wand system-level test that will exercise the chip in such a way that you know you have a good assembly, that’s easier said than done. Built-in self-tests are important for these kinds of assemblies because you can’t probe everything. If you’re looking at the structural integrity of the die, which is the main bottleneck, how do you test that? You can test it with a TDR (time domain reflectometer) system, which allows you to peer into the package itself by probing on pins on the package. You can probe and essentially look inside like an X-ray machine, and you can deduce defects inside that package with a TDR system. So that’s one way of doing it. And, of course, the ultimate shift left is to simulate this stuff up front rigorously so that you have fewer concerns about the package integrity on the back end.”\n\nGiven these persistent challenges and the complexity of multi-die testing, design teams must rethink their approach to verification and design-for-test strategies. This is where advanced verification methodologies come into play, bridging the gap between physical and logical testing demands.\n\nIn the verification realm, static and dynamic verification play a role in addressing connectivity challenges. “Static verification can help catch issues early at the RTL stage, saving costly iterations later,” Cadence’s Singh said. “Dynamic simulation can also help check the correctness of the DFT circuitry in the RTL.”\n\nStill, while static checks catch the majority of connectivity bugs, including reachability, completeness, illegal crossings, and constraint mismatches, “dynamic simulation is only effective after static correctness is guaranteed,” said ChipAgent’s Wang. This is why ChipAgents focuses on agent-driven static connectivity reasoning, then recommends minimal dynamic tests.\n\nBuilding a plan\n\nPutting the pieces together in a way that will work for a single workload is a challenge. But building a unique design for an AI data center, for example, is much harder.\n\nStill, there are some common elements. Synopsys’ Vittal pointed to five initial steps that design teams need to take to address these challenges, including:\n\nOther steps then need to follow. “Chip architects/designers need to be aware that ensuring proper connectivity of the test clocks/resets and other DFT logic helps make the design scan ready and helps with test coverage goals,” Cadence’s Singh said. “This means they need to plan for DFT at the very beginning and perform connectivity checks at the RTL stage to save on costly iterations later in the design cycle.”\n\nAnd they need to approach it as part of the design, before it is sent to manufacturing. ChipAgents’ Wang said design teams should treat DFT connectivity as an interface contract, not a post-RTL script problem, as well as run connectivity checks continuously in CI, not once before tapeout. “Also, use power-aware and hierarchy-aware static analysis at RTL, and align DFT checks with functional connectivity, since many bugs affect both.”\n\nConclusion\n\nEarly and robust verification methodologies are essential for managing the complexity of modern chiplet and multi-die designs, with static verification at the RTL stage catching most connectivity and DFT issues before costly downstream errors occur. Scalable, design-agnostic tools and continuous connectivity checks — supported by features like schematic visualization and reusable macros — enable efficient debugging and adaptation across frequent design changes.\n\nThe goal is to understand where the problems are, and to address them as quickly as possible. “Using static tools can help catch DFT connectivity issues early at the RTL stage,” Singh added. “These checks can be done at all levels — IP, sub-system, and SoC. And having a full connectivity map of the DFT signals can help with scan chain insertion and test sign-off later.”\n\nRelated Reading\n\nWhen To Move To Multi-Die Assemblies\n\nMultiple factors are involved in deciding when and whether to disaggregate a planar SoC.",

    "title": "Is that allowed? Authentication and authorization in Model Context Protocol",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Model Context Protocol (MCP), released in late 2024, is an emerging standard for communication between AI agents and services used to complete tasks.\n\nYeah, I find it a bit spooky too.\n\nAn MCP server is similar to a REST API: it offers standardized remote access to resources, data, and functionality.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn about how to protect MCP servers from unauthorized access and how authentication of MCP clients to MCP servers works. Both users of MCP servers and those who build them will benefit from a deeper understanding of this authentication layer.\n\nThis article assumes you are familiar with the basics of MCP, otherwise you might want to review the MCP specification or this introductory article.\n\nThere have been a few versions of MCP, but the three that relevant to authorization are:\n\nIf you are building MCP servers, make sure you understand which version your clients support since that affects the capabilities you can offer. This article focuses on the 2025-11-25 specification, with occasional information about the more widely implemented 2025-06-18 version.\n\nIf you are reading this more than a few months into 2026, check the latest version of the specification and ensure you understand any changes.\n\nWhat is the current status of authentication and authorization in MCP? These occur at the transport layer. There are currently two supported transport technologies:\n\nLet’s take a look at each of these, and how authentication happens.\n\nThis transport runs the MCP server as a local process. These are also called “local” MCP servers. All communication takes place over standard input and standard output.\n\nWhen you pipe a request to curl, you are usually implicitly authenticated. Similarly, with the stdio transport, no authentication between the MCP client and MCP server is required. The MCP server is started as a subprocess of the MCP client.\n\nEnvironment variables configure the MCP server. For example, you can set an environment variable with the value of an endpoint URL to the server. The server then can use that environment variable at startup to connect to the correct service endpoint. Environment variables are perfect for configuration during the MCP server boot up process. While data can be passed, no explicit authentication takes place between the MCP client and the MCP server.\n\nYou can manage the authorization process of services behind the MCP server by providing environment variables. If the MCP server supports it, you can add an API key environment variable. The MCP server can use this variable to connect to backend services, which can limit functionality and data based on the API key. The specifics of this authorization process vary by MCP server.\n\nJust like a curl request can be authenticated using basic auth, an API key, or an OAuth token, the request between the MCP server and the APIs or services it relies upon can be authenticated in the same way.\n\nThe exact mechanism for authentication and authorization for requests made by an MCP server is outside the scope of the MCP specification. But you darn well need one. We’ll talk more about this issue below.\n\nWe won't discuss the stdio transport again, since most of the authentication complexity occurs when you have a remote MCP server using the streamable HTTP transport. Let’s take a look at that transport next.\n\nThis transport, introduced in the 2025-06-18 specification, uses the OAuth 2.1 protocol and other standards-based solutions to authenticate and authorize MCP clients. MCP servers that use this transport are called remote MCP servers, whether the MCP server lives on localhost, a private URL or a public URL.\n\nHowever, you can have a remote MCP server that requires no authentication or authorization. An example of this is the context7 MCP servers. These are remote MCP servers, but because they surface documentation and are read-only, they don’t require any verification of the MCP client. Such MCP servers are in the minority, though.\n\nMost MCP servers allow MCP clients to take action, and therefore need to know who the MCP client is and what it can do.\n\nFor such MCP servers, you use an OAuth flow. To use the OAuth terms:\n\nThe authorization server is responsible for authenticating the MCP client, getting end user consent for the actions it is going to take, and issuing a token to the client. The client then presents the token to the MCP server, which validates it to ensure the client is authenticated and authorized. Per the MCP specification, the authorization process is an optional recommendation, but remote servers are strongly recommended to implement it.\n\nWe’ll dig into this OAuth process a lot more below.\n\nFor completeness, SSE is another transport which supports remote servers. It was deprecated in the 2025-06-18 specification and should not be used. It was replaced by Streamable HTTP.\n\nAs mentioned above, no matter what kind of communication protocol you are using to communicate from the MCP client to the MCP server, the question of authentication and authorization from the MCP server remains.\n\nBecause this logic is organization specific, it is difficult to give general guidance. An MCP server that is accessing a database will have different authentication and authorization logic than one that is accessing a REST API.\n\nPlan to leverage whatever authentication and authorization solution that protected the data, functionality, or service before you created an MCP server.\n\nHowever, it is important to avoid treating the MCP server as a monolithic entity. The MCP server is acting on behalf of the MCP client, and that information should be part of any authorization or authentication decisions.\n\nAn MCP server fielding a request from an MCP client that an admin user is using should have different capabilities than one from a non-admin user, for example, and that information needs to filter down to the requests the MCP server is making.\n\nHow to implement this depends on the authentication and authorization schemes you implement. When using the Streamable HTTP transport, Token Exchange is a good standards-based choice if the resources behind the MCP server expect OAuth tokens.\n\nIn this case, the MCP server provides the token used to authenticate the MCP client to an authorization server along with information about the downstream resource. The authorization server then can mint a new token which includes information about:\n\nThis token can be provided to the downstream resource which can validate it and allow data access based on all the attributes.\n\nThere are other solutions out there for ensuring the requests the MCP server makes on the MCP client's behalf are correct, but definitely choose one. If you choose a different approach, the MCP specification prohibits passing through tokens.\n\nAs mentioned above, with remote servers, MCP authentication uses the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code grant and several related standards. Any further references to an MCP server in this post refer to remote MCP servers.\n\nThe flow starts with an unauthenticated MCP client such as Cursor or Claude Code. It ends with the MCP client having possession of an OAuth access token and presenting the token to the MCP server to gain access to data and functionality provided by it.\n\nConfusingly, the term “client” can refer both to the MCP client and an OAuth client, but in the rest of this doc, I’ll be referring to the OAuth client unless otherwise specified. Let's walk through each of these steps in this diagram in more detail.\n\nIn step 1, an unauthenticated MCP client attempts to connect to an MCP server. The MCP server doesn't accept this request, and returns a 401 pointing to metadata. This metadata is defined by RFC 9728 and contains a list of at least one authorization server that can be used to authenticate the MCP client.\n\nHere's an example response to the unauthenticated request:\n\nThe https://resource.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource URL is hosted at the MCP server. The values in it basically tell the MCP client “these are the authorization servers I trust”.\n\nHere's an example of the response:\n\nAs an implementation detail, the MCP client can choose any one of these authorization servers. Above, there are two possible authorization servers that can be used to gain access to this MCP server. However, having multiple authorization servers is pretty rare at present and is usually only used for resiliency by having multiple DNS aliases.\n\nThe MCP client then retrieves metadata from the authorization server, as specified by RFC 8414 or OIDC Discovery. This metadata contains how the MCP client can communicate with the authorization server. This includes:\n\nHere's an example of authorization server metadata.\n\nNow that the MCP client knows the authorization server trusted by the MCP server, the client may need to register itself with the authorization server. There are four options. In preferred order, they are:\n\nDynamic client registration was, until the 2025-11-25 specification, the primary way to register clients. Let’s see what that looks like.\n\nIt does so using the registration_endpoint and functionality defined under RFC 7591. The MCP client provides information about itself and the desired redirect URI.\n\nHere's an example client registration request:\n\nThe MCP client must be prepared to handle the OAuth 2.1 authorization code, created during the Authorization Code grant. This code is delivered to the redirect URIs, which must be either https URLs or point to localhost.\n\nThe scopes requested are what this client might request from the user, not the actual scopes requested. That happens later.\n\nDynamic client registration is not required by the latest specification. It has been left in mainly for backwards compatibility and will likely be replaced by client ID metadata registration as the latest specification is implemented.\n\nClient ID metadata registration allows clients to provide a URL to the authorization server, which then retrieves the metadata from that URL. This is a simpler option, but is not as widely supported.\n\nBut if you know every MCP client that needs to talk to your MCP server, you don't need to implement it; just pre-register your clients. This might happen if you are in a controlled environment with a fixed audience of MCP clients.\n\nWhat you want to avoid is multiple MCP clients sharing the same OAuth client ID. If this were true, it'd be impossible to distinguish between different MCP clients. Additionally, authentication and scopes could be cached leading to clients seeing each other's data.\n\nAt this point the authorization server knows about the MCP client. Huzzah!\n\nNow, the MCP client is starting the authorization code grant. This is outlined in excruciating detail in this blog post I wrote in 2022. That post outlines the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant, which is very similar to the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code grant required by the MCP specification.\n\nThe following differences, however, are required by either the OAuth 2.1 specification or the MCP specification:\n\nHere's an example of the authorization URL that begins the authorization code grant.\n\nMany MCP clients also use the refresh grant to enable for transparent refresh of expired access tokens. We’ll talk about this more below.\n\nAt the end of a successful authorization, the MCP client has an access token and possibly a refresh token.\n\nThe MCP client now makes the same request it made initially, but with a valid access token. It must include the token in the Authorization field like so:\n\nAuthorization: Bearer <access-token>\n\nWhen the server receives the access token, it must validate the access token. How exactly to do so depends on the authorization server and the resource server, so consult your authorization server’s documentation.\n\nIf the access token is a signed JSON web token, which is a common format, ensure the token:\n\nIf the access token can’t be validated, the MCP server should fail the request with a 401 status code.\n\nIf the client requests an operation and the access token does not contain the required scopes for that operation, the MCP server should negotiate for an increase in scope.\n\nThis is called step-up authorization and is new in the 2025-11-25 specification.\n\nIn this process, the MCP server responds with a 403 and a header that contains error messages and the new list of required scopes. The MCP client can then repeat the authorization steps, including possible user consent requests and then try to make the previously blocked request.\n\nUnless you are writing an MCP client, you shouldn’t care too much about storing the token, since doing so should be handled properly by that component.\n\nThe access token delivered to the MCP client should be stored securely, similarly to any other bearer token. As a reminder, a bearer token is similar to a car key; anyone who has it can use it to access resources, so it should be treated carefully.\n\nNever send the token as a URL query parameter and never store it where it might be stolen. The best place to store an access token depends on what kind of software an MCP client is.\n\nThe access token should have a short lifetime to mitigate risk if it should be stolen, inadvertently revealed, or logged.\n\nAs mentioned above, MCP clients can request a refresh token in the initial authorization process, typically by providing a certain parameter in the initial authorization request. The MCP client should store the refresh token just as securely as the access token.\n\nWhen the access token expires or is invalid, instead of sending the user through the entire authorization flow again, the MCP client can:\n\nA refresh grant doesn’t have to take place only when an access token expires; the client can pre-emptively refresh the token.\n\nThe refresh grant can also decrease the scope of the access token, though client support for this may be spotty. For example, if an MCP client no longer needs the mcp:write scope, it could make a refresh request omitting that scope; the returned access token would then not have it.\n\nThe OAuth 2.1 authentication flow discussed handles situations where an end user wants to grant access to data or functionality guarded by an MCP server. If I wanted to allow Claude desktop access to my Gmail email account, that kind of flow suffices.\n\nBut what about agents or other software constructs acting on their own behalf? Or even a script running in a cron job? Can they use MCP?\n\nThey can, but the behavior has changed over time. The client credentials grant was mentioned in the 2025-03-26 version of MCP, was removed and now is coming back. There is a draft extension discussing the client credentials grant. The core MCP specification is intentionally silent on server-to-server auth to allow for implementation simplicity.\n\nGoogle’s robust agent to agent (A2A) protocol offers more focus on this aspect.\n\nIf you use the OAuth client credentials grant, you obtain an access token just as you can one obtained through a OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code grant. The token can then be presented directly to the MCP server and go through the same validation process.\n\nThese tokens shouldn’t be used for any other purpose than to allow access to an MCP server. However, to minimize risk of token misuse, the authorization server should have a set of scopes used for the OAuth clients that correspond to MCP clients.\n\nThese should be different from any used for other purposes, such as a third-party API, but there is no requirement for this. In the examples above, you may have noticed that the scopes had the mcp: prefix on them.\n\nScope design is complex and business specific, but to sum it up briefly, you should:\n\nFor the scope values themselves, you need to balance:\n\nUnlike with APIs, where the software clients are difficult to upgrade, in MCP, the scopes are controlled by the resource server and provided in the initial WWW-Authenticate header. They are dynamically retrieved.\n\nIf you have existing APIs that your MCP server is using, you can re-use much of the design, though MCP scopes should be broader. Just make sure you create a separate set of strings, though.\n\nWhen you are building your remote MCP server, you should use the MCP inspector, which can handle both the OAuth flows and the interaction with your MCP server.\n\nIf you run into OAuth trouble, you can test the functionality with any OAuth compatible client. Using a tool like Postman or curl ensures you have the basics correct and adhere to the specification.\n\nMaking requests against an MCP server with a valid access token also allows for a tight testing loop. You can also set up automated tests to make sure your MCP server’s authentication process remains unchanged as you evolve it.\n\nNext test with a variety of MCP clients that you expect to be used with your server. There are subtle differences between each client.\n\nDebugging MCP is complex, since there are a number of different components in a successful request. The MCP Inspector is the go-to here as well.\n\nWhat are some of the current limits and future directions for MCP, especially with respect to authentication and authorization?\n\nAs mentioned above, one piece of authorization not well defined is how the MCP server interacts with the services and APIs which fulfill the MCP client’s needs. There is a security section in the specification which offers some guidance around token passthrough, stating “MCP servers MUST NOT accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server”, but that’s about it. As mentioned above, this kind of authorization is super business-specific but requires your attention.\n\nThere is also complexity around the dynamic client registration. While there is an RFC detailing how to manage or delete dynamic clients, it is not widely supported. This means there is an open question about how to manage or remove the OAuth client configurations that have been added on behalf of the MCP clients.\n\nAs mentioned above, there is another draft specification, client ID metadata, which makes registering OAuth clients at the authorization server simpler. This makes the OAuth client registration process easier by tying client metadata to a URL rather than requiring the dynamic client registration process. It also eases the server-side burden, since the client exists only when the metadata retrieval succeeds.\n\nThere’s also been discussion on whether or not OAuth is the right solution for authorization of MCP clients. This was discussed in depth in this issue, but the issue was closed and won’t be implemented.\n\nSometimes scopes don’t give enough granularity for what the MCP client wants to ask of the MCP server. The community has discussed adding Rich Authorization Requests to the MCP protocol. This standard allows for more fine grained authorization requests.\n\nThere’s a proposal to allow for generic extensions, such as the client credentials extension mentioned above, of which some will be authentication or authorization related. This is still a proposal. Whenever you have extensions, you gain flexibility at the expense of complexity and interoperability, so we’ll see where this proposal goes.\n\nThere’s another interesting draft extension which allows the MCP client to get tokens without the OAuth redirect. This simplifies certain enterprise scenarios.\n\nYou can review the proposals targeted for future MCP specification releases as they are added. Since the 2025-11-25 specification was recently released, there are no active projects at that link at the time of writing.\n\nThere are a wide variety of organizations and individuals involved in this protocol, from the model vendors like Anthropic, to AI agent identity vendors like Prefactor, to representatives of more traditional identity providers like Okta and Stytch. There are a couple of ways to get involved in the authentication aspects of MCP:\n\nMCP is key to making AI solutions useful. Since it extends these programs’ reach to other software systems, it is critical that such access be secure. The two different transports have different threat models and security implications, but both allow for authentication and authorization.\n\nBecause MCP servers are hosted and therefore more accessible to other systems, they have different security needs. Leveraging OAuth and the lessons learned from over a decade of securing APIs and services help meet those needs.\n\nIf you are interested in securing your MCP server, first consider whether it needs to be local or remote. If the latter, ensure you are handling the critical flows, setting up your scopes correctly, and following the provided security guidance.\n\nThink about joining the MCP community as they continue to push the protocol forward, whether by commenting on GitHub issues or joining the various groups.\n\nThank you to Simon Russell for review and feedback.",

    "description": "Coval is the leading simulation and evaluation platform for AI voice and chat agents. Test, monitor, and optimize your AI agents at scale.",
    "fullText": "Why are production voice agents still running on 18-month-old models? Why is instruction following the hardest problem to benchmark? And what's actually missing from voice AI evaluation today? We sat down with two of the sharpest minds in the space to find out.\n\nAs part of our State of Voice AI 2026 research, we brought together Kwindla Hultman Kramer, co-founder of Daily and creator of the open-source PipeCat framework, and Zach Koch, co-founder and CEO of Ultravox AI, which trains real-time speech-native models. The conversation that followed was one of the most candid discussions we've had about what's actually working in voice AI evaluation—and what's still broken.\n\nCheck out the full episode here:\n\nKwin recently published something the voice AI community has desperately needed: a public benchmark for instruction following and function calling in long, multi-turn conversations.\n\n\"I wanted to publish something that people could criticize and try to help make better,\" Kwin explained. \"We all have kind of tests and vibes that we do internally, but I wanted something that reflects the hard workloads in voice AI—instruction following, function calling reliability, turn-taking reliability.\"\n\nThe benchmark simulates a real-world voice AI scenario: knowledge dumped into a system prompt, tools that need to be called, and a 30-turn conversation that tests whether the model can maintain coherent behavior deep into the dialogue.\n\nWhat surprised Kwin most? The frontier models saturated it.\n\n\"GPT-5, the latest Claude, Gemini 3—they all saturated what I thought was a really hard benchmark. But here's the thing: they're all too slow to use for a voice agent.\"\n\nThis is the central tension in voice AI today: the smartest models are too slow, and the fast models aren't smart enough.\n\nHere's a reality check that might surprise people outside the voice AI space: most production voice agents are still running on GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash—models that are now a year and a half old.\n\n\"Those are the models that have the right mix of intelligence and latency,\" Kwin noted. \"And because people have gotten prompts optimized for them, they're pretty safe choices that a lot of people are sticking with.\"\n\nBut it's not just about capability. Switching models in voice AI is uniquely painful.\n\n\"It's so tricky to switch models,\" I explained during our conversation. \"You have so many models in concert together—you're not just seeing if it performs as expected with your prompts, but how it interacts with all the other models. And the testing is much more expensive. The eval process is often very manual.\"\n\nThis creates a vicious cycle: teams stick with older models because evaluation is hard, which means newer models don't get battle-tested, which means teams stick with older models.\n\nWe spend a lot of time at Coval thinking about what makes voice AI evaluation uniquely difficult. Instruction following is, without question, the hardest piece.\n\nWhy? Because you can't just run the same prompt across different models and call it a fair comparison.\n\n\"Different prompts do well on different systems,\" I explained. \"What people actually want to know is: what's the best I can get out of each system? It's not useful to compare something out of the box if there's an obvious optimization.\"\n\nThis is why benchmarks like Kwin's are so valuable—they help you rough-cut which models to even consider, before you invest in the expensive work of testing on your specific data and use case.\n\nBut there's a deeper problem. Traditional benchmarks test the first few turns of a conversation. Voice AI conversations are fundamentally long, multi-turn interactions—and that data is massively underrepresented in training datasets.\n\n\"I would talk to people at foundation labs and they'd say, 'We fixed function calling,'\" Kwin recalled. \"And function calling on the first three turns would be noticeably better. But function calling 20 turns into the conversation? No better at all.\"\n\nOne of the most honest moments in our conversation came when Zach admitted something many AI practitioners secretly believe:\n\n\"I'm a king of vibes. I haven't figured out any benchmark that I trust fully more than putting in my AirPods and talking to the models for 20 minutes. Nothing is quite as brutal as that test.\"\n\nBut Kwin pushed back—gently—on the idea that vibes are enough:\n\n\"For the purpose of this conversation, I'm going to pretend to disagree. The pain point I see is: I got this prompt right, the 20 people at our company tested it and had a good experience, but then I put it in production and people did weird things and it's not good enough.\"\n\nThis is the gap that quantitative evaluation fills. It's not about capturing the entire space of what makes a conversation feel good. It's about drawing a box around expected behavior so you can tell which models are clearly inside the box and which aren't.\n\n\"If you can draw a box and say this model is clearly in the box, this model is not—that's a useful point of comparison for what it feels like to deploy these things into production with a wide variety of real-world user behavior.\"\n\nWhen I asked Zach what's still not captured in benchmarks, his answer was illuminating:\n\nBack-channeling. Those little \"mm-hmm\" and \"uh-huh\" moments that humans do perfectly and AI does awkwardly—or not at all.\n\n\"Any attempt to back-channel as a system-level thing has failed catastrophically,\" Zach said. \"They're either exactly correct and on the mark, or they're awkward. And we have no evals for this.\"\n\nProsody matching. The way your tone affects my response, and vice versa.\n\n\"If I say something in a particular tone, the interpretation of that tone should change how you respond—not just the words, but your prosody. My anger might induce your anger, or slow you down. We have no mechanisms to measure any of this.\"\n\nThe \"one beat off\" problem. The uncanny valley of voice AI isn't about obviously wrong responses—it's about timing that's slightly off.\n\n\"Capturing what makes it really unnatural—things are out of order, or it's repeating itself, or getting stuck in loops—those we can catch,\" I noted. \"But when it's just one beat off? That's the hardest to get.\"\n\nOne of the most interesting threads in our conversation was about how production voice AI is evolving toward multi-model architectures.\n\n\"We're increasingly living in a world where multiple models and multiple inference loops are really valuable,\" Kwin explained. \"A lot of what we're helping customers deploy now feels like a thinking fast and slow split—a fast voice loop, and then various kinds of async or long-running or parallel inference processes.\"\n\nGuardrails running in parallel (though by the time a guardrail kicks in, you may have already moved past the moment)\n\nTool calling pulled out of the fast loop to avoid latency penalties\n\nLong-running processes that inject back into the voice context\n\nBut this creates new evaluation challenges. As Zach pointed out: \"The evals can mislead me when I look at them, because you get this boost from thinking performance that helps tool calling, but when I have the actual conversation, it feels awkward.\"\n\nThe text-based evaluation might look accurate, but the user experience of two AI brains trying to coordinate can feel disjointed.\n\nOne pattern we're seeing—and warning customers about—is trying to reuse the same agents for chat and voice.\n\n\"This is where people are running into a lot of issues,\" I explained. \"What you want to see in chat looks very different than what you want to hear in a voice system. You're trying to use the same reasoning for two very different systems, and it just doesn't work.\"\n\nThe benchmarks might say your instruction following is great. But when you add all the layers of abstraction to retrofit a chat agent for voice, the real-world performance falls apart.\n\nWe ended the conversation with what might be the most important takeaway for anyone building with voice AI:\n\nShare your problems with your vendors.\n\n\"Everyone is trying to figure it out right now,\" I said. \"Hearing from users about what's working and what's not is the biggest signal above all else. We learn so much from our customers.\"\n\nZach agreed: \"We'd give ourselves a high five on some model performance eval, and then I'd throw it to a customer and they'd be like: garbage, garbage, garbage. There's a gap in our methodology—and we made a lot of mistakes in 2025 training without keeping that applied reality in mind.\"\n\nThe voice AI space is moving fast, but it's still early. The benchmarks are getting better. The models are getting better. But the feedback loop between real production pain and model improvement is still the most valuable signal any of us have.\n\nFrontier models saturate hard benchmarks but are too slow for production. The intelligence-latency trade-off is the defining constraint of voice AI in 2026.\n\nMost production systems still run 18-month-old models because switching is expensive and evaluation is hard.\n\nInstruction following is the hardest problem to benchmark because different prompting techniques work for different models, and voice conversations are long multi-turn interactions that training data doesn't represent well.\n\nWhat's missing from benchmarks: back-channeling, prosody matching, and the subtle timing issues that make conversations feel \"one beat off.\"\n\nMulti-model \"thinking fast and slow\" architectures are emerging, but they create new evaluation challenges around coordination and user experience.\n\nDon't reuse chat agents for voice. The systems require fundamentally different reasoning and evaluation approaches.\n\nShare your production problems.

The company announced its impressive-looking Genie 3 model last year, but it was only available as “a limited research preview” at the time. Project Genie, which will be rolling out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US starting today, will be the first opportunity for more people to actually try out what Genie 3 is capable of.\n\nGoogle is releasing Project Genie now partly because it wants to see how people use it. “It’s really for us to actually learn about new use cases that we hadn’t thought about,” Diego Rivas, a product manager at Google DeepMind, tells The Verge. The company is already excited about how Genie could help to visualize scenes for filmmaking or for interactive educational media. You could, if you wanted, take a photo of your kids’ favorite toy and use it to prompt a Genie-generated world. Genie could potentially help robots navigate the real world, too. But Project Genie isn’t yet an “end-to-end product that we expect people to just use every day,” stressed Shlomi Fruchter, a Google DeepMind research director.\n\nWith Project Genie, you pick from a bunch of worlds designed by Google or define prompts for the environments and characters you want to create in your own world. After a brief wait, Genie first generates a thumbnail, then you can have it generate the world. You can explore each generated world for 60 seconds, and each has a resolution of about 720p and a frame rate of about 24fps. While you’re in one, you can (typically) move your character with the WASD keys, jump or go higher with a tap of your space bar, and turn the camera with arrow keys.\n\nOne of Google’s worlds, called “Rollerball,” features a blue orb in a white, snowy world, and as you roll around, the orb leaves a trail of paint behind it. As a “game,” Project Genie wasn’t great. There was nothing to do but roll around; there weren’t any objectives or goals. There was no sound. There was frustrating input lag that was even worse than what I sometimes experience with cloud gaming. (Some of this could be due to the generally poor Wi-Fi I get in my office.)\n\nOver the course of the 60-second experience, Genie sometimes forgot to show a paint streak where I had previously rolled. Occasionally, the ball would randomly stop laying down paint at all. So I started to distrust Genie’s ability to recall what I had already seen with my own eyes.\n\nAnother Google-designed world, “Backyard Racetrack,” was a little more fun because there was an actual track to follow. My racing lines were awful — the input lag didn’t help — but I enjoyed trying to make the turns and stay on the road. Near the end of the experience, though, part of the track unexpectedly turned into grass, which ruined the immersion. And the wheel rims looked really janky.\n\nI had a lot more fun pushing the limits of Project Genie to try and make 3D, AI-generated games featuring recognizable characters, like with my Super Mario, Metroid Prime, and The Legend of Zelda-themed worlds. While they made me laugh, the worlds don’t have scores or anything to strive for, so there’s nothing to do but walk or jump around. Even if there were specific things to do, the input lag made the worlds basically unplayable. (Again, this may be a Wi-Fi issue, but even when I was closer to my router, I still experienced lag.)\n\nI wasn’t able to make everything I wanted. Project Genie wouldn’t generate a world that I prompted with the scenario of Kingdom Hearts — here was my prompt, if you’re curious:\n\nIt’s a world filled with Disney characters with a steampunk vibe. Donald and Goofy are your sidekicks. Jack Skellington is present, as is Cloud Strife.\n\nYou are a spunky, anime teenager with spiky brown hair wielding a blade that is like a key.\n\nWhen I removed the specific names of characters and wrote descriptions of them instead, Project Genie generated a thumbnail preview of the world featuring characters that were dead ringers for Sora (the series’ protagonist), Donald, Goofy, Jack Skellington, and Cloud. But when I tried to generate the actual experience, Project Genie blocked me.\n\nI asked about why I was able to generate worlds with Nintendo characters. “Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides,” Rivas says. “As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback.” Rivas also notes that the Genie 3 model was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web.” (This probably partially explains why Link deployed his paraglider in my test, which surprised me. At a high level, the Genie model is constantly trying to predict the next frame, and I’m sure there are many videos of people jumping in Breath of the Wild and then gliding forward, which the model probably learned from.) Shortly before publishing this article, Project Genie stopped letting me generate worlds based on Super Mario 64 due to “interests of third-party content providers.”\n\nAssuming Google clamps down on the ability to generate interactive worlds based on known gaming franchises — I can’t imagine Nintendo will be happy with what I was able to generate! — Project Genie otherwise isn’t that great at the moment. The input lag and 60-second limit make them pretty poor interactive experiences. Occasionally, I couldn’t control my character at all, only the camera. After the weirdness with the paint stripes and the road turning into grass, I had a general feeling that I couldn’t trust the worlds to stay consistent from moment to moment.\n\nProject Genie is better than some AI-generated worlds I tried last year, but it’s still much worse than an actual handcrafted video game or interactive experience. Fruchter described a potential future where the line blurs between different kinds of media thanks to technology like Genie, but I think it has a long way to go to get there.\n\nPerhaps my standards are too high. Project Genie is an experimental research prototype, after all. And maybe I’ll feel differently after the technology improves down the line. But I can’t imagine that people will want to spend an extended period of time jumping into these types of AI-generated worlds anytime soon. With world models, I don’t think we have to worry about the genie being out of the bottle just yet.",

    "description": "Together with Zed, we've launched the official ACP Registry: a directory of AI coding agents, integrated directly into JetBrains IDEs.",
    "fullText": "Supercharge your tools with AI-powered features inside many JetBrains products\n\nAI coding agents are multiplying fast. Some of the most common ones include Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Auggie, OpenCode, and Copilot, and more are being released every day. Each comes with its own unique strengths, specific setups, and varying levels of editor support. Keeping track of what’s out there, let alone getting it running in your IDE, hasn’t been easy.\n\nTogether with Zed (Zed’s announcement), we’ve launched the official ACP Agent Registry: a directory of AI coding agents, integrated directly into JetBrains IDEs and Zed. Browse what’s available, click Install, and start working right away. This beta release is just the beginning.\n\nThe Agent Client Protocol is an open standard that lets any AI coding agent work in any supporting editor. Think of it like the Language Server Protocol, but for AI agents. The LSP lets any editor support any language through a shared standard. The ACP does the same for coding agents. You only need to implement it once, and then it will work in your JetBrains IDE, Zed, or any other editor that supports the protocol.\n\nThis means you get to pick your preferred agent and editor, and they will then work together seamlessly – no vendor lock-in and no waiting for someone to build a specific integration.\n\nACP has been, since we started integrating it to Mistral Vibe, a real joy to use: thoughtfully designed from the ground up, community-driven, and evolving rapidly. We’ve found it not only simplifies integration, but also fits our focus on open and flexible tools. It’s really great to see a standard that puts developer choice first.\n\nMichel Thomazo, Software Engineer @ Mistral AI\n\nThe ACP made agent interoperability technically possible. The registry makes it convenient.\n\nInstead of manually configuring agents, you can now:\n\nAt launch, you’ll find a wide array of different agents:\n\nFull-featured coding assistant optimized for large-scale refactors\n\nSpecialized agent for automated code generation workflows\n\nGoogle’s agent with deep codebase understanding and multimodal capabilities\n\nGitHub’s AI pair programmer, now available via the ACP\n\nLightweight, fast agent built on Mistral’s models\n\nCommunity-driven, fully open-source agent\n\nAlibaba’s coding agent with strong multilingual support\n\nInnovation in software agents is moving at an unbelievable pace. The Agent Registry and ACP makes it simple for developers to use the best agents in their favorite tools.\n\nChris Kelly, Product @ Augment Code\n\nIn general, it’s less about having multiple agents than about enabling you to pick and choose the ones that work well in your workflow. Different agents come with different benefits. Some provide a more attractive pricing structure for your business, some provide a user experience that you simply enjoy more than others’, and some embody the ideas of open-source development that just resonate with you.\n\nThe Agent Client Protocol registry lets you experiment freely. Try a few, see what clicks for your workflow, and then keep the ones that help. You’re not locked into a single vendor’s vision of what AI-assisted development should look like.\n\nWe’re excited to support the ACP Agent Registry as a step toward a more open agent ecosystem where Droids can integrate seamlessly across all IDEs.\n\nFrancesca LaBianca, VP of Operations @ Factory\n\nIn any JetBrains IDE (2025.3.2+) with JetBrains AI (253.30387.147):\n\nThat’s it. The agent is configured and ready to use in the AI Chat tool window.\n\nQuick note: agents typically come with their own subscription. That’s between you and them. You won’t need a JetBrains AI subscription to use ACP agents.\n\nWant to try something concrete? Install OpenCode, open a project, and ask it to explain an unfamiliar module. OpenCode also lets you swap between different LLMs, so you can experiment with what works best for you.\n\nIf you prefer manual configuration, that option is still there, too. Just edit the acp.json directly. This is useful for agents that aren’t in the registry yet or for custom setups.\n\nIf you’re building an ACP-compatible agent, the registry is now the fastest way to reach developers across JetBrains IDEs and Zed.\n\nHead to the ACP Registry repository and check out the CONTRIBUTING.md for the full submission process and metadata requirements. Please note that, for now, we are only featuring agents that support Agent Auth or Terminal Auth. Full details of requirements and conditions can be found here.\n\nThis is an open registry. If you’re building an ACP-compatible agent, you’re welcome to submit it. The registry exists to serve the ecosystem, not to gatekeep it.\n\nFor developers: More choice and zero lock-in. Use any agent you want in the IDE you love.\n\nFor agent builders: Instant distribution to millions of JetBrains and Zed users. Implement the ACP once and reach everyone.\n\nFor the ecosystem: Competition on quality, not on who controls the integration. The best agents win because they’re the best, not because they have exclusive deals.\n\nWe’re building this openly with Zed because we believe AI-assisted development shouldn’t be locked inside any single vendor’s ecosystem. Developers deserve to pick their tools freely.\n\nThe registry is one more step toward that future.\n\nThe ACP Registry is available now in JetBrains IDE versions 2025.3 and later. Update your IDE and the JetBrains AI plugin, open Settings, and start exploring.\n\nHave feedback? Found a bug? The registry repo is open for issues and PRs. And if you’re building something interesting with ACP, we’d love to hear about it!\n\nOpenAI Codex is now natively integrated into the JetBrains AI chat, giving you another powerful option for tackling real development tasks right inside your IDE. \n\nYou can use Codex with a JetBrains AI subscription, your ChatGPT account, or an OpenAI API key – all within the same AI сhat inte…\n\nThe next edit suggestions feature is now enabled in all JetBrains IDEs for JetBrains AI Pro, AI Ultimate, and AI Enterprise subscribers.\n\nYes, you read that right! JetBrains-native diff suggestions are available right in your editor. Global support for optimized latency. Out-of-the-box IDE actions…\n\nBring Your Own Key (BYOK) is now available in the AI chat inside JetBrains IDEs as well as for AI agents, including JetBrains’ Junie and Claude Agent. Whether you’re looking to use cutting-edge frontier models, cost-efficient small models, locally hosted private models, or experimental research prev…\n\nJunie is now integrated into the AI chat.

    "fullText": "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.\n\n“They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.\n\nDiaz’s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.\n\nRandall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.\n\n“Even if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?” Kallinen asked. “There still has to be an investigation.”\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.\n\nGonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a “presumed suicide.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.\n\nDiaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.\n\nRelatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members “were in disbelief,” said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.\n\nA coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.\n\nSome of those calls came after the Jan. 3 death of 55-year-old Cuba native Geraldo Lunas Campos. A medical examiner has ruled that a homicide, citing physical restraint by guards.\n\nA witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.\n\nLawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.\n\nICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz’s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff “found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.” The agency said he “died of a presumed suicide” but that the cause was still under investigation.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz’s body wasn’t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.\n\nThe 911 caller in the case told the dispatcher that a team of doctors and nurses were working to try to revive Diaz after his suicide attempt and they needed an ambulance.\n\nParamedics found him laying on his back in a hospital bed without a heartbeat, according to an El Paso Fire Department incident report.\n\nAP reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Former Nigerian oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke had no real influence over the awarding of lucrative government contracts and was merely a \"rubber stamp\" for official recommendations, her lawyer said on ​Thursday at her London corruption trial.\n\nAlison-Madueke, minister for petroleum resources between 2010 and 2015 under then-president Goodluck Jonathan, has pleaded not ‌guilty to five counts of accepting bribes and a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery.\n\nProsecutors say Alison-Madueke \"enjoyed a life of luxury\" in London, with oil and gas industry ‌figures having provided the use of high-end properties and given her lavish gifts to try and influence the awarding of lucrative contracts.\n\nBut her lawyer Jonathan Laidlaw told jurors at London's Southwark Crown Court that purchases were made on Alison-Madueke's behalf \"because Nigerian ministers are forbidden from having bank accounts abroad\".\n\nHe also said Alison-Madueke, 65, disputes the extent to which properties were provided for her use and the amounts of goods she received, but ⁠that \"all that was spent on her personally, in ‌one way or another, was reimbursed\".\n\nLaidlaw said personal expenses were repaid by Alison-Madueke in Nigeria and expenses relating to official business were \"reimbursed from government coffers\", meaning Alison-Madueke received no financial advantage.\n\n\"If there was any financial advantage, ‍it was to Nigeria, enabling the Minister for Petroleum Resources to undertake her ministerial business and ... there was, of course, nothing improper about it,\" he added.\n\nOTHER ALLEGED BRIBE PAYERS NOT CHARGED IN UK\n\nAlison-Madueke, who was also briefly president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is standing trial alongside her brother ​Doye Agama, 69, who has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery relating to his church.\n\nTheir co-defendant Olatimbo Ayinde, 54, ‌has pleaded not guilty to one count of bribing Alison-Madueke between 2012 and 2014 and one count of bribery of a foreign public official.\n\nThe trial, expected to conclude in April, is one of the most high-profile cases relating to alleged corruption in oil-rich Nigeria.\n\nProsecutors say that Nigerian businessman Kolawole Aluko spent more than 2 million pounds ($2.8 million) on items for Alison-Madueke at London department store Harrods alone.\n\nAlison-Madueke is also accused of taking bribes, including gifts and payment for her son's school fees, from prominent oil and gas industry figures.\n\nBut, Laidlaw told the jury, ⁠none of the others named in the charges against Alison-Madueke have been charged, ​nor had Britain sought to have them extradited to stand trial.\n\nMINISTER HAD NO REAL ​INFLUENCE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nLaidlaw said Alison-Madueke's role as minister meant she signed off on oil and gas contracts which were awarded by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe told the jury to ask whether Alison-Madueke had \"any ability to exercise influence upon ‍who would be awarded these contracts ⁠or ... was she effectively a rubber stamp, stamping the recommendations that her civil servants made\".\n\nAlison-Madueke's lawyer also acknowledged that Nigeria, which is one of the world's largest producers of oil and the largest in Africa, had long been blighted by corruption.\n\nHe said, ⁠however, that perception of government and business practices may be different in Britain compared to Nigeria.\n\n\"Things which may seem uncomfortable or extravagant to all of us sitting ‌here in Southwark, may well feel very different to 12 people sitting together in Nigeria,\" Laidlaw told the jury.",

    "title": "‘A liar’: Trump official accidentally traps White House press secretary over ‘verbal stumbles’",
    "description": "The secretary acknowledged that the president misspoke, despite claims from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that President Donald Trump had previously misspoken while defending his campaign to acquire Greenland — and critics are pouncing.\n\nWhile testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Rubio answered questions for the first time since a U.S. military operation in Venezuela led to the capturing of leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife. He said that the former regime represented an “untenable situation,” telling lawmakers that the United States does not intend nor expect to take any further military action “at this time.”\n\nAt one point, Rubio was asked a question by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) about the president’s desire to acquire Greenland, which was renewed in the days following the raid. Kaine pointed to an instance last week when Trump said Iceland instead of Greenland four times while addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n“Until the last few days when I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy, right? Last time,” Trump said, referencing a previous nickname from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nAbout a minute later, Trump claimed that “they are not there for us on Iceland, that I can tell you.”\n\n“I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland,” Trump said. “So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.”\n\nDuring the hearing, Kaine asked Rubio directly: “The president repeatedly mistook Iceland for Greenland, right? We’re not mad at Iceland... the president just mistook the two countries for each other, correct?”\n\n“Yeah, he meant to say Greenland, but I think we’re all familiar with presidents that have verbal stumbles,” Rubio said, appearing to take a jab at former President Joe Biden. “We’ve had presidents like that before. Some made a lot more than this one.”\n\nAfter some reporters and critics noted the president’s mistake, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt quickly hopped on the defense, responding to NewsNation’s Libbey Dean, who posted on X that Trump “appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.”\n\n“No he didn’t, [Libbey],” Leavitt replied. “His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here.”\n\nLeavitt’s post has since been marked with a community note, with X users claiming that she is “not telling the truth.”\n\nA number of Trump’s critics quickly pummeled Leavitt following the exchange with Rubio.\n\n“Rubio calls Karoline Leavitt a liar,” the progressive network MeidasTouch wrote in response, though Rubio did not use the label directly.\n\n“So the Press Secretary wasn’t on the level here?” another user asked. “Shocking.”\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate Fred Wellman added: “Swing and a miss, Marco! Better luck next time.”\n\nTrump told reporters last week that he would announce details of a compromise in “two weeks” related to the future of Greenland, which falls under the boundaries of Denmark, a NATO ally. His deadline came one day after he announced a “framework of a deal” with the NATO alliance, without providing any details.\n\nTrump called a potential proposal “infinite,” adding that it will be “a deal that’s forever.”\n\nRubio said during Wednesday’s hearing that “we’re in a good place right now” with Greenland. He noted that there is a “professional” process underway that will result in a “good outcome for everybody.”\n\nTrump has faced fierce resistance from officials in both Greenland and Denmark, who have argued that the semi-autonomous Arctic territory is not for sale. The president, however, has frequently maintained that ownership over the island, home to critical rare earth minerals, is necessary for national security, while warning against Russia or China occupying it in the future.\n\nIn his announcement of a “framework,” Trump also pointed to his proposed “Golden Dome,” a missile defense system that he has previously teased will be operating before the end of his term in 2029.\n\n“Because of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",

The publication, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other scientific reports, tied these trends at least partly to an overheating planet.\n\n\"There is now strong evidence across different datasets that winter precipitation in the Himalayas is indeed decreasing,\" Kieran Hunt, who co-authored a 2025 study that showed a decrease in precipitation in the western and part of the central Himalayas between 1980 and 2021, told the news site.\n\nFor instance, an inquiry by Hemant Singh at the Indian Institute of Technology in Jammu found that snowfall in the northwestern Himalayas decreased by 25% in the past five years compared to the 40-year long-term average.\n\nAccording to the BBC article, the reduction in snow and ice will impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people, along with the region's ecosystems. For instance, in the spring, snowmelt feeds rivers and streams, supplying local communities with water for drinking, irrigation, and hydropower. Drier conditions also increase the region's risk of forest fires.\n\nSimilar trends can be seen worldwide in recent years due to rising global temperatures, too. For instance, one ski resort community in Italy was left bare in early 2024 after an abnormally warm winter. Similarly, multiple ski resorts in the French Alps were forced to close in 2023 due to a lack of snow.\n\nOne of the most impactful things anyone can do is stay up to date on critical climate issues to make better-informed decisions — for instance, who to vote for or how to get around town in more planet-friendly ways.\n\nSome communities are taking impactful steps to mitigate warming by phasing out polluting fuels. For instance, Los Angeles recently banned the use of natural gas in newly constructed buildings.\n\nHow cold does it get where you live?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The data contained continued alarming trends in birthrates and some surprising regions that are gaining population.",
    "fullText": "America is still growing. But not by much.\n\nAccording to U.S. Census estimates released Jan. 27, population growth has slowed \"significantly,\" with just 1.8 million more people between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025.\n\nThat amount of population growth – just 0.5% – is the slowest rate of growth since early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when a worldwide shutdown slowed population growth to just 0.2% in 2021. And it comes after a significant uptick in 2024, when 3.2 million people were added to the U.S. population, which grew by a full percentage point, the most growth since 2006.\n\nThe main culprit for slower growth? What one Census Bureau official called \"a historic decline in net international migration.\"\n\nBut the data was also filled with continued alarming trends in birthrates and some surprising regions that are gaining population. Here's what to know.\n\nChristine Hartley, assistant division chief for estimates and projections at the Census Bureau, said in a release from the agency that migration into the U.S. dropped from 2.7 million people to 1.3 million during the period from July 2024-July 2025.\n\n\"With births and deaths remaining relatively stable compared to the prior year, the sharp decline in net international migration is the main reason for the slower growth rate we see today,\" Hartley continued.\n\nThe slowdown in population growth was evenly distributed across the country, the Census Bureau said, with every state except Montana and West Virginia seeing slower growth or accelerated declines in population.\n\nThe Census Bureau said that if current trends hold, migration into the U.S. will drop by another 1 million people, to about 321,000, by this July.\n\nThere were about 519,000 more births than deaths in the U.S. between July 2024 and July 2025, about the same as the year before, the Census Bureau said. That's a higher rate than during the pandemic but still \"represents a significant decline from prior decades,\" according to the agency. In 2017, for example, there were 1.1 million more births than deaths, and during the years between 2000 and 2010, natural change accounted for between 1.6 million and 1.9 million.\n\nResearch shows American women are having fewer babies, with percentage of women 40 to 44 who have one child nearly doubling from 10% in 1980 to 19% in 2022.\n\nSusan Newman, a social psychologist and author of \"Just One: The New Science, Secrets & Joy of Parenting an Only Child,\" told USA TODAY in 2025 that struggles with infertility, the high (and rising) cost of parenting and cultural shifts are some of the reasons people are choosing to be \"one and done,\" having only one child.\n\nYoung adults, faced with higher costs for education, health care and housing, are delaying typical milestones like marriage and family, as well.\n\nAmerica doesn't have enough babies. Could working from home deliver a baby boom?\n\nOnly one region of the country, the Midwest, saw every one of its states gain population between July 2024 and July 2025. The Midwest population has grown steadily each year since 2023, including slight gains in what the Census Bureau calls \"natural change\" — births minus deaths.\n\nMarc Perry, a senior demographer for the Census Bureau, said for the first time in the 2020s, the Midwest saw net positive domestic migration — more people moving to the region from elsewhere within the U.S., a \"notable turnaround\" from population losses in 2021-2022.\n\nPeople are moving to South Carolina from elsewhere in the U.S., the Census Bureau noted: With 66,622 new residents moving in, the population grew by a total of 79,958 people between July 2024 and July 2025, the highest rate of growth (1.5%) of any state — though even that was down from a 1.8% increase in 2024.\n\nSouth Carolina's neighbor, North Carolina, followed close behind at 1.3% growth. Idaho saw 1.4% growth, with both states' growth fueled largely by domestic migration, the Census Bureau said. Texas' 1.2% growth was spurred by both domestic and international movement, even with a sharp decrease in international migration. Utah's 1% growth came mainly from natural change — more births than deaths.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: New US Census data highlights immigration and an alarming trend",

    "fullText": "UK partners at the Big Four firm KPMG received greater payouts than their counterparts at rivals EY and PwC this year.\n\nKPMG announced on Wednesday that partners received £880,000, roughly $1.2 million, in the firm's 2025 financial year — an 11% rise compared to the previous year.\n\nThe bonus pool for rank-and-file employees increased 18%, though that was lower than the 20% rise for the previous financial year.\n\nKPMG is often considered the underdog of the Big Four professional services firms, being both the youngest and the smallest by global revenue and number of employees.\n\nPartners hold a stake in the firm, giving them a vote in key decisions and a share of distributable profits.\n\nWhile payouts were up, the number of senior leaders at KPMG continues to slowly shrink.\n\nThe total number of partners dropped by six in the 2025 calendar year, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data. Partner numbers have declined for at least the last four years.\n\nNonetheless, the firm's results placed its partners above rivals at PwC and EY when it comes to pay.\n\nPwC UK partner pay remained largely flat in its 2025 financial year, with partners receiving £865,000, or $1.19 million. At EY, partner payouts were £787,000, just over $1 million.\n\nDeloitte remains the most lucrative for those at the top levels of the Big Four in the UK, paying its partners £1.05 million, or $1.4 million, in its 2025 financial year.\n\nOverall, KPMG UK reported annual revenue of £3.6 billion ($4.9 billion), up 2% from the previous year. The results include the firm's Switzerland branch following its 2024 merger with the UK firm.\n\nKPMG's UK audit and tax and legal divisions posted gains of 5% and 6% respectively, but the consulting business declined by 3%, which the firm said was due to \"a difficult consulting and deals trading environment.\"\n\nDemand for consulting services has slowed across the board in the UK. Consulting revenue was down at all of the Big Four's UK divisions in their latest financial years, and by as much as 10% at Deloitte UK.\n\nThe tightening market, combined with the need to evolve as AI changes the industry, has put pressure on the partner class at the Big Four.",

    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is shaking up video production.\n\nThe startup MITO AI is rolling out a new platform to help filmmakers storyboard, organize, and generate AI assets in one place. It's a project management tool for the era of generative AI filmmaking.\n\nThe company exclusively told Business Insider that it had raised $4.5 million in a pre-seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. It's launching its product on Thursday after testing with about 200 beta partners.\n\n\"Our tools are connected to video models, image models, audio models, and voice models, and then everything is brought together into our infinite canvas for collaboration and experimentation,\" MITO cofounder Iñaki Berenguer said.\n\nWhile many AI video generators, such as OpenAI's Sora or Google's Veo, are limited to short-form clips, MITO wants to help creators piece together short AI assets into a longer project. It also offers collaborative features, such as commenting. MITO users can create new AI assets that align with their film's style via integrations with platforms including Runway, Veo 3, ComfyUI, and Pika.\n\nBeyond its workflow platform, the startup also makes AI content for partners via its studio team.\n\nMITO arrives at a moment of flux in the media industry. Hollywood and advertising executives are testing AI tools for digital effects and commercials. Independent creators are using the tech to spruce up their videos without breaking the bank. Actors, animators, and other creatives, meanwhile, are raising eyebrows at the technology that some fear could wipe out jobs.\n\nMITO is also entering a crowded category dominated by incumbents like Adobe and containing other new upstarts like FLORA, which recently raised a $42 million funding round led by Redpoint Ventures.\n\nRead the pitch deck MITO used to raise its $4.5 million pre-seed round, shared exclusively with Business Insider. Some of the slides have been omitted or redacted.\n\nIt's a platform for \"multiplayer video creation.\"\n\nThe company highlighted two films it created end-to-end, \"Golf Le Fleur Maritime\" and a \"Lagaam campaign.\"\n\nArantxa Barcia, chief creative officer\n\nDanny Saltaren, chief product officer\n\n-Genially (collaborative canvas, $20M ARR), Inditex, Unusuals.\n\nTHE PROBLEM TODAY: AI video workflows are fragmented, slow, painful to iterate, and impossible to collaborate on.\n\n50 cent - 21 Questions and Willy Chavarria - Campaign.\n\nWe have delivered multiple real brand campaigns and music videos using our platform. MITO's tools meet professional quality standards and solve real brand pain points. Why create a studio? To eat our own dog food, generate revenue, and market what's possible.\n\nMITO Orchestration and Collaboration Tools:\n\nStoryboard as the skeleton of a full AI video production. Manually crafted, AI-assisted, or fully generated by our AI agents.\n\nAI Editor for individual text, images, videos, audios.\n\nInfinite canvas. Infinite creation.\n\nA non‑linear visual collaboration space — an evolved moodboard —for exploring and iterating ideas across images, video, audio, text, and styles; freely, in parallel, grouping and recombining, without breaking flow.\n\nMITO UNIVERSE — COMMUNITY OF CREATORS & MARKETPLACE\n\nA creator community and marketplace where artists and producers get a vanity URL to share AI-generated video assets, workflows and portfolios.\n\nMITO offers three pricing tiers: A free tier, a $16 monthly \"pro\" tier, and a $38 monthly \"studio\" tier.\n\nUsers are charged additional costs in the form of \"credits\" based on how often they generate AI content.\n\nWhat private beta users are saying:\n\n\"Huge congratulations! The progress over the last few months is dramatic. MITO makes complex audiovisual creation feel effortless, with real controls over camera, lenses, framing, lighting, and color. The built-in video editor is a game-changer. I haven't seen another AI suite this complete or this clearly designed for real audiovisual creators.\"\n\n\"Creativity is entering a phase of explosive diversification, and along with it, the quality of art and entertainment can drastically increase. Even in the very early days of playing with MITO, it's been striking how open the playing field suddenly feels.\"\n\nDespite the emergence of powerful models, no dominant platform yet ties everything together.\n\nAI models like Veo, Kling, and Runway open new frontiers.\n\nTeam workflows remain fragmented — the orchestration layer is missing.\n\nStorytellers, filmmakers, brands, and companies can now produce high‑quality video without the high cost and long process of traditional production. The result is faster iteration, more experimentation, and many more creative versions.\n\ne.g. brands needing 30 sec-5 min videos\n\nToday 80k brands spending at least $100k per year on video\n\nThe video creation boom is coming. If cost per video is lower: 10x more brands, 10x more content per brand, at a lower cost\n\nProfessional video creation is about to explode — for brands, movie studios, social media, agencies, creators and new forms of entertainment.\n\n\"New powerful AI video models are transforming massive existing categories and unlocking new ones,\" the company says.\n\nUnleashing video creativity & myth-making in the age of AI.",

    "fullText": "American households will continue to feel the pinch of high energy costs as gas prices are set to increase in the coming year, according to a new analysis.\n\nThe Guardian reported that the Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. homes will pay 4% more for gas in 2026 than in 2024. These increases are being driven by a multitude of factors.\n\nOne is the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, whose effects are felt worldwide. A 2023 analysis by the World Economic Forum found that the war caused household energy prices to nearly double. Increased instances of extreme weather events also affect household prices. Hurricanes and extremes in heat and cold can all lead to intense short-term price surges. Additionally, the current administration's decision to resume exports of liquefied natural gas is only adding to the problem.\n\nThe U.S. exported 100 million tons of LNG last year that was a windfall for producers, but at the expense of domestic consumers. In the first nine months of 2025, American households forked out over $12 billion in additional costs, per Public Citizen.\n\nClark Williams-Derry, an energy analyst, told the Guardian that the effects will be long-lasting: \"This may be something that lasts for a while and will be a severe economic crimp for lower-income families.\"\n\nThe steep cost increases reflect short-term thinking that prioritizes profiteering and convenience above all else. It's hardly unique to the current situation or even the United States; Germans are still paying the price for their overreliance on gas imports from Russia.\n\nFor households, the problems of using gas as an energy source go beyond the cost. Using a gas stove presents a serious health risk akin to having a car's tailpipe pumping directly into your kitchen.\n\nFortunately, there is a cost-effective way for homes to move past cooking with gas without compromising on quality. An induction stove may look like an underpowered electric hob, but it performs much better.\n\nIts highly efficient design applies heat directly to the cookware instead of heating a surface. That means the surface remains cool and is a good deal safer for the little fingers that might touch it. Upgrading to an induction stove doesn't have to mean an expensive renovation, as there are several plug-in options starting at around $50.\n\nWhat would it take for you to get rid of your gas stove?\n\nI already have an electric stove\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Professor Erik Gordon said the \"AI bubble is almost as big as the planet Jupiter,\" and Microsoft's stock drop is a \"warning of the burst to come.\"",
    "fullText": "Rampant speculation and massive overinvestment in AI have created a financial threat of cosmic proportions — and the fallout will be catastrophic, Erik Gordon has warned.\n\n\"The AI bubble is almost as big as the planet Jupiter,\" Gordon, an entrepreneurship professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said in a Wednesday email to Business Insider.\n\n\"When it bursts, the debris will be everywhere,\" he continued. \"Big, institutional investors will be hit with it, and so will individual investors who bet the bubble would get even bigger.\"\n\nGordon pointed to Microsoft stock, which tumbled more than 6% after the software giant's earnings beat on Wednesday. It was trading around 12% lower at 12:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, marking one of the sharpest intraday declines in the company's history.\n\nMicrosoft's shares sank \"because of the truckloads of cash it is investing in AI,\" Gordon said. \"That is a warning of the burst to come.\"\n\nThe cloud-computing titan's net cash used in investing surged 95% year-on-year to over $57 billion in the six months to December. That was fueled by its addition of $49 billion worth of property and equipment such as data centers.\n\nPrior to their post-earnings slump, Microsoft's shares had roughly doubled since the start of 2023, lifting the company's market value to over $3.5 trillion.\n\nOther AI stocks have surged even faster over that timeframe. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia have vaulted 13-fold, valuing the company at close to $4.7 trillion — more than 20 times its projected revenue for the fiscal year ended January 25.\n\nPalantir stock has jumped about 25-fold, giving the data-analysis company a $375 billion market value, or around 85 times its forecasted revenue for 2025.\n\nGordon told Business Insider in an email last week that he doesn't expect the AI bubble to burst in the next few months, as investors still have enough cash to \"prop it up,\" and technological advances remain \"exciting enough to distract\" from irrational valuations.\n\nThe veteran professor has previously rung the alarm on an \"order-of-magnitude overvaluation bubble,\" and warned that when it pops, the \"suffering will be more painful\" for investors than the aftermath of the dot-com bubble. But stocks have largely defied his warnings and continued to march higher.",

    "description": "Taco Bell debuted its new 10-item Luxe Value menu on January 22. It features five new dishes and five fan favorites. Every item costs $3 or less.",
    "fullText": "The $2.49 chips and nacho supreme dip are among the five new items on Taco Bell's Luxe Value menu. The dip features seasoned beef, refried beans, nacho cheese sauce, sour cream, pico de gallo, and a three-cheese blend, served alongside tortilla chips.\n\nThere's plenty of cheese to enjoy in this dip, but the strong smack of the sour cream overpowered the first bite. And while the seasoned beef tasted delicious, we thought there wasn't enough of it — the flavor got lost among the other ingredients.\n\nTaco Bell offers plenty of delicious dips and sauces on its menu, so we'll be giving this one a skip.\n\nThe $1.19 cheesy roll up is definitely the simplest item on Taco Bell's value menu. It features a three-cheese blend melted into a soft flour tortilla.\n\nThis dish instantly reminded Anneta of the quesadillas she used to make when she was a broke 20-something in New York City, surviving on Trader Joe's tortillas, cheese, a microwave, and a dream.\n\nErin thought the roll up tasted light and cheesy but lacked the exciting flavors of the other value menu items.\n\nWhile we wouldn't order it again, we could see kids enjoying this palate-friendly snack.\n\nThe $2.79 cheesy double beef burrito first debuted on Taco Bell's 2024 value menu. Designed to be a heftier version of Taco Bell's discontinued beefy melt burrito, it features more meat alongside rice, nacho cheese sauce, tortilla strips, a three-cheese blend, and sour cream.\n\nErin generally prefers Taco Bell's chicken products, but she thought the meat in the cheesy double beef burrito was well-seasoned and flavorful.\n\nAnneta, who also wasn't a fan of Taco Bell's original beefy melt burrito, believes this version gives you way more bang for your buck. It's packed with tons of meat, and the tortilla strips are a nice crunchy touch.\n\nWe just wish the flavor was more distinct — it needs some acid or heat to keep things interesting.\n\nTaco Bell's $1.29 spicy potato taco first debuted on the chain's value menu in 2020. It features seasoned potatoes, lettuce, cheese, and chipotle sauce in a soft flour tortilla.\n\nThe potatoes were nicely cooked and had a slight kick from the chipotle sauce, though they easily slipped out of our tacos because of their small, square shape. We wonder if the dish would work better with a hash-brown patty instead, which would add some crunchy potato to every bite.\n\nThe $2.99 avocado ranch chicken stacker is another new item on the value menu. It features grilled all-white-meat chicken, a three-cheese blend, lettuce, tomatoes, and the avocado ranch sauce. The ingredients are stuffed inside a tortilla that's been grilled and folded for easy eating.\n\nAnneta and Erin were both excited by the stacker's fresh flavors. The tender and well-seasoned chicken paired with the creamy avocado sauce reminded Anneta of Taco Bell's discontinued chipotle ranch grilled chicken burrito, while the crisp veggies were reminiscent of Erin's beloved McDonald's ranch Snack Wraps.\n\nThere's a lot of tortilla layered within each bite, so we both wished there had been more filling to balance the flavors and textures. It was delicious, so why not add more of it?\n\nThe $1.49 cheesy bean and rice burrito features beans, seasoned rice, nacho cheese sauce, and creamy jalapeño sauce.\n\nWhile the ingredient list sounds simple, this burrito has a surprising amount of flavor. The oozing cheese sauce tasted warm and comforting, pairing well with the plentiful beans. We were also pleasantly surprised by how hefty this burrito was for its price point.\n\nErin thinks this would be a great choice for those who are trying to eat a more plant-based diet, while Anneta believes it'd be the cure for a bad hangover. Now that's multifaceted.\n\nTaco Bell's brand-new $1.99 salted caramel churros are dusted in salted caramel sugar and come in a pack of three.\n\nWe both thought the salted caramel churros were a delicious and inspired treat. Their crunchy shell gave way to the sweet and creamy middle, while the salted caramel sugar added some lovely and unexpected depth to the flavor.\n\nDessert isn't the first thing that comes to mind with Taco Bell, but we would happily get these churros again and again.\n\nWe were both huge fans of the $2.49 beefy potato loaded griller, which features seasoned beef, crispy potato bites, nacho cheese sauce, chipotle sauce, and sour cream, all wrapped up in a grilled tortilla.\n\nTaco Bell purposely designed the griller for on-the-go eating, but this smaller burrito still packs plenty of punch. The grilled tortilla had a satisfying crunch, adding a contrast of textures to the juicy beef and soft potato bites in the middle. The creamy chipotle sauce also added a hit of extra tang, tying everything together.\n\nThis feels like a fresh new direction for Taco Bell, and we're here for it.",

    "fullText": "Most Super Bowl advertisers stick to a familiar formula: inoffensive humor and A-list celebrities. Hims & Hers is breaking from the playbook.\n\nTitled \"Rich People Live Longer,\" the digital health company's 2026 big game spot takes aim at a divide in access to quality healthcare between wealthy Americans and everyone else.\n\nOne scene features a space-suited cowboy over the TV news-style chyron \"World's richest man in orbit again.\" The scene is reminiscent of tech billionaire Jeff Bezos emerging from a capsule after completing Blue Origin's first passenger spaceflight in 2021.\n\nAnother shows a shirtless, muscular man strapped to an oxygen mask while sprinting on an exercise bike, alongside text reading \"spends millions\" and \"cheats death\" — perhaps a reference to biohacker Bryan Johnson, who has been known to test oxygen therapy as part of his expensive, public quest against aging.\n\nDan Kenger, the chief design officer at Hims & Hers, told Business Insider that the figures in the ad \"aren't specific individuals,\" and instead \"symbols of an intimidating, members-only healthcare culture.\" Kenger said Hims & Hers is aiming for the ad to be a provocative conversation starter about health inequity.\n\n\"We don't shy away from uncomfortable truths, and we fully expect this will ruffle some feathers,\" Kenger said. \"But if our message makes the industry uncomfortable, it's because we're exposing an outdated system that benefits the very few at the expense of everyone else.\"\n\nHims & Hers is no stranger to advertising controversy. Its \"Sick of the System\" Super Bowl ad last year drew backlash from senators and lobbyists for promoting non-FDA-approved compounded weight-loss drugs in a spot that lacked the sort of safety information typically disclosed by pharmaceutical companies. At the time, Hims & Hers said it adhered to advertising regulations and aimed to raise awareness of the obesity health crisis by showcasing the difficulties of accessing affordable weight-loss treatments.\n\nFor this year's campaign, Hims & Hers also plans to partner with podcast hosts and influencers to produce content across Meta, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms. It also has commercials planned throughout the Olympics, which begin next month.\n\nThis year's Super Bowl takes place on Sunday, Feb. 8.",

    "title": "Fact Check: Charlie Kirk once said 2nd Amendment is for citizens to 'defend themselves' against tyrannical government",
    "description": "Kirk's 2018 post about the Second Amendment resurfaced following the fatal shootings of citizens at the hands of federal agents in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Turning Point USA CEO and cofounder Charlie Kirk once said: “The 2nd amendment is not for hunting, it is not for self protection. It is there to ensure that free people can defend themselves if god forbid government became tyrannical and turned against its citizens.”\n\nIn late January 2026, a claim circulated online that Turning Point USA CEO and cofounder Charlie Kirk once said that the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment was \"not for hunting\" or \"self protection,\" but rather \"to ensure that free people can defend themselves\" from a tyrannical government.\n\nThe rumor spread in the wake of the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti at the hands of federal immigration officers in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, 2026, just two weeks after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good in similar circumstances in the Minnesotan city.\n\nSocial media users on Threads (archived), Instagram (archived) and Facebook (archived) shared a screenshot purportedly showing the Kirk quote, which allegedly read:\n\nThe 2nd amendment is not for hunting, it is not for self protection\n\nIt is there to ensure that free people can defend themselves if god forbid government became tyrannical and turned against its citizens\n\nIn short, the words were correctly attributed to Kirk, who posted the remarks to X (then Twitter) on March 3, 2018 (archived). The timestamp and content of his post matched the screenshot users shared in 2026.\n\nKirk's statement appeared to reference events at the time. On Feb. 14, 2018, one month prior to Kirk's post, a mass school shooting occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which prompted a renewed focus on gun rights and the Second Amendment in the United States.\n\nOn the date of Kirk's post, Florida held \"a rare Saturday session\" of the state Senate to consider \"a number of gun and school safety measures\" following the Parkland shooting, according to an NPR report. That same day, Reuters reported on the arrest of a man suspected of fatally shooting his parents, which could have amplified the discourse around the accessibility of guns on that particular date.\n\nThe post in question was the latest of resurfaced comments from Kirk that spread online. For example, some of his alleged posts and comments, particularly about the Second Amendment and gun control more generally, recirculated online after he was fatally shot on Sept. 10, 2025.\n\nSnopes previously investigated a claim that Kirk once said: \"I think it's worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.\"\n\nIn that report, Snopes uncovered an April 5, 2023, interview featuring Kirk at the Salt Lake City campus of Awaken Church that confirmed the quote but also included a statement that mirrored the content of his March 2018 X post about the Second Amendment.\n\nDuring the 2023 interview, which is available to listen to on Awaken Church's PodBean podcast feed, Kirk said (starting at 39:28): \"The Second Amendment is not about hunting. I love hunting. The Second Amendment is not even about personal defense. That is important. The Second Amendment is there, God forbid, so that you can defend yourself against a tyrannical government.\"\n\nTherefore, not only was the quote correctly attributed to Kirk, but there were other instances of him repeating similar statements, making his opinions on the Second Amendment clear.\n\nAlex Pretti Articles | Snopes.Com. https://www.snopes.com/tag/alex_pretti/.

    "fullText": "Federal safety regulators have opened an investigation after a Waymo self-driving vehicle hit a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the incident happened on January 23 during morning school drop-off hours, within two blocks of a school.\n\nIn its preliminary evaluation, NHTSA said the child ran into the street from behind a double-parked SUV and was hit by the autonomous vehicle, which was operating without a human safety driver.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, Waymo said it voluntarily notified NHTSA on the day of the incident and is cooperating fully with the agency's investigation.\n\nWaymo said in its statement that as soon as the car detected the child, it \"braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.\"\n\nThe child suffered minor injuries, Waymo reported, according to NHTSA.\n\nNHTSA is now examining whether Waymo's automated driving system exercised appropriate caution in a school zone and how the vehicle responded after the impact.\n\nThe investigation comes as Waymo faces heightened scrutiny over the safety of its autonomous vehicles.\n\nIn recent months, the company has dealt with a series of incidents, including a crash on Sunday in Los Angeles involving a Waymo vehicle driven by a human employee and a federal recall in May affecting more than 1,200 vehicles after robotaxis collided with chains or gates.\n\nLast December, regulators also examined incidents in which Waymo vehicles stalled in busy intersections, disrupting traffic in San Francisco.",

The Indiana Poison Center tells 13 Investigates calls doubled from 2024 to 2025, with 320 calls in 2025.",
    "fullText": "It’s just days before Christmas as medical workers wheel 7-year-old Jessa Milender through the halls of the hospital. The normally bubbly child is limp, face down on a medical gurney. She’s being admitted after overdosing on her mother’s prescription GLP-1 medication.\n\n“She couldn't walk from exhaustion and severe pain,” said Melissa Milender. “She wouldn't even allow them to touch her stomach. She'd scream out in pain in her sleep. It was awful.”\n\nPoison centers nationwide are seeing a spike in calls about people taking too much GLP-1 medication. Research suggests the increase in patients being prescribed Ozempic, Mounjaro and other similar drugs is causing the rise in overdose reports.\n\nThe Indiana Poison Center tells 13 Investigates calls doubled from 2024 to 2025, with 320 calls in 2025. The local poison center says the majority of calls are about adult women, though a handful of those calls involve children and teens.\n\nDoctors tell 13 Investigates most people can manage the symptoms at home. However, some end up in the hospital, like Jessa.\n\nGLP-1 stands for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The medications artificially create a hormone the human body naturally makes. That’s good for patients with diabetes, because it allows their bodies to produce more insulin so they can better manage blood sugar.\n\nThe drugs also reduce hunger and make some people feel full longer, which can assist with weight loss.\n\nThere are several versions of GLP-1s currently in use including semaglutide and tirzepatide, which are the active medication in popular brands including Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro.\n\nJessa’s mother tells 13 Investigates Jessa was admitted to the hospital twice in one week in December 2024.\n\nThe family shared pictures of Jessa looking ashen, exhausted, in pain and hooked up to an IV.\n\n\"I don't think we were prepared for how bad it was gonna get,” Melissa said.\n\nMedical records show Jessa got hold of her mother’s Mounjaro around Dec. 16, 2024. Melissa says as soon as she learned the girl injected herself with the medication, she called Poison Control. Melissa followed instructions to keep the child at home and hydrated. She was told to expect Jessa to have symptoms including vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\nHours after Jessa injected the medicine, she started vomiting.\n\n“We weren't expecting the severity,” Melissa said. “She would drink water and then throw right back up … I'm like, 'How is she going to stay hydrated when she literally can't keep anything down?'”\n\nJessa’s mother said she would vomit constantly.\n\n“Seeing your child sick, even a normal sick, you wish you could take it away,” Melissa said. “But seeing them so sick for so long and feeling like no one really knows how to help. That's a hopeless, helpless part that I wish on nobody.”\n\nRecords show Jessa was admitted overnight on Dec. 18 to Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center, not far from the family’s home in San Bernardino, California. That was a couple of days after the girl took the medication. She received medication and an IV, then went home the next day.\n\n“They were on the verge of if they should release us or not,” Melissa said. “I should have never let them release her.”\n\nJessa had a night of rest. Then the vomiting returned on the next day. Melissa remembers her daughter was thirsty, but could not keep water down. Jessa was so weak her mother had to carry her to the bathroom.\n\nMedical records state Jessa’s parents reported she was vomiting 10 to 15 times a day. So, back to the hospital — doctors admitted her again, and medical records show there were “concerns for renal shutdown.” Jessa had stopped urinating, and doctors worried about the health of her kidneys.\n\nMelissa said at one point Jessa was vomiting “brown chunks,” which doctors said could have been the girl’s stomach lining. The family reports around this time they started to fear for Jessa’s life.\n\n“On Saturday, night is when we as a family gathered around her, because she was just laying there, like lifeless,” Melissa said.\n\nTwo more days at the hospital, then doctors said Jessa was well enough to go home on Dec. 23, two days before Christmas. She made a full recovery.\n\nDoctors say overdose symptoms typically last about a week because that’s how long the drug is meant to remain in the body. Now that millions of people have been prescribed GLP-1s, poison center calls are on the rise.\n\nThe National Poison Data System, America's Poison Centers report GLP-1 overdose and side effect calls are up nearly 1,500% since 2019.\n\nThe Indiana Poison Center reports calls doubled last year. In 2022, the center reports receiving 64 calls, and in 2025, it received 320 calls. The center tells 13 Investigates 76% involve women, and the majority were due to accidental dosing errors. Most, 73%, did not result in a patient needing to go to a healthcare facility for care.\n\nDr. Mary Wermuth is a toxicologist at IU Health. She said there are probably more unreported cases, especially since people may call their doctors or simply deal with the symptoms themselves at home.\n\nWhile overdose cases are up, calls involving children like Jessa are rare.\n\n\"The dosing errors we typically see are too frequent or inaccurate or too high of a dose,” she said.\n\nWermuth said some people take it too often, forgetting it's a weekly medication.\n\nShe said other patients think taking a little extra might help them lose weight faster.\n\n“More of a good thing is not always a good thing,” said Dr. Ethan Blocher-Smith at IU Health Fishers.\n\nHowever, Wermuth and Blocher-Smith both agree the majority of people who take too much of the medication do it by accident. Mistakes are more common with compounded medications that may come with multiple doses in a single vial, requiring patients to measure out the proper amount. Many brand-name medications are now prefilled.\n\nOverdose symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal issues. Severe reactions can lead to dehydration and pancreatitis, which can land you in the hospital.\n\n\"Just because it's thought to be used for weight loss, although there are other indications — diabetes and so forth, that doesn't make it less toxic if you take it inappropriately,” Wermuth said.\n\n“That medication is slowly time releasing,” said Blocher-Smith. “That means the instant you injected it, you are dedicated to have that weeks’ worth of results, positive or negative. You get what you get.”\n\nTo avoid overdosing, the medical experts suggest people carefully read the instructions and ask their pharmacist to demonstrate how to take it properly.\n\nThey also encourage buying medication only from a reputable source. The doctors warn counterfeit medications can be dangerous because they are not regulated.\n\nAs for children, they suggest patients put their medication in a lockbox.\n\nMelissa now has one for the compounded version of her tirzepatide.\n\nDoctors say lockboxes are key to keeping these medications away from curious kids and teens.\n\n\"I got it the day she overdosed on it,” Melissa said. “It was $20 on Amazon, and it's been in my fridge ever since.”\n\nBack in 2024, she thought putting the medication higher up in her refrigerator was enough. She’s still surprised Jessa decided to inject herself with the medicine.\n\n\"I thought it was stomach medicine,” Jessa said, “because my mom takes it, and I thought it helps her with her stomachaches.”\n\n“She had seen her dad give me the first couple of injections,” Melissa said. “It goes in your stomach … but I never explained to her what I was doing … trying to get healthier.\"\n\nJessa took about 60% of her mom’s medication. The family is glad the girl didn’t take a full dose.\n\n“I try not to think about the ‘what if,’\" Melissa said. “God protected us from the worst, and I firmly believe that.”\n\nHer parents now hope her story can protect other kids.",

    "fullText": "Every nominee at the Grammy Awards hopes to clinch the top prize of the night: album of the year.\n\nThe coveted award has previously gone to Hollywood icons like Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, and The Beatles, and is always the last award of the night to be announced.\n\nAt the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Beyoncé won for her album \"Cowboy Carter.\" It marked Beyoncé's first win in the category, despite being the most-nominated and most-decorated Grammy winner of all time.\n\nIn 2024, Taylor Swift took the prize and made history as the first person to win album of the year four times. She previously tied with Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra, and Paul Simon, who all hold three album of the year wins.\n\nEvery album of the year nominee at this year's Grammy Awards would be a first-time winner. Bad Bunny, Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, Clipse, Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar, Leon Thomas, and Tyler, the Creator are all nominated in the category.\n\nHere's every winner of album of the year throughout history.\n\nMancini, pictured left, was the inaugural winner of the award.\n\nSinatra won his first of three album of the year awards in 1960.\n\nNewhart starred in \"The Big Bang Theory\" as Professor Proton.\n\nGarland was recently played by Renee Zellweger in \"Judy,\" for which she won an Oscar — one award that eluded Garland.\n\nThe album was a musical spoof based on the Kennedys.\n\nReleased on February 25, 1963, it was the debut album by Barbra Streisand. She is a rare EGOT winner: She's won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.\n\nThis year marked the first time two people won the award.\n\nSinatra won consecutive album of the year awards in 1966 and 1967.

    "description": "I started traveling full-time in 2019 and loved seeing the world. But over time, I saw the lifestyle's challenges and decided I wanted a home base.",
    "fullText": "I thrive in unfamiliar environments and get a kick out of last-minute plans and spontaneous adventures. So, it's hardly surprising I became an almost-accidental \"digital nomad\" — a term I've always found incredibly cringe-inducing, for the record.\n\nSo, I decided to pursue a life that would allow me to hop from place to place, working remotely as a freelance journalist and copywriter. And in 2019, I hit the road full-time.\n\nLike others tagging #todaysoffice on social media, I spent the following years surfing badly in Sri Lanka, climbing volcanoes in Guatemala, skiing in Colorado, and so much more.\n\nBut after almost seven years of traveling full-time, I decided I was ready for something different.\n\nAside from an extended stint in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic, I didn't have a stable base for more than three months at a time.\n\nMy travels brought once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and I met incredible people along the way. However, over time, the cracks in the lifestyle began to show.\n\nOf course, it's hard not to sound ungrateful when talking about the downsides of traveling, but it would be dishonest to ignore them — especially in an age known for glamorizing everything.\n\nFor starters, maintaining relationships can be challenging when you're always on the move. I learned that loneliness can linger even when you're staying in five-star hotels or lounging on tropical beaches.\n\nPlus, packing and repacking every few days becomes tedious. As does the endless search for short-term accommodations, trawling the internet for somewhere with decent WiFi and a table I can work from. (Finding the motivation to work in such beautiful locations is another challenge in its own right.)\n\nAnd sadly, after a while, even the most objectively stunning sunsets become ordinary. I'm not sure when it happened, but at some point, I stopped feeling the rush I used to get from stepping off a plane in a new place (I know, play the world's smallest violin).\n\nA few years ago, in the Grenadines, I asked a captain who'd been traveling for nearly 50 years how he chose where to settle. \"You can search and search all your life,\" he told me as we sat on the bow of his catamaran, surrounded by a pale blue sky and shimmering sea. \"But sometimes you need to know when you've arrived.\"\n\nI didn't fully understand it at the time, but I do now: There's no \"perfect place\" to live.\n\nSo, after almost seven years abroad, I finally decided it was time to find a home base.\n\nChoosing where to establish my home base was harder than I expected. For a long time, nothing felt right.\n\nI wasn't looking for a traditional 9-to-5 or a forever home, just a place from which to explore, with friends and a community I wouldn't have to say goodbye to every few months. Somewhere I could do the things I love consistently, like pottery, writing, yoga, and swimming in the sea, and return to familiar surroundings.\n\nLike many decisions I made on the road, I stopped forcing it and followed what unfolded naturally.\n\nSurprisingly, this led me to a place much closer to \"home.\" I decided to settle on the northeast coast of England near Newcastle, just an hour away from where I grew up. A windswept stretch battered by rain, with concrete skies and a brutally cold sea.\n\nIt's not the tropical island I once envisioned, but it feels grounding, like I've actually arrived.\n\nI have no desire to travel yet (it's only been a few months), though I'm sure that'll come. When it does, though, it's unlikely I'll disappear as often or for as long as I used to.\n\nI'm not saying I've found long-lasting contentment just because I'm anchored to a place, but it's given me the chance to be creative, slow down, and establish routines.\n\nIt's also helped me appreciate the smaller things in my life that I'd missed, like catching up with friends, playing golf regularly with my old man, and working on projects that felt impossible to tackle while hopping between hotels.\n\nAnd it feels good to know I don't have to check out anytime soon.",

Back then, I had only one child, but Costco's price for bulk diapers was reason enough to \n\nNow that I'm a mom of four, it only made sense to keep renewing that membership year after year. Here's what I buy at Costco to keep my family of six happy and full.\n\nI'm typically exhausted after grocery shopping, but a delicious rotisserie chicken makes dinner easy.\n\nWe almost always have enough leftovers for chicken tostadas the next night, and I frequently use the carcass (plus some onions, celery, carrots, and herbs) to make broth in the slow cooker.\n\nI love making the Imperial Garden frozen edamame as a side dish with dinner. An added bonus is that it's one of the few plants my kids will actually eat.\n\nThis big bag is full of smaller portions that go from frozen to ready-to-eat in just three minutes in the microwave.\n\nIt pairs well with the rotisserie chicken, and sometimes, I even eat it as a salty bedtime snack.\n\nMy kids love berries, and though I'm happy they reach for a healthy option, the price tag for these fruits can be high.\n\nHowever, I've found Costco's strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries are affordable and delicious.\n\nEveryone in our house, from my 7-month-old baby to my 34-year-old husband, loves the creamy and delicious Kirkland Signature organic Greek yogurt. It's high in protein and nonfat and pairs perfectly with the aforementioned berries.\n\nI always snag a few bags of the Kirkland Signature dried beef steak strips.\n\nMy husband usually eats these jerky snacks with his lunch, and I often grab a handful on my way out the door for school dismissal. They're quick, easy, delicious, and gluten-free.\n\nMy husband and I rely on Kirkland Signature protein bars for a macro-friendly snack or breakfast.\n\nThey're so delicious that I almost feel like I'm eating a candy bar. Almost.\n\nCostco's large box of Goldfish, which includes three bags of the snack, is the only size that makes sense for my family.\n\nI fill a bin in the snack cabinet with the cheddar crackers and store the extra in our pantry. The bin sees a lot of refills, but this giant box usually lasts us about a month.\n\nCostco has a great selection of nut butter, and I usually find myself buying more than one kind. In an opinionated household of six, everyone has a favorite spread, and they don't often overlap.\n\nI grab almond butter for my husband, natural peanut butter for me, Nutella for my 8-year-old, creamy Jif for my 6-year-old, and crunchy Jif for my 3-year-old.\n\nIt may not come as a surprise, but babysitters aren't exactly lining up at my door to watch my four kids. Instead, my husband and I like to get creative with date nights at home using Costco's beef loin New York steaks.\n\nI can typically find a pack of five for about $50. We usually grill or reverse sear steaks on Friday nights after the kids are in bed.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 3, 2025 and most recently updated on January 29, 2026.",

    "description": "How Amazon's decision translates to your own workplace.",
    "fullText": "16,000 jobs down. How many more to go?\n\nThe sequel to Amazon's mass layoffs last fall came yesterday with another round of deep job cuts. I'd love to tell you it's an isolated incident, but it feels representative of a broader shift across tech and corporate America.\n\nAI is ushering in a new era for workplaces, and companies are adjusting accordingly. As the ones closest to the tech (and spending the most on it), Big Tech would be the first to evolve. Make no mistake: Where Big Tech goes, the rest of the business world will likely follow.\n\nSo what can we glean from Amazon's layoffs? Fortunately, my colleagues Eugene Kim and Ashley Stewart are crushing it with scoops. Their stories provide context about Amazon's decision and how that translates to your own workplace.\n\nNo one is safe: Internal Slack messages Ashley viewed show how many teams were bitten by the layoff bug. That includes businesses within AWS (its AI cloud service and cloud data warehouse service) and Amazon's retail business.\n\nOne Amazon worker used an AI tool to flag roles on the chopping block. That list is even broader, although it may contain inaccuracies since it's AI-generated. Another noticeable trend is how software engineers got hit particularly hard, as has been the case in tech recently.\n\nOwn it: After a not-so-hot start, Amazon has coordinated its post-layoffs communications. And there's one word that keeps cropping up: ownership.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP of AWS Infrastructure, and Colleen Aubrey, SVP of Applied AI Solutions, both described \"doubling down on a culture of ownership\" in memos Ashley viewed. That sentiment, coupled with the changes Eugene reported on in performance reviews, signals that the further away you are from doing the actual work, the more at risk you are.\n\nAI can be a friend as much as a foe: Artificial intelligence often takes a lot of blame for why jobs are getting swallowed up. A memo from AWS VP Greg Pearson that Eugene viewed paints a different picture.\n\nHe urged workers to \"keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work.\" It's something I heard a lot of last week when chatting with execs: \"AI won't take your job, but the person willing to use it will.\"\n\nMake change, don't manage it: I'm not a tech career coach (I'll leave that advice to this guy), but the layoffs, coupled with CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing war against bureaucracy, indicate a desire to get more people rolling up their sleeves.\n\nIt's reminiscent of a recent convo I had with Cisco president and chief product officer Jeetu Patel. He stressed the importance of figuring out the change you want to make and working toward it, rather than focusing on a job title.\n\n\"If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,\" Patel told me. \"But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.\"",

    "fullText": "The second week of January brought hope of a snowstorm for Santa Fe, New Mexico, businesses.\n\nSki resorts and winter sports shops were struggling because of high temperatures and a lack of snow, KOAT reported.\n\nBluebird Mountain Sports assistant manager Wanonce Rakestraw said: \"Usually, our season extends out to the first week of April. Past seasons used to be second week of April. But now, if it keeps going the way it is, we're looking last week of March, if not mid of March.\"\n\nThe warmer weather highlights a worldwide trend in which temperatures have drastically risen because of humans' burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gas. In the United States and elsewhere, this change varies by region, but winter temperatures in the continental U.S. have climbed 3 degrees since the preindustrial era, according to The Climate Reality Project.\n\nIn the Southwest, that means drier winters that increase drought risks. In addition to the impact on businesses and economies, this \"season creep\" is stressing agriculture and ecosystems.\n\nFarmers rely on snowmelt to irrigate crops in spring, while plants and animals have evolved to rely on seasonal cues for survival instincts that include reproduction. People similarly have built their lives around the rhythms of Earth.\n\n\"It's been really slow,\" Rakestraw told KOAT. \"When places lose business, you lose people, employees. You close early.\"\n\nSki Santa Fe general manager Ben Abruzzo said his business was using snowmaking machines to remain open. Others have not been so lucky. In France, hundreds of ski resorts shut their doors, and some in the western U.S. couldn't open as usual because of a lack of snow. Excessive snowfall in the Northeast and Midwest underscored the variability.\n\nWarmer weather can also mean more rain, which may create flooding issues.\n\nWhile some ski resorts may be able to supplement low snowfall, they cannot stay afloat without more of the white stuff. Adapting to new weather patterns should be one priority, while investing in infrastructure and planning upgrades should be another.\n\nDo you think America could ever get all of its power from clean energy?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe rise in temperatures at the root of the problem may only be mitigated by the transition to solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy, which do not produce pollution that traps heat in the atmosphere.\n\nYou can make a change — and even save yourself a ton of money — by installing solar panels, replacing your gas-powered vehicle with an electric one, and changing how you update your wardrobe.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "As a seasoned chef, I've learned helpful tricks and tips from culinary school that home cooks can use when it comes to prepping and upgrading dishes.",
    "fullText": "I've been a chef for over 15 years, and even though professional kitchens aren't for everyone, there are several lessons and tricks I learned in culinary school that can come in handy for anyone.\n\nHere are some of the most helpful tips to take your at-home cooking game to the next level.\n\nIf you're tired of your cutting board moving around while you use it, place a damp paper or dish towel underneath it.\n\nWhether your board is wood or plastic, this trick will keep it in place and create a stable work surface.\n\nThe more you prep, the more you can sit back and relax when it's time to actually cook.\n\nChop up your ingredients, measure out your spices, and set yourself up for success and save time later.\n\nFor example, most restaurants strain scrambled eggs the day before, then pour out individual portions to cook.\n\nYou can do something similar if you're having people over for brunch — crack your eggs in a container with a tight-fitting lid, mix them up, and keep them in a very cold fridge until you're ready to cook them.\n\nPlus, ingredients like scallions and greens can be washed, sliced, and wrapped in paper towels or kept in an ice bath until ready to use.\n\nIf the parts taste great, the whole will too.\n\nMake sure to salt each individual component of your dish, not just the finished product.\n\nA sharp knife is a safe and effective tool, but dull ones can slip off food and cause all sorts of unintended injuries.\n\nYou can buy tools to sharpen your knives at home if you don't want to visit a professional. Just do a bit of research to see what works best for your particular knife.\n\nMost restaurants actually thin dishes with water. If they can do it, so can you.\n\nIf your sauce is too dry or soup is too thick, you don't need to run to the store for more stock or broth — simply turn on the tap.\n\nJust make sure to add a little bit at a time since you can always put more in, but you can't take it away.\n\nIf a recipe is telling you to use a specific oil or butter, you may want to listen. Not all fats are created equal.\n\nButter and olive oil burn at high temperatures, so use avocado or grapeseed oil for sautéing.\n\nIf you want to use butter, you can clarify it — or remove the milk solids by melting and pouring off the liquid — to keep the flavor high and the risk of burning low.\n\nWhen making pasta, get that large pot of water salted, filled up, and on the stove first thing.\n\nA lot of prepping can be done while the water boils.\n\nButter is the secret to a rich risotto, since the ingredient tones down acidity, adds creaminess, and generally makes things taste really good.\n\nFollowing the beurre monté technique, add a pat of cold butter to a saucepan with a bit of simmering water and swish it around until the mixture is thick and emulsified.\n\nThen, to make the most of the fat, add it to your risotto at the end. This can upgrade things like veggies or pasta, too.\n\nIf your sauce is boring or a bit flat, acid may be just the thing to fix it.\n\nWhether it's lemon juice or vinegar, just a splash of acid can make all the difference in brightening a dish.\n\nFor the fluffiest pancakes and the lightest desserts, mix all your ingredients only until they're just combined (unless a recipe states otherwise).\n\nDon't worry about leftover lumps. They'll generally absorb and hydrate into the batter as it cooks, making those light-as-air baked goods a reality.\n\nPull meat and fish out of the fridge about 30 minutes before cooking to temper it, which can allow it to cook more evenly.\n\nAlso, rest your meat on a paper towel to absorb surface moisture and help achieve an evenly browned finished product.\n\nYou shouldn't cook everything in your oven the same way or at the same height.\n\nRoast veggies at high heat on the bottom rack for maximum browning, and finish dishes up top under the broiler for a crispy, melted look.\n\nFor baking, you should cook most things in the middle so the heat is evenly distributed from top to bottom.\n\nThis story was originally published on April 23, 2022, and most recently updated on January 29, 2026.",

    "description": "Meta stock surged on Thursday as Q4 earnings beat estimates and investors welcomed more big AI spending plans from the Facebook parent.",
    "fullText": "The move: Meta Platforms stock jumped 9% on Thursday after earnings, erasing losses from the previous week. The stock is up 10% year-to-date.\n\nWhy: Meta reported Q4 2025 earnings on Wednesday after close, coming in above Wall Street estimates on both top and bottom line metrics. It posted revenue of $59.9 billion, versus the forecasted $58.4 billion, and earnings per share of $8.88, versus the $8.16 consensus.\n\nImportantly, the social media giant also revealed that it plans to spend $115 billion to $135 billion on AI in the coming year, a substantial increase from the $72.22 billion it spent on AI in 2025 and well above Wall Street's expectations for 2026.\n\nDespite balking at its big spending plans announced in its last quarterly earnings, Wall Street reacted favorably to the news.\n\nThe key difference this time around seems to be that the company's quarterly advertising revenue came in well above expectations. CFO Susan Li fueled confidence in Meta's growth plans when she said on the earnings call that the company's AI endeavors would be financed with cash rather than debt, likely generated by its advertising success.\n\nWhat it means: The earnings were a key update on the AI race, showing that the company is successfully generating cash from other areas to fund its AI ambitions. It's the kind of strength investors want to see after last year ended with Wall Street growing anxious about soaring capex among hyperscalers.\n\n\"Ongoing investments across the business, including the infusion of AI capabilities across the company's ad stack and content recommendation engines, are already driving tangible benefits for the core advertising segment,\" stated Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.",

    "description": "A former marketing manager explains why leaving corporate life to freelance after having kids led to burnout and mental health struggles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bullon of activ Marketing Franchise. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore I got pregnant with my firstborn, I was working in the corporate world as a marketing manager. It was an intense job that I absolutely loved, both as a single person and then as a newly married one. I got to travel the world, quickly advance in my career, and diversify my skill set, but I could only do the job because I didn't yet have kids.\n\nI knew once I started a family, I wouldn't want to continue working in the corporate world full time. I never wanted to be in a position where I had to choose between taking care of my kids and doing my job, so I initially decided to go back to my role part time, thinking that would be a happy medium.\n\nBut after keeping in touch day, a reintroduction to work after maternity leave, when my son was 7 months old, it became clear I couldn't even manage the part time role. To do the job well, to the high standard I expected of myself, I had to give it my everything.\n\nI remember finishing the keeping in touch day, crying in my boss's office, telling her I just couldn't come back. The day had been a reminder of my old life — the life of a young, free, travelling corporate marketer. It was a life I knew I couldn't maintain with a baby in tow, and I mourned the end of my life as a corporate professional.\n\nI quit my job and, after months of deliberation and dreaming, decided to go freelance — I was really excited. Surely, I thought, I would strike a healthy balance of parenting and working if I worked for myself.\n\nThe plan would be to devote all my attention to my son when he was awake, and pull out my laptop to work while he slept.\n\nBut the reality of being self-employed as a new mom was not what I had imagined.\n\nI was running on empty all the time, exhausted from sleepless nights. I didn't know what I was doing with parenting, as I had never done it before, and often felt I was doing it all wrong. I adored my son even more than I had imagined I would, and not being with him while I worked constantly pulled at my heartstrings.\n\nIt was from this state that I then tried to work, attempting to be at clients' full-time disposal. Even though I knew about marketing, I didn't fully take into account the amount of work or the number of non-billable hours I'd be working as a self-employed individual. As opposed to working for a corporate company, I was the sole person responsible for every aspect of the business. It was all on me.\n\nNot keen on putting my son in a day care to save us a bit of money, I tried to build the business with him around most of the time, save for a few hours a week when my mom or sister would have him.\n\nI was on a hamster wheel from the moment I woke up, becoming more and more exhausted as I tried to work as if I didn't have a child, and parent as if I didn't have a job.\n\nThe standards I set for myself as a mother and business owner were unachievable, and I could feel myself starting to burn out as I attempted to do it all.\n\nOnly 20 months after my first son was born, I gave birth to my second son, and I continued trying to balance my own business with parenting, this time with a toddler and newborn in tow.\n\nMy second didn't ever take a bottle, so I frequently sat with him breastfeeding on one side with my laptop set up on the other. I was absolutely determined to do it all, and do it all perfectly.\n\nI suppose part of me wanted to prove people wrong, to show them that I could be a completely present mother while also being an incredibly successful self-starter.\n\nMy mental health crashed. My physical health deteriorated. My relationship with my husband was rocky. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I had hit rock bottom.\n\nIt wasn't what I had expected freelancing to be like, and it most certainly wasn't what I wanted motherhood to be like.\n\nWhile self-employment might seem like the \"easier than corporate path\" for new mothers, it wasn't — not for me.\n\nSomething had to change, so I went back to the drawing board, considering what I could do differently, and joined a marketing franchise. It allowed me to continue doing what I loved, marketing, but I had the back office and a team of people behind me to carry out all the work that had overwhelmed me when I was working on my own.\n\nIf I could go back in time and give myself advice, I would say: You can't do it all, nor should you.\n\nAs a mom, I can't put myself last. I must build my life in a way that prioritizes me; otherwise, I'll burn out repeatedly, which is detrimental to ume, my family, and my work.",

    "fullText": "The bond market has been volatile, and recent events have created divergences between prices and fundamentals, according to a top fixed-income executive at Morgan Stanley.\n\nVishal Khanduja said he sees rare mispricings in the bond market that smart investors can take advantage of. Speaking with Business Insider, Khanduja shared several key areas he thinks investors should watch in 2026.\n\nKhanduja cited several geopolitical events that have spiked volatility recently, including the US raid on Venezuela and President Donald Trump's Greenland negotiation announcements at the World Economic Forum, noting that they caused prices to disconnect from actual fundamentals for roughly 48 hours.\n\n\"For an investor who's focused on medium to long-term returns within the market, that provides a fantastic opportunity to take advantage of some of those mispricings,\" Khanduja said\n\nDisruptive events over the last several years have often created target-rich environments for investors, he said.\n\n\"All of that led to quite a few opportunities that active managers could actually take advantage of in positioning and add alpha versus the passive benchmarks,\" he said.\n\nKhanduja said he sees significant mispricings in areas such as rates and credit markets.\n\n\"Cross market value and rates have quite a bit of opportunities, not only from volatility, but also from dispersion, where different central banks in various parts of the developed and emerging market are acting differently,\" he said.\n\nHe cited the differing economic trajectories between nations, such as Japan, Europe, and the US. While Khanduja thinks the K-shaped economy in the US, in which higher-earning households are driving spending and generally doing better than lower-income households, is driving uneven credit outcomes, he thinks credit markets still look like a good value.\n\n\"Dispersion and volatility across those three elements of rates, cross-market relative value, and then credit, are offering opportunities,\" he said.",

    "title": "'Bond King' Jeff Gundlach lays out his investing playbook as he eyes high inflation and a weaker dollar",
    "description": "Jeffrey Gundlach said one of his top recommendations is to invest in non-US stocks in non-dollar currencies.",
    "fullText": "The Bond King is steering clear of the US.\n\nThat's one of the prevailing themes that defines Jeff Gundlach's latest investing playbook, the famed fixed-income investor said.\n\nIn an appearance on CNBC on Wednesday, the DoubleLine Capital CEO pointed to two risks in particular that were swaying his macro outlook:\n\nHigher inflation. Inflation is running at about a 3% annualize rate, above the Fed's 2% target. While that difference sounds small, Gundlach estimates that it translates into a 56% increase in consumer prices of a 15-year period, much higher than a 2% rate.\n\nIf the Fed were to cut interest rates below the rate of inflation, that could potentially cause price growth to run even hotter, he said, referring to concern in markets that the Fed could give into political pressure and cut rates prematurely.\n\nA weaker US dollar. The greenback isn't acting like a safe-haven asset for investors anymore, and it hasn't been for a while, Gundlach said, pointing to recent selling pressure in dollar-denominated assets.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, has declined around 10% over the past year, a possible sign that investors are losing some confidence in dollar-based assets as a whole.\n\n\"My central investment theme now for about two years has been center your portfolio positioning around the idea that the dollar is going to be secularly weak,\" Gundlach said. \"If you slash interest rates, then you're not only running a weaker dollar policy, but you're running an inflationary policy,\" he later added.\n\nWith those risks in mind, Gundlach said these were the areas he believed investors should consider.\n\nGundlach said one of his top recommendations was for people to invest in non-US markets in local currency, particularly in emerging markets. He advised investors to have 30%-40% of their portfolio in foreign stocks and avoid US stocks completely.\n\n\"I know this is risky for dollar-based investors, but I have conviction on this,\" Gundlach said of his recommendation. \"I think that's going to continue to be a winning trade.\"\n\nEmerging markets have outpaced the gains in the US market over the last year. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is up 42% in 12 months, compared to the 15% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nGundlach said he's still a big fan of bonds — but on the short-end in particular.\n\nThe risk associated with those bonds doesn't seem to be substantial at the moment, Gundlach said, speculating that much of the risk in the public bond market had been absorbed by the private credit market.\n\n\"I still like what's performed well — bonds did well last year,\" Gundlach said, though he later added he felt bearish on long-end bonds. Long-end bond yields have climbed higher in recent years as concerns have swirled around inflation and rising deficits in the US, two issues that have been front-of-mind for Gundlach.\n\nMetals like gold and silver could be good shelter assets for investors, particularly since the US dollar is no longer acting like a safe-haven, Gundlach said.\n\n\"Less than one month of 2026, what's outperforming? It's the precious metals, it's commodities, \" he said, pointing to the rallies that have carried gold, silver, and copper higher in recent months.\n\nHe added that investors seem to be more interested in hard assets, he said, a trend Gundlach said he believed would continue to accelerate over time.\n\n\"It's already well underway and that train just keeps on rolling,\" he added.\n\nGold and silver are still seeing their strongest gains in decades. Bullion is up 99% over the past year, while silver is up a staggering 284%.",

    "description": "I used points to upgrade to United Polaris business class on an eight-hour flight. From the lounge access to the amenities, the upgrade was worth it.",
    "fullText": "I never thought I'd prefer sleeping 35,000 feet in the sky to my own bed, but my recent trip in United's business class proved me wrong.\n\nI like to take red-eye flights when I'm traveling to a destination in a different time zone because it helps me keep my sleep schedule on track. However, if I don't get proper rest on these flights, I land feeling completely groggy and end up missing out on my first day of travel.\n\nSo, on a recent overnight flight from New Jersey to Morocco, I decided to upgrade to United Polaris business class in hopes of getting a good night's sleep. I originally had a regular economy ticket and, as a frequent flyer, used my PlusPoints to get the upgrade at no additional charge.\n\nBetween the Saks Fifth Avenue blanket and a toiletry kit filled with skincare products, the experience did not disappoint.\n\nBecause I was flying business class on an eligible long-haul international flight, I had access to United's Polaris lounge.\n\nI typically like to be in and out of the airport as quickly as possible, but this time, I arrived a few hours early just to enjoy the perks.\n\nAs I walked in, I thought the space itself was stunning. It had a sleek, modern design with a marble check-in area and an overall elevated, luxury feel.\n\nThe lounge featured an extensive hot and cold buffet, but I opted to visit the full-service dining room instead.\n\nI ordered the tagliatelle pasta, which was perfectly al dente, followed by a warm sticky toffee cake that practically melted in my mouth.\n\nAfter my meal, I stopped by the bar to enjoy one of the signature cocktails before boarding.\n\nAfter boarding, I made my way to my seat, which was set up in a private pod. I immediately noticed how spacious the layout was and how it provided a real sense of privacy.\n\nWaiting at my seat was Saks Fifth Avenue bedding, including a plush pillow, a duvet, and a cooling-gel pillow. I also requested a mattress pad and a pair of slippers for extra comfort.\n\nOn my seat, I also found a complimentary toiletry bag with some travel essentials.\n\nInside was everything I needed for a long-haul flight — an eye mask, cozy socks, tissues, a dental kit with a toothbrush and toothpaste, earplugs, and a pen.\n\nIt was also stocked with Perricone MD skincare products, including a cleansing wipe, eye gel, hand cream, lip balm, and face mist.\n\nAll of it was super helpful for staying refreshed throughout the flight.\n\nAt this point, I was so comfortable I could've fallen asleep at any second, but I had to stay awake for the food.\n\nBefore the meal service began, the flight attendants came around with warm towels, which was a thoughtful, elevated touch. They even pulled out my tray table and placed a cloth napkin down.\n\nFor dinner, I was served a welcome snack, an appetizer (salad, bread, and an olive tapenade), and my main course. I also had a glass of white wine.\n\nHowever, I was left a bit underwhelmed by my entrée. The steak was cooked more than I would've liked it to be, and the potatoes tasted underseasoned.\n\nBecause I had a satisfying meal at the lounge, though, I wasn't too disappointed.\n\nHowever, dessert is where things really stood out. The flight attendants came around with an ice-cream sundae cart, where passengers could build their own treat with different toppings.\n\nI went all out with caramel sauce, hot fudge, chocolate chips, and cherries.\n\nAfter eating, I got ready for bed in the spacious cabin bathroom and settled in for a good night's rest. Honestly, the best part of this seat was how well I slept.\n\nBeyond the luxury bedding, the seat itself reclines into a completely flat bed. There's even a footrest up front that adds extra room.\n\nAccording to United's website, the bed offers about 77 inches of sleeping room. As someone who's just over 5 feet tall, this was more than enough space to stretch out completely.\n\nThe controls on the side of the seat made it easy to adjust everything exactly as I liked. Between the fully flat bed, plush bedding, walls surrounding my pod, and my sleeping mask and earplugs, I slept just as comfortably as I would've at home.\n\nSince my flight was a red-eye, I landed in Morocco at 9 a.m. with a full day of events ahead of me. Being well-rested made all the difference and allowed me to hit the ground running.\n\nAlthough I thought the upgrade was completely worth it because I used points, I probably wouldn't pay full price for a business-class seat.\n\nHowever, I'd gladly use any points or upgrades I had available to recreate this experience in the future.",

    "description": "Paramount+ is exploring free content, user-generated content, and interactive shopping features, according to a leaked presentation.",
    "fullText": "Paramount CEO David Ellison and his team are getting creative in their quest to turn Paramount+ into a top-tier streaming service.\n\nParamount executives are brainstorming several ways to make their namesake streamer more competitive, including a short-form video feed, a sports multiview feature, and free content, according to an internal presentation viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe presentation was sent by Dan Reich, the Paramount+ head of global product and design, to Dane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, via email in mid-January. It was described as \"a high-level summary of our priorities\" for the first quarter. Reich told Glasgow that it was \"not an exhaustive list\" of Paramount streaming's priorities.\n\nThere are several notable takeaways from the presentation, including that Paramount's priorities include:\n\nThe presentation also indicated that Paramount is brainstorming several new features for the Paramount+ mobile app, including:\n\nThe notion of free content on Paramount+, a paid streamer, is notable since the company already has Pluto TV, a free, ad-supported streaming service.\n\nA person familiar with Paramount's thinking previously told Business Insider that the streaming team regularly tests products and initiatives, and that leadership shapes its priorities based on how those tests go.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe presentation also mentions \"convergence,\" which refers to Paramount's previously announced effort to consolidate its streamers — subscription services Paramount+ and BET+, and free Pluto TV — onto a single tech platform for improved performance and efficiency.\n\n\"Paramount+ stuff goes back to CBS All Access,\" a high-ranking software engineer familiar with the convergence effort told Business Insider, referencing Paramount+'s previous name. \"It goes back to the early, early days of streaming, and it's great that we're finally getting away from all of that.\"\n\nParamount+ has become profitable, though it's still much smaller than its top rivals.\n\nAt last public count, Paramount's flagship streamer had just over 79 million global subscribers, compared to 325 million for Netflix, about 196 million for Disney across Disney+ and Hulu, and 128 million for Warner Bros. Discovery across HBO Max and Discovery+.\n\nParamount+ is far bigger than Peacock, which has 44 million subscribers, though Comcast's streamer only operates in the US.\n\nParamount also trails the streaming market leaders in engagement. Its streamers accounted for 2.5% of US TV viewership in December, according to Nielsen, versus 9% for Netflix and 4.7% for Disney's streaming services.\n\nEllison has talked about making Paramount a tech-first company and is focused on building a streaming business that can compete with Netflix. To that end, he's currently locked in a battle with Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount's exploration of short-form video and user-generated content also suggests that Ellison is keen to fight with YouTube and TikTok for viewership time. YouTube has been one of the biggest winners from the shift away from traditional TV and toward free streamers.\n\nBelow are Paramount's priorities for Paramount+ and Pluto TV in the first quarter, according to the leaked presentation. The slides have been reformatted with minor changes for clarity, with notes from Business Insider bolded in square brackets. Not all terms or references in the slides are immediately clear.",

    "fullText": "Apple is the next mega-cap tech titan to report earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, and Wall Street is looking for answers on the company's AI roadmap.\n\nThe iPhone maker's fiscal first-quarter results will be a key update amid investor concerns that it has fallen behind in the AI race. Its partnership with Gemini, announced earlier this month, launched Alphabet stock to a $4 trillion market cap, but the impact on Apple shares has been muted. iPhone and other hardware sales will also be a key focus after Tim Cook said in the previous earnings call that its Q1 would be the best ever quarter for revenue.\n\nApple heads into the earnings call with shares down about 7% year to date. The results will be published shortly after the closing bell, and the analyst call will kick off around 5 p.m. ET.\n\nChris Brigati, SWBC's chief investment officer, said there will be heightened scrutiny on Apple's AI strategy, and there's a risk that investors aren't satisfied with the company's updates to its approach.\n\n\"The tone from this week's Magnificent 7 earnings reports should be solid, though not evenly distributed across the group,\" Brigati said on Wednesday. \"Apple, however, faces the toughest hurdle: after a wave of upward estimate revisions, it's the name most likely to struggle to clear the bar, especially as investors raise questions about its AI strategy.\"\n\nUBS analysts said that while iPhone sales should be strong, they'll \"take a back burner to rising memory costs.\"\n\n\"Despite supply agreements that likely mitigate the impact of rising memory costs in the Mar qtr guide, risk does increase in the June and Sept qtrs as production of the next gen of iPhones ramp, impacting cost and margins,\" UBS wrote in a January 20 note.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said he expects weak stock price action after earnings on Thursday, as he expects investors to be underwhelmed by iPhone sales.\n\nBut he's still bullish on the stock for the year ahead, with a price target of $315 a share, representing upside of about 23%.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said he expects weak stock price action after earnings on Thursday, as he expects investors to be underwhelmed by iPhone sales.\n\nBut he's still bullish on the stock for the year ahead, with a price target of $315 a share, representing upside of about 23%.\n\n\"Looking beyond the short-term, we continue to believe Apple will outperform in 2026 as it re-launches an upgraded Siri/Apple Intelligence (February '26 and WWDC 2026 in June), introduces its most innovative iPhone in 10+ years (Foldable), becomes first to market with a 2nm-powered smartphone (iPhone 18 family),\" Woodring wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nAnalyst Michael Ng says Apple will post earnings largely inline with consensus on Thursday, but that the stock is set to rally as the market will soon come around to its AI strategy.\n\nNg's price target is $320 a share, about 25% upside from current levels.\n\nAnalyst Michael Ng says Apple will post earnings largely inline with consensus on Thursday, but that the stock is set to rally as the market will soon come around to its AI strategy.\n\nNg's price target is $320 a share, about 25% upside from current levels.\n\n\"AAPL stock is down 5% YTD to start C2026 likely on commodity cost inflation and App Store concerns, but we view the stock weakness as a buying opportunity into a continuation of the iPhone refresh cycle,\" Ng said in a January 20 note.\n\n\"Apple's partnership with Google Gemini for Siri and continued iPhone demand growth against the backdrop of AI-native consumer hardware launches should demonstrate to the market that the iPhone will remain the consumer device of choice for accessing new AI tools, clearing overhangs related to competition.\"\n\nTech analyst Dan Ives said to look for updates on Apple's AI strategy.\n\n\"With the company finalizing the choice of Google Gemini to back Siri in its AI strategic push, it's time for Apple to lay down the blueprint to accelerate its AI strategy in 2026 which leads up to a much-anticipated Siri refresh this spring and WWDC in June,\" Ives said in a client note Wednesday, referencing the World Wide Developers Conference.\n\nTech analyst Dan Ives said to look for updates on Apple's AI strategy.\n\n\"With the company finalizing the choice of Google Gemini to back Siri in its AI strategic push, it's time for Apple to lay down the blueprint to accelerate its AI strategy in 2026 which leads up to a much-anticipated Siri refresh this spring and WWDC in June,\" Ives said in a client note Wednesday, referencing the World Wide Developers Conference.\n\nHe thinks the stock could enjoy a big rally if investors start to apply an AI premium, as they have for other firms that have touted involvement in the burgeoning technology.\n\n\"We believe no 'AI premium' which could be worth $75-$100 per share is factored into Apple's stock at current prices,\" Ives wrote.",

    "title": "My first trip to Puerto Rico with my kids was great — but it could've been even better if we'd avoided these 4 mistakes",
    "description": "I made mistakes when planning and budgeting for our family's first trip to Puerto Rico. Here's what I'd do next time we visit the Caribbean island.",
    "fullText": "Puerto Rico, also known as the Enchanted Island, has been high on my list of places to visit for years.\n\nI've always wanted to explore the island's rainforests, beaches, and colorful, charming old town. When I finally made it to Puerto Rico for a weeklong visit with my family in July, we had a great time.\n\nHowever, I think our trip would've been better if we had avoided these four mistakes.\n\nPuerto Rico is a relatively small island — it's got fewer square miles than Connecticut, one of the tiniest US states — so I assumed it would be easy to get around without a car.\n\nA friend who had previously visited the island recommended that my family just use Uber, since traffic tends to be heavy and parking can be difficult. Their logic seemed sound, and this mostly worked, but we ran into some hiccups.\n\nAfter I arrived, I realized that rideshare vehicles aren't authorized to operate in the El Yunque National Forest, which I had been looking forward to visiting. Instead of heading there on our own, we ended up booking a pricey tour with transportation included.\n\nThough I was thrilled to finally see the glowing bioluminescent bay in Fajardo, which has to be experienced after sunset, our family struggled to get back to our hotel after dark.\n\nWait times for a ride were long, and I ended up submitting several requests for a driver before one finally agreed to pick us up.\n\nUltimately, I ended up spending more time waiting for rides and more money booking tours with private transportation than I had expected.\n\nAlthough I managed without a car, I regret not just renting one to avoid some of the fees and stress.\n\nDealing with traffic and parking would have been frustrating in their own ways, but at least we could've explored more of the island if we'd had a rental car.\n\nOne of the things I love about travel is spontaneity. Usually, this approach works well and makes my trip better.\n\nThere are exceptions, such as a trip to Tokyo that involved booking activities months in advance. However, since I was visiting the Caribbean island in the summer, outside the island's peak winter travel period, I wasn't worried.\n\nPerhaps I should've been, as not planning far in advance made my trip to Puerto Rico more difficult.\n\nI found that booking tours at the last minute here was nearly impossible. That surprised me because I've been able to book last-minute excursions in many other places I've traveled — even during the busiest travel seasons.\n\nThough I was able to experience the top items on my list, like visiting the rainforest and a bioluminescent bay, doing so took hours of extra research.\n\nEventually, I started skipping some attractions on my want-to-visit list, like a coffee plantation, because finding last-minute availability was so frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nIf I return to Puerto Rico, I'd make an effort to book more excursions and tours before even boarding my flight.\n\nPrices were higher than I expected, especially compared to trips I've taken elsewhere in the Caribbean — a difference that makes more sense given Puerto Rico's US ties and labor costs.\n\nMost of our meals, even at fast-casual restaurants, cost my family of five (two adults, three kids) at least $100.\n\nAt one point, I was surprised to find that the cheapest order of mofongo (a Puerto Rican dish made primarily from plantains) on the menu at a basic restaurant near the beach was $25.\n\nThe dish was tasty, but my view was of a dumpster rather than the ocean. Back home in DC, when I pay that much for one dish, it's usually at a nicer restaurant with a better view.\n\nAfter a couple of days, my husband walked to a supermarket near our hotel to pick up some groceries and snacks, which helped us save on food costs.\n\nSimilarly, several excursions cost more than I expected.\n\nWe did a large-group kayaking tour I expected to cost around $50 per person, which is what I've paid for similar excursions elsewhere.\n\nInstead, the tour cost $70 per person, which added up for my family of five. Our half-day tour to El Yunque National Park also cost $625 for the five of us — plus a cash tip for the guide.\n\nThe excursion was great, and my kids loved zipping down natural rock slides and jumping off a cliff. I would've even liked to do the tour again and see more of the park, but it was too expensive for us to consider doing it twice.\n\nOn the bright side, both resorts we stayed at on the island offered access to beaches, pools, and plenty of activities (like biking and kayaking) for no added cost. This helped us have fun without spending extra money.\n\nIf we were to do Puerto Rico again, though, I'd set a more realistic budget for our vacation.\n\nDuring my trip, several locals and frequent visitors to Puerto Rico recommended visiting at least one of the territory's many smaller islands — it's got over 100 of them.\n\nI tried to see the island of Vieques during my visit, but all ferry tickets were sold out by the time I checked. I considered visiting a different island, such as Culebrita, instead, but eventually gave up on navigating last-minute logistics.\n\nSeeing one of Puerto Rico's smaller islands would have allowed me to experience more of the territory's rich culture and natural beauty.\n\nNext time, I'd be sure to plan out day trips and book ferry tickets in advance.",

The firm said it spent a record amount on AI, but reported slowing cloud growth and issued soft guidance on profits for the following quarter, leading tech stocks to sell off across the board.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is down 21% from its high in October.\n\nHere were the notable moves in the tech sector:\n\n\"Microsoft (MSFT) was the black sheep with losses,\" Joee Mazzola, the head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, wrote on Thursday, referring to more upbeat results from Magnificent Seven peers Tesla and Meta.\n\nMajor indexes were dragged lower.

Capex spending among tech giants has been a particular worry, given the uncertainty over monetization plans and when the market will see returns from AI spend.\n\nMicrosoft's earnings likely \"reinforced fears that a return on AI investment may be slow in coming,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note Thursday morning.\n\nThe company likely needs to \"prove\" that it's making good investments into its AI endeavours, analysts at UBS wrote earlier this week.\n\n\"Microsoft has elected to increase the allocation of new GPU compute to its 1P efforts, effectively throttling Azure growth, because of its confidence in monetizing Copilot,\" the bank said. \"The challenge for the stock is that many investors don't buy into that trade-off.\"",

The tech giant's quarterly earnings report spooked investors, given higher-than-anticipated capital spending and a slowdown in quarterly cloud sales growth.\n\nA rapid rally in precious metals that had stunned Wall Street faced resistance on Thursday as the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) rebounded from its lowest level since early 2022.\n\n“The continued surge across metals, especially gold and silver, is entering a dangerous phase, in my opinion,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said on Thursday.\n\n“The problem is volatility feeding on itself. As price swings intensify, liquidity thins,” he added.\n\nGold prices had risen roughly 20% year to date as the greenback weakened against other currencies.\n\nJust last week, Goldman Sachs analysts set a year-end price target of $5,400 for gold, with a potential upside risk due to increased participation from private-sector investors.\n\nThe precious metal rallied past $5,500 on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held rates steady, with commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell doing little to stop the dollar's slide.\n\n“I see this as a sign that conviction levels in the Dollar-down trade are high,” Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a note on Thursday before gold's descent. He noted that \"the weak Dollar is super-charging the debasement trade.”\n\nSilver topped $120 per ounce before paring gains. The precious metal is up 42% year to date after posting a stunning rally in 2025.\n\n\"Silver prices have already significantly overshot our forecasted averages, though calling a top is close to impossible in markets displaying near-parabolic price momentum,\" JPMorgan analysts noted earlier this month.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

As this practice becomes the norm, firms must overcome challenges such as evolving consumer expectations, fragmented internal operations, and increasingly complex carrier contracts. To adapt, they will need to audit their shipping data for savings opportunities, renegotiate contracts to stay flexible in the face of constant rate changes, integrate shipping strategies across departments, and invest in real-time analytics for agile decision-making.",

    "fullText": "PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; The Game Bakers\nA punishing, beautiful survival game that turns mountaineering into an intimate test of endurance, fixation and emotional resolve – you’ll be in tears by the end\n\nMountaineers and climbers, especially the free-solo kind, are humanity’s most fascinating maniacs: single-minded, daring souls who throw themselves into profoundly optional life-endangering feats. It is hard not to be compelled, and appalled, by someone like Alex Honnold. Even with ropes, a single wrong move can mean death in mountaineering, a mad human activity that puts you at the full mercy of nature. You cannot help but wonder what kind of person willingly chooses this: what kind of person looks at a towering cliff face, or a wall of wind-whipped ice, and thinks, I bet I can get up there.\n\nAava, Cairn’s protagonist, is that kind of person: a champion climber, a woman who has conquered summit after summit, butand for some reason can’t walk away. Before her stands Mount Kami, an ice-tipped, Himalayan-style peak that has never before been climbed. Kami was once home to a tribe of people, whose remnants you find as you pull yourself up each section of the mountain, but now you are very much alone. Controlling Aava’s limbs, you move her hands and feet towards imperfections in the rock, jamming her fingers into cracks and her toes on to tiny ledges. You quickly learn to read the mountain, as Aava would.\n\nDespite the absence of real-life peril, Cairn makes your heart race and your mouth go dry. When Aava’s limbs start shaking and she starts breathing more urgently, you know she’s not secure on the cliff face; you’d better reposition her feet fast, or take a gamble and try to screw a piton and clip in before she loses her grip. And you have limited life-saving pitons, so you’d better conserve them. At one point I was stuck halfway up a bare rock face after climbing all night, with no pitons left and no respite in sight in any direction, and I had to perform a terrifically stressful 10-minute climb towards a cave without putting a foot wrong. I got desperate right at the end and Aava nearly slipped as she pulled herself up on to the final ledge. I had to put the controller down and do some deep breathing before I could continue.\n\nIn this respect, Cairn is a wonderful survival game. It feels perilous, as it should. In addition to managing Aava’s hand and footholds, you have to manage her backpack, scavenging, foraging, trying to find water wherever you can (tip: keep every bottle you find). You must laboriously bandage her ruined fingers to preserve her grip, when you get a moment to rest. And with that sense of danger and suffering comes a sense of accomplishment, when you prevail. The relief that I felt whenever I found a safe point where Aava could set up her tent was intoxicating.\n\nAs hours pass and conditions get worse on the mountain, Aava’s obsession with conquering Kami starts to feel not just impossibly brave but self-destructive. Cleverly, the game invites you to question why she’s doing this – and why you’re doing it. Especially towards the end, this is not an easy game (though you can always turn on some assists to make it less pitiless if you want). There were sections where I fell off the mountain over and over, failing to find a good route, parched and starving. Dangling from the rope for the 15th time, I became immensely frustrated with myself, and Aava voices her own frustration every time you fumble a hold. I should probably have walked away and taken a break for a while, but Aava’s stubborn determination was rubbing off on me.\n\nCairn, as much as a game about climbing and nature, turns out to be a game about what it takes to be the kind of person Aava is – and the cost. I was floored by the ending, which had me crying on my sofa at one in the morning. There were many moments of beauty and terror during my ascent that left me quietly awestruck. That awe, in the end, was proportional to the hardship.",

    "title": "The Difference Between TikTok’s ‘Soft Cardio’ Trend and True Cardio",
    "description": "Don't get discouraged when you don't see the results you want.",
    "fullText": "If you've been scrolling through your fitness algorithm lately, you might see content creators in their \"soft cardio\" era. This trend sounds a lot like last year's \"cozy cardio,\" although the way I see it used is slightly different. Where \"cozy\" cardio is a little more about tricking yourself into working out by establishing a comfortable, maybe even luxurious ambience, \"soft\" cardio has a greater emphasis on the \"low effort\" of it all. Whatever the wording, this type of workout is simply the latest iteration of bigger trend toward low-effort cardio, promising all the benefits of exercise without the sweat, strain, or stress. But here's the thing: While soft cardio might be great for getting you off the couch, it's not quite delivering what traditional cardio does.\n\nLet's be clear: I'm not here to bash soft cardio. Movement is movement, and anything that gets people more active is a win in my book. But if you're hoping to reap the cardiovascular benefits that come with actual cardio exercise, we need to have an honest conversation about what soft cardio can—and can't—do for your body.\n\nSoft cardio is essentially low-intensity exercise performed at a relaxed, comfortable pace. Think leisurely walks, gentle dancing in your living room, slow cycling, or easy stretching routines. The emphasis is on making movement feel enjoyable and stress-free rather than challenging or demanding. Naturally, this should resonate with people who feel intimidated by traditional exercise, or who are recovering from injury, or who simply want to incorporate more gentle movement into their daily routines. These are all valid reasons to embrace this type of activity. Soft cardio designed to spare your body from repetitive impact and intense exertion, which sounds wonderful—and in many ways, it is.\n\n“Cardio” may not have a precise definition, but just looking at the name, it's safe to say it usually refers to the realm of cardiovascular exercise. That means it's supposed to challenge your heart and lungs, elevating your heart rate to a level where your cardiovascular system actually has to work harder than usual. This is what creates the adaptations that improve your heart health, increase your endurance, and boost your overall fitness.\n\nIf your soft cardio session doesn't meaningfully elevate your heart rate—if you could easily hold a conversation throughout without any change in breathing at all—then your cardiovascular system isn't being challenged enough to create those training adaptations. You're moving, which is great, but you're not getting the cardiovascular conditioning that comes with true cardio exercise.\n\nHere are some examples of soft, cozy, or low-impact cardio:\n\nA 30-minute stroll through the neighborhood at a comfortable pace\n\nGentle yoga or stretching routines\n\nSlow dancing or swaying to music\n\nEasy cycling on flat terrain where you never feel breathless\n\nLight household chores done at a relaxed pace\n\nAll of these movements reduce sedentary time, are gentle on joints, have a low barrier to entry, are sustainable for many people, and would probably improve your mood. Soft cardio has it's place, but it's minimal cardiovascular conditioning, with limited calorie burn, and it won't significantly improve aerobic capacity.\n\nHere are some examples of what it might look like to tip into actual cardio:\n\nBrisk walking where your breathing becomes noticeably heavier\n\nSwimming laps with sustained effort\n\nCycling at a pace that makes conversation difficult\n\nDance cardio classes with energetic movement\n\nJump rope, rowing, or elliptical training\n\nThese examples could strengthen your cardiovascular system, improve aerobic capacity, increase calorie burn, reduce risk of heart disease, and overall enhance endurance. Of course, this comes with higher impact on joints, more effort and motivation, and can feel intimidating for beginners.\n\nThe good news is that you don't have to choose between soft cardio and real cardio—you can incorporate both into your routine based on your goals and current fitness level. If your primary goal is simply to move more and sit less, soft cardio is perfect. It's infinitely better than remaining sedentary, and for many people, it's a sustainable way to maintain an active lifestyle. The gentle nature of soft cardio also makes it ideal for active recovery days, when you want to move without taxing your body.\n\nHowever, if you're looking to improve your cardiovascular fitness, increase your endurance, or achieve more significant health benefits, you'll need to include actual cardio workouts that challenge your heart and lungs. This doesn't mean every workout needs to be intense—even moderate-intensity cardio, where you can still talk but your breathing is elevated, provides substantial cardiovascular benefits.\n\nSoft cardio has its place, and I genuinely appreciate that it's helping people embrace movement without feeling overwhelmed or intimidated. It's particularly valuable for keeping your heart slightly elevated without putting stress on your joints or muscles, which is especially important for those recovering from injury or managing chronic conditions. But let's call it what it is: light physical activity or gentle movement, not cardiovascular exercise in the traditional sense. If you want the cardiovascular adaptations that come with cardio—the improved heart health, increased lung capacity, and enhanced endurance—you need to include workouts that challenge your cardiovascular system.\n\nFor beginners, use soft cardio as a gateway to building more challenging workouts into your routine. Start with gentle movement to establish the habit of being active, then gradually increase the intensity as your fitness improves. You might begin with soft cardio walks and slowly pick up the pace over time, or add short intervals of brisker walking to your leisurely strolls.\n\nThe trend isn't bad. But understanding the difference between moving your body and training your cardiovascular system will help you set realistic expectations and design a fitness routine that actually meets your goals.",

    "fullText": "As scammers continue to find ways to impersonate known brands, users should remain wary of spam-like emails—even if they appear to come from a legitimate company address.\n\nArs Technica has identified a scheme that abuses a Microsoft subscription feature to send phishing emails from [email protected], a real address that the company advises users to add to their allow lists.\n\nUsers targeted with this scam have received emails from an address connected to Microsoft Power BI, a business analytics platform. The messages include (fake) billing receipts with large purchase amounts from services like PayPal, Norton LifeLock, and Microsoft 365 and a phone number to call to dispute the transaction.\n\nScammers on the other end of the line may try to convince you to install a remote access application that allows device takeover or will otherwise extract personal information. As with any phishing scam, engaging in any way—calling the number, responding to the email, or clicking links—could put your data and your device at risk.\n\nThe emails themselves are full of typos and grammar errors and urgent calls to action that are, in most cases, completely unrelated to Microsoft itself. Many users would spot these red flags and know to simply delete the message. However, threat actors capitalize on the trust users have in the brands they're exploiting along with scare tactics to trap some people in the scheme.\n\nThis is also far from the first phishing scheme of its kind: Threat actors have sent malicious emails from legitimate PayPal and Google addresses (to name just two) by exploiting similar loopholes. In the case of PayPal, fraudulent purchase notifications sent from service[at]paypal[dot]com abused the platform's subscription billing feature. With Google, scammers registered google.com subdomains via Google Sites and linked them with Google Accounts.",

    "description": "There are new enhancements to Failed Authentication Lock and Remote Lock.",
    "fullText": "Phones are valuable targets. If someone can steal your device, especially if they know how to break into it, they have access to a huge amount of your sensitive data. As such, good security features can mean the difference between losing that data, or protecting it entirely—even if your phone is long gone. Google has a number of anti-theft features baked in Android, appropriately called \"Theft Protection Features.\" While the company isn't announcing a slate of new features today, it did announced new updates to its existing Android Theft Protection features in a post on the company's Security Blog Tuesday. Here's what's new:\n\nFirst, the company announced updates to authentication safeguards, which apply to all Android devices running Android 16 or newer. That includes a new dedicated toggle in settings for Failed Authentication Lock, which automatically locks your screen after someone tries to guess your password too many times. Now, you can choose whether or not to keep this feature on right from settings.\n\nGoogle is also increasing the amount of time your phone locks up after too many failed passcode attempts, which reduces the chance for someone to break into your phone. I wouldn't have thought of this, but Google notes that it has included protections against children that try to break into your phone, by not counting identical passcode attempts against this retry limit. And while it isn't new, Google highlighted that since late 2025, all features and apps that use Android Biometric Prompt now work with Identity Check, which prevents unauthorized users from changing sensitive settings without a successful biometric authentication—meaning a face or fingerprint scan.\n\nThe company also announced enhancements to features that are available to devices running at least Android 10. First is an update to Remote Lock, which lets you lock up your phone from a web browser if it is stolen or goes missing. Now, you can set up a security question as part of the unlocking procedure. Even if someone knows your credentials, they'd need to know the answer to your security challenge before they could unlock your device. Tip: If you make the answer something nonsensical, you'll be even more protected (e.g., What is your mother's maiden name? h7r_t*2#). Just be sure to file that answer somewhere safe, like a password manager.\n\nUsers in Brazil also have two new security settings enabled by default. The first is Theft Detection Lock, which can detect when your device has been snatched out of your hand in a likely theft situation. The second is Remote Lock, so users in Brazil can take advantage of the above benefits without having to set anything up first—other than the option security challenge question, of course.\n\nThese updates might not be revolutionary, but they should help boost your Android's security a bit—and prevent your kids from locking you out of your phone for the day.",

    "fullText": "Big news for runners with an Apple Watch: You can now follow Strava routes directly from your wrist. Route navigation on Strava-compatible watches isn't exactly new technology—it's just been inexplicably absent from Apple's platform until now. In a Reddit post from Strava's product team, the news was welcomed by runners, cyclists, and hikers who've long wondered why their Apple Watch couldn't do what Garmin and Coros devices have offered for years.\n\nThe core update here is users can now view maps directly on their Apple Watch during activities, seeing both where they're headed and how to backtrack if they take a wrong turn. For subscribers, saved Routes work hands-free and function offline, eliminating the need to pull out your phone mid-run or mid-ride to check directions.\n\nTo access routes directly on your watch, press the Route icon while selecting the Sport Type that you’ll record.  Once you’ve selected the saved route you want to follow, the activity will start recording.\n\nTo then access the map while in the middle of recording your activity, simply swipe up on your watch face. Once on the map screen, you will be able to follow your live location and, if added, your saved route. To zoom or pan the map, tap the watch face to unlock interactive mode. If you want to turn back to your Stat screen, tap the back icon or use the watch scroll button.\n\nAlongside route navigation, Strava added two more training features:\n\nCustom Laps let you mark intervals with a single tap, useful for tempo runs, hill repeats, or comparing efforts against your previous performances.\n\nLive Segments provide real-time feedback when you hit a tracked segment. Subscribers can see whether they're ahead or behind their personal record as it happens, while all users get live progress updates.\n\nAs always, you can also turn to route suggestions that draw from Strava's massive activity database full of actual paths that real users have tested and preferred.\n\nFor Apple Watch users who've grown accustomed to working around Strava's limitations, this update rocks. Less phone checking means more attention on the road, trail, or effort itself.\n\nMaybe it's taken longer than it should have, but Apple Watch users are finally caught up. Whether that's enough to satisfy those who've already migrated to other platforms remains to be seen, but for the loyal holdouts, it's about time.",

    "description": "You might want to disable the buggy \"Take a Message\" feature on your Pixel phone.",
    "fullText": "A recent Google Pixel feature is reportedly turning on the microphone when it's not supposed to, and Google's finally acknowledged that there's a bug. Reports started as early as last September and gained traction last week, and now, Google has removed the feature on some older phones.\n\nCalled \"Take a Message,\" the buggy feature was released last year and is supposed to automatically transcribe voicemails as they're coming in, as well as detect and mark spam calls. Unfortunately, according to reports from multiple users on Reddit (as initially spotted by 9to5Google), the feature has started turning on the microphone while taking voicemails, allowing whoever is leaving you a voicemail to hear you. Audio leaks are bad in any circumstance, but they must feel especially nasty if you're trying to pretend you're not there.\n\nAffected users have have found that while the caller can hear the audio from the person receiving the voicemail, there's no indication on the receiver's end that their audio can be heard, aside from the green microphone indicator possibly turning on.\n\nThe issue has been reported affecting Pixel devices ranging from the Pixel 4 to the Pixel 10, and on a recent support page, Google's finally acknowledging it. However, the company's action might not be enough, depending on how cautious you want to be.\n\nAccording to Community Manager Siri Tejaswini, the company has \"investigated this issue,\" and has confirmed it \"affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and 5 devices under very specific and rare circumstances.\" The post doesn't go any further on the how and why of the diagnosis, but says that Google is now disabling Take a Message and \"next-gen Call Screen features\" on these devices.\n\nNext-gen Call Screen is a separate feature that allows Google's AI to ask a caller their name and the purpose of their call before taking a message. No bugs have been reported for it, but Google says it's disabling both features out of \"an abundance of caution.\"\n\nWhile this should prevent the issue from popping up for users with those phones, it's a bit of a heavy-handed fix. I've reached out to Google to check if Take a Message is only being removed temporarily while the company fixes the bug, or if it will now be permanently gone. In the meantime, Tejaswini does say that Pixel 4 and 5 owners will still be able to use manual and automatic Call Screening, which provide basic protection against spam. The post also suggests that affected users can rely on any call screening features provided by their cellular carriers.\n\nWhile it's encouraging that Google is taking action on the Take a Message bug, the company only seems to be acknowledging it for Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 models, at least for now. I've asked Google whether owners of other Pixel models should be worried, as user reports seem split on this. Still, because some have mentioned an issue with even the most up-to-date Pixel phone, if you want to practice your own abundance of caution, it might be worth disabling Take a Message on your device, regardless of its model number.\n\nTo do this, open your Phone app, then tap the three-lined menu icon at the top-left of the page. Navigate to Settings > Call Assist > Take a Message, and toggle the feature off.",

But I think I can realistically challenge for fourth at least,\" he told BBC Sport Scotland.\n\n\"Between now and then, I'm just focused on getting stronger to close the gap with the lifters ranked above me.\n\n\"I learnt so much from competing in the World Championships. The first was the junior version - but a lot of the lessons were to do with travel. This time I will be at home, in front of a Scottish crowd for the first time.\n\n\"That's going to be emotional. It's been my dream to compete in the Commonwealth Games since taking up the sport. I never thought I'd get the chance to do it at home.\n\n\"When Australia dropped out and Glasgow stepped in, I knew I had to be there. It will be one of the proudest moments of my life.\"",

Rugby isn't eternal, but friendship is.\"\n\nNew Zealand-born Atonio won 68 caps for France, was part of their 2022 Grand Slam-winning side and started all five games in their title-winning Six Nations campaign in 2025.\n\nHooker Jamie George, who has faced Atonio in front-row battles for both club and country, also paid tribute.\n\n\"On behalf of the England squad, I want to send Uini all our very best wishes following his retirement,\" he said.\n\n\"A huge competitor on the field and a great man. We're thinking of him and wishing him strength and good health.\"",

    "fullText": "Kai Havertz made his first start of the 2025/26 campaign on Wednesday night, making the lineup at home to Kairat Almaty in the Champions League’s final League Phase fixture.\n\nYet Victor Gyokeres didn’t drop out of the team for Havertz, with the German international instead playing in midfield behind the Swedish striker.\n\nThe system worked wonders, with Havertz assisting Gyokeres’ opening goal less than three minutes into the match. Gyokeres’ physicality then opened up space for Havertz to score in the 15th minute, and Havertz’s ball across the box led to Gyokeres assisting Gabriel Martinelli’s goal in the 36th.\n\nBoth players left the game with a goal and an assist, so perhaps it was no surprise Gyokeres was pleased to see Havertz back involved.\n\n“It was great to have Kai back,” Gyokeres said afterwards. “He performed great this game, even though he only played 45, so yeah, it went really well, I think.”\n\nMikel Arteta agreed, saying: “I think the quality that [Havertz] showed, the way he connected with the team, the goal that he scored, the assist that he made in the first half – a really positive performance.\n\n“He can play in [all positions] I think – right, left, attacking midfielder or nine. It doesn’t change much for him, depending on the position, the relationships we have around him, and the players that are available as well.\n\n“The good thing is that he’s fit, he’s available and he’s going to give us so much.”\n\nThe question now is whether Havertz is ready to have an immediate impact in the Premier League as well. Arteta wouldn’t commit on whether the 26-year-old is ready for league starts, but he suggested the player will be knocking on the door ahead of this weekend.\n\n“For sure, he wanted to continue playing today, so I know what is coming tomorrow!” Arteta said of Havertz’s desire to face Leeds. “From now on, we have to make a decision whether he starts or not in these competitions.”",

    "fullText": "Inter close out the UEFA Champions League League Phase with a prestigious 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Signal Iduna Park, thanks to goals from Federico Dimarco and Andy Diouf. The Nerazzurri finish in 10th place. That finish secures them a spot in the knockout-stage playoff draw as a seeded team, where they will face either Benfica or Bodø/Glimt. A truly European night, reflected both on the pitch and in the stats.\n\nThe win against Dortmund backs up Inter's impressive away form in the Champions League. The Nerazzurri have won six of their last eight European away games (excluding neutral venues), with just one draw and one loss, matching the number of wins they achieved in the previous fifteen matches. The result also adds another positive stat in the head-to-head record against Borussia Dortmund: Inter have remained unbeaten in four of the five previous encounters in the UEFA Champions League and European Cup, with three wins and one draw, and have won three of the last four meetings.\n\nDimarco’s goal also makes club history: Inter have scored from a direct free kick in a Champions League away game for the first time since 6 April 2010, when Wesley Sneijder found the net against CSKA Moscow.\n\nFederico Dimarco continues to be a standout playeras of Inter’s season. His stunning left-footed free kick paved the way for victory in Germany and underlines his incredible numbers: he is the only defender in Europe’s top five leagues to have more than five goals and more than five assists across all competitions this season, with a current tally of six goals and seven assists. On top of that, it was a special night personally for the No. 32, as he wore the captain’s armband for the first time this season.\n\nDimarco’s goal in Dortmund also has a historic European significance. The last Italian to score from a direct free kick in the UEFA Champions League was Francesco Totti for Roma against CSKA Moscow on 25 November 2014. Looking specifically at defenders, the last to achieve it for an Italian club was Dani Alves with Juventus against Dinamo Zagreb.\n\nIn the closing stages, Andy Diouf also enjoyed a personal milestone, putting the finishing touch on Inter’s victory. The goal was his first in the UEFA Champions League, achieved in just his fourth appearance in the competition and his second wearing the Inter shirt, a milestone that reflects his growing impact on the team’s European campaign.\n\nFrancesco Acerbi also put out a top-level performance, standing out with flawless build-up play. The defender completed all 44 of his attempted passes, finishing the match with 100% accuracy. That puts him among the very best in Inter’s Champions League history: since 2003/04, only Milan Skriniar against Viktoria Plzen in 2022 and Javier Zanetti against Tottenham in 2010 have completed more passes while keeping a perfect passing rate.",

    "fullText": "Eddie Hall has found himself in the ring with two influencers again, this time in another unusual 2 vs 1 boxing match.\n\nHall, who made his name as a Strongman competitor, has spent the last few years exploring different combat sports, including arm wrestling and boxing.\n\nThis past year, he finally stepped into an MMA cage, picking up a controversial win over Mariusz Pudzianowski after dedicating years to training for the sport.\n\nSeveral months on from that fight, Hall’s latest move sees him back in another strange setup.\n\nFollowing his quick success in MMA, it seemed inevitable that the 38-year-old would continue in the sport, and would potentially take on former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, who continues to look for a fight.\n\nHowever, since then, there hasn’t been much news about Hall’s next move in combat sports. But he’s still finding ways to stay active and grab attention with some unusual ventures.\n\nJust recently, a video made the rounds on social media showing Hall stepping into another two vs one boxing match against a pair of influencers.\n\nThis wasn’t new territory for Hall. Back in 2024, he knocked out two featherweights at once during what many called a ‘freak fight’.\n\nBut this latest fight didn’t go as smoothly as that one did. One of his opponents was Dean Alex (Dean.dodd online), who regularly takes on odd challenges set by his 750,000 followers.\n\nThe other was Kristen Hanby, whose prank videos have built him an audience of 8.2 million people online.\n\nDuring the fight, Dodd took several knockdowns from Hall but also managed to land a few clean shots himself. Fortunately for both Dodd and Hanby, it was all light-hearted sparring rather than anything meant to cause real harm.\n\nIt’s looking more and more likely that Hall will be back in the MMA cage before the end of the year.\n\nHowever, with influencer boxing on the rise, there’s also a chance his next appearance could come back inside the ring rather than under MMA rules.",

    "fullText": "Charles Barkley isn’t holding back his disappointment over Michael Jordan’s NBC appearances this season. Fans had eagerly awaited the NBA legend’s insights on modern basketball as the network returned to airing games in 2025-26, but what aired left many underwhelmed.\n\nBarkley, speaking candidly, called the arrangement “disingenuous” and criticized NBC, claiming the rollout didn’t live up to the hype surrounding the six-time NBA Finals champion.\n\nCharles Barkley, whose relationship with Michael Jordan has cooled over the years, expressed frustration on SiriusXM NBA Radio. “I was excited to have Michael because Michael Jordan is the reason we all make this money from the NBA,” he said. He added, “But now you see this thing coming out with NBC… one interview five months ago, and you’re all gonna sprinkle it throughout the season? Come on, man. That’s disingenuous by NBC. That’s crazy.”\n\nBarkley didn’t mince words about how the network handled the coverage. “It’s a bad look for NBC, it’s just a bad look, plain and simple. They couldn’t fly to Michael like once a month and do a new interview? That makes NBC look really bad,” he added, emphasizing his disappointment in the setup. ( via Awful Announcing)\n\nMichael Jordan’s appearance was restricted to a single pre-recorded segment, MJ: Insights to Excellence, which ran across a few shows. While it offered some interesting takes, a lot of fans were hoping for deeper commentary on the state of today’s game. Host Mike Tirico defended the setup, saying Jordan “really wanted to talk about where he sees the game right now,” adding that viewers still got to hear his perspective, even if it wasn’t as in-depth as expected.\n\nTirico noted that Jordan’s love for basketball really shone through. He loves the game, and in some ways, he’s not a fan of where it’s headed, and he wanted to share that, Tirico said. Tirico also acknowledged that while the segment might not have satisfied every fan craving MJ insight, it was still special to hear from the legend himself. Tirico also hinted that future appearances could give fans even more of the coverage they’re hoping for.\n\nThe post NBA Veteran Targets Michael Jordan & NBC Deal: ‘It’s Bad’ appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Joao Pedro took centre stage for Chelsea on Wednesday night, scoring twice in the second half to give Liam Rosenior’s side a big boost.\n\nHe had already scored against Crystal Palace on Sunday and got on the scoresheet in the win over Brentford before that. It continued a good run of form for the Brazilian, who stepped up again when his team needed it.\n\nEnzo Fernandez put Chelsea ahead early from the penalty spot, but United turned it around with goals from Antonio Vergara and Rasmus Hojlund just before half-time. Still, Rosenior’s side did not look rattled going into the break.\n\nThe former Watford man then fired home a low left-footed drive from 25 yards out to pull his side level. Later in the half, he finished off a swift counter-attack with his right foot to put Chelsea back in front.\n\nChelsea’s win secured sixth place in a 36-team field, earning them a spot in the last 16 and avoiding the play-off round altogether. It has been a promising start under Rosenior, and Pedro was asked about what he has brought to the squad.\n\nPedro spoke with Jamie Carragher on CBS Sports after the match, highlighting that Rosenior is focused on raising intensity and tightening up Chelsea’s shape. He pointed out that Enzo Maresca put more emphasis on how they controlled possession.\n\n“I think Liam is electric. He wants to play with more intensity, to be more compact. If you see my second goal, I was low.\n\n“He wants us to come low to connect the team and create space for others to run behind. Enzo is more with the ball; he’s very good. But that’s the main difference,” the Brazilian star explained.\n\nRosenior’s media strategy has been built around boosting the confidence of his squad. He has not held back in praising just about every player, but the approach seems to be paying off.\n\nThe team is responding well, and with five wins from six matches, there is little reason to question the methods. Joe Cole told TNT Sports he felt Chelsea might have lost that game if Maresca was still in charge.\n\n“Liam is still getting his style of play. But the one thing is character. A Chelsea team, going behind, could’ve got rolled over a few months ago. He’s instilled something in them,” Cole stated.\n\nChelsea can now take a brief pause from Champions League concerns, with West Ham up next in the Premier League before returning to Carabao Cup action against Arsenal.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike says he is happy with the way he has adapted to English football – but expects more from himself.\n\nThe French striker has enjoyed a strong debut season in English football after joining the Reds from Eintracht Frankfurt in the summer, scoring 13 goals in all competitions so far.\n\n“I would say that I’m happy but I’m hungry for more,” Ekitike said after helping Liverpool reach the Champions League round of 16.\n\n“I expect more from myself. I have to keep working.\n\n“I play for the fans. They give me so much energy. Sometimes in the games, I haven’t scored yet, and to hear your name in the crowd, it’s just a great feeling.\n\n“That’s what I was dreaming of when I was a kid. They made me live that.\n\n“I’m just grateful and I want to give more to them to make them happy.”\n\nEkitike also says he is enjoying his link up with fellow summer signing Florian Wirtz.\n\n“I gave him a lot of assists,” Ekitike joked. “He needs to give me back now.\n\n“I think we can help the team and score. Obviously, as I said before, he’s a great player. He smells football and I love to play with that kind of player.\n\n“Hopefully, we can just do that and continue each game, every game, keep scoring and give assists to each other.”\n\nNext up for Liverpool is a clash with Newcastle in the Premier League, with Ekitike and his side hoping to bounce back from last week’s loss at Bournemouth.\n\n“Obviously, it’s annoying when you see the last game in Bournemouth,” he said.\n\n“What I can say is that everybody gives 100% of themselves. Obviously, as every team, we have to go through something. We stick together. Hopefully, it’s going to go better.”",

    "fullText": "Viktor Gyokeres insists Arsenal must keep their focus firmly on the present after his fourth goal in five Champions League games helped them to a 3-2 win over Kairat and offered a tantalising glimpse of what his partnership with Kai Havertz could become.\n\nMuch of the optimism surrounding Arsenal’s attack centres on the return of Havertz, who started his first match in 357 days and marked it with a goal and an assist. Gyokeres was quick to praise the German’s influence.\n\n“It was great,” he said. “To get the ball from him so early on and score was amazing. Then he did great on the other two goals as well. I’m really, really happy for him.”\n\nThe Swede struck early as Arsenal started brightly, carving out a number of chances in an impressive first-half display. Gyokeres admitted the tempo dropped after the break, however, as the Gunners were unable to extend their lead.\n\n“We started well and created good chances, especially in the first half,” Gyokeres said. “In the second half we didn’t play as fast or as direct, so we didn’t create as much. That’s why we didn’t score more goals.”\n\nStill, the victory was an important response after the shock of last Sunday’s first home defeat of the season, when Manchester United snatched a late winner at the Emirates.\n\n“Yes, we take the win,” Gyokeres added. “We’re all happy with the group phase and now we look forward to the knockout stages.”\n\nArsenal will discover their last-16 opponents in Friday’s draw, with Atalanta, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund and Olympiacos all possible next steps in Europe. But Gyokeres was keen to stress that domestic matters come first, with a testing Premier League trip to Leeds looming as Mikel Arteta’s side search for their first league win in four games.\n\nReflecting on the mood after the United defeat, he said: “It was disappointing after the loss and how we lost it, but it can happen in football. The most important thing is how you react to it and what you do after.”\n\nWith Havertz fit again and Gyokeres thriving in Europe, Arsenal head to Elland Road believing momentum could yet swing back their way.",

    "title": "Why Steve Holland could be key to Man Utd's revival under Carrick",
    "description": "Why former England and Chelsea coach Steve Holland could be the key appointment in new boss Michael Carrick's coaching team at Manchester United.",
    "fullText": "Ask people who know Steve Holland well how they would describe the former Chelsea and England coach and the same phrase is repeated.\n\n\"Football is his life,\" a source told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Whether it's Champions League, thoughts on players or something else, he has a hell of a brain when it comes to football detail.\"\n\nIt explains why, instead of sitting back and reflecting on the success of Manchester United's 3-2 win at Arsenal, Holland spent the return journey to North West England going through footage of the victory with head coach Michael Carrick and the rest of his backroom team to come up with a plan for Sunday's home game against Fulham.\n\nOn Monday, while the players were given a day off, Holland and company were at United's Carrington training ground, honing the sessions they hope will lead to a third straight Premier League win.\n\nAttention to detail is a Holland character trait, something he has relied on since joining Crewe in 1992, after concluding he would advance further as a coach than he did as a player if he dedicated himself to the profession at a young age.\n\nHolland, 55, believes only former England boss Graham Taylor was younger than him when he gained what is now known as the Uefa A Licence coaching badge, when he was 21.\n\nOf the rest of United's new coaching set-up, boss Carrick had not even started secondary school when Holland began his coaching journey. Jonathan Woodgate is slightly older than Carrick. Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion are younger.\n\nIt is why Holland's presence - and, through his England experience, ability to deal with intense pressure - is so vital to Carrick and his coaching team and why he is getting so much credit for the positive start to a tenure that has already delivered victories against Manchester City and Arsenal and taken United up to fourth in the Premier League.\n\n\"He won't be bothered about the scrutiny and pressure at Manchester United,\" says former Radio Stoke editor Graham McGarry, who got to know Holland well during his 16-year stint with Crewe.\n\n\"He will take it all in his stride and just do his job.\n\n\"His training sessions are fantastic. You can already see the Manchester United players are responding to them.\"\n\nNot that Holland is likely to be talking about it in public.\n\nA second trait that keeps being noted is that he is a man of few words, someone who is difficult to read. \"You never knew whether he was quietly content or silently raging,\" said a source who has worked with him.\n\nBut that mask can help when it comes to delivering messaging. The less someone speaks, the argument goes, the more likely their audience is to listen when something is being said.\n\nIt is far too early to assess Holland's work. It is just over two weeks since the coaching team were introduced to United's players as a group for the first time, but several well-placed sources stress the coaching team work as a collective.\n\nIt should not be dismissed either that while Darren Fletcher didn't win his two games in interim charge, he reset the formation following Ruben Amorim's dismissal on 5 January. The Scot began to lift the mood. He also recalled Kobbie Mainoo. It meant key players Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo returned from the Africa Cup of Nations to a stable environment, which gave Carrick the best chance of success.\n\nChanges to the training programme have been made, according to sources. The days are now shorter, but more intense. There is a different energy about sessions and more focus on individual work with specific players. The matchday routine for home games has been tweaked so players now arrive at Old Trafford slightly closer to kick-off.\n\nCarrick was given the job ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, in part, because of the work he does 'on the grass'. But Holland ran the sessions with England, allowing Gareth Southgate to take an overview.\n\nIn consultation with Southgate, Holland concluded England's formation had been 'too stodgy' in qualification for the 2018 World Cup, triggering the switch to a back three. \"Harry Maguire's ability on the was ball fundamental,\" explained Holland in a half-hour dissection of his work for the Coaches Voice podcast in 2021.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports before the Manchester City game, Maguire recalled his own dealings with Holland.\n\n\"He was magnificent for England,\" he said. \"We all knew what we were doing.\n\n\"I can remember a lot of time working with Steve and he really does drill in tactically how to defend and how to keep the ball out of the back of the net.\n\n\"It's basics but really disciplined basics. I feel he will have a big part to play in making our defensive record a lot better.\"\n\nSince leaving his role with England following Euro 2022, Holland has had a short, unsuccessful spell in Japan and undertook some work for the League Managers' Association.\n\nWhat he has not done is court media attention.\n\nThe Coaches Voice chats and others with the Football Association are rare examples of Holland being interviewed.\n\n\"The perfect number two,\" as he has been described.\n\nThe insight that does exist is revealing.\n\n\"With any session the more the players are enjoying their work the more you will get out of them,\" he explained in an interview published by the FA.\n\n\"It is important to try to find creative ways of delivering repetitive practice to stimulate the players' interest.\n\n\"The key always with practice is the transfer into the game. It is important to try and maximise the possibility of a transfer by not steering too far from the reality of the game.\"\n\nHe may be new to Manchester United but navigating the fall-out from a departing boss is something Holland has plenty of experience of.\n\nIt was then Blues manager Andre Villas-Boas who elevated him from the youth ranks to the senior team at Chelsea. \"I was on holiday in Spain,\" recalled Holland. \"I took the call on day two and returned home on day three. My wife still reminds me of that regularly.\"\n\nVillas-Boas was sacked after nine months back in 2012. His successor, Roberto di Matteo, won the Champions League but was dumped after eight.\n\nBehind the scenes, Holland was impressing. He survived the tenures of Rafael Benitez, Jose Mourinho and Guus Hiddink before quitting to concentrate solely on England after Chelsea won the Premier League in Antonio Conte's first season in charge.\n\n\"At a big club, every day is a drama,\" Holland told the Coaches Voice. \"It is never quite as bad as it is made out to be but your ability to handle these moments are decisive.\n\n\"My experience of life at Chelsea has taught me it is about winning. That winning mentality doesn't include feeling sorry for yourself or making excuses. It means you analyse and push to do better next time.\"\n\nThey seem like wise words given the intensity of the noise that surrounds Manchester United, who will look to add more weight to claims their revival under Carrick and co is more than a flash in the pan when they host Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it seems Holland is already having a significant positive impact at English football's fallen giants.\n\nThe job might be tough, and the demands might be high, but it is fair to assume the Stockport-born 'football obsessive' is in his element.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "MELBOURNE, Australia — Elena Rybakina fended off a late Australian Open surge from Jessica Pegula in a 6-3, 7-6(7) semifinal win Thursday night, to set up a heavyweight final against the world No. 1, Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nRybakina is not the world No. 2, but the No. 5 seed is the opponent Sabalenka would least like to face. She won their last meeting in straight sets, including a tiebreak to love against a player who has won their last 20 at Grand-Slam level. That was the WTA Tour Finals championship match in November, one of Rybakina’s 20 wins in her past 21 matches. In that time, she has picked up two titles and posted a 9-0 record against top-10 opponents.\n\nWith her huge serve, easy power, clean ball-striking and underrated ability to generate huge speed even when extended, Rybakina is one of the very few players who can take the racket out of Sabalenka’s hands, as Madison Keys did to win last year’s final.\n\nShe is also the world No. 1’s temperamental opposite. Where Sabalenka wears her emotions on court and lives through them, Rybakina is near-totally zen and unreadable, even though Pegula’s late surge in the second set brought some mild anguish across Rybakina’s face. When she won the Wimbledon title in 2022, her reaction was more akin to someone being told they could finish work early than someone who had just won their first Grand Slam.\n\nSabalenka may not appreciate how relaxed Rybakina will seem when she, by contrast, will be outwardly battling the stress of trying to avoid losing a third Grand Slam final out of four.\n\nSabalenka was busy performing media duties after hammering Elina Svitolina in her own semifinal, but when she sits down to watch Rybakina’s defeat of Pegula Thursday night, she will see a rival playing with complete conviction, bar a late wobble down the stretch. Things otherwise look so uncomplicated for Rybakina when her game is song, built around arguably the best serve on the WTA Tour.\n\nShe won the first six points of the match against Pegula, breaking early to go 3-0 up after 10 minutes. That break was all Rybakina needed to roll through the first set, winning 77 per cent of first-serve points and 79 percent on the second. She didn’t face a break point.\n\nAs against Iga Świątek in the quarters, Rybakina’s serving fluency meant she could tee off once the rallies got started, rocking Pegula back on her heels so much that she frequently gestured to her box about the experience.\n\nPegula, who hadn’t dropped a set all tournament until Thursday night, had found a way to diffuse and redirect Keys and Amanda Anisimova’s power back on them in the previous two rounds, but this was another level. And when she had 30-30 on her opponent’s serve early in the second set, Rybakina slammed the door shut with a huge ace down the T. She then broke in the next game for 2-1, with a devastating inside-out forehand return winner.\n\nThe pair then exchanged breaks, before a pair of aces helped Rybakina hold for 4-2. Pegula, a U.S. Open finalist two years ago and in the best form of her career, was fighting hard, but it felt like she was always swimming against the tide. When a fourth ace flew by her to move Rybakina to 5-3, Pegula let out a resigned “yeah” — summing up the powerlessness she must have been feeling. A game later it looked set to be all over, as Rybakina attempted to ease her opponent into submission one last time.\n\nA forehand return that flew onto the line for a winner to bring up a third match point drew another look of disbelief from Pegula, before a rare Rybakina forehand miss earned an even rarer show of annoyance.\n\nBut Rybakina could not convert any of them, and the very next game Pegula hit two return winners to go up 0-30. Rybakina drew even with the strength of her serve, but one tight forehand in the net and another long gave Pegula a break. The tension was clear, as Rybakina immediately broke back before again being broken, tightening up as the finish line approached and what had looked like a routine win instead headed for a tiebreak.\n\nOnce there, Pegula had two set points to take the match the distance, but Rybakina staved them off on the back of her serve. setting up a forehand onto the baseline with one huge one before an ace down the T took her to a fourth match point. This time there was no mistake, as one last clean-as-a-whistle backhand flew past Pegula for a return winner.\n\nAfter their straight-set semifinal wins, even with the late tension in the latter, Sabalenka and Rybakina will now meet with neither having dropped a set on their way to the final. They are undeniably the two best players in the world right now, and their meeting will be a repeat of the final here in 2023, which Sabalenka won in three thrilling sets. That was Sabalenka’s first major title, while Rybakina has not been to a major final since.\n\nEverything is set up for another barnburner Saturday, when the sequence of one-sided and straight-sets matches will be tested to the max by two such well-matched players. So while this is the final Sabalenka probably wanted to avoid, it is also one that fans desperate for a sustained competitive encounter will be relishing.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "USA Hockey has approved a new policy that will prohibit transgender athletes from participating in hockey programs that are classified by sex, including adult recreational “beer” leagues.\n\nThe new participant eligibility policy, which was approved on Nov. 15, 2025, and will go into effect on April 1, 2026, states that, “In all programs where participation is restricted by sex, athletes are only permitted to participate in such programs based on their sex assigned at birth, except that a female (as assigned at birth) may not play in programs restricted to females if they have undergone any male hormone therapy.”\n\nUSA Hockey’s Board of Directors said it adopted the new policy in response to directives from the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, and it aligns with their policies. The change reverses USA Hockey’s Transgender Athlete Eligibility Policy set in January 2019, which allowed transgender athletes to compete in essentially all programs.\n\nThe new policy notes that the “vast majority” of USA Hockey’s programs are co-ed, not restricted by sex, and won’t be affected by this change. All hockey players will continue to be eligible to play in those programs, which include most youth hockey, junior hockey, disabled hockey programs, high school and prep school co-ed hockey, and adult co-ed or “open” hockey.\n\nHowever, the policy also notes that some programs within those categories are restricted by sex, such as girls’ hockey programs restricted to female athletes, high school programs restricted to either male or female players, and adult hockey teams, leagues or events that are restricted to either male or female players. In those cases, players now will be eligible based strictly on their sex assigned at birth.\n\nThat distinction matters to people such as Harrison Browne, a former professional hockey player — and now an actor on the hit show “Heated Rivalry” — who called widespread attention to the change last week in an Instagram post.\n\nBrowne, who played in the National Women’s Hockey League from 2015-18, came out as a transgender man in 2016 but delayed hormone treatment until the end of his playing career. Browne is a Canadian citizen, so he isn’t directly impacted by the USA Hockey rule change, but he is concerned about it, in part because he’s in the category of players most impacted.\n\n“I played women’s hockey my entire career,” Browne told The Athletic. “A lot of trans men played women’s hockey their entire career, and women’s spaces are more safe for queer individuals, especially in hockey. If the choice is given to play in the men’s league or not play at all, most trans men would choose not to play at all.”\n\nBrowne stressed that’s not the case for everyone in that situation, with many transgender men happy to play in men’s-only hockey leagues, but that “some individuals may feel uncomfortable not being within a queer or women’s space,” which are typically viewed as more inclusive.\n\n“I’m not advocating for trans men to be able to take testosterone while playing competitive leagues,” Browne said. “I’m talking about beer league, where the discrepancy of skill level is huge. It’s broken up into skill, and that’s the way that we should be breaking that up, in something that’s just for fun, exercise and community. That also applies at the youth level, of just playing recreationally to gain friendships.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "After the Pittsburgh Steelers and head coach Mike Tomlin parted ways after 19 seasons, the Steelers have hired new head coach Mike McCarthy.\n\nThe former head coach of the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys has a Super Bowl win on his resume, but that doesn’t mean he was the right hire for the Steelers.\n\nThe Steelers didn’t have a losing season in Tomlin’s 19-year run, but are also in the midst of a streak during which they haven’t won a playoff game in seven consecutive years (which ties the NFL record).\n\nWhile a fresh face may help change the Steelers’ playoff fortunes, McCarthy hasn’t had the best playoff record as of late as his lone Super Bowl win was 15 years ago.\n\nMORE: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nMcCarthy’s .608 regular-season winning percentage (185-113-2) will play well in Pittsburgh as they haven’t had a losing season for an NFL record 22 years, but they need someone to get them over the playoff hump, and the Pittsburgh native’s playoff record is just 11-11 (including 1-3 in his most recent stint with the Cowboys).\n\nMcCarthy is also 62 years old, so there’s very little chance he’ll be around as long as his three predecessors, who had stints averaging 19 years. That doesn’t mean he won’t win in Pittsburgh, but McCarthy likely won’t represent a changing of the guard as he’s already lobbied for quarterback Aaron Rodgers to return next season.\n\nThe Steelers had a chance to reset an aging roster, but the hiring of McCarthy represents a bit of a status quo-type move. They have a few stars on their roster with DK Metcalf and T.J. Watt, but the Steelers missed an opportunity to rebuild their roster into a more modern one. With an AFC that is loaded with star quarterbacks, it’s hard to see how McCarthy will be able to get Pittsburgh over the hump in 2026 (and beyond).\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings, 30 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nNHL: NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl 60 graphic resurfaces\n\nWWE: WWE Power Rankings ahead of Royal Rumble\n\nVIRAL: Shaun White pulls off epic Central Park snowboarding stunt over Shane Gillis\n\nThe post Mike McCarthy was wrong coaching hire for Pittsburgh Steelers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Arvid Lindblad completed 120 laps in his first official appearance as a Racing Bulls Formula 1 driver, the only rookie on this year’s grid.\n\nLiam Lawson had driven the VCARB03 on the first day of testing, while Racing Bulls chose not to take part in Tuesday’s weather-affected session. They will have another opportunity to run later in the week.\n\nLindblad was seventh quickest out of the eight drivers who hit the track on Wednesday, but getting nearly two Grand Prix distances under his belt was far more valuable than lap times at this stage.\n\nFollowing an error during Racing Bulls’ shakedown at Imola that left him needing a car recovery, Lindblad will be pleased with how smoothly things went in Barcelona. The session should help settle any early nerves and give him a bit more confidence heading into what will be a challenging debut season.\n\nLeaving aside newcomers Cadillac, only two teams have changed driver line-ups for 2026: Red Bull, who promoted Isack Hadjar and dropped Yuki Tsunoda, and Racing Bulls, who turned to Lindblad after Hadjar’s exit.\n\nIt’s early days, but there will be pressure on Lawson to outperform Lindblad if he wants to secure his future. At the same time, the rookie will need to make a strong impression quickly to catch the eye of Red Bull’s decision-makers.\n\nOn paper, it was a clear advantage for Lindblad. He set a best lap of 1:19.420 compared to Lawson’s 1:21.513 from Monday and logged 32 more laps overall – though some of that difference can be chalked up to the team moving beyond their early system checks.\n\nKimi Antonelli clocked the quickest time of testing overall on Wednesday, suggesting teams are starting to ramp things up. While conditions were similar between days one and three at Barcelona, they weren’t identical.\n\nLindblad seemed to be working through a different plan than Lawson in this session – understandable given that he has more ground to cover across four and a half days in the car this winter.\n\nLindblad was working through his own programme during this session – understandable since he has more ground to cover over his limited time in the car before pre-season begins in February.\n\nThere was a minor hiccup for Lindblad on Wednesday when he came to a stop on track, briefly halting the session. Footage posted online showed him moving slowly around the circuit before coming to a halt.\n\nRacing Bulls haven’t disclosed what caused the stoppage, though given the nature of pre-season testing, that isn’t unusual. Whatever the issue was, it didn’t appear to be serious since he managed to complete 120 laps by the end of the day.\n\nThe new Red Bull power unit has generally run smoothly in early testing. Hadjar triggered red flags on Tuesday, but that incident came after a crash in wet conditions.\n\nHaas’ Oliver Bearman and Audi’s Nico Hulkenberg both had problems on Wednesday as well. While Hulkenberg managed to get back out for 68 laps, Bearman’s day was more limited, with only 42 laps completed.\n\nRed Bull’s reaction to Isack Hadjar crash shows contrast between Laurent Mekies and Helmut Marko\n\nDavid Croft uncertain all 22 cars will make the starting grid for the Australian Grand Prix\n\nFIA consider Lewis Hamilton’s 2026 Ferrari inspection before approving aggressive aero design",

    "fullText": "Opta had Olympique de Marseille’s chances of progression in the UEFA Champions League above 94% heading into Wednesday night’s final ‘League Phase’ match against Club Brugge. However, Roberto De Zerbi’s side would ultimately let it slip.\n\nA week after losing 3-0 to Liverpool at the Vélodrome, OM headed to the Belgian capital, aware that their Champions League fate was in their hands. However, they conceded twice in the first 11 minutes and then conceded again in the second half.\n\nBut it still looked like it would be enough for Marseille. The big screens at the Jan Breydel Stadium even congratulated the Ligue 1 side for their progression to the playoffs.\n\nThat message, however, came before the final whistle in Benfica and Anatoliy Trubin’s 98th-minute header against Real Madrid would knock Les Phocéens out, the Portuguese side moving up to 24th at OM’s expense.\n\nSporting director Medhi Benatia did not hold back in his mixed-zone interview post-match.\n\n“A sh*tty night, shameful. When you are a club like us, you can lose matches, like we lost in Madrid, like we lost in Lisbon, but you can’t lose like we did tonight,” began Benatia.\n\nHe added, “The truth is that, as a sporting director, what you have to do is ask for forgiveness, forgiveness from the supporters, from the people who make sacrifices for this club. I hope the players are aware that this was gross misconduct. I lost a lot of matches in my career, but rarely have I felt this feeling of shame. Conceding six goals in two matches…”",

    "fullText": "The FBI director, Kash Patel, said the inquiry followed a far-right influencer’s post about anti-ICE Signal chats\n\nThe FBI director, Kash Patel, announced on Monday he was launching a criminal investigation into group chats used by Minneapolis protesters on the Signal messaging app, based on a social media post by the far-right personality Cam Higby.\n\nPatel used the podcast of another rightwing personality, Benny Johnson, to break the news.\n\nHigby had posted on Sunday on X that he had “infiltrated” a group chat on Signal, the widely used communication app that offers effective encryption, populated by anti-ICE organizers in Minneapolis. Higby’s posts appear to show communication between Minneapolis activists in vehicles trying to locate and share the descriptions and license plates of potential ICE vehicles. He argued that the chats have “the sole intention of tracking down federal agents and impeding/assaulting/and obstructing them”.\n\nHigby pushed his disclosures on Johnson’s podcast, The Benny Show, where Johnson demanded a federal investigation.\n\n“This is clearly a coordinated infrastructure,” Johnson said, “and we’d like for the feds to take a crack at trying to get rid of this infrastructure the way they approach the mob or cartels or other terrorist networks, right?”\n\nPatel himself then joined Johnson’s podcast – where he made frequent appearances before becoming FBI director – and confirmed that he would act as suggested.\n\n“As soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,” Patel said.\n\n“We immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat – being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country – if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.”\n\nPatel was careful to say he was not investigating peaceful protests or first amendment activity, but added: “You cannot create a scenario that illegally entraps and puts law enforcement in harm’s way.”\n\nKevin Goldberg, vice-president at the Freedom Forum, told the Guardian that impeding or obstructing law enforcement would be illegal, but that when he reviewed the Higby posts he saw nothing obviously illegal.\n\n“I got the sense the [Signal chat] group has been organized for purposes that are fully protected by the first amendment: to observe, to speak and to alert others of possible dangers. I didn’t see anything that impedes or obstructs justice. The claimed ‘doxing’ of law enforcement is not necessary illegal.”\n\nGoldberg said the supreme court in 1958 established the right to organize even in secret as long as there is no illegal activity. “I would want to know what the illegal activity is in this case,” he said.\n\nPatrick Eddington, of the libertarian Cato institute, said the FBI had no business investigating. “The use of encryption is as American as apple pie. The founders used it before during and after the revolution,” he said.\n\n“The notion that Kash Patel, who clearly failed to investigate the criminal conduct of Pete Hegseth now want to go after people for utilizing first amendment protected activity and technology to warn their neighbors about violent out-of-control so-called federal agents policing their neighborhoods is beyond outrageous.”\n\nThe FBI’s quick move to investigate activists based on a far-right provocateur’s media posts comes at the same time the bureau has insisted it is not investigating the killing of Alex Pretti, the veterans affairs nurse shot repeatedly by border patrol agents on Saturday in Minneapolis.\n\nThat investigation is being run by homeland security investigations, HSI, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, according to an interview Patel gave Fox News, and a sworn statement by an HSI official in court.\n\nNBC News reported on Monday that investigators were reviewing body-camera video from the cameras worn by the agents involved in the incident, which could provide more important footage of the killing, which was already widely captured on cellphone cameras from multiple angles.",

    "description": "Microsoft showed record spending but slowing cloud growth and a big reliance on OpenAI",
    "fullText": "In its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, tech giant Microsoft reported $37.5 billion in capital expenditures, exceeding market estimates by more than a billion. The spending was up 66% from a year earlier, and roughly two-thirds of it was primarily spent on GPUs and CPUs, Microsoft executives said in an investor call.\n\nA few months ago, a report like this would have sent (and did send) Microsoft stock soaring. But on Wednesday, it had the opposite effect, and the stock went down 7%.\n\nAs worries over an AI bubble simmer, the market is more desperate than ever to see tangible revenue returns that can reignite belief in the great financial promises of the technology, rather than just another huge spending commitment.\n\nBut accompanying Microsoft’s record spending was slowing cloud growth.\n\nRevenue from Microsoft’s cloud services grew by 39% this quarter, down from 40% growth in the first quarter. During the investor call, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood attributed this discrepancy between capital expenditure and cloud growth at least partially to Microsoft allocating GPUs and cloud capacity to internal teams as well. Customer demand for cloud is still outpacing supply, Hood said.\n\nBut even if the slowing cloud growth can be explained away, what also got investors anxious was Microsoft’s reliance on AI giant OpenAI. 45% of Microsoft’s remaining cloud commitments are solely from OpenAI.\n\nAlthough OpenAI used to be the silver bullet for finance, growing uncertainty over the startup’s road to profitability and the risks associated with its ability to pay for towering, ambitious dealmaking has made some start to view any dependence on the AI darling as a potential burden.\n\nOpenAI has signed trillions of dollars worth of deals this past year, despite its $20 billion annualized revenue. Lately, the market has started questioning these overcommitments, as concerns over a potential AI bubble mount.\n\nIf it continues to take too long for AI investments to start translating to actual gains or if somehow it turns out OpenAI cannot pay for its piling commitments, it could lead to a sharp market correction and spell trouble for the U.S. economy, which it seems is currently held up by AI investment.",

    "description": "A viral video sparked questions about ICE pay. Here’s what official job postings show.",
    "fullText": "Amongst the countless videos uploaded to social media in recent months depicting clashes between federal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and protesters in states like Minnesota, one recent clip actually captured what would pass as a relatively civil conversation between the two sides.\n\nThe video, uploaded to the NowThis Impact YouTube account on January 14, features a pair of unidentified bystanders, who remain off-camera, speaking with a man wearing a vest that reads “Police ICE” and who self-identifies as an ICE officer (1). It’s unclear if they are in Minnesota or a different locale.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThe video begins with the two bystanders — a man and a woman — telling the alleged ICE agent that he “should be ashamed.” The ICE agent turns to them and states, “I love my job, thank you.”\n\nWhen pressed, he adds, “I can’t believe I get paid for this. I’d do this for free.”\n\nThe female bystander then notes that she makes a $200,000 salary, though the background noise on the recording makes it difficult to discern her exact job title beyond the word “assistant.” Still, when she tells the ICE agent that she went to school for “over seven years” to earn that salary, the ICE agent responds with, “I went to high school and I make $200k.”\n\nThe video garnered more than 2.1 million views as of this writing, with numerous commenters expressing their own feelings on the subject. Some question whether the ICE agent would actually do the job for free, while others disputed the claim of a $200,000 salary.\n\nSo how much do ICE agents patrolling American cities actually make?\n\nIn a longer version of the same video, a tag with the designation “ERO” is visible on the front of the ICE officer’s vest (2).\n\nERO stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations and, while it’s difficult to be certain what his official position is based on the video, the evidence on his clothing and the fact that he’s out in the field among other law enforcement suggests that he would likely be a deportation officer.\n\nDeportation officers are described on the official ICE job posting as providing support for work “related to immigration investigation, custody, identification and location, arrest, prosecution and deportation” (3). That includes assisting “with the apprehension of individuals that are accused of violating immigration or related laws.” In the longer version of the video, the ICE officer tells the two bystanders “I don’t care what they told you. If you guys get in my way, I will arrest you” (2).",

    "description": "In its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Tesla said fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Everything is going great over at Tesla. Wait, sorry, no. Everything is going bad over at Tesla. The automaker held its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, announcing that fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025. Beyond posting its lowest profits in years, Tesla's revenue from car sales was down 11% year-over-year, and it was the second year in a row that sales declined.\n\nIt gets worse. As reported by TechCrunch, on the call, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla is killing off the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. This isn't exactly a surprise, as the two EVs are Tesla's oldest models, with the Model S launching in 2012 and the Model X following three years later. It's been years since either have been strong sellers; while Tesla no longer breaks out their sales, in 2025 it delivered 50,850 units of the Cybertruck, Model S and Model X combined (a 40.2% decrease compared to 2024), with the latter two likely making up 30,000 of those. Honestly, this should've happened a long time ago, ideally followed by next-generation versions of both, but that was never gonna happen. Instead, Tesla gave both models a couple of enshittifying facelifts over the past few years, the most recent of which came just a few months ago.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said on the call, \"so if you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.\" The last units of both cars will be built at some point next quarter. Musk said their discontinuation \"is slightly sad.\" Boo hoo. He added that Tesla will support Model S and Model X owners \"for as long as people have the vehicles,\" whatever that means.\n\nTaking their place on the assembly lines of Tesla's Fremont, California, factory will allegedly be the Optimus robot. As The Verge reports, Musk said the \"mass production\" version of the Optimus will be shown later this quarter, and the first one will allegedly be built before the end of the year. We've heard how those promises usually turn out. Previously, Musk has said he aims for Tesla to build a million of them per year. Uh huh. He's also focused on getting the Tesla Cybercab out. We're not holding our breath for that one, either.\n\nPutting everything else Tesla and Elon-related aside, it is a shame to see the Model S get snuffed out like this. It did revolutionize the car industry, and while newer versions have been suckier, the early years of the Model S were truly great. Too bad their creator is focused on making the automotive world, and the world as a whole, a worse place.",

    "fullText": "This story has been updated to include a comment from Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n\nA Muskingum County father alleges in a lawsuit that his 27-day-old daughter died in March 2025 after she was pulled from her unsecured crib at Nationwide Children's Hospital by attached wires, resulting in a fatal fall.\n\nTyler Peyton, of Zanesville, filed the lawsuit against the Columbus-based hospital on Jan. 27 in Franklin County Common Pleas Court on behalf of the estate of Ellieana Peyton.\n\nNationwide Children's Hospital said it could not comment on pending litigation. No other defendants are named in the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Ellieana's mother, Mackenzie Marshall, gave birth to the girl on March 4. Shortly after the birth, Ellieana was diagnosed with a heart condition that can cause difficulty in the heart's ability to create effective cardio output.\n\nThe lawsuit says Ellieana was admitted to Nationwide Children's Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for monitoring on the same day as her birth. For several weeks, hospital staff monitored Ellieana, the lawsuit says, who was determined to be stable and scheduled to be released to go home on March 28.\n\nAround 9:30 p.m. on March 25, the lawsuit says a patient care assistant left a rail down on Ellieana's crib. Ellieana had cords attached to her for monitoring, and those cords were also connected to a box in the assistant's pocket, court records say.\n\nThe assistant moved away from Ellieana's crib and the lawsuit says the wires pulled Ellieana over the open side of the crib. Ellieana fell approximately three to four feet to the floor, according to the lawsuit.\n\nA CT scan performed the same night showed Ellieana had a skull fracture and brain bleeding, as well as swelling, tenderness and visible bruising, court records say.\n\nEllieana's vital signs and health deteriorated over the course of several days, the lawsuit says, including developing hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation and a rapid heartbeat.\n\nOn the day she had originally been scheduled to go home, Ellieana suffered an acute cardiopulmonary collapse, the lawsuit says. She underwent prolonged CPR, as well as being intubated. Testing showed she had severe brain injuries caused in part by a lack of oxygen reaching her brain, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOn March 30, another CT scan showed extensive hypoxic-ischemic injuries throughout Ellieana's brain, injuries caused by reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, the lawsuit says. Her condition was determined by doctors to be irreversible.\n\nEllieana died at 7:50 p.m. on March 31 at 27 days old.\n\nAn autopsy performed by the Franklin County Coroner's office said Ellieana died from her congenital heart defect, which was complicated by the effects of the head injury she suffered in the fall. Her death was ruled an accident, according to the autopsy.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking damages for medical negligence, wrongful death and misconduct.\n\nReporter Bethany Bruner can be reached at bbruner@dispatch.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Father of baby who fatally fell from crib sues Nationwide Children's",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan and Bank of America will match the government's $1,000 to \"Trump Accounts\" for employees' kids.\n\nThe banks each employ more than 160,000 employees in the US.\n\n\"Trump accounts\" are Treasury-funded accounts that give $1,000 to newborn Americans.\n\nJPMorgan and Bank of America are among the latest financial firms to commit to contributing to \"Trump Accounts\" for the kids of US-based employees.\n\nThe banks announced on Wednesday that they will match the government's one-time $1,000 contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts,\" for the children of their employees. Their announcements coincide with a \"Trump Accounts Summit,\" where President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are speaking.\n\nFor JPMorgan, the news comes just one week after the president sued the bank and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for $5 billion over allegations of politically motivated debanking. A source familiar with the bank's move said that the firm has been planning the contributions since Trump Accounts were announced in June.\n\nJPMorgan employs more than 190,000 people in the United States alone, Dimon said in a press release about the announcement.\n\n\"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future,\" he said in the release.\n\nBank of America shared the news in an internal memo, reviewed by Business Insider, to its 165,000 US employees. In addition to matching the contributions, the bank will allow \"eligible teammates\" with kids to make pretax contributions to the accounts via payroll deductions.\n\n\"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate,\" the memo said.\n\nThe banks join a list of companies that have committed to matching their employees' $1,000 contributions to Trump Accounts for their children, including BlackRock and Charles Schwab. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attended a White House roundtable in June and expressed support for the plan.\n\nThrough the program, the Treasury-funded accounts are available to every American citizen born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the program will start on July 4, 2026. It's one of many initiatives Trump has touted during his second term to give Americans free money, some of which haven't come to fruition.",

    "fullText": "A lawyer died during a flight in 2025 after falling asleep on her mom's shoulder, an inquest in the United Kingdom has heard\n\nRachel Green, 44, had several prescription drugs in her system as well as an undiagnosed heart condition, which is believed to have likely contributed to her death\n\nGreen's sister said her sibling had an \"abnormal\" heart test in the past, but \"was never referred to a cardiologist\"\n\nA lawyer reportedly died during a flight to the United Kingdom after falling asleep on her mom’s shoulder.\n\nRachel Green, 44, was traveling from Minneapolis, Minn., to London on April 30, 2025 when she became unresponsive on the plane, according to SWNS.\n\nDuring the flight, which lasted more than seven hours, Green reportedly fell asleep on her mom’s shoulder, but the cabin crew was unable to wake her up.\n\nAn inquest at West London Coroner's Court heard that Green had numerous prescription drugs in her system at the time of her death, SWNS reported. She was also found to have an undiagnosed heart condition.\n\nThe combination of the drugs and the heart condition likely contributed to Green’s death, the inquest heard.\n\nSenior Coroner Lydia Brown said, “there is no evidence that Rachel had any opportunity to be resuscitated,” and added that her death “appears to have been instantaneous,” according to SWNS.\n\nRoxanne Carney said her sister “had spent the past couple of years recovering from an unexpected illness, relearning to walk, and having to relocate back to her hometown in Minnesota to recuperate,” according to a statement shared on a GoFundMe created after Green’s death.\n\nCarney also claimed Green had an “abnormal” heart test in the past, but suggested her sister “was never referred to a cardiologist” before being prescribed certain drugs, according to SWNS.\n\nHowever, Brown said “there was no evidence” that Green was taking any of the medications “in excess.” She also said there was “no evidence” that Green was consuming drugs recreationally.\n\nGreen was on her way to London to do research for a historical fiction book she was writing about Eleanor of Aquitaine, former queen of France and England, Carney said in her statement.\n\nNow, Carney hopes to finish the book in her sister’s honor, according to SWNS.\n\nCarney said in her statement that Green “exuded unyielding strength and courage at even the most difficult times,” calling her a “saint” and “the best aunt in the world.”\n\n“We are at the greatest loss as we piece together a life without her physically present but forever with us,” Green's sister stated.\n\nShe later added, “Rachel was beyond selfless, always taking care of everyone around her and trying to guide people to the goodness in life, be it traveling, enjoying a play, or a gathering.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAs of Wednesday, Jan. 28, more than $5,000 has been raised through the GoFundMe started after Green’s death.\n\nFunds donated to the online fundraiser will go toward Lakeshore Players Theatre in Minnesota, where Green recently “revisited her love of theatre,” and a memorial for Green at Golders Green Crematorium in London.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates. The 30- and 15-year fixed rates are near recent lows. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are near recent lows. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is down four basis points to 5.93%. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed home loan rate is holding steady at 5.47%. Zillow compiles rates from those offered in its lender marketplace.\n\nStill under 6%: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined period, then adjust it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.93% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates took a dive when President Trump announced some proposals to enhance home affordability and lower mortgage rates. Then, they jumped when his push for Greenland raised international tension. Still, according to Freddie Mac data, 30-year mortgage rates remain a half-point or more below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nHow can I get the lowest refinance rate?\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of ARM?\n\nHow do 15-year rates compare to 30-year?\n\nWhat are current 30-year fixed mortgage rates?\n\nZillow Home Loans isn’t just a marketplace — it’s also a mortgage lender with conventional, FHA, and VA loans, to name a few. Learn more about Zillow as a lender.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nWhen you can refinance a mortgage depends on your loan type. You may have to wait up to 12 months. Learn how soon you can refinance your mortgage.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time.

    "fullText": "A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.\n\nThe decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.\n\nAn email late Wednesday night to the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.\n\nA federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country’s TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.\n\nNinth Circuit Judges Kim Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony Johnstone said in Wednesday's ruling that the TPS legislation passed by Congress did not give the secretary the power to vacate an existing TPS designation. All three judges were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\n“The statute contains numerous procedural safeguards that ensure individuals with TPS enjoy predictability and stability during periods of extraordinary and temporary conditions in their home country,” Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel.\n\nWardlaw said Noem's “unlawful actions have had real and significant consequences” for Venezuelans and Haitians in the United States who rely on TPS.\n\n“The record is replete with examples of hard-working, contributing members of society — who are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and partners of U.S. citizens, pay taxes, and have no criminal records — who have been deported or detained after losing their TPS,” she wrote.\n\nTemporary Protected Status, or TPS, authorized by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows the Homeland Security secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country.\n\nDesignations are granted for terms of six, 12 or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work, but it does not give them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn ending the protections, Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow immigrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.\n\nHaiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.\n\nMendoza wrote separately that there was “ample evidence of racial and national origin animus” that reinforced the lower court's conclusion that Noem's decisions were “preordained and her reasoning pretextual.”\n\n“It is clear that the Secretary’s vacatur actions were not actually grounded in substantive policy considerations or genuine differences with respect to the prior administration’s TPS procedures, but were instead rooted in a stereotype-based diagnosis of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti as dangerous criminals or mentally unwell,” he wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the government have argued the secretary has clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program and those decisions are not subject to judicial review. They have also denied that her actions were motived by racial animus.",

    "fullText": "LAHORE/HANOI/HYDERABAD, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Authorities in Pakistan have ordered enhanced screening of people entering the country for signs of infections of the deadly Nipah virus after India confirmed two cases, adding to the number of Asian countries stepping up controls.\n\nThailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, ​Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam have also tightened screening at airports. But an Indian official said there were no plans to introduce screening at the country's ‌airports and said there was no sign of any outbreak.\n\nThe Nipah virus can cause fever and brain inflammation and has a high mortality rate. There is also no vaccine. But transmission from person to person is ‌not easy and typically requires prolonged contact with an infected individual.\n\n\"It has become imperative to strengthen preventative and surveillance measures at Pakistan's borders,\" the Border Health Services department said in a statement.\n\n\"All travelers shall undergo thermal screening and clinical assessment at the Point of Entry,\" which includes seaports, land borders and airports, the department added.\n\nThe agency said travellers would need to provide transit history for the preceding 21-day period to check whether they had been through \"Nipah-affected or high-risk regions\".\n\nThere are no direct flights between Pakistan and India and ⁠travel between them is extremely limited, particularly since their worst fighting ‌in decades erupted last May.\n\nIn Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital's health department on Wednesday also ordered the screening of incoming passengers at Noi Bai airport, particularly those arriving from India and the eastern state of West Bengal, where the two health workers were confirmed to have ‍the virus in late December.\n\nPassengers will be checked with body temperature scanners.\n\n\"This allows for timely isolation, epidemiological investigation,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nThat follows measures by authorities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest city, who said they had tightened health controls at international border crossings.\n\nNO OUTBREAK, NO WORRY, SAYS INDIA\n\nIndia's health ministry said this week that authorities have identified and traced 196 ​contacts linked to the two cases with none showing symptoms and all testing negative for the virus.\n\nThe two infected people are health workers, with the male patient doing ‌well and likely to be discharged from hospital soon, while the female patient remains critical and under treatment, the chief district medical officer in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nIndian health authorities have repeatedly sought to reassure people that the infection has been contained and that there is no reason to fear an outbreak. Federal health authorities also said there was no need to screen passengers at Indian airports.\n\n\"There is no outbreak, there were just two cases in one district in (West) Bengal and there is no spread,\" a federal health ministry official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"There is no consideration for screening at airports in India because there appears ⁠to be no need for it.\"\n\nAsked about Indian passengers being screened at airports across Asia, the official ​said it was the sovereign right of countries to do what they think is best.\n\nNipah ​is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40% to 75%, depending on the local healthcare system's capacity for detection and management, according ‍to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe virus was first ⁠identified just over 25 years ago during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore, although scientists believe it has circulated in flying foxes, or fruit bats, for thousands of years.\n\nThe WHO classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen. India regularly reports sporadic infections, particularly in the southern state of Kerala, regarded as one ⁠of the world's highest-risk regions for Nipah.\n\nAs of December 2025, there have been 750 confirmed Nipah infections globally, with 415 deaths, according to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is funding a vaccine ‌trial to help stop Nipah.",

    "description": "Americans are drinking less alcohol overall, so they don't feel the need to take an entire month off for Dry January. Welcome to Wet Winter.",
    "fullText": "Angelo Warren has never poured as much hard liquor in his 10 years of bartending as he has over the past few months. Even this January, when there would typically be a pullback, has been pretty busy. His bar does a lot of corporate events where attendees drink for free, and people who would typically take it easy around their bosses are cutting loose. \"I've had to cut off hosts of parties because they're drinking too much,\" Warren, who lives in Chicago, says.\n\nOutside of events, sales are barely down, and customers are leaning toward the heavy stuff. Last year was mocktail central; this year, he can't remember the last time he made one. The night after we spoke, he snapped a picture of one of his order tickets to drive home the point — two shots of Grey Goose vodka, five shots of Jaegermeister.\n\nDry January is hitting a little different this year and, frankly, a little damper. Bartenders like Warren say fewer patrons seem to be partaking, and that drinkers seem to be giving themselves some grace on a month of complete sobriety. It's not that we're all becoming lushes — it's that the culture around drinking continues to shift in nonlinear ways. More people are moderating and drinking less overall, which may alleviate the desire to take a full month off. The rhetoric around drinking has cooled off, too, moving from \"ALCOHOL WILL KILL YOU,\" to \"OK, it's not great for you, but also, if a little helps you socialize, by all means.\" Many Americans hit the bottle too hard during the pandemic, and it makes sense they felt the need to recalibrate. But that time is past, and like so many trends, Dry January has become a bit passé.\n\n\"Last year, we saw peak adoption, and often when that happens, it becomes uncool again,\" says Adam Teeter, the cofounder and CEO of VinePair, a digital media company focused on drinking culture.\n\nWarren himself usually participates in Dry January. This year, he's doing a lighter version of it — he allows himself booze on weekends after work only, and he subs in nonalcoholic beers while still enjoying some shots with friends. He tells me he's too stressed to skip out on alcohol completely. It's a sentiment many people can relate to. If you're looking for an excuse to have a drink, the possibility of the United States invading Greenland can be one.\n\n\"Dry January has been very wet,\" he says.\n\nDry January is packing less of a punch than it has in recent history. A late 2025 survey from IWSR, which covers the alcoholic-beverage industry, found interest in a monthlong abstention from alcohol is stalling among Gen Zers across the globe. Google search interest in the term in the US is down. Consumer insights firm CivicScience says there was a slight uptick in American drinkers who said they wanted to participate in Dry January this year, but the number of people who dropped off over the course of the month nearly doubled. Respondents also reported lower commitment to making a long-term behavioral change.\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, moderation may be a cause for the sobriety slippage. Americans are drinking at record low rates, and even if they're not giving up the bottle altogether, many people are limiting alcohol intake. They're \"zebra striping,\" by alternating alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, or \"bookending,\" where they start and end the night with NA options. Others are leaving drinking as a thing they only do a little of on weekends.\n\n\"Dry January is becoming less significant as a different thing because in general we're seeing so many more people not drinking or drinking less,\" says Harry Kaufman, who runs that bar program at Odo, a Japanese restaurant in New York.\n\nData from payments company Square shows that nonalcoholic beverage sales are up by 19% during the first two weeks of January compared to a year ago. At the same time, same-store sales at breweries were up 7%, bars 10%, and clubs and lounges 34%. Essentially, as NA options become a greater part of drinking culture overall, people may not feel the need to approach alcohol in such an all-or-nothing manner. If you only drink a couple of times a month or alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic beers, you may not be too worried about imbibing a bit at a friend's January birthday party. People are drinking less overall, but they're also drinking less apologetically.\n\nThe more conscious consumption efforts are \"limiting the amount of people who feel the need to take an entire month off,\" says Tom Brander, the beverage director at Wilder, a restaurant in Philadelphia. Despite being featured in a few news articles and television segments about Wilder's nonalcoholic selection over the last few weeks, gross sales of those options have actually decreased this year compared to 2025. However, total alcohol sales are trending higher. \"We are seeing less people opting out of drinking,\" he says.\n\nThe public conversation around alcohol has also softened. A year ago, the surgeon general put out a warning that alcohol causes cancer, which ignited an online frenzy (and probably a few calls from worried parents). Media coverage around Dry January, Sober October, and Gen Z skipping drinking was at its loudest. This year, Dr. Oz is telling us some level of drinking is fine, as long as we're not doing it for breakfast. Physically, alcohol may not be good for you, but we've got a loneliness crisis on our hands that an occasional glass of wine at happy hour may work for some people in the socializing mood. (Of course, not everyone.)\n\n\"Perhaps last year, 2025, was peak noise or rhetoric on alcohol and health,\" says Nadine Sarwat, an analyst who covers beverages and cannabis at Bernstein. \"It's difficult to say, are we now stabilizing or reversing?\"\n\nJanuary is always slow in bars and restaurants, regardless of a sobriety challenge. The weather is cold, the holiday whirlwind is winding down, and people's bank accounts are in need of reprieve. If you overspent on Christmas gifts, you may be inclined to say no to beers with the boys on NFL Sunday at your local watering hole and even skip the six-pack at home to try to get yourself back into the green. This year, there are other considerations influencing drinking decisions as well — GLP-1s are helping some people reduce drinking, while economic uncertainty and continued inflation means budgets are even tighter.\n\nAmerica's relationship with alcohol is evolving, and it's hard to know where we will land. Gen Z is drinking less for now, but as we get farther away from the pandemic and more of them have a typical college experience and move away from their parents, that may change. And even if they aren't drinking alcohol, many of them are consuming plenty of other substances, such as cannabis. Much of the time, what determines someone's drinking habits is their finances. One of the reasons baby boomers drink so much is that they can afford it.\n\nJonathan Hunt-Glassman, the CEO of Oar Health, which provides medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder, tells me experiments like Dry January can be a \"learning opportunity\" for people to examine their drinking habits. Is it harder for me to take a break than for others? What are the situations I really struggle with? And while complete sobriety may be the answer for plenty of people, it's not for everyone. About two-thirds of Oar's members join with the goal of drinking less, not stopping completely. \"We've always believed that moderation is a legitimate goal,\" he says.\n\nLike it or not, alcohol is embedded in many parts of life — work, dating, celebration. For some people, sobriety is essential, but Dry January has become more of a mass cultural product than an actual clinical tool. It's OK to move away from moral binaries and symbolic purity toward an approach that's more manageable. The moment is messy; maybe that means fewer drinks, heavier pours, and less guilt.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin is one of the many California-based billionaires pouring millions into donations ahead of the state's proposed wealth tax.\n\nBrin, along with other tech executives, venture capitalists, and philanthropists, donated a combined $35 million to ballot measure committees in January, supporting affordable housing ballots in California, per a disclosure seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe disclosure was filed by the coalition \"Building a Better California.\"\n\nBrin was the largest contributor in the filing, donating $20 million. Others donated large sums on various days in January, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and PayPal CEO Max Levchin, who donated $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nOthers in the list include DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr.\n\nBrin's multimillion-dollar donation comes ahead of California's vote on a measure that would levy a one-time, 5% tax on billionaires in the state. The tax, due in 2027, would be imposed retroactively from January 1 this year.\n\nGroups like the one Brin donated to are part of a concerted push by billionaires to negate the need for the wealth tax, either by funding alternative programs or by funneling money into political action committees opposed to the measure.\n\nReactions to the potential tax have been mixed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he's \"perfectly fine\" with it, saying this month that Silicon Valley's talent pool was worth any taxes.\n\nHowever, other executives have taken a more defensive stance. Brin and Google's other cofounder, Larry Page, moved an LLC they are both tied to from California to Delaware in December.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said the tax would be \"horrendous\" for innovation. White House AI czar David Sacks said the tax, if enacted, would be akin to an \"asset seizure.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Palantir's chairman, Peter Thiel, donated $3 million to the California Business Roundtable in December, which has directly opposed the wealth tax.\n\nRepresentatives for the executives did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Last Friday, Minnesota business Catzen Coffee wasn't open for purchases — but it did invite customers in to hang out with cats and find community as part of a statewide economic blackout to protest ramped-up ICE actions.\n\nThis Friday, the general strike is going nationwide.\n\nAt least that's the aim of activist groups, unions, and some celebrities who have called for no work, school, or shopping after fatal shootings by immigration officers in recent weeks in Minnesota.\n\nIn a post promoting a \"National Shutdown,\" actor Hannah Einbinder wrote on Instagram that \"withholding our labor and capital is our most effective leverage. national general strike spread the word!\"\n\nActor Pedro Pascal shared a graphic of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, the two Minnesotans shot by federal agents, that says \"Pretti Good Reason For A National Strike,\" and posted in support of a larger strike on the 30th.\n\nIt's unclear how widespread participation in the blackout will be or what impact it may have on ICE operations. A website for the \"National Shutdown\" lists hundreds of organizations as endorsers.\n\n\"Last week's march brought out tens of thousands of people, lets make this Friday even bigger,\" the University of Minnesota Graduate Labor Union wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nThe January 23 action in Minnesota was endorsed by a slew of regional labor unions, whose demands included ICE leaving the state and no additional federal funding for the agency.\n\n\"Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families,\" Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said in a statement ahead of the January 23 Minnesota strike. \"Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.\"\n\nLocal news site Bring Me The News compiled a running list of more than 200 businesses that posted on social media about their participation.\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration's immigration operations \"have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets.\" Jackson said that will \"create a safer environment where all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe.\"\n\nUltimately, thousands of Minnesotans took to the streets on January 23, and an estimated 700 businesses closed their doors in solidarity, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\n\"I thought the strike was extremely successful. There were so many who participated that it served as a true roadmap for a larger general strike,\" Vanessa Beardsley, the owner of Catzen, said of the January 23 strike. \"For me personally, there was overwhelming comfort and gratitude that I live in Minnesota and that we are all standing together in this time of history.\"",

    "title": "Meta's VR superfans are livid: 'I feel like I'm going to puke!",
    "description": "There's only one life-giving product from Meta. Zuck just killed it.",
    "fullText": "As much as nearly all of Meta's products are part of my daily life  —  Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, even the Ray Ban smart glasses  —  I can't say that any of them make me feel more alive. Except the one that Meta just killed.\n\nSupernatural, the Meta-owned VR fitness app, has been my constant cardio companion since 2022. For about 45 minutes each day, I slip on Meta's Quest headset and smash through shiny targets flying at me with virtual baseball bats synced to the beat of Taylor Swift, Madonna, Imagine Dragons, Eminem, Coldplay, and many others in my living room. Throughout the workout, which Supernatural calls \"flow,\" my body drips with sweat, and my breath explodes in thunderous bursts. More than anything, I'm transported into a meditative state I haven't found in any other physical activity: reality fades away as I become one with the action.\n\nSupernatural, however, is fading away too. Earlier this month, Meta decided to lay off its entire staff — including its effusive, cheerleading coaches — along with 1,500 other employees in Meta's Reality Labs division. Some other VR gaming studios that Meta owned got the ax too. \"We're still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,\" Andrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, told Sources, a tech newsletter, last week. \"And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.\"\n\nFor now, the app itself isn't going anywhere. Instead, it will continue to exist as a snapshot, frozen in time with no additional workouts. But users are worried that it might start rotting away as licenses to the songs expire and workouts get pulled.\n\nAccessing Supernatural needs ponying up for a $300 Quest and a $10 monthly subscription fee — a big reason why it never gained mainstream popularity. But it still has a passionate — and vocal — fanbase, which is punching back, even as Meta deprioritzes the metaverse to make room for all-out investment in AI.\n\nIn the app's official 113,000-member Facebook community, a relentlessly upbeat feed of sweaty selfies from silver-haired seniors and retired moms, Supernatural's unlikely connoisseurs, Meta's announcement landed like an unexpected email from HR announcing that everyone had been laid off.\n\n\"I feel like I've been kicked in the stomach,\" one person posted. \"I feel like I'm going to puke!\" wrote another. \"Supernatural is my only reason to go into VR!\"\n\n\"Four years of Supernatural,\" posted another one. \"Almost every single day. I feel BETRAYED. I feel let down. I feel angry.\"\n\nMany others wrote long, emotional paeans about how the workouts helped them drop the pounds, reverse diabetes, or simply get through a rough patch in life. \"This is a huge loss, especially now with the state the US is in,\" one user wrote. \"Supernatural has been the best escape from reality for me and I'm so heartbroken.\"\n\nLike all successful Meta products since Zuckerberg first built Facebook in his dorm room, Supernatural was an acquisition. In 2022, when Meta sought to buy Within Unlimited, the Los Angeles-based VR startup that made Supernatural, for more than $400 million, the Federal Trade Commission tried to block the sale. Then-FTC chair Lina Khan argued that the deal would harm competition by allowing Meta to simply purchase a top player in VR fitness rather than build its own rival app. A year later, Meta prevailed. The Information, a tech news website, called the FTC's move a \"head-scratcher\" and a \"ridiculous sideshow.\"\n\nNow Khan is having an I-told-you-so moment. \"This is exactly what antitrust laws are designed to prevent: a dominant platform eliminating choice by buying up the competition and then abandoning the market when corporate priorities shift,\" she told me in a statement. Courts and enforcers, Khan added, should learn from this cautionary tale, \"especially as they evaluate Meta's acquisitions in artificial intelligence and other emerging markets.\"\n\nSome of Meta's employees are also concerned. \"It makes no sense to decimate studios you acquired,\" says a Reality Labs employee who wished to stay anonymous. \"It lowers your credibility. You will have trouble buying others in the future. But Meta does this a lot and also cancels useful things.\" Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJulia Meyer, a 47-year-old single mother from Texas who was once a Supernatural beta tester, tells me that after hearing the news about killing the app she had named her Roomba \"Mark Suckerberg.\" \"Roombas are not smart,\" Meyer says. \"They suck up everything around them, and they make no distinction as to what it is they're sucking up  —  be it carpet or dirt or your pet's tail. They just consume and bumble around. And that's pretty much the view I have of Mark Zuckerberg.\"\n\n\"There's such a community that was built with this,\" says Karla Mellinger, a 64-year-old Supernatural fan from Massachusetts who bought her first Quest headset with her COVID stimulus check. \"And now they're killing it, and it's a shame, because it helped a lot of people. Mark Zuckerberg can kiss my ass.\"\n\nPalmer Luckey, who sold his VR company, Oculus, to Meta for $2 billion in 2014, argued that the layoffs are actually a good thing. In a long post on X, which Bosworth retweeted, Luckey argued that Meta's acquisition of gaming studios made it harder for independent developers to compete. \"Change always sucks because people lose their jobs in the process,\" Luckey wrote, \"but in a world of limited resources, Meta heavily subsidizing their own (with money, marketing, placement, etc) at the expense of core technical progress and platform stability doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"I am sure that closing Supernatural made sense somewhere on a spreadsheet to some bean counter at Meta,\" John Hansknecht, a 62-year-old engineer from Johns Island in South Carolina, tells me. \"I don't think Mark Zuckerberg even knows how many people love this program.\" Last week, Hansknecht started a Change.org petition to \"Save Supernatural,\" demanding that Meta either revamp the app itself, or spin it off, so it can be \"supported by community funding or subscription models.\" It currently has just over 7,000 signatures.\n\nOther Supernatural superfans are taking craftier action. One user begged Zuck's would-be cage fight foe Elon Musk to buy the app from Meta. \"If there were ever a product worth saving, continuing, or reimagining under leadership that values innovation, health, and long-term impact, this is it,\" they wrote. \"This isn't just about software. It's about the health and well-being of thousands of Americans.\" Others asked Taylor Swift to take over.\n\nSome users tried to start a campaign to log in to Supernatural at the same time to \"crash the servers\" to get Zuckerberg's attention  —  until someone pointed out that a few thousand people would be unlikely to jam a company whose platforms are used by more than three billion people every day.\n\nWhat happened to Supernatural isn't supernatural: Tech companies have a storied tradition of taking a product with a small but fiercely devoted user base, deciding it's not \"core,\" and euthanizing it with a blog post. From Google Reader in 2013 to Pebble smartwatch when it was acquired by Fitbit in 2016 to previous Meta products like Facebook Paper and the video-call device Portal, the graveyard of tech projects with avid followings put to bed after the numbers didn't justify the continued spend is vast. The details change, but the ending is always the same: the product gets \"sunset,\" the community mourns, and the company announces it's focusing on the Next Big Thing. (Supernatural did not even get a blog post. There was no final goodbye, no last workout, no closing lap. \"They didn't just pull the plug,\" wrote one user in a blog post. \"They gave it a farewell drink with a turd in it.\")\n\nWhen I spoke to Lisa Messeri, an associate professor of anthropology at Yale and author of a 2024 book about VR 'In the Land of the Unreal,' I asked her a question many Supernatural users I interviewed kept asking themselves: Is it ethical when a corporation collects years of physical and emotional data from an app that functioned as a form of self-care for thousands of people, and then pulls the rug out for a pivot?\n\n\"The question is, why did we ever think that corporations were ethical in the first place?\" Messeri says. For decades, the tech industry has benefited from what she calls an \"endurable myth\": that better technology automatically equals social progress. Messeri points to Google's original motto ,  \"Don't Be Evil,\"   as \"the kind of grace that we gave tech companies.\"\n\nSeen through that lens, the backlash against Meta over Supernatural isn't just about losing a fitness app. It's the whiplash of thousands of people realizing that something they treated as a routine, a community, and even a mental health lifeline, was never anything more than a plaything of billionaires. \"Part of the anger that you're seeing \"is coming from this feeling of betrayal that comes with an enduring belief in that myth,\" Messeri says.\n\nFive years ago, smarting from years of backlash over Facebook's role in the 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica, and damaging whistleblower revelations, Mark Zuckerberg rebranded his company as Meta, hitching its identity to a vision of the future he called the \"metaverse.\"\n\nIts defining quality, Zuckerberg wrote, \"will be a feeling of presence — like you are right there with another person or in another place. Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology. That is why we are focused on building this.\" Since then, Meta has sunk more than $70 billion into making Zuckerberg's vision a reality, with little to show for it. It burned nearly $20 billion in 2025 alone.\n\nSupernatural, arguably, was the closest the company ever came to realizing it :  a truly immersive experience that made you feel like you were hanging out, laughing, and sweating to the beat of great music on the surface of the moon, or Mars, or on top of a volcano, or in the Alps, along with strangers from all over the country.\n\nUltimately, Meta's mission is to build value for its shareholders, Messeri says. \"It's not to build the metaverse or to pioneer AI technologies. When it seemed like VR or the metaverse could do it, they happily acquired all of these companies.\" Now that the VR winter has set in, she added, \"it just doesn't make sense for them.\"\n\nMeta's new goal, Zuckerberg announced in the summer of 2025, is building \"personal superintelligence\" —as long as we make smart glasses with built-in cameras and microphones that can \"see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day,\" our primary computing devices.\n\nTo help build this new vision, Meta has invested billions of dollars in building data centers across the country and hired top AI researchers and engineers from rivals such as Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Apple, among others. So far, the company has had little to show for it.\n\nSome of Supernatural's most passionate fans aren't convinced. \"I think sometimes Zuckerberg isn't great with his decision-making,\" Hansknecht says. \"I think he's putting all his chips on the AI glasses, and I just don't see society buying into it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he's still planning to keep paying Meta for his Supernatural subscription \"until the wheels fall off,\" he says. \"I hope that my headset doesn't just become an anchor for my boat.\"\n\nPranav Dixit is the Meta Correspondent at Business Insider based in the San Francisco Bay Area.",

    "description": "ICE activity and tariffs are making for an especially tough month for Perennial Cycle in Minneapolis. The owner is focusing on the community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luke Breen, co-owner of specialty bike shop Perennial Cycle in uptown Minneapolis. The following conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nPerennial is a specialty bike shop. We do cargo bikes, city utility bikes, and commuting bikes, and have been a niche business for 33 years.\n\nPerennial focuses on community events. Last year, we did 35 organized community rides. So, while we do rely on selling bikes, we're very community-driven. That's always been a big piece of Perennial Cycle.\n\nYou cannot be in Minneapolis without ICE's presence impacting your day-to-day. You just simply cannot. Imagine: We had to shut down our schools to keep children safe. It is insane what is happening right now.\n\nAs a bike shop, we've had meetings so we can be aware of each other's levels of anxiety — how we're doing, is everybody OK? For some people, it's going to affect them a little differently, and we've come up with a plan for if ICE is on the block.\n\nWe were closed on Friday, January 23, for the ICE OUT protest. To me, it's a big ask to have small businesses go on strike, and later I heard that it was the first general strike in 80 years. I'm really glad that Perennial did that.\n\nI also went to the march in downtown Minneapolis last Friday afternoon and was a little overwhelmed with emotions. I had no idea how massive it was. When you're in a march like that, you can kind of see the few thousand people that are around you. It isn't until later when you see those overhead videos posted online, and it's like, 'Oh my God.'\n\nIt had an amazing vibe. There was not a lot to cheer about, and yet there's a lot to be together about. It took a lot of awesome organizing to pull that off. There were restaurants that were handing out food. There were tables with cases and cases and cases of hand warmers. It was minus 10 when I went down there, and the wind was blowing. I did not expect that many people because it was so cold.\n\nWe held a fundraiser for MIRAC, a local immigrant rights organization, scheduled for Sunday. I talked with Brieanna, the artist and screenprinter I am working with. We considered canceling. Brieanna and I decided that canceling is exactly what ICE would want us to do. We did not cancel the event.\n\nThere was a line outside the door that was a half-block long at one point. Tons of people showed up. Everybody was just happy to be part of the community. A couple of legal observers explained what it's like to be an observer, knowing that lots of people are very curious about it, but it's pretty intimidating when you just go by what you're seeing on the news and on Instagram. That was part of the aim of the fundraiser: to foster observer conversations.\n\nWe raised over $4,000. We brought in, I don't know, probably like 20 grocery bags of food for a food shelf. All those things were great, but the most appreciation came from people saying they were happy to be together, happy to have a place to go and be around other people who were kind of in mourning.\n\nWe had little cheat sheets with information about the event that we handed out when visitors walked in the door. One of the things was, \"Yes, we're a bike shop Monday through Saturday, but today we're not. Please don't ask us questions about bikes.\" We just didn't have the capacity to do bike stuff.\n\nThere were plenty of people at the fundraiser who weren't familiar with the bike shop. But plenty of people who were like, \"Wow, this is kind of weird. Why is this happening in a bike shop?\" And that was kind of fun explaining that, actually, this is very normal because we focus on community events. We have Cambros containers for serving coffee to 100 people. We have serving trays for treats. We have all the things that are necessary to organize an event like this. The bike shop actually already has the musicians who were singing.\n\nIt's off-season for me. I am really happy to have found a place to plug in to be useful during what's happening in Minneapolis right now. Numerous people came up and thanked me for opening the shop and doing the fundraiser. Most of the kind words were about community and not about raising money.\n\nHopefully, the shop will make it through, but honestly, it is a real challenge.\n\nOur city's under siege, but in reality, we all know it's our country that's under siege. We know a lot of people are super challenged by what's going on right now. I sell pretty expensive bicycles. These cargo bikes are not cheap. So for me, the tariffs have completely turned my life upside down. I'm learning that there is a plural for the word crisis, and it's crises. And that's what I'm looking at — one crisis on top of another.\n\nI have high seasons and low seasons. It's a low season, so I have to be very protective with my money right now. Any loss of income is a big deal because we're barely going to cover expenses for the month. This is a typical cycle for a business in Minnesota, a very seasonal business, so none of that is overwhelming. But, yeah, that's why the strike was definitely a big ask, and I'm so happy I did it. I believe that the store will reap rewards on the other side of this.",

    "description": "Google said it will let websites opt out of generative AI features in Search. Cloudflare's CEO says that's just a start.",
    "fullText": "Google said its Search engine could break if the company is forced to implement strict new controls to protect and nurture web content in the AI era.\n\nThe warning came after UK antitrust regulators proposed new rules for Google Search that would give publishers more control over how their content is used in AI features such as Google's AI Overviews and AI Mode.\n\nIn response, Google said it is working on new ways to give websites more control over how AI chatbots and AI-powered answer engines access and use online content. The company faces mounting pressure to give content owners ways to opt out of having their data crawled for AI, while still allowing traditional search engines to index this valuable data.\n\n\"We're now exploring updates to our controls to let sites specifically opt out of Search generative AI features,\" Google said on Wednesday in a blog post.\n\nThat's a major concession from Google, which has been quietly but firmly pushing back against such demands.\n\nYet, the tech giant also warned that strict new controls could threaten its prized Search engine, which generates most of the company's profits.\n\n\"Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,\" the company said, arguing that search and AI are now deeply intertwined.\n\nGoogle says AI has been core to how Search works for more than a decade, helping rank results and surface relevant links. Creating sharp opt-outs for generative AI features, Google suggests, could undermine the basic mechanics that allow people to find information quickly and allow websites to be discovered at scale.\n\nAt stake is a deeper question about what Search should be in the AI era. Publishers increasingly argue that AI summaries substitute for their content rather than pointing users to it, undermining the grand bargain that has underpinned the web for decades. Google counters that drawing hard lines between search and AI risks unintended consequences, including degraded results and a worse user experience.\n\nCloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said the UK's proposal is \"progress,\" but didn't go far enough. His company helps run about 20% of the web and has been pushing for new standards to level the AI playing field.\n\n\"The CMA's recommendation today doesn't go far enough because it doesn't force Google to split search crawl from AI crawl,\" Prince told Business Insider, referring to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. \"Instead, it requires us all to trust that Google will not be evil when they build their unauditable black AI box.\"\n\n\"If the CMA wants to encourage innovation and competition in AI, the best thing they should do is force Google to play by the same rules as everyone else and split crawl for AI from the crawl for search,\" he added. \"Every company other than Google would support that because it fosters a healthy market. It's a no-brainer, so it's disappointing the CMA didn't go far enough today.\"\n\nA CMA consultation runs until February 25. Whether regulators can tighten the rules without, as Google warns, breaking Search may help determine not just the future of Google in the UK, but the shape of the open web itself.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Andrej Karpathy posted his \"notes from Claude Coding,\" describing a shift in engineering over the last two months.",
    "fullText": "He coined \"vibe coding.\" Now, he sees a \"phase shift\" in software engineering.\n\nAndrej Karpathy is one of AI's guiding figures. He was a founding member of OpenAI and later served as Tesla's director of AI. He also coined the term \"vibe coding,\" the AI-assisted coding movement that has taken software engineering by storm and was named Collins Dictionary's word of the year.\n\nIn his \"random notes from Claude Coding\" — which are over 1,000 words long — Karpathy wrote about the changes to his own coding style. Posted on X on Monday, the notes have already elicited reactions from engineers at Anthropic, xAI, and more.\n\nAI coding agents \"crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nA few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in…\n\nKarpathy name-dropped both Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex as having significant improvements. Claude Opus 4.5, the model that has garnered much love from engineers online, came out at the tail end of November.\n\nThe AI leader's workflow has changed as a result of the AI tools. From November to December, Karpathy's 80/20 ratio flipped. He once used 80% manual coding and 20% agents; now, it's 80% agents and 20% manual code editing.\n\n\"I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words,\" he wrote.\n\nThe change to AI-written code \"hurts the ego,\" but is too powerful to ignore, Karpathy wrote. He also devoted a whole section of his notes to the \"fun\" he has while coding with large language models.\n\nWhat of those traditional coding skills, the ones you learn in a computer science program or through endless digital courses? That's a whole other function, Karpathy wrote, and one that might decline.\n\n\"I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually,\" he wrote.\n\nIn Karpathy's comments, engineers from leading AI companies sounded off. Ethan He, an xAI engineer and Nvidia alum, wrote that a \"10x engineer can be a one-man army.\"\n\nCharles Weill, another xAI engineer, wrote that founders can now \"divide themselves\" with coding agents, like a VC divides their capital over a portfolio of companies.\n\nBoris Cherny, an Anthropic staffer and the creator of Claude Code, wrote that he read Karpathy's \"thoughtful\" post till its end.\n\nThe Claude Code team at Anthropic may offer a model of where the industry is moving, Cherny wrote. His team is \"mostly generalists\" and filled with 10x engineers.\n\n\"Pretty much 100% of our code is written by Claude Code,\" Cherny wrote. \"For me personally it has been 100% for two+ months now, I don't even make small edits by hand.\"\n\nThe Anthropic employee also acknowledged the \"quality\" problems with AI-written code. Agents can overcomplicate things and can leave around dead code, he wrote.\n\nHis solution: having AI review the AI-written code.",

    "description": "How does the editor of Minnesota's biggest newspaper sift through social media to get to the truth about the ICE chaos on her doorstep? I asked her.",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Star Tribune is the state's biggest newspaper, and has been doing an excellent job of covering every angle of \"Operation Metro Surge\" — the federal government's mass deportation effort that started in December.\n\nBut it is also competing in a real-time news environment where everyone is a reporter, and cellphone videos and social media posts are widely distributed. I first saw the killing of protester Alex Pretti via a Reddit post someone sent to me Saturday morning.\n\nThat poses a challenge for Kathleen Hennessey, the paper's top editor: In a world where everyone can see everything — or, at least, lots of things — in close to real time, what can her publication do to set itself apart?\n\nI talked to Hennessey about what her outlet does well — and what it's not doing, at least yet — earlier this week for my Channels podcast. Below is an edited excerpt from our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: This is a story that's being covered by lots of different sources, including lots of individuals posting videos from their phones. How do you handle reporting on a video that lots of people have already seen, and seems quite clear? How many checks do you have to do before you can say \"This is what happened\" as opposed to \"There's a video that appears to show this?\"\n\nKathleen Hennessey: We are very careful. We know that a video that appears to show something does not mean that that is exactly what happened. Our language is careful. And we recognize we're not going to have every single video first, obviously.\n\nOur job is to verify it, and to watch it closely, and to slow it down a thousand times, to try to get the rights to it, and to call the lawyers, and figure out who took it. To do the hard work.\n\nAnd inevitably, that just means that we'll be slower than social media. But we'll be more accurate and more careful and fuller.\n\nWhat do you say to readers who say, \"I'm seeing this thing on Reddit or Instagram. Why don't you guys have it?\"\n\nAs a journalist, it never feels good to have somebody send you an account and say, \"See? Look, this is what happened!\" And you have to say, \"Yeah, I guess we're not quite reporting it that way. Yet.\" We're all competitive, and we know the importance of speed, but we're really trying to hold to our process here.\n\nYou've mentioned that your staff spends time chasing \"ghosts\" — stories that might be real, or not. What's an example of that?\n\nA lot of the story, as everyone knows, is being reported through these Signal channels that various activists and neighborhood groups are on. And they're saying, \"ICE reported here, ICE reported there.\" And you either get there instantly, or you are there in the aftermath. And they maybe were there, or maybe it was just somebody else in a rental car …\n\nI just think that's the nature of this. It's a hard story to cover that way. I think we're better positioned than some outlets because we're just closer to the community. We know these neighborhoods. We know what's real, what's not. We have had some luck in getting ahead of that and getting better and more solid information first.\n\nHave you thought about saying, \"Look, if this stuff is going to exist on social media, why don't we find some way of collecting it for our readers, because most normal people don't see all of the videos? We can say it's not verified, but you ought to see it.\"\n\nWe're having those conversation. I don't think people come to us for unverified information. Right? Our job is to show them what is verified and what is real.\n\nAnd we've all had that experience where we've seen a video on social media and then we ask, \"Wait, what is that?\" And then we go Google the real thing.\n\nOur job is to be additive and to confirm and to name places and dates and locations and get reaction and comment from federal law enforcement officials and others. To really paint the fuller picture.\n\nSo we are not yet at the point where we're trying to just gobble up all the [user-generated video], and throw it on our site and say \"Here.\" But we are collecting a lot of it, for the production of journalism, going forward.",

    "title": "Bad news, tech workers: A brand-name résumé isn't enough anymore",
    "description": "For years, tech work was plentiful, especially for those with big names on their resumes. Today, layoffs are up and opportunities are scarce.",
    "fullText": "New year, new layoffs — and Big Tech workers who spent their careers being courted by recruiters are in for a nasty reality.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon said it would cut around 16,000 corporate jobs globally. It's the second round of layoffs since October, when the company eliminated 14,000 roles. Earlier this month, Meta cut about 1,500 employees in its Reality Labs division.\n\nJanuary is historically a common month for companies to shed workers as they reassess budgets and plan for the year ahead. January 2024 saw more than 34,000 tech layoffs across 123 companies, according to the online tracker Layoffs.fyi — a monthly total that hasn't been exceeded since.\n\nHowever, tech workers don't typically face a job market this challenging. US businesses are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013, and tech job postings have plunged amid economic uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with dozens of laid-off workers — including people from Big Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Many told me they'd built their careers in a tech landscape where job security could be elusive, but opportunities were plentiful. Some said finding a new role used to be as simple as opening LinkedIn and replying to the recruiters who regularly flooded their inboxes.\n\nNow, despite impressive résumés and big-name credentials, many laid-off tech workers are struggling to land their next roles.\n\nLast year, US tech companies announced roughly 154,000 layoffs, per Challenger, 15% more than in 2024 and the most of any private-sector industry. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla each announced plans in recent years to cut at least 10,000 employees.\n\nThis adds up to too many workers flooding the market and not enough jobs. It's affected people like James Hwang, who has struggled to find work since being laid off from his IT support engineering role at Amazon in October. Although his résumé sports years of experience at Amazon, he said it's not as helpful as one might think.\n\n\"It felt like there was this huge brick wall from the get-go,\" said Hwang, who's 28 and lives in Michigan. \"I applied to 100 jobs but didn't get any interviews.\"\n\nWorkers in Hwang's line of work have had abundant job opportunities in years past, but now tech companies are getting leaner and expecting more. They're rightsizing after overhiring during the pandemic, taking longer to fill roles, and citing a need to be more efficient in the AI age. At the same time, the US has seen a decline in tech openings, down 33% on Indeed from early 2020 levels as of December.\n\n\"It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman,\" said Mody Khan, who has been looking for work since losing his Microsoft job in December 2024. He said he's depleted much of his savings and fears he could lose his home.\n\nDespite a five-year run at Microsoft, he said, even landing interviews has been difficult. Among the many challenges he's faced during his job search, Khan said, is that some companies he's interviewed with have seemed to favor candidates with startup backgrounds — making his time at a large tech firm feel like a disadvantage in those cases.\n\nTech workers who've experienced layoffs throughout their careers consistently pointed to one challenge that stands out in today's market: the sheer level of competition.\n\nSriram Ramkrishna was laid off from Intel for a second time last July and has been looking for work ever since. He said he has a clearer sense of his career identity than after his first layoff in 2016, but that the job market is more competitive than anything he's ever experienced.\n\n\"If an employer I'm interested in posts a job, there's bound to be at least 400 applicants,\" said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon.\n\nWhile most laid-off workers I've spoken with have faced more challenging job searches than they expected, others have eventually found work.\n\nWhen Deborah Henderson was laid off from Microsoft after 14 years, she shared the news on LinkedIn and helped start a Discord group for other affected colleagues. She said connecting with others provided emotional support and helped surface new job opportunities — including a referral for a role at Meta that she landed just two months after being laid off.\n\n\"It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows,\" said Hendersen, who's in her 40s and lives in Seattle.\n\nMike Kostersitz, on the other hand, struggled to find a new role after 31 years at Microsoft. He felt like a fish out of water in the job market, so he decided to hire a career coach to help him build a résumé, update his LinkedIn profile, draft cover letters, and tailor his materials for applicant tracking systems.\n\nIn particular, he added, it was difficult to know which parts of his Microsoft experience to highlight in interviews.\n\n\"It's like, I have 30 years of stories for you. Which one do you want to hear?\" said Kostersitz, who's in his 60s and lives in Washington state.\n\nKostersitz said he eventually expanded his search to tech roles at large corporations outside Big Tech. After six months, he landed a role at Nike.\n\nHis top piece of advice for job seekers is something he first heard from a career advisor provided through Microsoft's layoff package: develop a solid job search strategy — and stick with it.\n\n\"They said it's a game of chicken right now. The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job.\"",

    "description": "I visited my local Starbucks and I've gotta say: CEO Brian Niccol? My boy, you did a good job. It's a comfortable place to get a coffee drink.",
    "fullText": "First, I should admit that ordering Starbucks' new \"Iced Caramel Protein Matcha\" was an obvious mistake. I'm not a huge matcha fan, and combining it with caramel and protein (part of Starbucks' push into trendy wellness drinks)? Come on, I was asking for it.\n\nStill, I had to see what's been working so well at Starbucks lately.\n\nClearly, something is working. Starbucks' latest earnings report on Wednesday showed sales up for the second quarter in a row. This is a reversal of a downward trend over the last 18 months, ever since Brian Niccol, former Chipotle CEO, took over at Starbucks.\n\nNiccol's big campaign is \"back to Starbucks\" — attempting to revive the coffee chain to its glory days as a place people wanted to sit and chat and drink coffee, not just order over an app for pickup or drive-thru.\n\nThis has meant some small but meaningful changes: trimming the chaff from its drink menu, upping efficiency and speed, requiring baristas to doodle cheerful messages on cups, and refurbishing some locations to be more appealing for sitting and spending time — even adding more power outlets.\n\nThe location I went to in suburban Connecticut was completely new inside. (It had relocated from a building across the street in the town center.) So I got to experience what a fresh design looks like in a brand-new store.\n\nAnd you know what? Brian, my boy, you did good. It was a really nice-looking location. There were a few tables with padded chairs or stools, and a back seating section with three different styles of leather chairs.\n\nThe far wall was lined with shelves stocked with bags of beans and travel cups, along with framed art. The back wall of the barista's zone had a pleasing, earthy dark green tile. It didn't look like the Starbucks of the late '90s (when I worked at one as a teen), but it also didn't look like a copy of the minimalist, trendy coffee chains like Blank Street or Blue Bottle that usurped it as the preferred coffee destination of the discerning coastal urban office worker.\n\nWhile I was there, around lunchtime, the location was busy. As I typed this, seated in a plush leather chair at the back of the store, four other people joined me in the comfy area. The ambient bustle is nice, although I couldn't help notice the woman next to me was playing YouTube videos at full volume on her laptop with no headphones, which is fairly unpleasant.\n\nPerhaps Starbucks is trying to get back into the coffee shop/\"third space\" glory days, but some customers are still treating it like a public restroom that serves milkshakes — they're not yet following independent coffee shop norms and etiquette (where this kind of behavior would merit a good shaming from the workers or other customers. Me? I'm minding my own business).\n\nThe menu (aside from the screen promoting the Iced Caramel Protein Matcha) had been redone to list \"Coffeehouse Classics\" — a smaller, manageable list of drinks that resembled things recognizable as coffee-related. That was a nice relief from two years ago, when I found myself staring at a Starbucks menu, bewildered by all the newfangled drinks and feeling like an out-of-touch grouch. Sure, many of those weird, sweet drinks are available by customization, but I think the slimmed-down menu makes sense.\n\nYes, the barista wrote on my cup — a practice that I loathe. I find it offensive to the barista that they're forced to write \"you rock!\" on my cup, and offensive to me that the assumption is I'll be charmed by this saccharine mandatory gesture.\n\nAs for the Iced Caramel Protein Matcha? I'm sure some people might like it, but next time, I'll stick to ordering something that's more to my taste. For now, I can see why Starbucks is doing well again.",

    "fullText": "The stock market is flashing a rare warning that things could get tough for investors.\n\nThat warning has nothing to do with AI. It's the fact that the S&P 500 is now being far outpaced by the price of gold, according to strategists at Stifel.\n\nThe investment bank flagged the rapid rise in the precious metal, with bullion already surging more than 20% in 2026, compared to the 1% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nThat rally has broken down a long-standing relationship between stocks and gold, the firm said, noting that the price of the S&P 500 relative to gold has fallen below its seven-year moving average.\n\nThat's a rare signal for stocks that has typically been followed by \"difficult\" years for investors, Stifel wrote in a note. Markets have only seen the seven-year moving average broken four times in the past century, with the last signal occurring more than two decades ago, around the time the dot-com bubble popped.\n\nIn each instance, stocks have been stuck in a narrow range and struggled to move higher, strategists added.\n\nWhen the relationship between stocks and gold has broken down to this degree in the past, the economy has typically failed to see a burst of productivity and low-inflation growth in the years that followed, they said.\n\n\"The S&P 500 has decisively broken down versus gold,\" a team led by Stifel's managing director, Barry Bannister, wrote. \"Perhaps 'this time is different' and both the S&P 500 and gold will continue to soar, but to us that sounds like wholesale flight from fiat money, which has never ended well in history.\"\n\nThe firm said it believes the S&P 500 would see a consolidation at 7,000, a key psychological threshold the index briefly surpassed for the first time on Wednesday. That ceiling is also supported by Stifel's Equity Risk Premium and the firm's valuation analysis of the benchmark index, strategists added, pointing to prior research it published.\n\nForecasters on Wall Street are generally expecting another strong year of gains in 2026, but the outlook for stocks has wobbled occasionally as markets have been rattled by geopolitical conflict and fears that the AI trade is becoming unsustainable. Stifel, whose forecasts have leaned more on the bearish side, said it saw as much as 9% upside for the S&P 500 this year, but warned the index could drop as much as 20% if the US enters recession territory.",

    "description": "Jide Adebowale navigated a challenging job market after leaving his federal job in 2025. He ultimately found a tech role in Northern Virginia.",
    "fullText": "My 2025 was dominated by the tough decision to leave my job with the federal government in February. After signing the paperwork and moving on, I began thinking about what was next.\n\nI enjoyed some time off and dipped my toes back into the job market. I took occasional recruiter calls and experimented with freelance writing while spending time in Mexico City and Rio.\n\nSuddenly, headlines about a softening job market began to stack up. A year later, many of those same concerns still dominate the conversation. As coverage of layoffs, hiring freezes, and longer job searches became more common, I put my foot on the accelerator.\n\nI now work as a compensation analyst in the tech sector, but I had to expand my search to find this job.\n\nPrevious job searches had taught me the importance of patience and resilience. It's a numbers game. Leverage your network. The right opportunity is out there. I appreciated those general truths going in.\n\nWhen I encountered the familiar dance of recruiters who seemed enthusiastic and then went silent, I was prepared for it. Even an especially eye-roll-worthy sequence with an exciting tech company didn't throw me off: an interview scheduled and canceled at the last minute, a later request to reschedule, a coding assignment completed, and then no response.\n\nWhat proved far more difficult was the uncertainty behind it all. I couldn't tell which signals mattered. Was the job market softening because of tariffs? Because of AI? Were we heading toward a recession? Was white-collar work itself undergoing a more permanent shift? Was a referral the only way to get a job? I wasn't sure what information to anchor to.\n\nLiving in New York City at the time, I knew I was in a competitive job market, but I also assumed it was abundant. Even if there were millions of job seekers in New York, I thought there would be millions of jobs to match them. I began to wonder whether that assumption actually held.\n\nThe idea that I would find my next role in New York had been a fundamental part of my decision to leave the government in the first place, but over time, the signals I saw began to complicate that picture.\n\nI read an article that said New York City hadn't added any new jobs in the first half of the year. Having just left a role analyzing job gains and losses across the country, I was aware of how uneven labor markets could be.\n\nI also found myself thinking about my parents and how often they had moved for work. First from Nigeria, and then multiple times within the US, they had never anchored their decisions to a single city. They went where opportunity was. City preference came second.\n\nI still had no desire to leave New York. I loved the city, but as my buyout runway shortened, I needed a new approach.\n\nIt was time to run a labor market experiment.\n\nAt first, my expansion was modest. I looked at Philadelphia, where rent was cheaper, and Chicago, which seemed like New York lite.\n\nThe responses began to pick up. What started as a regional adjustment quickly became a national search. The Sun Belt felt abundant. Interview invites began to come from companies in Phoenix, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nMomentum was building. Geography was no longer a limiting factor. I continued applying in New York, but the priority had shifted. I wasn't optimizing for location anymore. I was optimizing for the best opportunity.\n\nI hadn't initially included Washington, D.C., in my expanded search because I knew firsthand how many federal employees were newly seeking work.\n\nWhat I didn't fully appreciate was how much the D.C. job market had evolved over the years. D.C. wasn't just a government town anymore; it was home to a rapidly growing concentration of banking and technology jobs, both within the city and in Northern Virginia.\n\nAfter weighing several cities, recruiter conversations, and potential paths forward, I accepted a new role as a compensation analyst at a tech company in Northern Virginia, which was a lateral move for me.\n\nAfter years of analyzing jobs and wages across industries and regions for the federal government, I would now be applying that lens inside a single organization, focused more narrowly on how compensation decisions play out in practice within a fast-moving, technology-driven business. The search was officially over.\n\nMany of the articles I'd read about the job market focused on how difficult things had become for new college graduates. Having just gone through a challenging search myself, I could appreciate that reality.\n\nWhat stood out to me was how central geographic mobility had been to my own outcome, even with several years of experience at a well-respected government agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to lean on.\n\nMoving isn't an option for everyone, and I resisted it at first, but it struck me as a lever that younger workers could consider. Data shows people move far less frequently than they once did, even as opportunities have spread across more regional labor markets. Historically, going where opportunity is has been one of the most reliable ways to create a new path forward, and it turned out to be the key to my search.\n\nI live in D.C. and commute to Northern Virginia. I found the cost-of-living adjustment relatively manageable compared with New York. Citywide salaries are only modestly lower, while rents are noticeably lower, and the rental market feels much more favorable to tenants. Finding an apartment was relatively easy for me.\n\nThe past year was defined by transition; the next will be about building. I plan to spend most of 2026 getting settled into my new job and life in D.C.",

    "description": "Wins on 3D printing components has the service anticipating that additive manufacturing will continue to reshape how it builds and repairs ships.",
    "fullText": "The US Navy is betting on 3D printing parts to speed up work on the fleet while also cutting costs after two wins last year, the service said recently.\n\nA Naval Sea Systems Command release said that additive manufacturing moved \"from a promising capability to a warfighting capability in 2025.\"\n\nTwo examples the Navy said were among the service's most significant achievements last year involved putting 3D-printed parts on its most in-demand and complex vessels.\n\nIn one instance, top shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries installed a 3D printed metal valve component inside a pump room on the new Ford-class aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.\n\nSimilar plans are in place for manifolds on the coming USS Doris Miller as well, replacing the traditional casting methods that take longer to complete.\n\n\"What started as a proof of concept quickly turned into a tangible result that is making a meaningful difference to improve efficiencies in shipbuilding,\" Dave Bolcar, the Newport News Shipbuilding division vice president of engineering and design, said afterward.\n\nAnd in another milestone last year, HII's Newport News Shipbuilding installed a 3D printed part on a Virginia-class submarine. The part met the standards for submarine components that need to withstand operations in the deep sea.\n\nWith successes making construction and repair work easier and cheaper, the Navy expects to expand 3D printing across the service as a new solution for long-standing challenges.\n\nAcross the US military, additive manufacturing is moving from experimentation to everyday use.\n\nArmy leadership expects this technology to be essential for soldiers building and repairing drones on the front lines, while Marine leaders view it as a way to lighten logistical loads. The Navy sees shipboard and port-based 3D printers as a way to keep vessels operational while deployed. And the Air Force is eyeing 3D printing to produce lighter parts and speed up aircraft repairs.\n\nFor the Navy, the logistics of sourcing parts — whether for new ship construction or repairs — can be a hassle, often requiring the purchase of an entire system to replace a single component. Long delivery times and material shortages can further delay repairs and stretch schedules.\n\nNavy leadership has suggested that additive manufacturing can also be the service's workaround for shipbuilding suppliers with long lead times and intellectual property concerns.\n\nIn 2024, Rear Adm. Jonathan Rucker, program executive officer for the Navy's attack submarines, told contractors at a conference: \"If you are a supplier, and your lead time is too long, and you refuse to work with us to give us your tech and help us figure out how to reverse-engineer it and how to manufacture it, not that we're trying to take it from you, we're going to figure it out.\"\n\nOther uses of 3D printing in Navy maintenance centers saw technicians saving money and time on repairing vessels. In August, the Navy's Southeast Regional Maintenance Center produced a chilled water pump cooling rotor for an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer. The part wasn't available to purchase separately from an entire new pump in the service's supply system, so the team adapted, and the cost savings were substantial.\n\nThe prototype cost $17.63, and the final blade cost $131.21, said the service. Replacing the entire rotor would've cost $316,544.16. The rotors are used on ships across the fleet, meaning that this method could be implemented for more repair jobs on other vessels.\n\nThe Navy anticipates further use of additive manufacturing, certifying more components for this process. It'll continue to spread to US shipyards, manufacturing plants, and support organizations, Adm. Jim Kilby, then the acting chief of US naval operations, said last year.\n\n\"Every time we 3D print a part that would otherwise take 40 weeks to procure, we are putting more capability back into the field,\" he said at the time. \"That is real, measurable readiness.\"",

    "description": "Leonis Capital founders Jenny Xiao and Jay Zhao tell Business Insider what they ask AI startup founders to evaluate their tech.",
    "fullText": "If you hadn't heard, there's an AI race sweeping through Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile stalwarts like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, are grabbing the headlines as they unveil model after model, there are plenty of startups trying to find a foothold.\n\nFor investors, it can be hard to tell which of these upstarts have true technical potential and which are likely to fade into tech oblivion.\n\nThat's part of why Jenny Xiao, the cofounder of Leonis Capital, said it's important for venture capitalists to get serious about understanding the AI technology they're investing in.\n\nLeonis Capital, founded in 2021, is now deploying its second $40 million fund. The venture capital firm is focused on next-generation AI companies and has invested in over a dozen since its launch, including MaintainX, Motion, and SpectroCloud.\n\nBusiness Insider asked Xiao and her cofounder, Jay Zhao, to share the top five questions they ask founders when evaluating their tech. They shared their responses over email, which have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe best founders don't think in terms of incremental feature improvements — they think in capability thresholds. We're looking for whether they understand that progress in AI is often non-linear, and whether they can anticipate which future capabilities might fundamentally change or even break their product.\n\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from our Leonis AI 100 — where we benchmarked the most important AI startups — is that the strongest AI founders build just ahead of the next technical breakthrough.\n\nA good answer talks about entirely new workflows that get unlocked, not just marginal efficiency gains, and clearly explains how the company would adapt or pivot as the technology evolves.\n\nMost AI startups don't fail because they're bad, but because they're building something that OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google can eventually ship \"for free\" as a feature.\n\nThat's why we don't accept \"they're not focused on this\" as an answer. We push founders to explain what internal constraint would actually prevent a foundation model lab from building the same thing. If the answer comes down to focus or culture, that's not a real moat.\n\nStrong answers acknowledge that the big labs technically could build it, but doing so would break their incentive structure, pricing, or distribution model; require operational complexity that doesn't scale for them; or shift value to downstream execution rather than model capability.\n\nSome founders can also credibly argue they have a 12- to 18-month head start. Weak answers, by contrast, lean on claims like being \"more vertical,\" having \"more niche data,\" or understanding customers better — responses we hear from about 95% of founders.\n\nWe've noticed a consistent pattern: Most founders underestimate foundation models, and most VCs underestimate them even more.\n\nAsking \"How much proprietary data do you have?\" is usually the wrong question, since no early-stage company has truly meaningful data. And if a founder's pitch boils down to \"we have more data, therefore our models are better,\" that's a red flag: foundation models often improve faster than proprietary ones, and the companies building them have enough capital to buy data and quickly close any gaps.\n\nWhat matters much more is not how much data exists today, but whether the product naturally generates better data over time. For example, industrial systems where data only emerges once software is embedded in workflows, or products where switching costs come from accumulated context.\n\nWe ask this question to understand where defensibility actually lives once code becomes commoditized. If a founder can't answer it clearly, they likely don't understand their own moat.\n\nCosmetic advantages like code, UI, or models are easy to copy, while structural advantages — such as being a system of record or being embedded into compliance, audits, or standard operating procedures — are much harder to replicate.\n\nThe question also reveals founder temperament: Strong founders are candid about their vulnerabilities (\"Here's what we're most worried about\"), while weaker ones tend to get defensive and insist a threat \"would never happen.\"\n\nThis question forces founders to explain their earliest technical decisions and the trade-offs they intentionally made, revealing whether they understand system dynamics rather than just iterating on features.\n\nStrong answers sound like, \"We chose to execute actions, not just make suggestions, which increased liability but created real lock-in,\" or \"We became the system of record instead of a thin layer, which slowed integrations and sales early but made switching organizationally expensive later.\" By contrast, many founders default to saying they want to \"stay flexible,\" which often signals they haven't yet designed anything fundamental.\n\nThe best AI systems are opinionated by design, deliberately removing degrees of freedom and hard-coding assumptions about workflows, authority, or data flow.\n\nReal insight usually comes from abandoning old assumptions. This question helps distinguish founders who simply stumbled into AI from those who experienced a genuine shift in how they see the world.\n\nWe're looking for intellectual flexibility, not credentials. Strong answers point to a specific belief the founder once held, why they believed it, and what changed their mind; weak answers stay vague, like saying they \"realized AI was going to be big.\"\n\nThis question assumes copying is possible and pushes founders to explain what isn't obvious. Shallow answers fall back on claims like \"they couldn't move as fast\" or \"they don't have our data,\" while stronger ones point to hard-to-see advantages such as deep operational knowledge, customer-specific integrations, or accumulated context that isn't visible from the outside.\n\nFounders who can't point to moments where they changed their mind usually aren't learning — they're executing a fixed plan in a world that won't stay fixed.\n\nThis question reveals epistemic humility and whether a founder is genuinely truth-seeking or just looking for confirmation. AI moves too fast for people who can't update, and we're especially wary of founders who treat every pivot as vindication rather than correction.\n\nMarket timing, regulatory shifts, and platform dependencies kill far more startups than bad management. This question tests whether founders think probabilistically about external forces and whether they've designed for resilience instead of relying on luck.\n\nFounders who say \"nothing\" haven't thought hard enough. The ones we want to back can name several concrete external risks and explain how they're hedging against them.\n\nThe best founders aren't contrarian for its own sake, but they can hold an unpopular position long enough for the world to catch up.",

    "description": "Stop basing your protein needs on your current weight. A doctor explains how most of us are overestimating our needs and sabotaging goals.",
    "fullText": "The proteinmaxxing trend has gone too far.\n\nLoading up on mountains of shakes, beef sticks, and chicken breasts could be making it harder to burn fat, according to a doctor who specializes in weight loss.\n\nProtein is an essential nutrient (alongside carbohydrates and fats), and it's crucial for regulating metabolism, as well as building and repairing tissue like muscle.\n\nBut too much protein has become a diet fad that can make it harder to lose weight and distracts from nutrient-dense whole foods, said Dr. Meghan Garcia-Webb, who works in concierge medicine. Her practice is dedicated to helping high-achievers like CEOs and attorneys manage their weight.\n\n\"The protein craze is totally out of control.\" Garcia-Webb told Business Insider. \"I definitely want people to have protein, but I think the quality of their protein really matters.\"\n\nThe ultra-processed food industry is making bank on our hunger for protein by adding it to chips, pastries, and bars, but these products don't offer much in the way of real nutrition.\n\nTo make matters worse, many people are getting more protein than they need because of a common mistake in calculating the optimal amount, she said. The protein overload can lead to excess calories that make weight loss more difficult in the long run.\n\nA few basic guidelines can help you understand your unique protein needs.\n\nA simple equation can help you understand how much protein to aim for each day, based on your goals.\n\nGarcia-Webb said that for weight loss, a good range for daily protein intake is between 1 to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of your lean body weight per day, or about 0.5 to 0.7 grams per pound.\n\nThat means if you're overweight and trying to shed pounds, you'll want to assess your protein intake based on your goal weight, not your current weight.\n\nFor example, consider a 200-pound person trying to reach a goal weight of 150 pounds. Per Garcia-Webb's recommendation, their protein goal would be 90 grams of protein per day (in the middle of the range for their goal weight).\n\nBut running the equation with their current weight — a common mistake — doesn't account for added body fat, leading to a goal of 120 grams per day.\n\nThe additional protein amounts to more than 100 extra calories. That may not sound like a lot, but it adds up, crowding out more energizing foods or key nutrients like fiber.\n\n\"People feel like they need to get all that protein or something terrible is going to happen,\" she said. \"They're focusing on that one 'magic' ingredient. Where are the vegetables?\"\n\nIf you're going to set a protein goal, making it more accurate and reasonable can help you balance your diet, Garcia-Webb said.\n\nBut she'd rather you didn't get hung up on a single number at all.\n\n\"We're really relying on these external metrics of 'I should have X many grams of protein' as opposed to 'actually I had half of that, and I was full,'\" she said. \"We are just not used to listening to our body.\"\n\nWhile protein can help manage appetite by making you feel fuller after eating, context matters. A processed, dessert-flavored protein bar tastes great, but may leave you wanting to eat more than a simple snack or home-cooked meal.\n\nInstead, aim to eat plenty of foods high in fiber (such as beans, whole grains, and veggies) that fill you up and provide lots of nutrients with fewer calories per serving. Other crucial habits for managing appetite include managing your stress, which can spark cravings, and getting enough rest. Research shows that a good night's sleep can help you eat less, since your body isn't scrambling for energy.\n\nTo lose weight and keep it off long-term, tune into your body's natural cues and focus on your overall lifestyle instead of a quick fix, Garcia-Webb said.\n\n\"I think people forget that it's just doing boring things over and over and over again.\" she said. \"Everything that we do to improve our health, whether it's lifestyle changes or medication, it really has to be done with the lens of you're doing this forever and that the only real magic pill is consistency.\"",

    "description": "I keep a relatively minimal closet, but I have a handful of items I no longer wear. I decided to try reselling. How hard could it be?",
    "fullText": "If I write about a particular side hustle, money-saving hack, or wealth-building strategy long enough, it's only a matter of time before I want to attempt it myself.\n\nI've invested my HSA money like the fiscally savvy do, lived the no-car and roommate lifestyle like the \"super savers\" do, and even hired a life coach in the name of \"investing in myself.\" Most recently, I've been experimenting with e-commerce, launching a pickleball paddle company to see what it actually takes to sell a product online after years of interviewing top Amazon sellers.\n\nI'm intrigued by strategies like rental real estate and generating passive income via content creation, but don't quite have the time, money, or bandwidth to experiment.\n\nReselling items, specifically clothes, on sites like eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari seemed different. If you're starting with items you already have lying around your home, it requires zero money to get up and running; all you need is a smartphone to download the selling apps and take photos of items, plus a bit of your time to list items and fulfill orders.\n\nDespite the seemingly low barrier to entry, there's a lot of upside: I've reported on side hustlers pulling in impressive numbers, including a full-time lawyer who earns $120,000 a year reselling sneakers and apparel on eBay and a millennial who turned her thrifting hobby into a full-time job.\n\nI keep a relatively minimal closet, but I have a handful of items I no longer wear. Instead of donating or tossing them, I decided to try reselling. How hard could it be?\n\nWell, I stopped almost as quickly as I started. Here's what happened.\n\nI downloaded two popular clothing resale apps: Poshmark and Mercari. Of the two, I found Poshmark a bit easier to use, largely because of its AI assistant, which essentially builds a listing for you, including descriptions, titles, and tags, after you upload photos of your item. As someone who doesn't know clothes all that well, this was particularly helpful.\n\nI took four to five photos per item against a clean, white background (a tip from top resellers) and priced them by loosely comparing similar listings. I didn't put too much time or thought into my prices, figuring I could always refine them later if necessary.\n\nAll in, I was up and running in about 30 minutes and spent exactly $0.\n\nHere's what my Poshmark profile looks like:\n\nMy first sale came through Mercari: a striped Madewell sweater I listed for $20. I was thrilled when I got the notification — until I did the math.\n\nAfter an $8 shipping fee and a $2 selling fee, Mercari told me that I'd made $10.03. My profit got knocked down to a measly six bucks after I purchased a $4 mailer to ship the sweater.\n\nI was slightly frustrated (was a couple of bucks really worth the hassle of printing labels and dropping off mailers?), but not ready to quit.\n\nMy next two sales came through Poshmark while I was out of town, which added another layer of inconvenience. I messaged the buyers to let them know I would ship their orders as soon as I returned home.\n\nI saved on shipping materials this time, opting to use mailers I already had on hand. It's also worth noting that, because of my pickleball business, I already had a label printer. Without that, I may not have embarked on this project at all. Figuring out how to print shipping labels at a FedEx \"Print & Go\" likely would have sent me over the edge.\n\nUsing my own supplies, I netted $28 from a gently used Tracksmith crewneck and $38.40 from a new top with the tags still on. I removed the buyers' names for privacy.\n\nOver roughly two months, I made a little more than $100 across five sales. Four came from Poshmark, while one came from Mercari.\n\nFor better or for worse, I had no real sense of urgency. It allowed me to price items comfortably rather than racing to the bottom (I did end up lowering prices on some of my items), but it also meant sales trickled in slowly, making it easy for the project to fall by the wayside.\n\nMy accounts are still active, and I even have a few listings live. If something sells, great. But I'm not planning to add more inventory, and I certainly won't be sourcing items beyond my closet.\n\nReselling isn't the side hustle for me. It doesn't play to my strengths, it tested my patience at times, and, ultimately, selling clothes doesn't excite me enough to justify the time. Unlike the pickleball business, which I genuinely enjoy despite the stress and costs, reselling felt like busywork that I wasn't even very good at.\n\nThe math also only works at scale. Making meaningful money reselling clothes requires volume. It means constantly sourcing inventory, photographing items, managing listings, and shipping orders. That's a commitment I wasn't willing to make.\n\nFor people who love fashion, thrifting, and the thrill of finding a deal, reselling can absolutely be lucrative, as I've reported.\n\nFor me, at least for now, I'm staying in my racket-sports lane.",

    "description": "It turns out investors are willing to forgive huge capital spending if a company's core business is thriving.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Wednesday's hoy trinity of earnings — which saw Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla report within five minutes of each other — everyone knew that updates on AI progress would be the only game in town.\n\nHow those results ended up playing out shed crucial light on where we are in the AI trade right now.\n\nThe overarching focus for the Big Tech trio was not who has immediately seen results from AI investment. Instead, it was whether those companies were doing enough to support the appearance of maybe, eventually doing something. Investors love the prospect of future upside, and want a reason to preserve their optimism.\n\nEach of the three companies showcased this trend in their own unique way. Let's go one by one:\n\nLast quarter, Meta was punished for its capex-spending plans. This quarter, the company once again blew the doors off spending forecasts … but this time the market seemed OK with it.\n\nWhat changed? Look no further than the company's stronger-than-expected first-quarter revenue, driven by a big beat in advertising. Meta CFO Susan Li also got investors hyped on the earnings call by saying the company will fund its AI ambitions primarily with cash, rather than debt.\n\nIn the end, it's not that Meta has tangible proof that its AI spending is going to generate monstrous future earnings growth. The company has instead fallen back on its cash-cow advertising business to alleviate financing pressures and buy itself more time.\n\nWe haven't yet gotten an answer about whether the AI spending will pay off. We just know the company can afford to keep pursuing it.\n\nMarket reception: Very positive\n\nI present the counterpoint to Meta's well-received quarter. Microsoft also announced much larger-than-expected spending plans … and its stock fell.\n\nThe difference? One of Microsoft's main cash cows — its Azure cloud-computing unit — showed slowing growth. Suddenly, big spending doesn't look so appealing when your backstop is weakening.\n\nWhile Tesla's AI push has taken the form of self-driving vehicles and robotics, the company's lofty valuation is still being largely driven by hopes that big AI-linked profits will one day be unlocked.\n\nBut unlike Meta, the EV-maker is doing it at a time when its core business is in decline. One overlooked highlight of Tesla's report was that — even though the company posted a bottom-line beat — it also saw first-ever decline in annual revenue.\n\nIt didn't matter. Investors instead focused on Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI, the company owned by Elon Musk. They also seemed to take the discontinuation of the Model S and Y vehicles in stride.\n\nAgain, the perception of eventually monetizing AI won out. In the AI race, it's not what you're doing, it's what you can convince everyone you're going to do down the line.",

    "title": "Colon cancer is officially the deadliest cancer for people under 50. Experts are shocked at how quickly this happened.",
    "description": "Experts say they're stunned by how quickly colon cancer has overtaken other deadly cancers, including lung and breast.",
    "fullText": "Colon cancer is officially the deadliest cancer for people under 50 in the US — a shift that happened more rapidly than cancer researchers expected.\n\nNew data shows that in 2023, colon cancer eclipsed breast cancer, which had been the leading cause of cancer death in young adults for over a decade. Before that, lung cancer was the big killer.\n\nAmerican Cancer Society epidemiologist Rebecca Siegel, senior author of the new report published in JAMA on January 22, told Business Insider she was \"very surprised by the speed of this shift.\"\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, colon cancer was less deadly in people under 50 than brain cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, and breast cancer. It was only in 2021 when the US Preventative Services Task Force lowered the colon cancer screening age recommendation from 50 to 45, realizing that the risks had changed.\n\nThe absolute number of colon cancer deaths in working-age people under 50 is still relatively small, with the American Cancer Society estimates suggesting around 3,750 people under 50 died from colon cancer in 2023. But unlike those four other leading causes of cancer death, where Siegel said there's \"great news\" to report, the trend lines with young colon cancer are going in the wrong direction.\n\nSomething unique appears to have happened to the cohort of people born after 1950, and it's putting every subsequent generation at a greater risk of developing colon cancer early and fast.\n\nColon cancer has been the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50 since about 2014, when it beat out lung cancer, but until 2023, breast cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50 overall.\n\nExperts had been projecting that colon cancer would likely become the leading cause of cancer death for everyone under 50 years old at some point before 2030, but the pace of the increase surprised even the most seasoned cancer experts.\n\nTo go from fifth to first place over the course of about two decades \"is not typical in cancer research,\" Siegel said. It's remarkable it all happened within the lifespan of her young adult daughter, she said.\n\nThe reasons for such a rapid shift are complex. While the rate of aggressive colon cancer cases has been going up, doctors have been getting better at treating and preventing other deadly cancers. Plus, lung cancer deaths plummeted, as people quit smoking en masse. Breast cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death in women under 50, when men are left out of the equation, but the number of women dying of breast cancer every year has also gone down steadily since the mid-1990s.\n\nExperts aren't exactly sure why colon cancer death rates are soaring, but point to a likely mix of complex factors influencing our environment, our genetics, and early life exposures during a baby's first months in and out of the womb.\n\nPrevention isn't as simple as the old standard advice to eat a healthy diet and get enough exercise, though those factors are still part of the equation. The air we breathe, the foods we consume, and the movement we do all play a role, but there seems to also be an element of luck involved. For example, one twin may get colon cancer, while another shows no signs.\n\n\"In the end, it's still a chance event,\" oncologist Tim Cannon previously told Business Insider.\n\nCannon has treated several young, fit colon cancer patients who've died from aggressive, late-stage forms of the disease.\n\nThe steepest rise in young colon cancer patients has been among people just starting adulthood, young patients in their 20s and 30s.\n\n\"They get more treatment — and yet they're not living longer,\" Dr. Kimmie Ng, director of Dana-Farber's Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center, previously told Business Insider.\n\nExperts have a few key pieces of advice. Everyone should start getting colonoscopies at age 45. They aren't just screening tools, they are also intestinal housecleaning measures, designed to remove precancerous polyps before cancer develops. Eat plenty of fiber, especially from foods like leafy greens, other vegetables, and whole grains. And if you see blood in the toilet, or have persistent stomach pain for weeks and weeks that will not go away, get it checked out.",

    "description": "Superhuman CEO Shishir Mehrotra calculates how much time he spends on tasks related to his to-do list.",
    "fullText": "Shishir Mehrotra runs a company that's all about productivity — and he's got a meticulous method to track his own.\n\nSuperhuman is a suite of four AI productivity tools, including Grammarly, which recently rebranded its corporate entity to Superhuman. In addition to overseeing that rebrand, Mehrotra is also juggling board seats at companies like Walmart and Spotify, writing a coming book on company rituals, and raising a family.\n\nHe holds himself accountable to his own time management by keeping track of how well he completes certain tasks, like checking things off his to-do list and keeping his inbox at zero.\n\nTo do this, Mehrotra uses a productivity hack from Intercom cofounder Des Traynor, who was also an investor in Coda and Superhuman Mail, both of which are now products within Superhuman.\n\nIn 2019, Traynor outlined his framework in a viral tweet, arguing that emails reflect \"what others think you should work on,\" to-do lists show \"what you think you should work on,\" and calendars reveal \"what you actually work on.\" The post, which included a Venn diagram, suggested that the three buckets are often misaligned, and people end up spending most of their time on what others think is important rather than their own priorities.\n\nMehrotra said he uses Traynor's four-step time management guide to keep focused on what's most important. It starts with clearing your inbox, followed by reorganizing your calendar so every task has a dedicated time block. The third step is sticking to that schedule, and the final step is reflecting on the time you spent on top tasks — and evaluating for adjustments in the next cycle.\n\nMehrotra told Business Insider that he's been using the four-step framework \"religiously\" for the last four or five years, and on a good week, it over doubles the amount he's able to spend on his to-do list tasks compared to when he doesn't use it.\n\n\"Giving yourself a weekly success score doesn't work for everyone, but it's been an insane productivity hack for me because it gives visibility into my work AND gives me something to improve upon,\" Mehrotra wrote in a LinkedIn post about the method.\n\nMehrotra said he reviews his priorities every Monday morning and sets his calendar with his executive assistant and chief of staff.\n\nWhen he reviews his week, Mehrotra calculates an \"alignment score\" which is the overlap between his email, calendar, and to-do list. He uses that to track what percentage of his time is spent on his to-do list. He said he considers a score of around 50%, meaning he was able to spend about half his time on his to-do list, to be on the high end.\n\n\"If I spend 50% of my time on things that were on my to-do list, then that's a pretty good week for me,\" Mehrotra said.\n\nMehrotra said that aiming for 100% is \"impractical\" and \"impossible.\" He said that without using Traynor's framework, it would be closer to 20%.\n\n\"There's way too much of my job that wouldn't have made my to-do list at the beginning of the week, but it's still important,\" Mehrotra said.\n\nMehrotra said he receives hundreds of emails every day and described himself as a \"zero inboxer.\" He said he also tracks how many consecutive weeks he's hit zero with Superhuman Mail's \"Inbox Zero Streaks\" feature.\n\n\"It's like the equivalent of a clean desk,\" Mehrotra said. \"I can't think straight if I think there are things that might be sitting there that I need to think about.\"\n\nThe CEO said that doesn't mean he needs to deal with every message as soon as it comes in, but he said it needs to be moved out of his inbox and categorized.",

    "description": "Some small-business owners in Portland, Maine, are debating how best to support staff and customers amid a federal immigration crackdown.",
    "fullText": "After Andy Gerry and his business partners put a \"No ICE\" sign in the window of their lobster roll shop in Portland, Maine, backlash followed quickly.\n\nGerry said dozens of bad reviews flooded the restaurant last week after lists circulated online of area businesses that had hung \"No ICE\" posters following the federal government's announcement that it would increase immigration enforcement in the state.\n\nFor Gerry and his co-owners at The Highroller Lobster Co., it was one more challenge of running a small business.\n\n\"The posters are up, and they're not coming down,\" Gerry said.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with a half-dozen local business owners, including Gerry, about their decision to take a stance on immigration agents' presence in Portland, including whether to post signs.\n\nAlso on the table: Should they go along with calls for shutting businesses and schools on Friday as part of what organizers hope will be a nationwide campaign.\n\nGerry said that some owners he's been speaking with favor taking part in the stoppage, and others are calling for businesses to remain open to divert profits to groups helping immigrants.\n\nAlready this week, Gerry said, he's flip-flopped over whether to keep the restaurant open on Friday. His current thought: Close for the day and donate weekend proceeds to charities helping those affected by the immigration sweep.\n\nThese are the sorts of calculations that many small-business owners across the US have considered over the past few months. The question has felt especially urgent lately in Portland, a seaside city of about 70,000, where immigration officials have had a more visible presence over the past week.\n\nWhile some of corporate America's top executives have weighed in with statements about the immigration actions, some small-business owners — answering phones and facing customers directly — are making personal choices about whether to publicly take action.\n\nSome workers and owners at more than a dozen businesses Business Insider visited didn't want to discuss the immigration issue because they said it didn't pertain to their day-to-day operations. Others said they didn't want to upset neighboring businesses or draw attention.\n\nGerry said he saw putting up the sign, created by a Portland artist, as a way to amplify his staffers' voices and support anyone who might be fearful of getting caught up in the immigration sweep.\n\nHe said he contacted restaurant review sites to flag the negative ratings, and he and his co-owners instructed the restaurant's more than 50 staffers on how to handle negative phone calls. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of commenters encouraging people to \"review bomb\" the restaurant.\n\nEarlier this month, Eden Millecchia hung a \"No ICE\" poster in the window of her airy shop, called Flowers & Candy. The following week, she attended an online training conducted by a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union about where federal agents are permitted to go within a business if they don't have a warrant.\n\nMillecchia said she feels she's in a more privileged position to speak up than some other shopkeepers.\n\n\"I'm the white lady who can yell,\" she said.\n\nYet, Millecchia said, motioning toward the poster, the sign is a \"hollow gesture\" — other than the show of support it sends.\n\nWhat is tangible, she said, is the drop in sales she's seen since word spread that immigration agents were focusing on Maine. For the long weekend that included Martin Luther King Day — which also included some unforgiving winter weather — her sales were down 91% year-over-year, Millecchia said.\n\n\"They killed my three-day weekend, and I think that it's going to keep people from coming here,\" she said, referring to the presence of federal officers.\n\nThat could mean fewer people will pick up the CBD products whose sales she relies on to help make rent. Another disruption: She plans to close on Friday to support the strike.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told Business Insider that it doesn't comment on immigration enforcement operations. US Customs and Border Protection didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn the steps outside Arcana Maine, a shop that sits opposite a small park and sells jewelry and works by area artists, a circular table recently displayed free business-card-sized guides to rights enshrined in the Constitution. The cards were printed in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Somali, and Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in parts of Africa.\n\nAn employee named Nico, who declined to give his last name, said that giving the cards a prominent spot was a way to help the community.\n\nHe estimated that foot traffic at the store had fallen by at least half from what's typical for January.\n\nAt a skate shop called Mocean, owner Jasper Tripp said he hung a \"No ICE\" sign because it aligned with his beliefs. Ordinarily, he said, he tries to separate his political views from the store he has run for nearly a decade.\n\n\"It just feels right,\" Tripp said of the decision to put up the poster. He worked with an artist to design an anti-ICE T-shirt. Proceeds from its sale will go to charities supporting immigrants' legal expenses, he said.\n\nFor some business owners, concerns go beyond the risk of alienating customers. One restaurant owner said she plans to shut down for at least a week — and pay workers — while she's out of town. Ordinarily, she said, her employees would run the restaurant, which has an entirely Spanish-speaking staff.\n\nShe asked that Business Insider not use her name or that of her restaurant to protect her employees, who she said are legal immigrants but who nevertheless feel threatened.\n\nShe taped a \"No ICE\" poster to the door to help employees and customers to feel safe, not to denounce immigration agents, she said.\n\nThe balance is tricky, the owner added. \"I have the responsibility to keep people safe. I also have an economic responsibility.\"",

    "description": "A Ukrainian soldier, until recently a drone operator, broke down what he carried in battle to stay alive, stay comfortable, and fight Russia.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian soldier, until recently a drone operator, shared a video earlier this month walking viewers through the gear he carried with him into battle against the Russians.\n\nIt featured an interesting mix of stuff, from drone detectors to weaponry to what he characterized as \"tactical Crocs.\"\n\nDimko Zhluktenko, now an analyst with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, spoke to Business Insider about the items that he considers key to staying alive, comfortable, and as effective as possible against Russia. He still carries a lot of the gear with him, even though his role has changed.\n\nHe picks his gear with great care, emphasizing that much of what he carries was his choice, not government-issued.\n\n\"The stuff that the government issues sometimes is good, but it's not the best fit.\" He said the military largely trusts soldiers to choose what works best for them.\n\nZhluktenko, who worked in tech before the war, said his gear comes from a mix of state funding, items he bought himself, and crowdfunding. He tries to keep what he carries on his person to around 10 kilograms, calling it \"a comfortable amount of gear that is still extremely useful,\" though he can carry more when needed.\n\nThis war has seen low-tech solutions fielded against cutting-edge weapons, such as wire mesh and cages used to stop advanced drones, or wooden decoy tanks designed to fool expensive munitions.\n\nAs a drone operator, Zhluktenko carried a pair of scissors to sever the cables of fiber-optic drones that now litter the battlefield as these jamming-resistant drones become increasingly prevalent.\n\nCutting the cables \"became a part of our standard operating procedure\" in areas saturated with fiber-optic drones, he said. Units are sometimes instructed to cut \"each and every\" cable they see, just in case.\n\nZhluktenko said that they don't even worry about friend or foe concerns. Similar responses have been seen with the radio-frequency drones, with soldiers panic-jamming everything regardless of who the systems belong to.\n\nZhluktenko said that he bought retractors for all his team so they wouldn't lose their scissors.\n\nHe carried an issued firearm — an old Soviet-designed weapon — which is good enough for his role because he doesn't operate in areas with much direct fighting.\n\nHe said it is \"much older than I am,\" but noted that he modified it and \"it's not too bad.\" He replaced some internal components and the handguard, adding one from Ukrainian manufacturer Kpyk to improve grip. He said its primary use is targeting drones that can't be stopped in other ways. Gunfights are not the norm in this war.\n\nHe also carried extra magazines and a pouch for empty ones.\n\nTo improve dexterity, he wore silicone-grip gloves from the American company Mechanix Wear, which make it easier to operate drone controllers. The grip provides \"extra sensitivity\" for precise movements and prevents slipping.\n\nHe carried a mechanical compass because Russia's electromagnetic warfare throws off the ones in his iPhone and Garmin.\n\nAnd Zhluktenko also had sunglasses, since spotting his own drone in a crowded sky is critical and the \"sun is a big factor.\"\n\nZhluktenko had a pair of shoes he brought with him that resemble the American-designed footwear Crocs, but his are made by a Ukrainian company, M-Tac. He said they are \"absolutely essential\" because it's impossible to wear combat boots all the time.\n\nHe called them \"tactical Crocs,\" explaining that he only breaks them out in moments when the threat is low.\n\nWhen it was time to get to work, he would wear combat boots made by the German company Lowa. He said he had been using these boots for around four years, along with orthopedic insoles. He said that he can wear them all day without pain.\n\nHe also carried hand sanitizer — \"you probably remember those from COVID era, but I still use them at war,\" he said, — a multitool that includes a knife and spoon to eat with, and a cap to protect him \"from excessive sun\" in the field.\n\nZhluktenko said he carried a drone detector, an electronic system that scans radio frequencies to detect incoming drones. He said it can alert him if a drone is flying toward him and sometimes show the video feed from the enemy drone, revealing what it is seeing.\n\nUkraine has bigger systems in place to try to warn soldiers of incoming drones, but they can sometimes miss one. Even if they don't get a warning from command posts, \"there might be just some random FPV drone that just flew in and might damage us.\" He explained that these drone detectors are \"becoming more and more essential\" and are needed \"ASAP.\"\n\nHe also carried a Motorola radio, a \"basic\" one where he can talk with his brothers in arms, and night vision goggles that he uses for nighttime drone launches and landings.\n\nHe put a GoPro on his chest so he can rewatch his actions for improvements, almost like sports teams do with replays.\n\nZhluktenko also has a Ukrainian-made MITLA anti-drone gun, which shoots nets to stop drones flying toward him by snagging their propellers. He said he got his recently and has never had to use it. It's a single-use product that was released this year.\n\nAnd he carried electrical tape \"because there is always something that you could fix\" when it comes to his technology and other gear.\n\nZhluktenko said that his body armor is the \"most important\" piece of gear that he carries, regardless of his role. He bought and selected it himself.\n\n\"I didn't use whatever the government gave to me,\" he said. \"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a good fit.\"\n\nHe chose a system that allows for extensive customization. He uses armor from M-Tac and added components such as a weight-distribution system from the Ukrainian company Balistyka, which attaches to the vest and gives him \"the flexibility to move around much better.\" Most of the injuries in battle come from shrapnel, so he wanted to protect as much of his body as possible without limiting his ability to move quickly.\n\nHe customized his armor with additional panels to protect areas like his stomach, spine, ribs, and hips, areas where a tourniquet can't easily be applied. He shared that many soldiers use neck protection, but he found it didn't offer enough freedom of movement.\n\nHe also wears glasses with ballistic protection to shield against shrapnel.\n\nHe uses a \"very lightweight\" helmet from Team Wendy, which supports his night-vision goggles. He said weight is important to him so that it doesn't strain his neck.\n\nHe also carries tourniquets and bandages. The first, on a battlefield where medical evacuation and trauma care are likely not readily available, is crucial for staying alive. He said these tools — he carried four on his person at the time of filming — are among his \"most important stuff.\"\n\nZhluktenko carried a \"proper knife\" that he said is old and getting \"a bit rusty\" but still works well enough, along with a multitool that includes features like a small saw. A follower on X sent it to him. He also uses a carabiner to carry extra gear.\n\nHe carried zipties and padlocks so his unit could take over and secure vacant positions. Many positions have doors, and they would lock them and write on the door which unit took it, along with their call sign and phone number.\n\nHe also carried a flashlight with red and white modes made by a friend's company, Syaivo, which gives them to Ukrainian soldiers for free. He also had two other flashlights that he could put on his helmet and armor.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk recently said that saving for retirement could become \"irrelevant\" in the next decade, as new technologies promise to create such an abundance of resources that nobody will need a nest egg.\n\nDario Amodei warned this week that achieving a plentiful future won't be easy. The CEO of Anthropic, the AI startup behind ChatGPT-rival Claude, wrote in an essay that AI promises to \"raise the quality of life for everyone\" — but there will be a brutal \"rite of passage\" to get there.\n\nAmodei said that at the current rate of progress, \"it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything.\"\n\nReplacing human labor with AI could supercharge economic growth and productivity, but the \"short-term shock will be unprecedented in size,\" he wrote.\n\nAmodei said he was worried that workers displaced by AI \"could form an unemployed or very-low-wage 'underclass,'\" and a tiny minority could capture most of the financial gains from AI, creating a \"level of wealth concentration that will break society.\"\n\nHe described those potential impacts on labor and equality as \"grave problems\" that AI companies, employers, philanthropists, and governments would have to work together to solve.\n\nAmodei noted that he and Anthropic's other cofounders have pledged to donate 80% of their wealth to good causes, and the company will match individual donations from its staff worth billions of dollars at its current valuation.\n\nAnthropic's boss shared a similar vision to Musk in a 2024 essay. He wrote that AI will eventually become \"so broadly effective and so cheap\" that the current economic system will \"no longer make sense.\"\n\nIt could be replaced by a \"large universal basic income for everyone,\" or a \"capitalist economy of AI systems\" that distributes \"huge amounts\" of resources to people as the \"overall economic pie will be gigantic,\" he added.\n\nBut he also flagged the risk of \"exploitative or dystopian directions\" and said, \"We will likely have to fight to get a good outcome here.\"\n\nBusiness Insider recently spoke to seven AI and personal finance gurus about Musk's vision, and they shared several of Amodei's concerns.\n\nThey urged Americans to keep saving for retirement just in case Musk is wrong — and said that even if he's right, making sure everyone reaps the rewards of AI will require immense planning and coordination.",

    "description": "\"Bridgerton\" season 4 stars Benedict (Luke Thompson) and Sophie (Yerin Ha), and features returning characters like Penelope, Colin, and Queen Charlotte.",
    "fullText": "Dearest gentle readers: \"Bridgerton\" is back. And with a new season of Netflix's romance series comes a new love story and a new crop of characters to get to know over the course of the story.\n\nSeason four is based on the third novel in Julia Quinn's \"Bridgerton\" series, \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" which tells the story of Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson), the second-eldest Bridgerton and the family's resident free spirit who's determined not to live a conventional life like his siblings — that is, until he meets a mysterious lady in a silver dress, Sophie (Yerin Ha), who makes him rethink his worldview.\n\nSophie's not the only new face we'll get to know this season. There's also the Penwood family, consisting of the widow of the Earl of Penwood, Lady Araminta Gun (Katie Leung), her two daughters, Posy (Isabelle Wei) and Rosamund (Michelle Mao).\n\nHere's where you may recognize the cast of \"Bridgerton\" season four from.\n\nSophie is Benedict's love interest this season — he meets her first in disguise at a masquerade ball, and then again when she's back in her normal life as a servant for one of the families of Mayfair.\n\nHa's first main role was in the Paramount+ series \"Halo,\" based on the video game franchise of the same name. She also had a small role in \"Dune: Prophecy.\"\n\nHa, who is Australian, has also appeared in Australian series like \"Troppo,\" \"Bad Behaviour,\" and \"The Survivors.\"\n\nAfter leading season three, to the delight of Polin fans everywhere, Newton and Coughlan are back in supporting roles as Colin and Penelope Bridgerton. And now that everyone knows that Penelope is actually Lady Whistledown, her life has become more complicated.\n\nNewton is best known for \"Bridgerton,\" but Disney fans may recognize him from \"The Lodge.\"\n\nCoughlan was already beloved by fans of the Irish series \"Derry Girls\" before taking on the role of Penelope. She also stars in the British series \"Big Mood\" and had a small role in \"Barbie.\"\n\nAfter getting married and heading off to Scotland in season three, Francesca and John are back in London for the social season — because, according to Francesca, it was getting a little crowded with the two of them, her sister Eloise, and John's cousin Michaela.\n\nDodd joined the cast of \"Bridgerton\" in season three, replacing the original actor who played Francesca, Ruby Stokes. Before the show, Dodd had roles in \"Enola Holmes 2,\" \"Eternals,\" \"Anatomy of a Scandal,\" and \"Flowers in the Attic: The Origin.\"\n\nAlli also joined in season three. Prior to the series, he had small roles in \"Death on the Nile,\" \"Belfast,\" and \"Andor.\"\n\nIt's explained during the first episode of season four that Anthony and Kate are still in India after the birth of their first child. Per Netflix, Bailey and Ashley will appear at some point in season four.\n\nFour years after their season, Bailey has become a true A-lister. In addition to being the reigning People's Sexiest Man Alive, Bailey was the No. 1 highest-grossing male actor at the box office in 2025, thanks to \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" and \"Wicked: For Good,\" per Variety.\n\nAshley was already known to fans of \"Sex Education\" before \"Bridgerton.\" Since then, she starred in the Prime Video film \"Picture This\" and is set to appear in \"The Devil Wears Prada 2\" this summer.\n\nBaduza was introduced at the end of season three as John's cousin, Michaela, replacing the (male) character of Michael Stirling from Francesca's book, \"When He Was Wicked.\" She only pops in at the very end of part one of season four, so we can be sure to expect \n\nBaduza's biggest role pre-\"Bridgerton\" was in the BBC series \"Noughts + Crosses\" as the main character, Sephy.\n\nEloise decided to get a change of scenery from the Ton at the end of season three to join her sister and new brother-in-law in Scotland, but when we pick up season four, Eloise is actually quite happy to be back among the rest of her family in London.\n\nJessie has appeared in classic British series such as \"Doctors,\" \"Call the Midwife,\" and \"Doctor Who.\" She also starred in an ITV adaptation of \"Vanity Fair.\"\n\nIn 2025, she starred in the Netflix miniseries \"Toxic Town.\"\n\nHyacinth is the second-youngest Bridgerton sibling, and this season, she's desperate to prove that she's all grown up.\n\nThis is Hunt's first major role, but in 2025, she played the younger version of Teresa Palmer's character in \"Mix Tape.\"\n\nGemmell has been part of \"Bridgerton\" since season one and also appeared on the spin-off, \"Queen Charlotte.\" We've only known Violet as a single mom, but this season, she has her eye on Lord Marcus Anderson (Francis), who just happens to be Lady Danbury's younger brother. He joined the cast in season three.\n\nGemmell is best known for her performance opposite Colin Firth in the 1997 rom-com \"Fever Pitch.\" She's also known to British audiences for roles in \"EastEnders,\" \"Tracy Beaker,\" and \"Home Fires.\"\n\nFrancis starred in \"Small Axe,\" \"Once Upon a Time,\" and \"The Wheel of Time.\"\n\nThe Evil Stepmother in this Cinderella story and the season's villain is Lady Araminta, played by Katie Leung.\n\nLeung is most famous for playing Cho Chang in the \"Harry Potter\" films. She also had a voice role in \"Arcane,\" and appeared in \"The Wheel of Time,\" \"The Peripheral,\" and \"T2 Trainspotting.\"\n\nPosy (Wei) is the nicer of the two sisters and has a less adversarial relationship with Sophie than her sister Rosamund and her mother. Wei has appeared in the Netflix series \"1899\" and \"Black Doves.\"\n\nRosamund (Mao) takes after her mother in more ways than one, including her disdain for Sophie. Mao most recently appeared in the film \"A Big Bold Beautiful Journey.\" She's also been in \"Goosebumps,\" \"Metal Lords,\" and \"FBI: Most Wanted.\"\n\nSophie is close with the other servants at Penwood House, including Alfie (Moorst) and Irma (Marr). Both are instrumental in getting her to the masquerade ball in the season premiere.\n\nThis is Moorst's first major role, though he has had small roles in \"Killing Eve\" and \"Grantchester.\"\n\nMarr will be familiar to fans of \"My Fault: London.\" She also appeared in an episode of \"Ted Lasso.\"\n\nThe staff at Bridgerton House includes housekeeper Mrs. Wilson (Geraldine Alexander); a footman, John (Oli Higginson); a maid, Celia (Sophie Lamont); and a new maid, Hazel (Gracie McGonigal).\n\nMrs. Wilson, John, and Celia have all been background players in the first three seasons of \"Bridgerton\" (and \"Queen Charlotte), but this season, since Sophie is also a maid, the staff will play a larger role.\n\nAlexander is a staple on British TV: She's appeared in \"EastEnders,\" \"Doctors,\" \"Coronation Street,\" and more.\n\nHigginson is predominantly a theater actor, as is McGonigal. Lamont had an uncredited role in \"The Batman.\"\n\nLady Portia Featherington is the leader of the Featherington family. Now that her daughters have all married and had children, Portia should be able to relax this season, but a conflict with her housekeeper, Mrs. Varley, may prevent that.\n\nFans may recognize Walker from her appearances in Gwyneth Paltrow's \"Emma,\" \"Clash of the Titans,\" or \"John Carter.\" She also appeared in \"Dune: Prophecy\" and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work in \"Rome.\"\n\nLike Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Varley has been around in the background since the beginning of \"Bridgerton,\" usually to help her employer, Portia, scheme. But this season, Varley is in high demand as a housekeeper.\n\nAshbourne has been in British series such as \"Grantchester,\" \"Midsomer Murders,\" and \"The Crown.\"\n\nFun fact: Ashbourne has been married to Andy Serkis since 2002.\n\nThe first season of \"Bridgerton\" introduced audiences to Queen Charlotte, a real-life monarch who reigned in England in the late 18th and early 19th century, as played by Rosheuvel. She also plays her in the spin-off, \"Queen Charlotte.\"\n\nRosheuvel has a long TV résumé, appearing in British shows including \"Luther,\" \"Coronation Street,\" and \"EastEnders.\"\n\nOn the big screen, Rosheuvel played Shadout Mapes in \"Dune.\"\n\nLady Danbury has been a fan-favorite since season one, largely due to the performance by Andoh. She's been one of Queen Charlotte's closest friends since her coronation, as seen in \"Queen Charlotte.\"\n\nThis season, Lady Danbury seems to have tired of society and has even ceded the first ball of the season to Violet Bridgerton.\n\nLike Rosheuvel, Andoh has been acting in British TV for decades. Since \"Bridgerton,\" she has appeared in \"The Witcher\" and \"The Red King.\"\n\nBrimsley has also been on the show since season one and made appearances on \"Queen Charlotte.\" Viewers have seen that he cares deeply about the Queen, even if she doesn't always treat him well.\n\nSachs is best known for his role in the British sitcom \"Benidorm.\" He was also in an episode of \"Andor.\"\n\nWill and Alice were introduced in season one as friends of Simon's (Regé-Jean Page). Originally, the Mondriches were working-class, but they have since moved up in the world. By season four, Lady Danbury has high hopes for Alice and a potential friendship with the Queen.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" is the biggest role for both Imhangbe and Naomi. Before the show, Imhangbe was mainly a stage actor, and Naomi had appeared in British TV shows. This year, she appeared in \"What It Feels Like for a Girl.\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. Crabtree are the caretakers of Benedict's country home, charmingly named My Cottage (any \"Heated Rivalry\" fans know that a cottage in a romance story means business).\n\nBrown is best known for playing Septa Mordane in the first season of \"Game of Thrones,\" though she is a well-known theater actor.\n\nBoyle has been in projects since the '70s, including films like \"Barry Lyndon\" and \"A United Kingdom.\" He's also been in many theater productions and British TV series.",

    "description": "Hiking subscriptions, making robots, and selling fewer cars? Tesla is acting like a tech company in more ways than one.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long insisted Tesla isn't a car company. After its latest earnings, it looks less like one than ever.\n\nThe billionaire told investors that Tesla would scrap its Model S and X EVs and convert their production lines to build the company's Optimus humanoid robot, as it continues to shift toward AI and robotics.\n\nTesla also said it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI and to evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with Musk's AI startup.\n\nIt came as the company's financial disclosures painted a stark picture of the troubles facing its EV business, which saw sales decline for the second year in a row in 2025.\n\nTesla beat Wall Street's expectations, but reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue and said profits fell by 46% last year, while revenue from car sales fell by 11% year-over-year in the last quarter.\n\nExecutives largely shrugged off the headwinds, with Musk and other top employees reiterating in the analyst Q&A their belief that autonomous vehicles will shortly render traditional forms of transport obsolete.\n\n\"The vast majority of miles traveled will be autonomous in the future,\" said Musk, in response to an investor question asking about Tesla's plans to launch new models.\n\n\"I'm just guessing, but probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody's actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%,\" he added.\n\nInvestors reacted positively, with Tesla shares rising around 3% after hours following earnings.\n\nThe reaction is another sign of how, for many investors, vehicle sales have become a sidenote to Tesla's future, as the company executes an ambitious shift toward a new business model built on robotics, AI, and software services.\n\n\"They're definitely moving away from an automotive-oriented company to a tech-oriented company,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Business Insider prior to Tesla's earnings. '\"This is a company that's looking to get away from vehicle sales as the focus of their revenue.\"\n\nElon Musk has long said that Tesla should be thought of as an AI and robotics company, not a carmaker. Investors have agreed, driving Tesla's market cap to $1.35 trillion, more than every other US carmaker combined.\n\nEven before Tesla's latest AI-focused earnings, there were signs that the company had begun to act more like the tech giant Musk dreams of.\n\nThe company overhauled its autonomy offerings in recent weeks, removing the option to buy its premium Full Self-Driving software for a one-off fee of $8,000 and making it subscription-only.\n\nTesla also killed its basic Autopilot tier, which previously came free on almost all its vehicles, instead replacing it with a more limited form of cruise control. Musk also indicated in a post on X that Tesla owners can expect FSD prices to rise beyond the $99-per-month subscription fee as the technology improves.\n\nPhasing out free features and hiking subscription prices is classic tech giant behavior, and the moves quickly sparked backlash from Tesla fans and customers on social media. Analysts told Business Insider the changes were likely aimed at driving adoption of FSD and monetizing the existing user base.\n\n\"I think it's about monetizing FSD. I think they're going to look at more ways to monetize what I view as services, autonomous, and really disruptive technology within their installments,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities and a longtime Tesla Bull, told Business Insider ahead of earnings.\n\nMusk has described FSD as crucial to Tesla's future, but the company has struggled to get drivers to pay for it. In October, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja told investors that just 12% of Tesla owners have bought FSD.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taneja said that 1.1 million customers had bought FSD, but added that nearly 70% of those purchases were upfront rather than subscription.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key milestone for Musk's $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to hit 10 million active FSD subscriptions by 2035 for the Tesla CEO to unlock the full payout.\n\nThe most critical part of Tesla's transition to a tech company is its robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot initiatives, which Musk has said will eventually make Tesla the world's most valuable company.\n\nTom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider that nearly 75% of his long-term valuation of the company was based on robotics and autonomous vehicles, with just 8% coming from car sales. Ives put that figure at 80-90%, adding that he viewed Tesla as an \"autonomous and robotics company\" moving forward.\n\n\"That's why this is such a key transition year for Musk and Tesla. Any delays in autonomous or robotaxis are going to be heavily scrutinized because that's the key to the valuation,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin last June, and recently began offering some public rides without a safety driver. However, its service in the Texan city is still small, with around 50 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla would have robotaxis operating in \"somewhere between a quarter and half\" of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, and the company is set to begin production on its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi in April.\n\nIves added that Tesla's focus this year would be on building out its robotaxi service, noting he didn't expect the company to begin collecting \"meaningful revenue\" from autonomous ride-hailing until 2027.\n\n\"It's important that they get into what I believe will probably be roughly about 30 cities this year. 2026 is the build-out of robotaxis, 2027 is where you'll start to see more monetization,\" Ives said.\n\nOnce Tesla's robotaxi service reaches escape velocity, Narayan said he expects it to transform the company's business model from a traditional carmaker into a high-margin services business more akin to Uber.\n\n\"It dramatically transforms the current auto business, which is a capital-intensive, low-margin business, into a high-margin, much higher revenue business,\" he said. \"The market is bigger and the economics are far better.\"\n\nExecuting that transition will be expensive. Taneja, Tesla's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to spend more than $20 billion this year on new production lines and AI compute infrastructure.\n\nFor Tesla's beleaguered EV business, things look unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\nAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in the US, the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September has caused that market to slow dramatically, with rivals Ford and GM canceling electric models and taking billions of dollars in charges amid warnings of an EV winter.\n\nOutside of the US, Tesla is losing market share to Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which now dominate China's booming EV market and are growing rapidly in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nAutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani said that Tesla ran the risk of a bumpy transition period if its carmaking business declined faster than its robotaxi and services businesses could grow. However, he added that the company may have no choice but to make the leap.\n\nHe pointed to the competition from China and declining income from the regulatory credits that Tesla sells to automakers who have failed to sell enough EVs as evidence that the company's automotive business was running out of road.\n\n\"Musk sees the future of this business as robots and autonomous vehicles,\" Fiorani said.\n\n\"The physical products themselves, the cars and the automotive side, are all legacy products,\" he added. \"We're going to see them going forward to autonomous software, autonomous hardware, things that will move them into the next generation.\"",

This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found the UK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AI and was being hit harder than other large economies.\n\nThis month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nLast week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.\n\nStockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He later bought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.\n\nWhile he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.\n\nHowever, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”\n\nStockwood was preceded as investment minister by Poppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.",

    "fullText": "Under Donald Trump, the White House has filled its social media with memes, wishcasting, nostalgia and deepfakes. Here’s what you need to know to navigate the trolling\n\nIt started with an image of Trump as a king mocked up on a fake Time magazine cover. Since then it’s developed into a full-blown phenomenon, one academics are calling “slopaganda” – an unholy alliance of easily available AI tools and political messaging. “Shitposting”, the publishing of deliberately crude, offensive content online to provoke a reaction, has reached the level of “institutional shitposting”, according to Know Your Meme’s editor Don Caldwell. This is trolling as official government communication. And nobody is more skilled at it than the Trump administration – a government that has not only allowed the AI industry all the regulative freedom it desires, but has embraced the technology for its own in-house purposes. Here are 10 of the most significant fake images the White House has put out so far.\n\nThe first AI image posted by the White House X account sets the tone for Trump’s second presidency – marking a turning point in which the shitposting that had been associated with the far-right online culture that brought Trump to power moved from fringe message boards, such as 4chan and Reddit, to mainstream platforms.\n\nThe image was posted alongside an announcement of the repeal of New York City’s congestion pricing, and leant into fears that Trump would govern as a king. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, held up the image at a press conference when she announced that she would defy attempts to block the congestion charge: “New York hasn’t laboured under a king in over 250 years. We sure as hell are not going to start now.” The congestion charge remains in effect.\n\nIn another post on Truth Social in October, the president posted an AI video depicting himself as a president-king, crown on head, flying over “No Kings” protesters in a jet fighter and dumping faeces on them. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, defended the post, saying: “The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue that he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that. He is using satire to make a point.”\n\nOpenAI’s Studio Ghibli-inspired meme generator became a sensation in March 2025, with its uncanny ability to translate any image into the beloved anime studio’s house style (without Studio Ghibli’s permission or approval).\n\nThe White House applied it to a woman in tears as she was arrested by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents before being deported. The original photograph, and the woman’s name and alleged crimes, are also included in the post.\n\nFor Caldwell, this demonstrated just how up to date the White House is with online trends. “They’re hopping on brand-new, fresh memes,” he says. He suspects White House staffers might be regular visitors to Know Your Meme. “The Studio Ghibli meme trend kicked off on March 25 on X; we covered it the following day; and then the White House covered it the day after that.”\n\nThis image is proof of Trump’s willingness and ability to insert himself into any conversation, even ones that have nothing to do with him, and shows how effective that can be.\n\nPredictably, the image went viral, made global headlines and was met with outrage from Catholic groups and politicians. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,” wrote the New York State Catholic Conference. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.”\n\nAs so often happens with such shitposting, those who ​took offence were accused of lacking a sense of humour. “They can’t take a joke?” Trump said soon after at a press conference. “You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media … the Catholics loved it.”\n\nTrump has been the subject of flattering fan art throughout his political career (remember the digital Trump trading cards?), but AI has made the job a whole lot easier. On 4 May, the White House crashed Star Wars fans’ special day with this image of the president as a jacked Jedi, lightsaber in hand, garlanded by flags and eagles. Who cares if his lightsaber is the wrong colour (the good guys’ are blue), or that the White House’s claim to be the Rebellion not the Empire rang laughably hollow? This was pure fantasy art.\n\nIn 2022, one of Trump’s trading cards clumsily grafted his headshot on to a superhero body; last July he was slightly less clumsily grafted on to the body of Superman, to gatecrash the launch of the new movie. The same month, the White House portrayed a besuited Trump heroically striding into the Colosseum. Fans and allies have generated reams of similar content themselves.\n\nWhy did the White House choose to put the Democratic house leader Hakeem Jeffries and the senate leader Chuck Schumer in sombreros and have them holding plates of tacos? It doesn’t matter. They look a bit silly, and it’s provocatively offensive, and once again, the world’s attention is colonised.\n\nThe image illustrates how difficult it is to respond to this type of content. It’s part of a running joke, stretching back to a deepfake video Trump posted a month earlier, which slapped a crude sombrero and moustache filter over Jeffries. That video was roundly condemned as offensive and racist , not least by Jeffries himself (who replied by posting a genuine image of Trump with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein) . The Trump administration then doubled down, playing the video on a loop on screens in the White House briefing room for several hours and creating more images in a similar vein, which kept the trolling going.\n\nFew people outside the Trump administration believe the US is in a “golden age”, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim. In January, the White House posted an AI video of a golden White House facade behind a shower of gold coins with the text “The White House? She’s in her Golden Age”, backed by Bruno Mars’ track 24K Magic.\n\nEven if Trump’s Midas touch is more a figment of his imagination, this type of wishcasting is more effective than it appears. According to one paper by the academics Michał Klincewicz, Mark Alfano and Amir Ebrahimi Fard – who coined the term “slopaganda” – “neural representations of information that were shown to be false continue to influence people’s beliefs and reasoning after being corrected”. In other words, even when you know it’s fake, your brain still kind of believes it.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems like a straightforward “Trump wants Greenland” post. However, it has a much darker message.\n\nAgain, the post is riffing on a popular meme, Caldwell explains: the “dramatic crossroads” image originated with the manga series Yu-Gi-Oh!, and started gaining traction online around 2021.\n\nThe slogan “Which way, Greenland man?” seems to reference a 1978 neo-Nazi text titled Which Way, Western Man?, in which the white supremacist author William Gayley Simpson called for violence against and the deportation of Jews and Black people, and argued that Hitler was right.\n\n“It’s absolutely shocking to see such images being deployed by this administration,” said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors US neo-Nazi groups. “The idea appeals to racists and white supremacists who think only white people should be in positions of power.”\n\nIn August, the Department of Homeland Security posted a mock recruitment advert for ICE with an image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads and the slogan: “Which way, American man?” Earlier this month, the US Labor Department posted an image with the slogan: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”. Critics pointed out that it had overtones of Hitler’s “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“One people, one realm, one leader”).\n\n“AI is very good at constantly reiterating images from the past, so it can create this nostalgic imagery of traditionalism,” says Daniel de Zeeuw, an assistant professor in digital media culture at the University of Amsterdam. Thus the extremist messages of the present – such as ICE’s militarised policing – can be inserted into more reassuring and familiar graphic styles, such as patriotic recruitment posters, 80s action-movie posters or 1950s public information campaigns (as with a recent image of Trump as a friendly milkman).\n\nAI is inherently backward-looking, says de Zeeuw, as it is fed on historical images. This aesthetic is in keeping with the Make America Great Again movement, which is constantly evoking a “better” past. Another stark example was the Department of Homeland Security’s chilling post from last December: an image of a vintage car at a deserted, palm-fringed beach with the slogan “America After 100 Million Deportations”. Ironically, the original was painted by a Japanese artist, Hiroshi Nagai, who complained that it had been used without his permission.\n\n“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” said the agent filming the Minneapolis civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the city’s most prominent activists, as she was arrested last Thursday. Within hours, though, it was: the Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem posted a still from the video, in which Armstrong seems composed and shows little emotion.\n\nHalf an hour later, the White House X account posted a significantly altered version of the same image: this time, Armstrong is exaggeratedly upset, tears streaming down her face. Her skin tone also appears to have been darkened. The image was captioned: “Arrested: far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.” In fact, Armstrong was demonstrating at a church service led by an allegedly ICE-affiliated pastor, and was later released without charge.\n\nUntil this moment, the White House’s AI-generated output had been conspicuously outlandish: there was little danger of mistaking it for reality. This image purports to be an authentic photograph – or at least omits to mention that it is not. It is not so much AI-generated trolling as an AI-assisted deepfake.\n\nAs with Musk’s recently shared Grok tool, which removed women and children’s clothing without their consent, there is also something abusive about it: AI has been used to attempt to humiliate a woman by manipulating her image, to make her look weaker and more distressed than she actually was.\n\nThe fact that the deepfakery is not all that convincing is part of the point, de Zeeuw thinks. “What is being communicated here is the falsification itself: you’re showing your ability to falsify images, to falsify evidence.”\n\nAfter the fakery had been called out, the White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr posted the response: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”\n\nIn response to this image of Trump and a penguin walking towards a Greenland flag, some observers pointed out that penguins actually live at the south pole. But that’s missing the point of these types of post, says Robert Topinka, a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London. “People continue to interpret them as if they’re meant to be a legitimate claim, or an argument or a piece of evidence, but they’re emotional hooks.” Their purpose is to stir up the base. “White House staffers have said they use AI because it’s the fastest way to get content out. It’s not the fastest way to say something that’s true; it’s the fastest way to push their propaganda.”\n\nTo those in the know, this is a riff on the “nihilist penguin” meme, which has gone viral on TikTok in the past few weeks. It’s based on a scene from Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary Encounters at the End of the World, in which one penguin inexplicably separates from the colony and wanders off towards the Antarctic interior, and certain death. “But why?” Herzog wonders. Many have asked the same of Trump’s quixotic attempts to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe image resonates with what Naomi Klein and ​Astra Taylor ​christened “end times fascism”, says De Zeeuw, where tech industry leaders and their enablers are almost willing the end of the world as we know it, striding towards oblivion like Trump and his penguin companion. “It’s like they know they’re moving toward the end, but they do so joyfully.”",

    "description": "D.D....",
    "fullText": "The mayor publicizes a $12 billion hole in New York’s budget over the next two years—and draws some political battle lines.\n\nThe honeymoon is officially over.\n\nThat was the deeper meaning of Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s somber Wednesday morning City Hall press conference disclosing the not-exactly-shocking news that regarding the next two fiscal years New York faces a $12 billion hole in the city’s finances. The budget gap itself was old news, disclosed first by Comptroller Mark Levine nearly two weeks ago—in an announcement whose details owed much to his predecessor, former comptroller Brad Lander’s final report, which had projected “a $2.18 billion gap for FY 2026…a gap of $10.41 billion [in FY 2027], $13.24 billion in FY 2028, and $12.36 billion in FY 2029.”\n\nLander’s mid-December warning drew little coverage—apart from a New York Post editorial board’s crowing that the looming deficits “will surely dent Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s freebie-filled socialist agenda.” But the mayor’s dramatic tale of his predecessor’s fiscal fiddling was designed with a clear political agenda in mind: both to underline the magnitude of the problem and to identify the villains responsible for this perfidy. “In the words of the Jackson 5, ‘it’s as easy as ABC,’” said the mayor, reprising a tune from his interview earlier in the week with ABC’s Jonathan Karl. “This is an Adams Budget Crisis.”\n\nI’ll leave it to younger Nation readers to decide whether our code-switching mayor’s allusion was designed, as Gothamist suggested, to appeal to the aging boomers “most likely to care deeply about the details behind a major financial issue” or a callout to the TV network getting an early look at his next moves. In any event, as Mamdani stood in the Blue Room on Wednesday—his third formal press conference in as many days—flanked by First Deputy Mayor Dean Fuleihan and Budget Director Sherif Soliman, the scale of the problem was crystal clear. Accusing Eric Adams of having “underestimated known expenses” so he could claim that the city’s budget would balance—as it is required to by law—the mayor explained that “these are not differences of opinion between accountants. They are measured to the tune of more than $7 billion beyond what he published.”\n\n“This is not just bad governance,” Mamdani continued. “It is negligence,” adding that “once we looked under the hood [of the city’s finances], the full picture was staggering.”\n\nNor was Adams the only culprit. Using charts and graphs to detail what he called a 10-year period during which the state “extracted our city’s resources,” Mamdani broke his self-imposed ban on uttering Andrew Cuomo’s name. “In fiscal year 2022 alone, the city sent $68.8 billion to Albany and got back $47.6 billion,” Mamdani said. Blaming his former rival for this “$21 billion chasm” constricting what New York City can spend on services for its citizens, the mayor described Albany’s approach as “punishment.”\n\n“New York City is facing a massive fiscal crisis,” declared the mayor. Addressing it would require “recalibrating the broken fiscal relationship between the state and the city.”\n\nBut when reporters pressed him for details on what that recalibration might look like—or, given Governor Kathy Hochul’s declared opposition to raising taxes (especially while she’s running for reelection)—the mayor declined to go beyond citing what he described as “encouraging” conversations with the governor and legislative leaders in Albany.\n\nNor would the mayor provide specifics on which city programs he’s prepared to sacrifice—however reluctantly—though some of these prospective cuts will doubtless be leaked between now and February 17, when the city will release its preliminary budget.\n\nStill, for a mayor and an administration that has spent the first half of this week celebrating their largely successful navigation of the city’s worst snowstorm and cold spell in years, it was a sharp change in tone. Keeping the streets plowed isn’t exactly rocket science. But it is a challenge that some of Mamdani’s predecessors have notably—and publicly—failed to meet. And as the political scientist Christina Greer recently noted, “if you can’t clear the bar that is the baseline, then I think we know where we are.”\n\nMamdani promised an urban renaissance. And though the magnitude of the city’s fiscal difficulties may have come as a surprise to him, it shouldn’t have. Because Andrew Cuomo wasn’t the only governor bleeding the city to fund Albany’s priorities. It was Kathy Hochul who decided to retain the Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage funds that the city uses to offset its share of Medicaid costs. She also raised the city’s contribution to mass transit costs by more than half a billion dollars a year, and held back—you might even say “extracted”—a hefty percentage of the city’s share of education funding, while also leaving New Yorkers on the hook to pay for more charter schools. Yet Hochul’s name never figured in Mamdani’s indictment.\n\nBut they say you catch more flies with honey than vinegar, and if Mamdani is going to have any hope of sweet-talking the governor into letting him raise the billions required to plug the budget gap by actually fulfilling his campaign pledge of increasing taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers, he’ll need to deploy all of his considerable stores of charm. Asked several times on Wednesday what would happen if he can’t get that permission, the mayor repeatedly failed to answer.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nWhich was also smart politics. Taking a small victory lap on Monday, Mamdani declared that “our city is up and running, thanks to the plans we put in place and the countless city workers who delivered on them.” Like this week’s big snow, the big hole in the city’s budget came with plenty of warning. In the weeks to come, we’ll find out whether here, too, City Hall has a plan in place to ride out the storm.",

    "description": "Daniel...",
    "fullText": "A conversation with Kwame Anthony Appiah about the religious origins of social theory and his recent book Captive Gods.\n\nThe philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah’s latest book, Captive Gods: Religion and the Rise of Social Science, is concerned with the origins of the social sciences. His main claim is that “it’s through religion that society becomes a disciplinary object.” What Appiah means by this is that the founders of the modern social sciences—notably Edward Burnett Tylor, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, George Simmel—used religion as a framework through which they established sociology as a discipline. But what religious assumption, then, did their sociological analysis assume? And what significance does the religious origins of the social sciences have for contemporary social thought? The Nation spoke with Appiah about the anti-secular stance of right-wing movements, the invention of sociology, and his new book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDaniel Steinmetz-Jenkins: This book is principally concerned about the connection between religion and the rise of the social sciences. Perhaps its central thesis is the idea that “it’s through religion that society becomes a disciplinary object.” Can you elaborate on what you mean by this?\n\nKwame Anthony Appiah: What I mean is that “religion” was the way the classical sociologists like like Emil Durkheim, Georg Simmel, and Max Weber first managed to turn “society” into something you could actually study. Durkheim’s Elementary Forms defines religion as a system of beliefs and practices tied to sacred things, and what matters there is how those beliefs and rituals bind people together into a moral community—the church. For him, the believer isn’t wrong to think he depends on a higher power. That power does exist, but it’s society itself. For Weber, the religious creeds and customs of a people were the key to understanding the historical trajectory of a civilization. Simmel, meanwhile, thought of God as a kind of personification of society, a way of absolutizing our own rules. And then he borrowed from Friedrich Schleiermacher’s idea that religion is rooted in the feeling of absolute dependence on God and argued that this mirrors our dependence on the social order as it stretches across time and space. What we feel as religiosity, he suggested, is really an intimation of how society constitutes us and keeps us connected.\n\nA critical point is that it’s in the same line of work that we see a new idea of “society” taking shape. Earlier thinkers tended to see it as just a collection of individuals under a contract, say, or as a static backdrop subject to divine or natural laws. By the late 19th century, though, the sense was that society had its own inner workings. It wasn’t reducible to individual psychology, or to the laws of the natural sciences. It had dynamics of its own—structures, sentiments, norms—that shaped people even as people shaped them.\n\nYou see this in Durkheim’s homo duplex: Each of us is both an individual and a bearer of collective life. Simmel stressed the constant interplay between social forms and the content that fills them. Weber takes up the concept of social action, and he’s fascinated by collective forms of self-transcendence. What religion gave them was a way into this discovery: By analyzing “religion” as a social phenomenon, they were really inventing “society” in the terms that we know it today.\n\nDSJ: Does this argument assume a particular understanding of religion? I ask this question because my understanding is that there is no scholarly consensus on what religion actually is. The theologian Paul Tillich, for instance, defined religion as “ultimate concern” meaning that almost anything can be religious as long as it is the thing that someone cares about the most.\n\nKAA: Right, one of the themes I keep coming back to in the book is just how elusive a definition of religion has always been. Tillich’s “ultimate concern” is one attempt, but there are dozens of others: ritual, belief in spirits, systems of symbols, social glue, a sense of absolute dependence, and so on. None of them really carries the day. In fact, not everyone has thought “religion” was even an intelligible category. Wilfred Cantwell Smith, in the ’60s, argued that it wasn’t—that the term conflated too many different things to be a valid object of inquiry, and that we’d be better off speaking of “faith” and “cumulative traditions.” There were strong arguments there: Critics noted how much the concept seemed to owe to a Protestantized model of belief and how awkwardly that fit what you found in much of the rest of the world. It was fair to ask: Does “religion” exist?\n\nWhat’s striking is that even the skeptics couldn’t quite do without it. They kept lapsing in their vows, going back to using the word. There are a lot of semantic stakeholders here. It’s not that there’s some single right answer. It’s that the very effort to treat “religion” as a discrete object of study was what helped conjure into being “society” as a parallel object. The thesis doesn’t depend on a dogmatic definition so much as on the historical fact that the attempt to give contours to religion was a critical part of the intellectual work that made “society” visible.\n\nDSJ: What is interesting about the key figures discussed in your book—Edward Burnett Tylor, Durkheim, Simmel, and Weber—is how you connect their personal biographies to your argument about the rise of the social sciences. In other words, all four are undergoing a process of secularization, even as they acknowledge the integral role that religion plays in the advent of modern secular societies, and in their family histories. You yourself acknowledge something similar about your own background when talking about growing up around Christian, Islamic, Jewish influences and how they shaped you. All of which leads me to wonder if the rise of the social sciences really is about the rise of a new class of Western educated academics who are grappling with their own personal experience of moving away from traditional religion.\n\nKAA: It’s natural to think that Tylor’s break from Quakerism and Durkheim’s break from his rabbinical lineage gave each of them some secular skin in the game. But I should also note that secularity itself was a civic ideal introduced and advanced by religious people. In particular, by religious minorities, as both Tylor and Durkheim were, because if you’re part of a non-state religion, you’ll be drawn to the idea of a separation of church and state.\n\nNow, with Simmel, you’re looking at someone who hadn’t grown up with much religious observance at all. Which makes it all the more impressive that he was so sensitive to the affective charge of religion, and so quick to reach for the language of tone and color to capture experiences that fascinated him precisely because they felt exotic, a little strange. And Weber, of course, described himself as “religiously unmusical.” Even in his teenage letters, you see him writing about piety as though peering in from the outside. He could theorize brilliantly about the social power of religion, and he stressed that he wasn’t anti-religious, but he suspected he had a tin ear for the sacred and the spiritual.\n\nFor all of them, I agree, the retreat of institutional religion was not just a social fact they observed but also a standpoint from which they thought. It’s just that they weren’t congratulating themselves on their skepticism. On the contrary: that distance helped them explore how religion’s force still lingered in modern life, under other guises. Secularization was something they saw—and something they saw through.\n\nDSJ: With the rise of the social sciences in the late 19th century there was a real concern, especially in Germany, with the attempt to model the human sciences on methods of the natural sciences, as you show in your chapter on Simmel. In other words, there was the fear that the humanities would be delegitimated by an over-fixation on the regularities of the natural sciences as it alone was viewed as a true science. In this regard your book shows the vital role that religion played in early sociology, and in particular for resisting this tendency. Might the failure to value this distinction be a way of explaining why the humanities are in such a state of crisis today, especially given how little they are funded in comparison to STEM fields?\n\nKAA: I do find it fascinating to revisit those late-19th-century debates. Ernst Mach, the Austrian physicist, complained that humanists and scientists were behaving like the Montagues and the Capulets, and he hoped for a Romeo and Juliet to unite them—ideally, he added, without the tragic ending. Humanists, of course, worried about whose terms the marriage would be on.\n\nThe social theorists in my book were alert to the danger: that the richness of lived experience would get flattened into a set of mechanical laws. Religion, as I argue, was a counterweight here. In grappling with ritual, feeling, community, and dogma, these thinkers insisted that cultural inquiry needed its own categories and methods.\n\nI’ve sometimes found the distinction that Wilhelm Windelband drew in the 1890s between the “idiographic” and the “nomothetic” to be useful. The idea is that the humanities tend to focus on the singular—the French Revolution in all its contingencies, say—while the sciences pursue the general rule, the law that holds no matter the time or place. To put it differently: The humanities can ask what made this event, this person, this text distinctive. The sciences seek to identify universal laws of nature. Of course, the line isn’t sharp; these are tendencies, not watertight compartments. Both endeavors are indispensable, but they’re not the same. And sociology ended up carving out a kind of third space between them.\n\nSo one debate was about what you were trying to understand. Another was about what counted as understanding it. Simmel and Weber made much of Verstehen—a sort of interpretive, experiential grasp, as opposed to a more mechanistic explanation, Erklären. Windelband wanted to replace that distinction with his idiographic/nomothetic distinction, though in practice his scheme mostly piled on rather than displaced what came before. And then there’s the matter of values. Not just the values scholars bring to the table, but the values they study. At one point, Simmel asks what happens if we take religion not as a bundle of empirical claims but as a state of being. It’s problematic, sure, but it opened up a way of treating religion as a framework for interpreting and judging empirical claims without making such claims itself.\n\nThat’s not so far from what a lot of qualitative and interpretive scholarship still does. Which is why today, when the humanities are starved of funds and legitimacy, part of the trouble is a failure to grasp these old distinctions. Understanding society, history, and culture needs tools other than those you’d find in a laboratory. Now, one sign of the strange times we’re living in is that we now have to worry about those laboratories, too, because politicized policymakers have taken them hostage in their battles.\n\nDSJ: Durkheim famously equated religion with society. Of course, in Third Republic France that wasn’t such a leap to make as ethical teaching in the name of society seems little more than a counterpart to being in a predominately Catholic culture. Do you think, however, that something like Durkheim’s notion of a shared collective consciousness can apply to a country as big and politically divided as the US?\n\nKAA: You might think that Durkheim had more personal reasons for thinking this way. He grew up in an orthodox rabbinic community, so he knew what it felt like to inhabit a total moral world. As he’s writing, Catholicism in France was losing its grip under laïcité and anticlerical laws, but he could see that republican ideals were taking on a sacred glow of their own.\n\nStill, his ideas weren’t just a French reflex. He’d spent time in Germany, where the leading social theorists had come of age in a famously fractured political landscape. And when Durkheim talked about “collective consciousness” in the 1890s, he didn’t mean some mystical group mind. He meant the shared moral world that small, tight-knit communities tend to generate. He thought you saw it most strongly the farther back you went in history, and he believed that as societies modernized, religions got less all-encompassing and more open. By the 1900s, he’d retired the psychological talk of “consciousness” and started speaking instead about the “collective representations” through which societies sketch out their moral blueprints.\n\nHe wasn’t really chasing the idea of a grand national spirit. He was asking a more basic question: How does any community, large or small, manage to reproduce its moral order? And though he never made it to America, Weber did, just as he was drafting parts of The Protestant Ethic. What Weber saw here—the dizzying variety and vitality of sects, of small denominations—only reinforced his belief that theology could be an engine for an entire civilization. And if you follow Durkheim’s later language, those “collective representations”—the rituals, symbols, and practices that carry a society’s self-understanding—are remarkably potent in America, even if they’re as much sites of contestation as of consensus.\n\nDSJ: All of the main figures you discussed were in some sense trying to articulate the ties that bind modern societies together despite the gradual fading away of traditional religion. Fast forward to our current moment, and sociologists talk of an unprecedented loneliness epidemic that marks modern Western societies. Is secularism to blame?\n\nKAA: Experts debate whether there really is such an epidemic. There’s certainly a lot of talk about it, and it’s true that nonreligious people often report being less happy on surveys. Whether or not people are feeling lonelier, they feel they feel lonelier. Part of this might come from the way contemporary cultures have heightened our reflexivity. We’re constantly encouraged to monitor our own emotional states, to measure ourselves against others, to narrate our experience in therapeutic terms.\n\nBut I want to complicate the picture. If you go back to, say, the German history of Pietism, which gets started in the late 17th century, you see that the underlying issue isn’t new. When Pietists exalted heartfelt devotion over formal ritual, they obviously weren’t rebelling against secularity. They were rebelling against what felt like bloodless institutions and practices. Pietism was an effort to find intimacy, immediacy, inwardness, deep interpersonal communion—hence those little collegia pietatis. Versions of this craving have been with us for centuries. Even in a thoroughly religious world, people could experience a sense of spiritual emptiness and the desire to feel full again. That’s why Weber said that religious experience gets hollowed out as soon it gets systematized and institutionalized. And it was Weber, too, who stressed that Calvinism’s doctrine of predestination—the idea that no matter what you did, your fate was fixed—could leave you with a feeling of “tremendous inner loneliness.” In other words, the discontents we now ascribe to secular existence were once ascribed to certain kinds of religious existence.\n\nWhat’s more recent is the idea that we might have nonreligious forms of religion. When Durkheim talked about the “religion of humanity,” he had something like this in mind. For Simmel, the religious impulse was like a hermit crab, which could readily inhabit very different shells. He decided that the “problem of religion” would be solved if people lead religious lives—not lives “lived with religion” but lives that were, in their essence, religious. He’s using the adjectival form. That’s the move the German sociologist Ulrich Beck makes too. He tells us to distinguish between “religion” and “religious.” The noun sets up an either/or—are you in or are you out? The adjective works differently; it opens the door to a both/and. You can be “religious” in your orientation to ultimate questions without belonging to any particular institution. Here the point is that climate activism, human rights activism, or even the “wellness” movement involves forms and feelings we associate with religion. From that angle, the story isn’t just about secularism eroding our ties. It’s about people constantly reinventing forms of shared meaning, even if they don’t look like the churches of the past.\n\nDSJ: Do you see a connection here with the success of rightwing authoritarian movements which are almost all resoundingly anti-secular?\n\nKAA: Let me start by saying that the theorists I write about would probably frame the story differently. They’d ask whether these authoritarian movements really are simply reactions against secularism, against a supposed loss or loosening of faith. Someone like Viktor Orbán doesn’t present himself as a regular churchgoer or a pious congregant. Instead, he’s a defender of “civilizational Christianity.” And when he talks about his opponents, he doesn’t describe them as godless, or slack in their convictions. He calls them pious, even fanatical, adherents of a false creed. He says that European liberals in Brussels are missionaries on behalf of “the ideology of universal salvation and peace” and that they brook no dissent because their message to humanity can be “valid and true only if it is true without exception.” That is precisely the language of one universalizing religion attacking another.\n\nCulture wars have long been waged in that key. The very term Kulturkampf originally referred to Bismarck’s battle against the Catholic Church in the 1870s. In contemporary America, you hear the same anathematizing register, when people on the right rail against the “woke mind virus,” describe the Democratic Party as “demonic,” demand a “360-degree holy war,” or charge that what liberals support is “Satanic.” And I’m putting aside those lurid QAnon theories about literal Satan worship. The point is, these aren’t attacks on disbelief. You don’t wage a holy war against atheism. You wage it against a rival creed—against people who, in your view, bow to all the wrong gods.\n\nDSJ: Given all this, in what sense might your book be considered a kind of recovery project?\n\nKAA: My social theorists were, to circle back, skeptical about any simple version of the secularity thesis, the idea that modernity simply means religion fading away. That’s a story people still reach for, but it wasn’t theirs. Durkheim, Simmel, Weber—what fascinated them was how “religion” and “society” became intelligible only in relation to one another, and my book is about how that interplay gave birth to the social sciences.\n\nToday we often reduce religion to survey data about declining church membership. But for these earlier thinkers, religion was at the heart of understanding society itself. Religion, in their sense, was a definition-defying tangle of beliefs, practices, and feelings whose edges were always blurry. And what mattered was not simply what people thought or did or felt but how they lived together.\n\nThat idea hasn’t gone away. Various cognitive scientists now argue that large-scale societies required belief in supernatural enforcers of moral norms. Interpretive sociologists explore forms of religiosity that don’t recognize themselves as such. Weber, memorably, imagined a modern world prowled by a pantheon of rival gods, each with its own values, each fighting for followers. Which sounds a lot like the world we inhabit.\n\nSo if Captive Gods is a recovery project, it’s about bringing back the recognition that every society generates and sustains itself through transcendental meanings. And it’s about the modesty this recognition should inspire: the willingness to make room for practices and beliefs we don’t ourselves see the point of, and to interrogate our own dogmas as much as anyone else’s. Or, as a fellow once said: “Sit down, be humble.”",

    "description": "Naomi...",
    "fullText": "Her advocacy for Epstein’s victims is inspiring. But what about the rights of other women?\n\nEarlier this month on The View, Marjorie Taylor Greene said something that progressives might once have found astonishing: that “the Republican Party has a woman problem.” It’s part of her rebranding as an advocate of women, following her recent split from Donald Trump. The former MAGA loyalist, who recently resigned from the House of Representatives, joined Republican Tom Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna in a high-profile campaign to force the Department of Justice to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein. On November 19, both the House and Senate passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandated that “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative material” be released to the public.\n\nGreene hasn’t stopped there. In December, she proposed inviting Epstein’s victims to the Oval Office, something Trump refuses to do. The files, she laments, represent “everything wrong with Washington.” And as a woman, she considers it particularly personal. “Greene herself had never been sexually abused, but she knew women who had,” wrote The New York Times’ Robert Draper, after he conducted two lengthy interviews with her. “In her own small way…she could understand what it was like for a woman to stand up to a powerful man.”\n\nIn those same interviews, Greene cited Trump’s handling of the Epstein case, and his bullying of female members of Congress, as emblematic of “why women overwhelmingly don’t vote Republican.” She added that “there’s a very big message here.”\n\nBut how sincere is Greene’s newfound concern for the rights and experiences of women? If she really believes that “how women in leadership present themselves sends a message to younger women”—including her own two daughters—why does she continue to support policies that tell young women they should live without bodily autonomy? While her advocacy for Epstein’s victims is inspiring, she has failed to defend sexual assault survivors when their alleged assailants were prominent Republicans. In June 2024, more than a year after a New York jury found that Trump had sexually assaulted writer E. Jean Carroll, Greene compared him to Jesus Christ. When Dr. Christine Blasey Ford recounted, in horrifying detail, how Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, Greene didn’t speak up for her. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s secretary of war, has been credibly accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2017. According to a 22-page report by the Monterey Police Department, he allegedly “block[ed] the door with his body” in order to prevent the woman he assaulted from fleeing. But when Hegseth was confirmed, Greene declared—without irony—that “every American is safer with [Hegseth] leading.” In December 2024, the House Ethics Committee found “substantial evidence” that former Republican representative Matt Gaetz engaged in “sexual activity” with a minor, including the possibility of “statutory rape.” Greene responded on X that she “has proudly defended Matt Gaetz from the beginning,” and that “he has done nothing wrong.”\n\nIf Greene hasn’t consistently defended women’s right to protect their bodies from predatory men, she also hasn’t defended their right to protect their bodies from the state. When Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, she tweeted that it was a “great victory for God and the unborn.” A few months later, in a heated discussion with a Democratic voter, she remarked sarcastically that she “appreciates your interest in women’s rights, but killing an unborn baby is not a woman’s right.”\n\nShe proudly supported the law passed by Texas legislators in 2021 to criminalize abortion once the fetus has a heartbeat, which can appear after five to six weeks, when most women don’t know they are even pregnant. The “Heartbeat Protection Act” has since been replicated in more than 10 other states. The consequences of this law can be fatal. In 2021, Josseli Barnica, a Texas mother pregnant with her second child, experienced a high-risk delivery. The medical professionals at HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest would have normally acted to speed up the birth and prevent an infection in the uterus. But because of the Heartbeat Protection Act, doing so could have been a crime. Until the heartbeat of the fetus was undetectable, the doctors couldn’t do anything. Barnica died three days later from sepsis. Experts who reviewed a timeline of her treatment created by ProPublica concluded that there was a “good chance she would have survived” if the law had allowed doctors to intervene.\n\nThis is not the only such story. In 2022, Georgia resident Amber Nicole Thurman needed a procedure to expel the remnants of fetal tissue from her uterus, according to ProPublica. Because of Georgia’s Heartbeat Protection Act, any physician who performed this surgery would have risked jail. After 20 hours of her lying in a hospital bed waiting for surgery, Thurman’s organs failed. According to an official state committee composed of 10 doctors, she died a “preventable” death. She was 28. This evidence did not move Greene, however. She tweeted that Kamala Harris was “lying to women” about Thurman’s death, claiming that she “died from taking abortion pills!”\n\nGreene’s recent criticism of the way Donald Trump’s Republican Party treats women is a step toward making amends for her sycophantic past. But her efforts are shallow. The GOP’s problem with women stems from far more than Trump’s sexist comments and his allies’ misdeeds. It is bound up with his party’s policies, which deny women the most basic right: bodily autonomy. Until Greene challenges those policies, her self-perception as an advocate for women’s rights will remain undeserved.",

    "fullText": "Pretti was one of us. We have to carry on his struggle.\n\nIn 1964, a military coup overthrew the democratically elected government of Brazil and plunged the country into more than 20 years of dictatorship. One might ask why an epidemiologist like me would be interested in Latin American history at this moment. What drew me to that era was the key role that clinicians and public health workers played in the resistance against the dictatorship; their simultaneous push for a national healthcare program; and the ways in which this sector organized, even as more conservative physicians sided with the putschists, happy to see their more progressive colleagues jailed and persecuted.\n\nI’m not making one-to-one comparisons between our current predicament and what happened in Brazil years ago. But the insights of that time ring true generations later. Brazil’s medical rebels thought healthcare was a human right. They wanted it to benefit the public good, not private greed. And they saw themselves as equal to workers rather than as their social betters. That history also reminds us that authoritarianism, which Americans since the Red Scares of the 20th century have been told comes from the left, finds an easy alliance with the rich and privileged.\n\nWhich brings us to Minneapolis and the United States in 2026. The killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti last weekend sent shock waves across this country, but it fell especially hard on people who work in health. The National Nurses United union spoke out directly on an assault on one of their own, but the grief was shared by everyone who knows the clinicians at our local VA hospitals or works on infectious disease research. For all of us, the murder of Alex Pretti has cut close to home.\n\nThere are plenty of clinicians and public health professionals who, like Pretti, have been appalled by what is happening in this country and to our communities. But there are still others who, whether because of their class or their ideology, either see themselves above the fray or have allied themselves with the current administration. Then there are the reactionary centrists in the field, more concerned with academic hippie-punching and attacking the supposed excesses of the progressive movement in public health than they are with fighting fascism.\n\nThe political economy of healthcare and public health in America is deeply tied up with the oligarchy of wealth. The authoritarian violence happening now is occurring in conjunction with a totalizing project from the far right and its corporate allies that, among other things, seeks to destroy public health and healthcare in the US and leave the carcass of what is left to the private sector to devour.\n\nDespite what the “can’t we all just get along” caucus tells us, merely pleading for an end to polarization won’t turn the tide here. We have to organize directly against the entrenched interests that have brought this country to the brink. This means, as Adrienne Maree has said, “Do we all share the same worldview?” isn’t the question we need to be posing now; we rather need to ask,“Is your heart beating and do you plan to live? Then come this way and we will figure out the rest on the other side.”\n\nThe fight for health for all, for clinical care as a public good, and for public health as a necessity is tied up with the struggle against authoritarianism in 2026. At this point, the threat is existential, and the coalition we need to build can include everyone who is not part of this administration’s techno-death cult. And this coalition is growing every day.\n\nFor all the sorrow and horror over what is happening in Minneapolis, the people there are an example to the rest of us. They are organizing to defend their city, but more importantly to care for each other. They are the antithesis of the rapacious violence that President Trump has brought down on them—an example of another kind of social organization built on solidarity and community rather than extraction and exploitation, the grift that this president personifies.\n\nWhat is happening in Minneapolis is partly spontaneous, but also deeply rooted in the expertise of activists there. Organizing is a practice, a way of life; it can be taught. Two weeks ago, I was at a gathering in Orlando, Florida, which was organized by the Emergency Campaign to Support Higher Education. The meeting was a training on the basics of community organizing with over 300 people, mostly students, in attendance from all around the country. For two days, we went through the basics of understanding and using power and public narrative, identifying issues that inspire, building a mass movement, mapping power, and developing campaigns. These kinds of trainings can be done all over the US—there are groups in every state that have the experience and expertise to take you through these fundamentals. Find them. Organize local trainings. Get skilled up. Learn the tools. Put them to use.\n\nThis leads us back to Brazil. Like the Brazilian doctors, who joined the labor movement and helped topple their dictatorship, we can build power by organizing and linking together with others, so that the chance to divide and conquer us, by stoking class and professional divisions, simply fails. This isn’t about just showing up to rallies and marches, signing petitions and sending letters—it’s creating powerful movements locally that can hold politicians and other decision-makers to account, to shape the future ourselves on an ongoing basis. Look to Brazil. Look to Alex Pretti. History shows us it can be done.",

    "fullText": "Without their videos of ICE shootings, we wouldn’t know what is really happening.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, CNN anchor Jake Tapper was interviewing US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hours after Border Patrol agents killed Alex Pretti. Suddenly, CNN cut away to live coverage of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference. Noem declared that Pretti had “attacked our officers” while “brandishing” a handgun and planned “to kill law enforcement.” When a reporter tried to ask a question about her claim, she interrupted to say, “That is no claim. It is the facts.” When another reporter noted that the White House had just called Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” Noem forcefully agreed.\n\nAny journalist who’s been paying attention knows that Noem’s boss, President Donald Trump, often doesn’t tell the truth. Trump launched his political career by asserting without evidence that America’s first Black president wasn’t born in the United States, which would have meant Barack Obama was in power illegally. After losing the 2020 election, Trump said he had no plans to leave office because, he insisted, he had actually won. Trump repeats that lie to this day, along with his claim that the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol to keep him in power was a day of “peace” and “love.”\n\nBut in spinning their latest web of lies, Trump and his aides didn’t reckon with the ingenuity and courage of Minnesotans who witnessed Border Control officers shooting Pretti—and Renee Good before him—and recorded the encounters on their cell phones. Without that evidence, the government’s version of the facts would have had the upper hand in shaping the public narrative. With that evidence, however, it’s obvious that “Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked,” as Pretti’s “heartbroken but also very angry parents” wrote in a statement the next day. “He had his phone in his right hand, and his empty left hand is raised above his head trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down.” Likewise, bystander videos of Renee Good’s shooting show that she was turning her vehicle away from ICE agent Jonathan Ross when he fired three deadly shots through her windows.\n\nWhether they know it or not, the bystanders who recorded these videos are citizen journalists. They are ordinary people, not trained in conventional journalism, and they were bearing witness to events of utmost importance to their community and country. And they were doing so under dangerous conditions, as was also exemplified by 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, who on May 25, 2020, bravely kept her cell phone focused on police officer Derek Chauvin throughout the nine minutes and 29 seconds that Chauvin’s knee was choking the life out of George Floyd.\n\nThe events of recent days have shown that citizen journalists, though not a substitute for professionals, can be an invaluable complement. Without their presence at the scene and steadiness under pressure, the public and the rest of the media would be ignorant of a pivotal aspect of the story unfolding in Minneapolis. We’d be hearing only the government’s version of the truth, which, given the Trump administration’s history of flagrant falsehoods, deserves extreme skepticism. Absent these videos, it is all but inconceivable that the editorial boards at three of America’s most influential newspapers—The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal—would be stating that the administration’s narrative defies belief or that the administration itself would be trying to walk back its initial slanders of Pretti.\n\nAll parts of the modern information system, from legacy newsrooms to social media influencers, can now present a fuller account of what is happening in Minnesota and let viewers and readers draw their own conclusions. And we can explore urgent questions raised by these videos, such as: How many more people might ICE agents have killed when no cameras were recording? Working in tandem at this critical moment for American democracy, citizen and professional journalists can fulfill the essential mission the nation’s founders envisioned for a free press: to inform the people and hold power to account.",

    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best WSL players to share the food they love and to chat about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nKerstin Casparij has been setting the pace down the flanks for league leaders Manchester City all season.\n\nOn the latest episode of Eat & Yap, while teaching Alex Scott how to create the Dutch delicacy oliebollen, she reveals how she ended up with a cat tattoo, why her girlfriend thought she was a gardener and why team-mate Vivianne Miedema causes her to swear in Dutch.\n\nAlex: OK, so talk to me, what's on the menu.\n\nKerstin: All right, so you'll see a massive pan of oil, which I know doesn't look too nice, but I've been able to prep some butter and this is for a snack called oliebollen.\n\nAlex: So this is a bit of home?\n\nKerstin: It is very Dutch and we only have them around New Year's. You can only get the packaging around New Year's as well. Don't look at the calories actually, because that's why we don't have them all year round!\n\nAlex: Some recipes had currants and raisins for this...\n\nKerstin: I don't like the raisins!\n\nAlex: We're on the same wavelength there! I'll warn you, I'm not very good at hiding things if I don't like them.\n\nKerstin: Alex, I'm Dutch. Do I look like the type that hides it?\n\nAlex: Talk to me a bit more about life at home because you grew up in what, a remote part of the Netherlands?\n\nKerstin: So I'm a northern girl. I'm from a province called the Friesland and I'm very lucky that I grew up in a small town where a lot of sports are available. Playing was like a two-minute walk from where I used to live, which was perfect.\n\nAlex: I feel like it was always definite you were going to go on and be an athlete then?\n\nKerstin: Well, my parents met both playing for the Dutch national team and they both did judo, so there was no choice other for us than to do sports.\n\nAlex: How did the people back home describe you back then?\n\nKerstin: People mostly described me as loud, very chatty - I'm raging ADHD. I've calmed down a little bit now but as a child I was all over the shop. It was such a good thing, growing up and wanting to become an athlete, because I was so hyper-focused on football.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's hard to navigate, so how did you do that?\n\nKerstin: At that time I was really struggling to keep up in school, to get ready for tests and also do all my football. Once I had the diagnosis, I was speaking to psychologists and my parents were very supportive. It takes time and I still have a lot of things to learn about myself.\n\nAlex: Would you say Manchester feels like home for you now?\n\nKerstin: Definitely. I think the people here are so nice. That's one of the things I heard when I was going to join. I live here with my girlfriend - we've got our cats.\n\nAlex: So you met your girlfriend in Manchester?\n\nKerstin: We met on Tinder in Manchester. It was great for me because I was a bit lonely, living on my own and I was just excited to meet other people outside my team-mates. I love my team-mates but sometimes you want to see other people as well.\n\nAlex: Sometimes that's the part that's hard to explain. Yes, you are fully immersed in football but it's equally as important to have other hobbies.\n\nKerstin: My girlfriend always says: 'You've got such a football perspective' and also just work-life balance. It's so different than she has, working nine to five and being off at weekends. Your work is not your life, not your personality and it doesn't define who you are. Being able to see that side of it and her allowing me to step away is really nice.\n\nAlex: You said you met on Tinder?\n\nKerstin: Yeah and to be fair, I was debating whether to go on Tinder. This was at the point in my career where I wasn't that known.\n\nAlex: Did I read you didn't put any photos up on Tinder of you in football kit?\n\nKerstin: I didn't put any bio - I didn't put any pictures of football. So Ruth had no idea that I was even sporty. She thought I was a gardener because I was tanned… She had no idea about football so it was fun to introduce her to the world and now she's a massive fan. She knows all the gossip! Sometimes she comes home and she tells me these things and I'm like: 'How do you know this?'\n\nAlex: So you've got Ruth, and now two cats?\n\nKerstin: Kiwi and Mango. Both fruits. I got Kiwi because I was on my own and I was very lonely. Then I met Ruth a couple of months later and we're both away quite a lot so we thought we should get Kiwi a brother.\n\nAlex: And next level, you have a tattoo.\n\nKerstin: Yes, I've got a tattoo of them. Should I show you? I've got a tattoo of them looking into a wine glass just because they're cute and silly.\n\nAlex: Are you fully immersed in Manc life? What kind of slang words?\n\nKerstin: I kinda just copy everyone else.\n\nAlex: What about when you're back with the Dutch team?\n\nKerstin: I definitely struggle having to switch to Dutch again, like finding the words because I only speak Dutch with my mum.\n\nAlex: What are the team meetings like in Manchester City then? Is it fully English or do you have translators?\n\nKerstin: It's all English. I know some that do struggle a little bit and when they have a meeting with the coach, they do have a translator to make sure they're being heard. To be fair, team meetings are really good. Andree [Jeglertz] really made a point about it being really open. We're all in a massive circle rather than an auditorium so when you speak you can actually look directly at each other. We really work together and everybody has a voice.\n\nAlex: You do team bonding stuff?\n\nKerstin: We've made it a very big thing to have a lot of team activities this year. So I'm captain of the team activity crew together with Laura Coombs. We went to Crystal Maze the other day with players and staff, which we've made a big thing. We want to get together with the staff as well, just to get that connection.\n\nAlex: It's how they know you away from the field as well.\n\nKerstin: Yeah, exactly. More of your personality. Sometimes it can be a bit of a step to approach someone in a leadership role and to get everybody together and just do something fun away from the club in your own clothes creates such a nice bond. You actually have conversations that you might not have at the club.\n\nAlex: I think you've done a cooking class didn't you? How did that go?\n\nKerstin: It was a success - it was Italian dishes. Some people made amazing risotto, they were getting the lemon in and it looked unreal. Some people burned it and some people were screaming that it was sticking to the pan.\n\nAlex: Come on, name names. Who's the bad cook?\n\nKerstin: I'm not going to expose my team-mates.\n\nAlex: Let's talk about temptations and cravings, because people are starting to talk about Manchester City potentially lifting the WSL trophy this season. Are you believing? Why are you laughing at me?\n\nKerstin: I mean, it's kind of funny because we were in such an underdog position going into this season. I felt like everybody was talking about Chelsea, Arsenal, [Manchester] United. It was kind of nice being left out of the conversation and I think we really took that as motivation.\n\nAlex: What do you think has changed?\n\nKerstin: It's little tweaks that matter the most, and also Andree's playing style. We get so much freedom, and also trust and responsibility. Previously it was a good system but a bit robotic at times. We do all the analysis and he gives us everything we need but if something's a bit different, he can't change that from the side. Leaving that space allows us to be adaptable on the pitch.\n\nAlex: What do you put your form down to?\n\nKerstin: I've got such a strong desire to show everybody what I can do and be the best that I can be. I'm really enjoying our offensive style of play this year and linking up with Bunny [Shaw] and Kerolin and all the other incredible forwards that we have. It's just been a joy to work. I go every day with a smile on my face.\n\nAlex: I've always wanted to learn about different cultures and I suppose you have that at Manchester City?\n\nKerstin: That's one of the things I love about football in general. We travel to these amazing places, but also my team-mates are from many different continents and cultures. It's been an eye-opener because I'm from a northern town in the Netherlands. We didn't have a lot of diversity growing up, so meeting these incredible people has been really inspiring.\n\nAlex: There are some cheeky elements to your game, which I absolutely love. Is this you trying to put the opposition off?\n\nKerstin: To be fair, I'm a bit annoying when I'm marking, like trying to push away. I'm not the tallest, I'm not the best at heading so I'm a blocker. Just be the annoying little fly, the little mosquito that doesn't let them head the ball.\n\nAlex: You've now got Dutch team-mate Vivianne Miedama at the club - what's it like having her at club level?\n\nKerstin: She's a fantastic player. In training, it looks so easy and she looks like she's putting in minimum effort and she bangs it into top bins. I swear at her in Dutch - no-one knows what I'm saying! She's such a good player to have with all her experience. A little bit of Dutchness can do wonders.\n\nWatch: Manchester City v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Sunday, 1 February (14:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "JAKARTA/SINGAPORE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities scrambled on Thursday to arrest a flight of capital from the stock market, rolling out measures to counter the risk of a downgrade to frontier-market status that prompted a selloff of more than 8% in just two days.\n\nWhat concerns exist about President Prabowo's policies?\n\nWhat measures did Indonesian regulators announce today?\n\nHow would MSCI downgrade impact Indonesian stocks?\n\nWhy did MSCI warn of downgrading Indonesia?\n\nThe rout, which erased ​about $80 billion in market value, came after index provider MSCI flagged concerns about ownership and trading transparency in Indonesian stocks, the latest setback for a market struggling to ‌maintain investor confidence.\n\nForeign capital has flowed out of Indonesia because of concerns about how President Prabowo Subianto is widening the fiscal deficit and ramping up the state's involvement in financial markets.\n\nThe appointment of his nephew, Thomas Djiwandono, to ‌the central bank this month, after last year's abrupt firing of respected Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, has shaken confidence in his fiscal stewardship and pushed the rupiah to record lows.\n\nMODEST RECOVERY AFTER REGULATORY RESPONSE\n\nIndonesian stocks staged a modest recovery late on Thursday after the country's regulators unveiled several measures, including doubling the free-float requirement for listed firms to 15%, as part of their response to MSCI.\n\nThe benchmark Jakarta Composite Index closed down just 1% after an earlier slide of 8% - which triggered a trading halt - following Wednesday's 7.4% tumble.\n\nThe rupiah was 0.27% softer at 16,745 against the dollar, just ⁠below last week's record low of 16,985.\n\n\"The two-day sell-off looks less ‌like a reaction to fundamentals and more like a repricing of market access risk,\" said Josua Pardede, chief economist at PermataBank.\n\n\"In the near-term market will likely remain headline-driven until there is tangible evidence of transparency improvements and a firmer policy mix that reassures investors on institutional strength and fiscal ‍discipline.\"\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Mahendra Siregar, head of the Financial Services Authority, said communication with MSCI had been positive and it was awaiting a response to its proposed measures, which he hoped could be implemented soon with the issues resolved by March.\n\n\"We will exclude investors in the corporate and other categories from the free float calculation and then publish shareholdings above and below 5% for each ownership category,\" Mahendra ​said.\n\nMSCI said in a statement on Thursday evening in Indonesia that it would \"continue to monitor developments in the Indonesian market and engage with market participants and authorities, including the Otoritas ‌Jasa Keuangan and the Indonesia Stock Exchange, and will communicate further actions as warranted.\"",

    "description": "Here’s the latest on scenarios, predictions and forecasts for a storm that could rapidly intensify into a bomb cyclone and bring snow to NYC and NJ this weekend.",
    "fullText": "A powerful coastal storm is expected to develop this weekend, and forecasters say its track will determine whether New York City sees accumulating snow or largely avoids impacts, with confidence highest for a system forming off the Carolinas.\n\nFOX 5 NY Meteorologist Mike Woods warns a slight shift closer to the coast could bring a major nor’easter, while a farther-offshore track would limit snowfall for much of the tri-state area.\n\nThe storm could rapidly strengthen into a bomb cyclone, a rare intensification process that can produce heavy snow, damaging winds and dangerous travel conditions as Arctic air remains locked over the Northeast.\n\nNEW YORK CITY - More winter weather may be on the way as forecasters track a potential weekend snowstorm that could strengthen into a major nor’easter.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) says confidence is growing that a powerful coastal storm will develop late this week, with the potential to bring snow, strong winds and bitter cold to the New York City area.\n\nSKIP TO: PREDICTIONS | FORECAST | BOMB CYCLONE | 5 DAY | LIVE WEATHER\n\nHowever, small changes in the storm’s track could make a big difference in who sees accumulating snow — and how much. Here's the latest on the storm.\n\nFOX 5 NY Meteorologist Mike Woods says the region needs to watch the storm closely.\n\nStay connected with FOX LOCAL. For winter storm coverage—Download Now.\n\n\"If it’s a little further offshore, we’re left with less of an impact,\" Woods said. \"But if it’s a little closer to us, we could have a major nor’easter on our hands.\"\n\n❄️ Winter Storm Likely This Weekend ❄️\n\nConfidence has increased, particularly across the Carolinas and southern Virginia, for impactful snowfall beginning as early as Friday night. More uncertainty remains for areas north along the East Coast. Stay tuned for more updates! pic.twitter.com/KT1UiNH6Dy\n\n— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) January 28, 2026\n\nWith a cold weather advisory in effect due to Arctic air already locked in place, conditions could support snow across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nFOX 5 NY's meteorologist Mike Woods says the region needs to watch the storm closely.\n\n\"If it’s a little farther offshore, we’re left with less of an impact,\" Woods said. \"But if it’s a little closer to us, we could have a major nor’easter on our hands.\"\n\nWoods says some forecast models currently show snow reaching parts of the tri-state area, particularly the Jersey Shore and the eastern end of Long Island, late Saturday into Sunday.\n\nOther scenarios keep the storm farther offshore, limiting impacts for the city. Forecasters emphasize that the exact track of the storm remains uncertain. Even a shift of 50 to 100 miles could change precipitation types, snowfall totals or whether some areas see little to no snow at all.\n\nForecast guidance suggests snow could begin as early as Friday night in parts of the Southeast before spreading north.\n\nThe setup includes very cold air already in place across the Northeast, combined with a developing coastal storm that could pull moisture northward. Woods notes that temperatures will trend colder over the next several days, not warmer.\n\n\"We’ve got more shots of Arctic air coming through,\" he said. \"That’s why temperatures are actually going down instead of up.\"\n\nWind chill advisories are already in effect across parts of the region, with feels-like temperatures dipping below zero in some areas.\n\nFOX Weather says the developing storm has a strong likelihood of rapidly intensifying, a process known as \"bombing out,\" which could turn it into a bomb cyclone. Forecast models suggest the storm’s central pressure could drop dramatically as it moves offshore, a sign of rapid strengthening.\n\nHowever, where that intensification occurs remains uncertain. Meteorologists stress that the storm is still several days away, and multiple scenarios remain on the table.\n\nA bomb cyclone forms through a process called bombogenesis, which occurs when a storm’s central pressure drops at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, according to FOX Weather.\n\nForecasters say a pronounced dip in the jet stream is reinforcing cold air across much of the eastern United States while steering the storm farther south before it turns north.\n\nA strong upper-level disturbance is expected to become embedded in the jet stream late this week, helping trigger the development of low pressure off the East Coast.\n\nWith cold air already in place, that combination raises the risk for snow if the storm moves close enough to the region.\n\nMeteorologists say updates over the next several days will be critical in determining the storm’s impact on New York City and the surrounding area.\n\nThe biggest question remains the storm’s path after it moves through the Carolinas, with forecast models split on whether it will track far enough north to bring another weekend snow to the Northeast.\n\nWednesday: Bitterly cold but dry. Arctic air remains in place with sunshine and strong wind chills making it feel well below freezing across the tri-state area.\n\nThursday: Continued cold with increasing clouds. No precipitation expected, but the cold air sets the stage for potential weekend impacts.\n\nFriday: Clouds increase as a coastal storm begins to organize off the Southeast coast. Snow develops across parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia by Friday night. Conditions remain cold locally with precipitation still uncertain for NYC.\n\nSaturday: Storm system moves north along the East Coast. Snow is possible in parts of New Jersey, Long Island and coastal areas, depending on the storm’s track. New York City remains in a \"wait-and-see\" zone.\n\nSunday: Potential for lingering snow, wind and cold if the storm tracks closer to the coast. A farther offshore track would limit impacts, while a closer path could bring a nor’easter with strong winds and accumulating snow.\n\nStay ahead of the snow with FOX 5’s expert meteorologists, streaming LIVE on FOX LOCAL.

    "description": "Jayson Tatum's return has been a question mark for the Celtics all season.",
    "fullText": "The question of Jayson Tatum's return from a torn Achilles has loomed over the Boston Celtics' entire 2025-26 season. The team might be about to get the answer it didn't want.\n\nPrime Video's Chris Haynes reported Wednesday that a recent and unspecified development has caused the Celtics star to reevaluate his situation and consider sitting out the entire season. Haynes added he had recently heard Tatum was \"getting close\" to a return, but it's now \"up in the air\" if he plays at all.\n\nThe news comes a day after Tatum expressed reluctance about making a return late in the season, which he worried would disrupt the chemistry the Celtics have developed without him, during an appearance on \"The Pivot Podcast.\"\n\n\"That's something I contemplate every day,\" Tatum said. \"More so about the team, if or when I do come back this season, they would've played 50 some-odd games without me. So they have an identity this year or things that they felt have clicked for them, and it's been successful, right, third or second team in the East up to this point. So there is a thought in my head that's like, how does that work or hows does that look with me integrating myself off an injury and 50-60 games into a season? There could obviously be some challenges and it is a thought, like damn? Do I come back or should I wait? It's something that I honestly, recently in the last two weeks or so, just kind of contemplate every single day.\"\n\nTatum tore his Achilles in last year's Eastern Conference semifinals and has had a hazy timetable to return ever since. Achilles tears are one of the most-feared injuries in all of sports, but Tatum's youth at 27 years old and recent advancements in treatment invited optimism for this season.\n\nTatum refused to rule out a return before the season and showed off some dunking ability in October, while the Celtics were reported to be cautiously optimistic. Now, they might have to accept an All-NBA talent isn't walking through that door until 2026-27.\n\nDespite Tatum's absence, the Celtics have remained one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. The team is tied for the second-best record in the East with a 29-18 record, thanks to a career season from Jaylen Brown and strong contributions from supporting cast members like Derrick White, Payton Pritchard and Neemia Queta.\n\nTatum is still under contract with the Celtics for four more seasons on his five-year, $304 million supermax deal.",

Curry finished with 27 points after an eight-point first half on 2-of-7 shooting, following in the second half with 5-of-7 shooting and 7-of-8 free-throw shooting.\n\nMoses Moody added 26 points (9-of-15 shooting, 5-of-9 from 3-point range) and Golden State rode eight double-figure scorers for 53.5% shooting, 23-of-54 3-point shooting and 38 assists for 42 baskets.\n\nUtah star forward Lauri Markkanen had 18 points on 6-of-14 shooting while Bryce Sensabaugh scored a team-high 22 points.\n\nThe Warriors (27-22) made 15 first-half threes – a season high for any half – on their way to a 68-55 lead: three apiece from Moody and Hield (during an 11-point, four-minute, second-quarter furry), two from Curry, Melton and Quinten Post and one from Al Horford, Brandin Podziemski and Will Richard.\n\nSharp ball and player movement opened jumpers and active defense forced 11 turnovers in the opening half.

A 99-82 advantage was cut with an 11-2 quarter-closing run from the Jazz (15-33), who started it with a triple from George (19 points) and capped with Isaiah Collier's buzzer-beating fastbreak layup.\n\nRichard and Moody started the fourth quarter with back-to-back triples to restore Golden State's double-figure lead.\n\nThe Warriors next play Friday against the Eastern Conference-leading Detroit Pistons at Chase Center.\n\nThis article originally published at Warriors on target from distance, end four-game trip with rout of Jazz.",

    "description": "The Ukrainian superstar Elina Svitolina has a shot at glory today, as she takes on world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the Australian Open semifinals.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian superstar Elina Svitolina has a shot at glory today, as she takes on world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the Australian Open semifinals. It’s been a surreal run so far for the Olympic bronze medalist in Melbourne. With one more win, the No. 12 seed has a chance to become the first Ukrainian woman ever to reach a Grand Slam final. In hindsight, this journey wouldn’t be possible without the steadfast support from her family.\n\nMikhaylo Svitolin is the man behind the scenes of Elina Svitolina’s tennis success. Before he was a tennis dad, he was a competitive wrestler in Ukraine. Professionally, he made his living as a real estate agent in Odesa, but his real passion was always been sports. Interestingly, Elina has mentioned that she only started playing tennis at the age of 5 because she wanted her dad’s attention, as he was busy traveling for tournaments with her older brother, Yulian.\n\nAs Elina got better and better, Mikhaylo stepped up as her early coach and mentor. The biggest sacrifice came when she was just 12. As per advice from the businessman Yuriy Sapronov, the millionaire who caught Elina’s talents while she was playing in a local tournament, the family made a decision to move from Odesa to Kharkiv so she could train at a professional academy to have better shots of making the pro, some 350 miles from her hometown.\n\nLooking back, it was one big gamble, but safe to say, the investment is paying in dividends now, helping her eventually reach the world No. 3 ranking.\n\nOlena Svitolina is a powerhouse in her own right. She was a competitive rower before moving on to professional bowling by the time Elina began focusing on tennis.\n\nShe was known for being a strict but incredibly supportive parent. She often told Elina that coming from Ukraine meant she had to work twice as hard as anyone else to get noticed on the world stage. Elina openly admitted she wouldn’t be the player she is today without her mom.\n\n“My mom always supported me. This is very important, especially in tennis, given how much time you spend on the road, at tournaments, away from friends and family… the sport of tennis is such that almost every week you have losses happen, it’s hard… my mother gives and continues to give me strength and faith in the fact that I can be a better tennis player.”\n\nYou can take a hint from her dedication. Olena’s love for the game and her professional career were so impeccable that when the family decided to move from Odesa to Kharkiv for Elina’s elite training, Olena stayed behind for two months to finish her bowling commitments before joining them.\n\nEven now, in 2026, Olena is still Elina’s biggest cheerleader. These days, she wears more of a spectator and grandma first.\n\nElina Svitolina was born in Ukraine to Ukrainian parents, Mikhaylo and Olena. Her dad has Jewish roots through her grandmother, Tamara. However, during her tennis career, she received several offers from other countries to change her nationality and play for them, often with a lot of money involved. However, she always chose to represent Ukraine.\n\nThe parents got involved very early in her career, with Mikhaylo serving as her former coach and Olena deliberately pushing her and making her work twice as hard to make it to the big leagues. Her parents followed her to every match and expecting constant victory. Around 2015, they collectively decided it was best for them to step back from traveling with her, allowing her to gain independence and take ownership of her career. Today, her parents remain her primary motivators and a constant source of strength.\n\nBut these days their role has changed quite a bit. It revolves less around Elina, more around Skai, their granddaughter, so Elina and her husband Gaël Monfils can focus on their matches. Safe to say, parents have traded their “coach” hats for “grandparent” hats.\n\nThe post Who Are Elina Svitolina Parents? Everything To Know About Mikhaylo Svitolin And Olena Svitolina appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "There are a lot of reasons Nick Saban is revered in Tuscaloosa.\n\nBut if you really want to understand who Nick Saban is, who he has always been, you don’t have to look at trophies or banners hanging inside Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nYou look at moments like this one.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nick and Terry Saban sat down with Alabama Governor Kay Ivey to talk about the future of kids.\n\nGovernor Ivey said it best when she shared how much time and energy the Sabans continue to pour into young people and their opportunities. And that’s the part that hits hardest, because Nick Saban didn’t have to do this.\n\nIt was great to have Coach and Ms. Terry Saban in my office.\n\nThey have always taken the time and energy to invest in young people and their futures.\n\nI look forward to Alabama students soon immersing themselves in STEM education and the arts at the Saban Center. #alpolitics pic.twitter.com/aTjYmTbeGM\n\n— Governor Kay Ivey (@GovernorKayIvey) January 28, 2026\n\nHe doesn’t need another project.\n\nHe doesn’t need another ribbon-cutting or photo op.\n\nHis name is already etched into history forever.\n\nThat’s not coincidence. That’s character.\n\nThe Saban Center isn’t just another building going up in Tuscaloosa.\n\nIt’s a first-of-its-kind learning campus designed to bring STEM education, the arts, innovation, and imagination under one roof, where students don’t just learn, but discover. Where curiosity is encouraged. Where confidence is built. Where leadership begins before a kid even realizes what leadership looks like.\n\nBecause Nick Saban has always understood something deeper than wins and losses: opportunity changes lives.\n\nThis campus will house the State of Alabama STEM Hub. It will be home to the Tuscaloosa Children’s Theatre. It will include IGNITE, formerly the Children’s Hands-On Museum, giving kids hands-on experiences that spark creativity and wonder.\n\nNot memorization. Not test scores. Real engagement.\n\nAnd maybe the most poetic part of all? The Saban Center will be built using only Alabama-sourced materials.\n\nThat’s Nick Saban in a nutshell.\n\nFor decades, we watched him develop young men on the football field, teaching discipline, accountability, resilience, and belief.\n\nWe watched players arrive as teenagers and leave as leaders.\n\nWe watched assistants learn under him, grow under pressure, and go on to shape programs of their own.\n\nBut this? This is bigger than football.\n\nThis is Nick and Miss Terry saying, “We’re not done.”\n\nThey’re saying that Tuscaloosa isn’t just a place where championships were won, it’s a place where futures will be built.\n\nThat Alabama’s kids deserve world-class resources. That innovation and creativity belong here, not somewhere else.\n\nThe Saban Center is set to open in 2027. And when it does, generations of students, many of whom may never wear a helmet or step onto a field, will benefit from the same belief Nick Saban has always had in people: that if you give them the right environment, they’ll rise to the challenge.\n\nNick Saban changed college football forever.\n\nBut what he’s doing now, what he’s always done, might matter even more.\n\nHe’s building something that lasts.\n\nAnd once again, he’s reminding us why Tuscaloosa will always be better because he chose to call it home.\n\nBut a man who never stopped caring.",

    "fullText": "Radio: Huskies Gameday App, Sports Radio KJR\n\nBetting Line: Washington Huskies +12.5\n\nPoints For per Game: 85.5 (25th)\n\nPoints Against per Game: 68.3 (41st)\n\nAdjusted Offensive Efficiency: 130.4 (1st)\n\nAdjusted Defensive Efficiency: 99.1 (29th)\n\nG- Keaton Wagler, Fr. 6’6, 185: 17.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 4.0 apg, 47.7% FG, 43.5% 3pt, 82.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +8.6 BPR (22nd nationally)\n\nWagler is one of the all-time outliers in modern college basketball. He was the #150 ranked freshman in the class of 2025 and yet has clearly been a top-25 player in the entire country among all classes as demonstrated by his 46-point demolition of Purdue last weekend. Wagler is a 6’6 3-star freshman point guard who is 12th nationally in offensive efficiency. He hardly ever turns the ball over, is a lights out 3-point shooter, draws a ton of fouls, and can make every pass. Just an amazing season so far.\n\nG- Jake Davis, Jr. 6’6, 215: 4.8 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 0.7 apg, 44.0% FG, 41.5% 3pt, 75.0% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +3.9 BPR (406th nationally)\n\nDavis has been thrust into the starting lineup with the recent injury to starting guard Kylan Boswell. But that’s not necessarily that bad of a thing because Davis is 2nd(!) nationally in offensive efficiency. He absolutely never turns the ball over with just 2 giveaways all season and is the epitome of a 3-point sniper. Over 80% of his attempts this season have been from behind the arc and is a career 40% shooter to justify it. Davis has good size at 6’6 but adds almost nothing from a defense/rebounding standpoint so is exclusively a 5th option floor spacer. Still nice to have.\n\nF- Andrej Stojakovic, Jr. 6’7, 215: 13.9 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.1 apg, 50.0% FG, 26.3% 3pt, 81.8% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +4.5 BPR (279th nationally)\n\nStojakovic was the final piece of the puzzle for Illinois in the transfer portal after transferring from Stanford to Cal to now the Illini. The 3-point shot has just never really developed and is at a career low right now but it’s okay because Stojakovic has been great at the rim and in the midrange. The rebounding and steal numbers are lower than you’d like but he’s still clearly an additive player and has the length to bother opponents on the other end even if he isn’t the best defender in the world.\n\nF- David Mirkovic, Fr, 6’9, 250: 12.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 2.6 apg, 47.4% FG, 37.5% 3pt, 80.6% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (72nd nationally)\n\nMirkovic was an offseason Euro import from Montenegro and has been a really nice addition for Illinois. His assist rate is really high for your average power forward and he’s both a very good rebounder and three-point shooter. His block rate is about what you’d expect for your average 6’4 shooting guard so he offers no rim protection but is big enough to still both Hannes Steinbach in that matchup.\n\nC- Tomislav Ivisic, Jr. 7’1, 255: 10.2 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 0.6 bpg, 49.2% FG, 36.8% 3pt, 70.4% FT\n\nEvanmiya.com Stats: +7.0 BPR (70th nationally)\n\nThe key to the Illinois offense is the Croatian brother duo of Tomislav and Zvonimir Ivisic who combine to play nearly 100% of the center minutes for Illinois. Tomislav starts has been better on the offensive end while Zvonimir is 2nd in the country in block rate as the rim protector. Both are shooting at least 67% on 2-pointers and almost exactly 36% on 3-pointers which makes them wildly efficient.\n\nIt’s safe to say that the all-Balkan roster makeover has worked out pretty well for Illinois and head coach Brad Underwood. There were thoughts in the offseason that Illinois would end up with 5 of their top 6 players who have a last name ending in “ic”: Mihailo Petrovic, Andrej Stojakovic, David Mirkovic, Tomislav Ivisic, and Zvonimir Ivisic. The only player not of that background was projected to be Kylan Boswell (Stojakovic was born in the US but is the son of former Serbian NBA star Peja Stojakovic so you can’t so the only American).\n\nAlmost every aspect of that remodel has worked except for Petrovic. He hasn’t been close to a starting caliber point guard and has fallen out of the rotation thanks to a ton of turnovers and poor shooting. That might have doomed many teams to underachieve. Except enter Keaton Wagler.\n\nNo one could’ve predicted that a three-star freshman would not only start for Illinois at point guard but legitimately enter the All-American conversation and become a top-ten NBA draft pick. That just doesn’t happen. Wagler is the engine behind an offense that is not just #1 in the country per KenPom but the best in KenPom’s database which goes back to 1997. That will likely drop off a bit at some point but the Illini are an absolute machine.\n\nIt looked like Illinois might only be so-so after they dropped to 8-3 following a home loss to Nebraska. That loss obviously looks better in hindsight and Illinois has won 9 straight since then. They’re now 3-3 against top-20 KenPom teams and 14-0 against everyone else. Not exactly encouraging for Washington.\n\nAs mentioned above, the success revolves around the Illinois offense. They take over half of their shots from beyond the 3-point arc and play five legitimate shooting threats at almost all times. Illinois will absolutely bomb it from deep and shoot 36% as a team from that range. They’ve made at least 10 three-point shots in 11 of their last 12 games. That’s compared to Washington who have hit that mark just 3 times all season (although they notably did it in their last game against Oregon). The math says it’s really hard to out-shoot them.\n\nEven when Illinois does miss a shot, they get it back almost half the time. Illinois is 4th nationally in offensive rebounding rate thanks to being the tallest team in the country with a rotation made entirely of players 6’6 or taller that aggressively crash the glass. That usually leads to kick outs and more three-point attempts rather than easy putbacks but they do shoot 58.4% (25th nationally) on two-point shots when they do decide to shoot it from close range. Oh, and if you foul them then they make nearly 80% of their free throws which ranks 4th nationally.\n\nSo they take and make a lot of three-pointers. And when they miss they get it back at an elite rate. And when they take close shots or get fouled they make them at an elite rate. Maybe we can force turnovers against them? Nope. They also rank 34th in turnover percentage. The math says Illinois has a sizable advantage from every area on offense and that’s why they have the best offense in the country.\n\nThere are some weaknesses to exploit on defense relatively but not that many. Illinois being the tallest team in the country does mean that it’s really hard to be outright bad on defense. They can at least contest shots with their length at every position even if they don’t have the best athletes. The rebounding and blocked shot numbers are very good because of that.\n\nWhere Illinois has their biggest issue is their depth. With Boswell’s injury and Petrovic not living up to expectations it means this is basically a 7-man roster right now. The Ivisic brothers combine to take up essentially all 40 minutes at center and then only 6’9 Ben Humrichous is truly available to soak up minutes at the 3/4 with the guards otherwise playing just about the whole game. So that means just get Illinois in foul trouble, right?\n\nEasier said then done. Illinois knows they’ve got issues with depth and so they just don’t foul. They rank 1st in the country in opponent free throw rate. That’s not a great sign for Washington. The Huskies are 2-7 this year when they have a free throw rate on offense below 30%. Illinois gives up 19% on average. Washington absolutely needs a friendly whistle to have any shot at pulling an upset but it doesn’t seem likely.\n\nThe flip side of Illinois’ aversion to fouling is that they also don’t force turnovers. They’re dead last in opponent turnover rate and 2nd to last in steal rate on defense. If Washington is going to win this game then they need that trend to continue with 5 or fewer turnovers. The Huskies have to find ways to make up possessions knowing what a juggernaut Illinois is on offense and one of the only clear ways to do that is to keep from turning it over when UW has the ball. And oh yeah, they’re going to have shoot like they did against Oregon making close to 50% of their three-pointers.\n\nEarlier this week I looked into how brutal Washington’s schedule has been recently. The 7-game stretch culminating in this game is the 4th toughest for any team this season and they recently wrapped a 5-game stretch that was the toughest of any team in the entire country. Illinois is scorching hot. Washington got a feel good win this weekend to hopefully build some momentum but no one has gotten within 5 points of Illinois since December 13th. Things are set to turn around soon with the schedule lightening up but the best UW can hope for in this one is a late surge helping them cover the spread like they’ve done a few times recently. I’m not counting on it though\n\nWashington Huskies– 68, Illinois Fighting Illini- 85\n\nSeason picks: 14-6 straight up, 10-10 against the spread",

    "title": "Rosenior explains tactical approach, praises ‘collective mentality’ in Chelsea’s comeback win against Napoli",
    "description": "Post-match reaction from the boss",
    "fullText": "Since coming in, Liam Rosenior made it a point to not try to change too many things tactically from what Enzo Maresca had been doing with Chelsea. The new head coach spoke in reverence of Maresca’s setup, which aligned with the BlueCo principles that Rosenior himself had been aligning to at RC Strasbourg.\n\nAnd seeing as how Chelsea have had a game every three days or so for as long as we can remember, it’s not like Rosenior really got a chance to really work on anything too drastically different. So the new man in charge had been focusing on the mental and motivation aspects of the job, showing fresh, brash confidence and preaching ambition and winning mentality — things we sure love to hear!\n\nLast night, Rosenior tried something a bit different.\n\n“I wanted to go man-for-man all over the pitch. We knew we needed to win the game. I wanted to be really aggressive and Napoli were very clever after 20-25 minutes. I felt we won the ball back very high in good areas in the first 20 minutes. When they started to miss our press out and went a little bit more direct, the distances were a little bit bigger. We corrected that. We were still man-to-man in the second half but we started a bit deeper with our press and I think that helped our compactness.”\n\nChelsea, set up in a most awkward three-man defense, were perhaps lucky to be behind only 2-1 at the half, with Napoli repeatedly slicing open the team — not sending anyone to hospital unlike their ultras the night before, but certainly sending Rosenior scrambling for a rethink at the break.\n\nTo his credit, the young head coach made the necessary adjustments. Chelsea were much improved in the second half, and though both of our two goals needed individual brilliance from João Pedro (certainly his first, our second), by controlling the game instead of constantly scrambling for our lives, we were able to provide the platform for our center forward to shine.\n\n“I’m so proud of [the players], even in the first half, I’m asking them to press in a completely different way that they’ve never done before and hardly had any practice at. So that time over the next few weeks will help us get better and improve, but we still need to win games in this moment.”\n\n“[There were] so many pleasing individual performances but I think the most pleasing aspect was the collective mentality of the group to have a positive reaction to a difficult first half.”\n\n-Liam Rosenior; \n\nRosenior got it wrong at the start — right intention to go for the win, but wrong approach — but he got everything right after that. His in-game adjustments and substitutions helped us win the game. We’re still just getting to know him, but it’s great to see that he can evaluate his own choices correctly. Not every coach can, certainly not in real-time.\n\nThis was a big win, an important win, but just one win. Next up: another important win-opportunity as West Ham come to town Saturday evening.",

    "fullText": "Despite obvious midfield gaps, Manchester United chose to focus on strengthening their attack last summer.\n\nIn came Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko for big money, and as a result, Joshua Zirkzee’s minutes decreased dramatically.\n\nIt was not until gameweek 12 that the Dutchman finally earned a Premier League start, but since the second week of December, the 24-year-old has not made the starting XI even once.\n\nWith the World Cup coming up at the end of the season, the former Bologna ace was keen to make the cut and the only way for that to happen was by playing regularly at club level.\n\nHowever, with his chances expected to remain limited under Ruben Amorim, the Netherlands international was eyeing a return to Italy, with AS Roma interested.\n\nHowever, the Portuguese tactician’s departure and Michael Carrick’s subsequent arrival meant United blocked his exit.\n\nAn injury, however, has meant he is yet to earn any minutes under the caretaker head coach, and he remains keen to leave Old Trafford.\n\nThere is interest from within the Premier League, but Serie A football appeals more to the former Bayern Munich ace and Juventus were reportedly interested.\n\nHowever, as per Tuttosport, the Red Devils will not allow their No.11 to jump ship midway through the season.\n\nInterestingly, Bianconeri boss Luciano Spalletti is also not a big fan of the versatile ace and is eyeing a different profile for Juve’s attack.\n\n“He will most likely remain in England, where Zirkzee doesn’t appear to be leaving for now: Manchester United has put a freeze on transfers, and not even Juventus’ interest has changed matters.\n\n“Regardless, he wouldn’t have met Spalletti’s requirements, who is looking for strength, hunger, and, even more so, physical qualities that can help him in specific moments of the match.”\n\nAny addition to the attack will depend on the future of Joshua Zirkzee. Should he depart permanently, only then will United pursue an alternative in the January market.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "After the shorthanded edition of the Golden State Warriors stumbled in a blowout loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday, Steve Kerr's rotation welcomed some much-needed reinforcements on Wednesday in the final leg of their four-game road swing. Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Al Horford and De'Anthony Melton all returned to the lineup on Wednesday night against the Utah Jazz.\n\nWith Curry back in the lineup, the Warriors returned to their winning ways on Wednesday night in Utah. Behind a high-powered offensive performance, the Warriors rolled to a 140-124 win over the Jazz to end their four-game road trip.\n\nEight members of the Warriors tallied double-figures on Wednesday with Curry leading the way. Curry tallied a game-high 27 points on 7-of-14 shooting from the field with four made 3-pointers to go along with two assists and two steals in 28 minutes.\n\nMoses Moody continued his strong stretch of play with 26 points on 9-of-15 shooting from the field. Moody drilled a game-high five 3-pointers in 26 minutes against the Jazz. Moody has now tallied 10 or more points in nine straight games for the Warriors. Over that nine-game span, Moody is averaging 15.2 points per contest.\n\nThe Warriors buried 23 3-pointers on Wednesday, with seven members of the Warriors tallying two or more made triples. Both Buddy Hield and rookie Will Richard drilled three 3-pointers off the bench against the Jazz.\n\nLed by 16 points from Gui Santos, the Warriors' bench scored 67 of Golden State's 140 points on Wednesday night in Salt Lake.\n\nGolden State's 140 points is a new season high in total points scored in a game this season. The Warriors have previously tallied 137 points twice this season.\n\nThe Warriors now end their road swing with a 2-2 record over four games. The Warriors will now return to the Bay Area for a tough two-game slate against a pair of Eastern Conference contenders, the Detroit Pistons and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThe Warriors will host the Eastern Conference-leading Pistons on Friday night at Chase Center with tipoff set for 7 p.m. PT.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Sharp-shooting Warriors explode on offense in 140-124 win over Jazz",

    "fullText": "Thursday’s NBA slate is packed with storylines and pressure games. A few teams are trying to snap losing streaks, while others want to protect their home courts. Big names like Tyrese Maxey, Cade Cunningham, Kevin Durant, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are set to take center stage. The games on January 29 are not just about wins and losses. They also show where each team truly stands as the season moves forward. Here is a closer look at every game. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nSacramento comes in on a six-game losing streak and has struggled badly on the road with a 3-20 record. Philadelphia has been average at home, but their rebounding edge stands out. The 76ers pull down 12.3 offensive rebounds per game, led by Andre Drummond at 3.5. Tyrese Maxey is carrying the offense with 29.2 points per game and strong playmaking. Joel Embiid has also been steady over the last 10 games with over 20 points per night. Sacramento gives up 120.8 points per game, which lines up poorly against a team that scores more than 116 per outing. DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook can score, but the Kings allow too many open looks. Philadelphia already controls the glass and should create second chances. That gap makes the home team the safer pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Sacramento Kings\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Capital One Arena, Washington\n\nMilwaukee has dropped three straight games and is only 3-7 in its last ten. Washington is not much better, but they recently beat Milwaukee 114-113 on January 1. Alex Sarr leads the Wizards with 17.7 points and 7.5 rebounds, giving them size inside. The Bucks allow 14.1 made threes per game, while Washington averages nearly 13 from deep. That matchup favors the home team. Ryan Rollins and AJ Green have been productive for Milwaukee, but the team still gives up over 115 points per game in recent outings. Wizards games tend to stay close, and they are 2-2 in games decided by three points or fewer. Another tight finish is likely, and Washington has already shown it can win this game.\n\nPredicted winner: Washington Wizards\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nBrooklyn is on a six-game slide and is 6-16 on the road. Turnovers are a big issue, with 14.6 per game. Denver plays better at home and moves the ball well, ranking near the top in assists. Jamal Murray averages 25.9 points and 7.4 assists, while the Nuggets hit nearly 14 threes per game. Brooklyn did win the first meeting this season, but that came at home. Denver has gone 6-4 over the last ten and keeps opponents around 108 points. The Nets allow over 117 points per game in that same span. Porter and Claxton provide effort, yet the defense breaks down too often. Denver’s balanced attack and home court give them the edge.\n\nPredicted winner: Brooklyn Nets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Footprint Center, Phoenix\n\nDetroit owns the best record in the East at 34-11 and has won four straight road games. The Pistons also rank near the top in defense, allowing only 110 points per game. Phoenix is strong at home but is missing key players like Devin Booker and Jalen Green. Cade Cunningham leads Detroit with 25.3 points and nearly 10 assists per game. Phoenix relies heavily on Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen for scoring. The Suns score 114 per game, but Detroit scores more and defends better. Detroit also won the first meeting 108-105. With Phoenix short-handed, the Pistons have the advantage in depth and form.\n\nPredicted winner: Detroit Pistons\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: State Farm Arena, Atlanta\n\nHouston is 28-16 and plays strong defense, ranking fourth in points allowed at 110.5. Atlanta scores well but struggles to stop teams, giving up nearly 119 per game. Kevin Durant just dropped 33 points in Houston’s last win and continues to be the focal point. The Rockets also rebound well, pulling in 49 per game. Atlanta moves the ball better than anyone, averaging over 31 assists per game, led by CJ McCollum’s recent form. Even so, the Hawks give up too many open shots and free throws. Houston’s mix of scoring and defense should control the pace. That balance makes them the better pick.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nChicago is coming off a loss to the Lakers but remains competitive at home. Miami beat Phoenix in its last game and has momentum. The Heat crushed Chicago earlier this season 143-107, though the Bulls dominated the matchup last year. Coby White and Ayo Dosunmu lead Chicago’s scoring. Bam Adebayo anchors Miami inside. Both teams sit around .500, which suggests a close game. Chicago usually plays tougher defense at home and will want payback for the earlier blowout. Miami has been steady, but the Bulls have won more often in this building. A narrow home win looks likely.\n\nPredicted winner: Chicago Bulls\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center, Dallas\n\nCharlotte just beat Philadelphia 130-93 with strong shooting and ball movement. Brandon Miller scored 30 points on 81.8% shooting. The Hornets average 116.3 points and hit 37% from three. Dallas lost to the Lakers and allowed 57 rebounds, which shows weakness on the glass. Max Christie has been productive, but Dallas still gives up 116.5 points per game. Charlotte’s passing and rebounding edge should matter. The Hornets also force turnovers and play faster. Dallas has struggled to defend consistently, which puts them at risk against a hot Charlotte offense.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 29, 2026\n\nVenue: Target Center, Minnesota\n\nOklahoma City leads the league in scoring at 120.8 points per game and allows just 107.9. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to shine, coming off a 24-point game on 72.7% shooting. Minnesota is solid offensively at 119 per game but allows 114.3. Julius Randle had 18 points in his last outing, though the Timberwolves rely on forcing turnovers to stay competitive. The Thunder rank first in points allowed and create pressure on defense. That combination usually travels well. Minnesota is strong at home, but Oklahoma City’s efficiency and defense give them the edge.\n\nPredicted winner: Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nJanuary 29 brings a mix of uneven matchups and tight contests. Some teams hold clear edges because of defense, home court, or recent form. Others are expected to grind out close wins based on past results and key player performances. These games will shape momentum for the next stretch of the season. This schedule offers plenty of reasons to stay tuned from the first tip-off to the final buzzer.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 29: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

I don't know if it's my last game here or not.\n\n\"Lot of memories here. Lot of history. Just super grateful and thankful for the time. Looking up in the rafters and seeing our championship banner, of course there was a lot of reflecting.\"\n\nJames said he doesn't see this season as his NBA farewell tour.\n\n\"I've never even thought to the point of a farewell tour or whatever the case may be because I haven't had that conversation with myself and my family on when is it over,\" he said.\n\nDonovan Mitchell, whose 25 points led Cleveland, understood that even with the Cavaliers (29-20) win streak at five games, this night belonged to James and his legacy of making Cleveland a champion after 52 years of failure in major US sports leagues.\n\n\"He has laid the foundation,\" Mitchell said. \"He has done a lot for the city being from here. We want to replicate that.\n\n\"He deserves the energy he has got here. First time they have done it in 50-some years. We're trying to do it differently. At the end of the day, we're trying to find ways to go out there and bring the city another championship.\"\n\nLuka Doncic had a game-high 29 points for the Lakers (28-18), who also had eight points from Bronny James, LeBron's son.\n\n\"It was pretty cool just sitting over there and watching him,\" James said. \"My mom was here watching her son and her grandson. I don't even know how to wrap that all in my brain. It's so weird and so cool and so surreal.\"\n\nJames, who fell to 9-4 as a visiting player in Cleveland, had averaged 28 points a game in 24 prior contests against the Cavs, who outscored the Lakers 42-22 in the third quarter for a 99-77 lead, hitting 7-of-11 shots from three-point range and 17-of-25 overall in the period.\n\n\"We got outplayed. I got outcoached,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \"We just didn't look like we had all our juice.\"\n\nThe Cavs were without reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley due to a left calf strain.\n\nIn other games, Victor Wembanyama had game highs of 28 points, 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to spark San Antonio's 111-99 triumph at Houston.\n\nPaolo Banchero delivered 31 points for Orlando in a 133-124 victory at Miami while New York's Mikal Bridges scored 30 in a 119-92 victory at Toronto and Julius Randle scored 31 in Minnesota's 118-105 victory at Dallas.\n\nStephen Curry scored 27 points to lead Golden State's 140-124 victory at Utah.",

Michelle Karvinen cut the deficit to 3–1 at 12:35, finishing a whip pass across the crease from Sarah Nurse, but the Goldeneyes were unable to generate further offense despite extended zone time.\n\nCurl-Salemme scored her second of the game into an empty net at 19:26.\n\nTaylor Heise recorded an assist on the play, giving her 52 career PWHL points and placing her among the league’s seven players to reach the 50-point mark.

Minnesota finished 1-for-2 on the power play, while Vancouver went 0-for-2.\n\nWith the win, Minnesota continues to lead the league in goals-for and goal differential, reinforcing their status as the PWHL’s most consistent offensive team. Vancouver, meanwhile, showed signs of being able to be competitive against one of the league’s top teams despite the result.",

With the Raiders holding several second in-person interviews with various head coach candidates, the one who seems most likely to get the job was conspicuously missing from those reports. Not anymore.\n\nSeahawks OC Klint Kubiak is expected to meet with the Raiders this weekend.\n\nBoth LV & Arizona have the opportunity to meet w/ Klint Kubiak again before the SB. \n\nThat timing is typically mutually agreed upon by team, candidate, and in this case -- the Seahawks. The expectation is that both LV and Arizona will take that opportunity to do so this weekend.\n\n— Peter Schrager (@PSchrags) January 29, 2026\n\nRight now the Seahawks are preparing to face the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl next Sunday. It appears there will be a small window this weekend for Kubiak to fly out to Las Vegas and Arizona to meet with those teams. At which point each side will decide if it's a good fit.\n\nWhat figures to happen after that is one team will hire a different head coach and the other will wait until after the Super Bowl to name Kubiak their next head coach. So, you can figure we should all have a pretty good idea, probably by Monday at the latest, who the Raiders next head coach is.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Raiders Wire: Raiders to hold head coach interview with Klint Kubiak in coming days",

    "fullText": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — In a move that might not have shocked the diehards but definitely excited the fanbase, the Los Angeles Chargers have made it official: Chris O’Leary is their new defensive coordinator. After announcing the hiring of their new offensive coordinator just one day earlier, the Chargers have now addressed the other side of the ball, turning to a familiar face to lead the defense in 2026.\n\nSources: Chargers are hiring Western Michigan defensive coordinator Chris O'Leary as their defensive coordinator. O’Leary returns to the Chargers, where he worked as safeties coach under Jesse Minter in 2024. Prior to the Chargers, O’Leary coached the secondary at Notre Dame… pic.twitter.com/643ARpuk10\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 29, 2026\n\nO’Leary, 34, returns to the Chargers after spending the 2024 season as the safeties coach with the Bolts. O’Leary’s impact was immediately felt in the form of Derwin James Jr., the All-Pro safety who continued his trajectory toward greatness. Under O’Leary’s guidance, James earned his fourth Pro Bowl selection in 2024, adding to his already impressive resume. O’Leary helped elevate James’ game, refining his coverage skills, his leadership in the back end, and his overall impact on the field.\n\nIn his lone year with Western Michigan as their defensive coordinator in 2025, O’Leary orchestrated a unit that ranked ninth in the nation in scoring defense, allowing just 17.4 points per game.\n\nThat’s a significant accomplishment for a program outside the power conferences and a testament to O'Leary’s ability to scheme up effective, disruptive defenses. Now, he’s tasked with bringing that same energy to Los Angeles as the Chargers’ defensive leader.\n\nFrom his six years at Notre Dame, where he worked in various roles including defensive analyst, O’Leary has developed a reputation as a coach who knows how to maximize talent at all levels.\n\nHis time coaching the secondary at Notre Dame helped solidify one of the most respected units in college football, and he showed a remarkable ability to adapt his coaching style to the talent at hand. That flexibility could be crucial for the Chargers, who will likely be looking to blend their current talent with new acquisitions in the coming seasons.\n\nThe Chargers’ decision to hire O'Leary is a clear signal that they are serious about developing a defense that can complement their high-powered offense.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea striker Joao Pedro has been asked what the difference is between former boss Enzo Maresca and Liam Rosenior.\n\nThe interview came after Pedro played a Man of the Match performance to help Chelsea beat Napoli in the Champions League last night, with the attacker scoring two very important goals.\n\nChelsea got a bit lucky in places after a poor first half performance, but they were much improved in the second half and got the job done.\n\nIt needed some real individual quality and class finishing from Joao Pedro though, but his first goal was of a world class calibre without a doubt. His second goal wasn’t too shabby either and was a fine finish to put Chelsea 3-2 up and going on to win the game.\n\nA depleted Napoli side fought hard, but Chelsea in the end just showed their edge with some individual quality and more control over the game in the second half.\n\nLiam Rosenior was heavily criticised for his strange setup in the first half, using a back three and playing only one natural centre back. But Pedro has been complimenting his head coach after the game.\n\nJoao Pedro celebrates with Chelsea players. (Photo by Francesco Pecoraro/Getty Images)\n\nPedro spoke to TNT Sports on the difference between Liam Rosenior and Enzo Maresca:\n\n“I think Liam is more electric. He wants us to play more with intensity and compact.”\n\n“Enzo is more like with the ball; he’s very good as well, but that’s the difference.”\n\nI’ve not really seen these differences yet, but I’m sure it will come in time. After all, that was only Rosenior’s fifth game in charge of Chelsea last night, so we will hopefully see that come to fruition soon enough.",

    "fullText": "Bo Nix calls out Sean Payton for sharing his medical history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDenver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix wasn’t happy with his head coach, Sean Payton, after Payton publicly discussed Nix’s medical history.\n\nNix suffered a fractured ankle during Denver’s victory over the Buffalo Bills in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs last weekend, and Payton told media members that Nix was predisposed to the injury, and that it was going to happen eventually one way or another.\n\n“What was found was a condition that was predisposed — they always find a little more when they go in,” Payton replied when asked if there was any concern that Nix has had multiple ankle surgeries in his career. “It wasn’t a matter of if, it was a matter of when. When you look at the play and you’re trying to evaluate it — the doctor, the operating surgeon said that this was going to happen sooner than later.”\n\nIn his first public comments since the injury, Nix refuted his coach’s claim that the injury was unavoidable.\n\n\"[But] nothing predisposed, nothing that was there originally,\" Nix said of the injury. \"That might have gotten confused. Just a simple step with my foot up in the air, my body weight came down on it, sort of got twisted up. ... It could have been a worse landing, but I think all that force went into the only place it could.\"\n\nMore: Broncos' Bo Nix breaks silence on season-ending ankle injury\n\nNix then questioned his coach for publicly dislocating his surgical history.\n\n\"I don't think he really should share how many surgeries I've had in the past, to be honest with you -- he doesn't even really know that,” Nix said. “But it's going to be good to get back, get back to work. ... Nothing really that concerns me, nothing that scares me moving forward.\"\n\nClearly, Nix was annoyed, or bothered, by his coach’s comments, and the fact that they came publicly, otherwise he wouldn’t have addressed them in the manner that he did.\n\nUltimately, this is probably something that will blow over and be long forgotten by the time that training camp rolls around. However, there’s also a non-zero chance that it could start to sow the seeds of distrust between Nix and Payton and ultimately contribute to the deterioration of their relationship.\n\nWhich will it be? Only time will tell. Obviously, Broncos fans are hoping that it turns out to be the former.\n\nJ.K.

    "description": "Dennis Cirkin’s put up a brilliant fight for his Sunderland shirt — seeing off some of his competition in the process. Could he kick on even further?",
    "fullText": "I have to admit that when Sunderland signed two experienced international left-backs in the summer, I thought it would be curtains (sorry, not a pun, despite his hairstyle) for Dennis Cirkin.\n\nHe’s a player I’ve really fallen in love with over the years and I’ve really enjoyed watching his journey from being a League One rookie to a Premier League starter, but given his problems with his injured wrist — particularly over the summer and at the start of the season — it felt like it would only be a matter of time before he moved along.\n\nThere wasn’t just that, though, because there is of course still the elephant in the room that is his contract situation. Like Dan Neil — who has now of course moved on elsewhere — Cirkin’s current deal expires over the summer, or so we are led to believe, so it felt as though the club may choose to move him along, perhaps in January.\n\nThankfully, I’m glad that I can say that hasn’t been the case. Instead, whilst Masuaku and Reinildo were off playing for their countries at the AFCON tournament, Dennis put a string of solid performances in and showed that he really belongs at this level. He hasn’t looked out of place and has just kicked on once again, which of course I’m totally delighted by.\n\nLet’s not forget that this is a lad who was incredibly highly rated by José Mourinho at Spurs, and over the summer was called into the England U21s squad for the European Championships. Yes, he may have arrived at Sunderland as a young boy lacking in experience, but he’s always had the ability that could see him playing at a much higher level, and if anything, the question marks have been surrounding his fitness.\n\nSo really, nobody should be surprised that he’s played well in the team. What is perhaps more surprising is that his form, coupled with the great season we’ve had out of Reinildo so far (barring a small handful of hiccups), has led to the departure of the other left-back that we signed in the summer — Arthur Masuaku.\n\nMasuaku will have had many good offers in the summer to go elsewhere, but something must have been sold to him in order for him to head to Sunderland instead. He would have been under no illusions over the competition in the squad, but clearly he felt he could come back to the Premier League and thrive. His chance actually came pretty early on into the season — after a fine showing as a centre-half in our League Cup defeat to Huddersfield, a red card for Reinildo against Aston Villa copped him a three-game ban, and that was Arthur’s chance to shine and stake a claim for a regular starting berth. Instead, he did anything but, and that little three-game run in the side was obviously enough to make the club realise that he probably wasn’t up to the standards required. He’s had injuries and, of course, the AFCON tournament kept him out of contention, but he was nowhere near.\n\nRetour vers le ̶f̶u̶t̶u̶r̶ ̶ Racing 🔙 pic.twitter.com/TJOmAebSIm\n\n— Racing Club de Lens (@RCLens) January 27, 2026\n\nAll of that coupled with the great run that Cirkin had in the side over the festive period and into January must have made up the minds of the Sunderland bigwigs — the young, energetic upstart is seen as the strongest contender for Reinildo’s shirt, and given he’s fully aware of the demands of playing under Régis Le Bris, sticking by him makes the most sense.\n\nOn Saturday at West Ham, Reinildo had a shocker. He should have been sent off just before half-time and you have to think that the referee did him and us a favour, probably out of pity as we were already getting dusted three-nil. If a young player had made that tackle which should have seen him bag a second yellow we’d have been calling them naïve and inexperienced, so it was disappointing to see such bad decision-making from a lad who has seen and done it all in the game. He was, understandably, hooked at the break, and I thought we actually looked much better with Cirkin in the left-back spot. He once again reminded everyone watching that he’s not here to make up the numbers, and he wants to be starting games for Sunderland in the Premier League.\n\nWith Masuaku out of the picture, he’s gained that trust from his manager. Now it’s up to him to really push Reinildo day after day in training, and then, who knows? We could be talking about Cirkin edging himself ahead of one of our best players, which would have seemed unthinkable earlier in the season. At worst, he’s going to help to get the very best out of Reinildo, as having strong competition all over the pitch is vital.\n\nHaway Dennis, lad — get that new contract signed, and knuckle down. The future is bright!",

    "description": "Sunderland suffered defeat to West Ham at the weekend, but where did it go wrong for Le Bris?",
    "fullText": "Following on from their victory against Crystal Palace, Sunderland returned to the capital for the third away game in a row to face a West Ham side renewed with confidence following a last-minute winner from Callum Wilson the week prior.\n\nWith Granit Xhaka a confirmed fitness doubt for at least the next fortnight, for the first time this season Sunderland had to adjust to life without their captain and it’s safe to say things didn’t go to plan. How did Le Bris try to provide a more expansive setup away from home and how did it all go wrong at the London Stadium?\n\nWith rumours surfacing late on Friday evening that Xhaka had picked up a knock during last week’s game against Palace, suspicions were confirmed at 11:15am when it was revealed our Swiss captain had suffered some ankle damage and will be out for an extended period of rehab.\n\nIn the absence of Xhaka, Le Bris decided to go bold in his team selection and picked Eliezer Mayenda to come in as his replacement for this one. Opting for a more aggressive team selection and shape, Le Bris decided to utilise a 4-4-2 system similar to his spell in early 2025 with Sunderland in the Championship.\n\nIn Xhaka’s absence, the midfield three became a two as Noah Sadiki and Enzo Le Fée looked to control the middle whilst Trai Hume resumed his hybrid role in the right of midfield/right-back/central midfield depending on where he was needed most. Mayenda partnered Brian Brobbey up front and formed a far more attacking line-up than we’re used to witnessing away from home — a bold move by Le Bris.\n\nNuno Espírito Santo was at the helm this time around as Sunderland faced their second West Ham manager of the season, looking to make themselves the only side in the league to go three wins on the bounce following a last-minute Callum Wilson winner the week prior.\n\nNuno kept the same side with his newly formed January strike force of Pablo and Castellanos following their moves earlier in the window whilst Jared Bowen and Crysencio Summerville manned the wings for the Londoners.\n\nSticking with a traditional 4-2-3-1 shape, Nuno looks to be compact off the ball and utilises the direct running of his wingers paired with the physical presence of his forwards to hit teams on the counter whilst looking to avoid leaving gaps to be played through. Having conceded 44 league goals prior to this one, West Ham have had a notoriously leaky defence this season which has been somewhat helped by Nuno; however, their Achilles heel remains their ability to ship goals at home.\n\nGiven Nuno’s style and approach mentioned above, Sunderland were handed an unusual amount of possession from the opening whistle and looked to assert themselves early. Noah Sadiki stung the gloves of Areola in the opening minutes with a half-volley; however, after that, Sunderland looked rather directionless without their talisman in midfield.\n\nWith a plethora of early misplaced passes, Sunderland found themselves exposed on the counter-attack numerous times in the opening half-hour and looked to be at the mercy of both the West Ham wingers every time they broke with the ball. Due to the shape of the opposition, both Sunderland full-backs were edging forward paired with an additional midfielder in Le Fée, leaving Sunderland effectively 3 v 3 on the break during concerted possession.\n\nWith West Ham demanding that Sunderland took the game to them, Le Bris was forced into adopting a 3-5-2 shape in possession leaving effectively both central defenders and Sadiki the only men behind the ball during build-up. Pair this with the lack of Xhaka to help dictate the play, especially with the midfielder averaging over 45 passes per game whilst completing the most line-breaking passes of any of the Sunderland team this season.\n\nSummerville was able to open the scoring for the hosts with an emphatic header following a Jared Bowen breakaway which made a fool of Reinildo on the day. Both full-backs wouldn’t cover themselves in glory as initially Reinildo couldn’t handle the trickery of Bowen having been so reliable for us this season, whilst on the other side Nordi Mukiele — despite his towering size — allowed Summerville to run on his blindside and get the jump on the full-back.\n\nBefore the half-hour the game was all but over as a series of probing runs from Summerville resulted in Hume dangling a leg for just a second too long allowing Bowen to return the favour and slot home to see both wingers having scored and assisted for one another. Sunderland were unable to contain the barrage and couldn’t sustain an attack for long before Mateus Fernandes crushed the ball beyond Roefs and wrapped up the most disastrous half of football so far this season for the lads.\n\nWhilst Sunderland made somewhat of an improvement in the second half, ultimately the game state meant that irrespective of performance, West Ham were far more passive in possession knowing the game was essentially a formality as the minutes ticked down. The real question here though is: was the poor showing down to personnel or tactics?\n\nWhilst losing Xhaka is understandably a big blow due to his raw ability on the football pitch, arguably his biggest loss came in the form of his intangibles. As we saw when Dan Neil moved from his anchoring role in seasons past, without Xhaka orchestrating the game flow from in front of his defence, other players were required to force the ball through the lines and resulted in Hume having an uncomfortable afternoon in possession. With only 15/19 completed passes in the first half and a 0% duel success rate he was unfortunately hooked to change the shape of the side and perform some damage limitation.\n\nSunderland’s shape caused arguably more issues than the lack of our talisman captain and in some ways, I can’t fault Le Bris for attempting something more expansive. Prior to the weekend, Sunderland had only scored two away goals since December and fans were calling for a more aggressive and expansive approach to playing away from home.\n\nWith West Ham susceptible to conceding, it felt like a logical choice to experiment with and potentially alter Sunderland’s dismal attacking output. In reality however, Sunderland produced their second lowest first-half xG of the season away from home with only their game against Manchester City at the Etihad producing less. With only one shot on target and four attempts in total, the shape saw Mayenda often confused on where to position himself around Brobbey and a gaping hole between the midfield and attacking lines in build-up.\n\nWith Hume inverting on the right and Mundle unable to get any change out of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, having only 17 touches, no take-ons/dribbles and 4 dispossessions in the first half, things made for ugly viewing. Sunderland were forcing attacks through the middle and drilled balls into both Brian Brobbey and Mayenda didn’t stick or were wide of the mark on several occasions.\n\nWhilst it’s a harsh learning curve for Le Bris having tried to catch the opposition unaware of his change in shape like he did away to Burnley and Sheffield United last season, the Premier League is a different beast. I assume we’ll see Le Bris revert to type against Burnley and utilise his regular system now Diarra looks fully fit.\n\nWhilst it really was the epitome of a bad day at the office for Sunderland, positive signs can be taken from the second-half substitutes as the likes of Habib Diarra and Chemsdine Talbi returned to the fold whilst Dennis Cirkin and Luke O’Nien both put in respectable shifts in the second half.\n\nWhilst Diarra will gain the plaudits for his marauding run that resulted in the assist, Chemsdine Talbi displayed his typical tidiness and ball retention with a 100% pass accuracy and a perfectly delivered cross for Wilson Isidor to rocket over the bar. With both players likely to start against Burnley we’re expecting to see a much more composed attacking display.\n\nThinking About the Bigger Picture\n\nNow that the dust has settled, it’s easy to see why and how things went wrong against West Ham; however, we’ve got to remember where we are and how little Sunderland have suffered a heavy defeat this season. Sat on 33 points at this point in the season still remains beyond expectations and with an opportunity to all but confirm safety against Burnley, we’ve got to view the bigger picture.\n\nRégis Le Bris has done a fantastic job at eking out the most he can from an attacking standpoint whilst remaining as defensively solid as Sunderland have this season so he’s earned more than enough trust from the Sunderland faithful. Let’s write this one off and with a week to recover, go again on Monday night.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest host Ferencváros at the City Ground this Thursday while they aim to secure a vital victory to climb the table.\n\nThe Tricky Trees have already moved into the knockout round play-offs following a successful campaign. Manager Sean Dyche will be desperate for a win to keep their automatic qualification hopes alive. Forest currently boast a perfect home record in this competition under Dyche. A victory tonight would mark the first time they have won three consecutive home games in a single major European campaign since 1979.\n\nSean Dyche manages a squad currently hit by a significant suspension to his star midfielder. Notably, Elliot Anderson is unavailable following his red card in the recent defeat to Braga. Chris Wood and John Victor also remain on the treatment table with knee injuries. Consequently, the manager is expected to name a strong lineup to reclaim momentum after their weekend Premier League victory.\n\nMatz Sels will start in goal behind a defensive partnership of Nikola Milenkovic and Morato. In midfield, Ryan Yates is expected to link up with Ibrahim Sangaré to provide defensive stability. Morgan Gibbs-White will operate in the number 10 role to support the attack. Igor Jesus, who scored in Sunday’s win at Brentford, is expected to lead the line once again. Callum Hudson-Odoi is also pushing for a start out wide.\n\nNottingham Forest predicted XI: Sels; Savona, Milenkovic, Morato, Williams; Yates, Sangare; Ndoye, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi; Jesus\n\nThe Europa League league-phase fixture takes place at the City Ground on Thursday, 29 January 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on TNT Sports via the discovery+ app. Coverage begins before the kick-off on both the website and the mobile app.\n\nRead more- Remembering Chelsea’s iconic Champions League comeback against Napoli\n\nSee Also- Wolves submit loan bid for England midfielder Gomes\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Grassroots sports groups across the West Midlands have welcomed government funding to help improve their facilities.\n\nLast year, 991 projects across the UK received money through the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme to improve things like floodlights, goalposts and all-weather pitches.\n\nA new round of funding has now opened and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has invited community organisations to apply for a share of an £85m grant.\n\nFor football groups in Herefordshire and Warwickshire, the funds they were previously awarded had a massive impact on the children they support.\n\nIn total, clubs in Coventry and Warwickshire received more than £310,000 to upgrade their facilities.\n\nThe funding ranged from just under £250,000 for new changing rooms at Racing Club Warwick, to just over £1,000 for Upper Lighthorne Football Club for new goalposts.\n\nNuneaton-based Camp Hill Educational Sports and Social, better known as Chess FC, was awarded £6,017 to buy portable floodlights for their training pitches at Hill Top Playing Fields in Arley.\n\nClub chairperson Ian Andrew said it meant their eight junior teams, including an under-15 girls side, could train anywhere on the surface at night and in all weathers.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"They love coming along in the evening. It's pitch black and they've got the chance to run around and feel like professional footballers playing under lights.\"\n\nRacing Club Warwick received just under £250,000 to build new changing rooms at their Townsend Meadow ground.\n\nClub chairman Gary Vella said: \"When you've got a 3G pitch and you've got game after game, particularly for juniors, you need changing facilities. The women's game, disability football, all need their own changing areas, so this will help push us on.\"\n\nNearly £60,000 was given to 16 clubs across Herefordshire and Worcestershire and the DCMS said the money was aimed at giving families affordable ways to stay healthy.\n\nDavid Pembridge, from Wessington Juniors FC in Hereford, said: \"Throughout Herefordshire there's a massive shortage of indoor facilities.\n\n\"It's very costly so any time that you're hiring indoor facilities, which could be anything from £50 an hour, when you've got 11 teams, that quickly racks up to thousands and thousands which makes it less affordable for parents.\"\n\nThe group was awarded a grant to provide portable floodlights\n\nHe added: \"Every winter since we have been able to continue training outside in almost all weathers, when the clocks change it doesn't mean football stops it means that we can carry on and the children still get their weekly fix of football.\"\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"This is sport delivering for the nation.

    "description": "Cleveland's unique 10-inch drop off between the court and the arena floor came into focus again during the Lakers game.",
    "fullText": "Luka Doncic grabbed at his left leg. He immediately thought of Dru Smith. The Miami Heat guard’s knee injury suffered in 2023 when he slipped off the side of the Cleveland Cavaliers court haunted Doncic while he winced in pain near the Lakers bench.\n\nThe Lakers superstar avoided serious injury after falling off the side of the Cavaliers’ raised court on Monday, but the threat of a player being hurt by Cleveland’s unique 10-inch drop off between the court and the arena floor came into focus again during the Lakers’ 129-99 loss to the Cavaliers.\n\n“It is absolutely a safety hazard,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said after Doncic was able to return later in the first quarter. “And I don't know why it's still like that. I don't. You know, you can lodge formal complaints. A lot of times you don't see any change when you lodge a formal complaint.”\n\nDoncic was injured shooting a fadeaway three with 7:58 left in the first quarter. He was hopping on one foot after releasing the shot and hopped right off the platform, grabbing immediately for his left leg. When he hobbled to the locker room, Doncic could barely put any weight on his leg.\n\nBut he returned with 1:32 remaining in the first quarter and finished with 29 points, six assists and five rebounds. He didn’t have any additional braces or wraps on his left leg, but he said he didn’t feel quite 100%.\n\n“I kind of got scared,” Doncic said. “It wasn't a great feeling and looking back at the video I think I got a little bit lucky. It hurts obviously more now, but, just, I tried to go.\"\n\nSmith was injured much more severely in 2023 when he was closing out on defense, landed on a stat sheet and slipped over the edge. He suffered a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament sprain in the accident, and the Heat contacted the NBA to express concerns about the floor at the time.\n\n“It’s tough to see another player get hurt on this court, with the fall, with the drop off,” Lakers guard Gabe Vincent said Monday, “so hopefully something can get fixed with that, but we’re fortunate that [Doncic] is OK.”\n\nCleveland’s Rocket Arena, which opened in 1994 and was last renovated in 2019, is also home to the Cleveland Monsters, an American Hockey League affiliate of the Columbus Blue Jackets. The basketball court is raised to accommodate the ice underneath the floor. But several teams in the NBA, including the Lakers, share their arena with hockey teams and none have a court that drops off like Cleveland’s.\n\n“It's the only court like this so, I guess it's my fault,” Doncic said. “I [gotta] stop jumping like that.\"\n\nThe Lakers have history with concerning courts this year. In November, Doncic said during a postgame news conference that the Lakers’ custom NBA Cup court used during a home game against the Clippers was dangerously slippery. The team flagged the problem to the league and the Lakers did not use the court again because it was not deemed safe for play in time for the other NBA Cup games.\n\nBut when asked if there was a way he could bring the latest problem up with the league, Doncic demurred.\n\n“I don’t know,” Doncic said, “don’t involve me in that.”\n\nSimilarly, Redick said any changes would be \"way above my pay grade.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa conclude their remarkably successful Europa League league-phase campaign on Thursday night at Villa Park, hosting RB Salzburg, fighting for their continental survival.\n\nUnai Emery’s men have already mathematically secured a top-eight finish. This guarantees them direct passage to the Round of 16. They will be eager to maintain momentum after a clinical 2-0 victory at Newcastle on Sunday. Conversely, the visitors find themselves in a desperate position. Currently sitting 28th in the table, the Austrian champions must secure a maiden victory on English soil.\n\nDate: Thursday, 29 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: First competitive meeting\n\nUnai Emery is expected to rotate his squad heavily tonight. Midfield metronome Youri Tielemans is out with a significant ankle injury. He joins captain John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara on the sidelines. Ross Barkley remains a major doubt with a knee issue. While Tammy Abraham has returned to the club permanently, he is not registered for this phase. Marco Bizot is likely to continue in goal to manage the workload of Emiliano Martínez.\n\nThe visitors are still without Takumu Kawamura and John Mellberg. Both players are currently recovering from long-term knee injuries. However, their attack remains a significant threat. Teenage winger Kerim Alajbegovic is in fine form following a brace against Basel. He is expected to support top scorer Petar Ratkov. Ratkov has netted 12 goals in all competitions this term.\n\nVilla Park has become a European fortress for the Villans once again. Including qualifiers, the club has won 14 of their last 16 home matches in Europe. They are now chasing a record-breaking seventh successive home European win. Curiously, all five of Villa’s home goals in this competition have been scored by players with surnames beginning with M.\n\nThe Austrian side faces a daunting task in Birmingham. Salzburg are winless in all eight of their previous major European meetings with English clubs. Furthermore, they have lost their last five away matches in major continental competitions. They have never lost six in a row on the road. A loss tonight would likely end their hopes of climbing into the play-off spots.\n\nAston Villa Predicted XI: Bizot; Garcia, Lindelöf, Mings, Digne; Bogarde, Onana, Hemmings; Sancho, Guessand, Buendía\n\nRed Bull Salzburg Predicted XI: Schlager; Trummer, Gadou, Schuster, Krätzig; Kitano, Diabaté, Bidstrup; Baidoo, Ratkov, Alajbegovic\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on TNT Sports 2.

    "fullText": "Manchester United need to get rid of a lot of deadwood come the end of the season.\n\nWhile a few are currently a part of the first team squad, many are out on loan. One of them is Andre Onana.\n\nSigned by Erik ten Hag as David de Gea’s successor, the ex-Ajax ace made more high-profile blunders than saves during his time in Manchester.\n\nArguably “one of the worst goalkeepers” to don the United jersey, the Cameroonian was banished to Trabzonspor after a series of mistakes last season and at the start of the current campaign.\n\nWhile the Turkish side would love to sign the African ace permanently in the summer, it is unlikely they can afford to pay the goalie’s wages and meet INEOS’ asking price.\n\nThe Cameroon international had expressed his desire to return to Old Trafford in a bid to resurrect his United career, but INEOS are simply not interested.\n\nAs per recent reports, the 29-year-old’s former club Inter Milan are keen on a reunion and even met with the goalkeeper’s agents.\n\nAndre Onana earns €108,269 per week including bonuses at Trabzonspor (via capology), more that he would have earned at Old Trafford.\n\nAnd he is unlikely to take a paycut to join the Nerazzurri. As revealed by The Daily Mail, the Red Devils might need to pay him off to finally get rid of him.\n\n“Andre Onana could be handed the opportunity to return to Inter Milan from Manchester United this summer after his agents held talks with the Serie A club.\n\n“Onana still owns a property in Milan, although wages could be a stumbling block. Onana was given a pay rise when he joined Trabzonspor from United once it became clear that he could not stay as back-up to Lammens.\n\n“The former Barcelona and Ajax keeper still has two-and-a-half years left on his contract at Old Trafford, so United may have to pay him off to enable any deal to go through.”\n\nWhether INEOS will agree to the proposal remains to be seen. The 20-time English league champions did the right thing by bringing in Senne Lammens, who has proven to be a calming presence between the sticks.\n\nFeature image Michael Regan via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The K League has unveiled the official trophy that will be used for the Coupang Play K League Super Cup 2026, as well as brand-new sleeve patches for the reigning champions.\n\nThe K League has a fresh look about it heading into the 2026 season, with new teams in K League 2 and newcomers to K League 1. There's also the return of the Super Cup, which has been given a brand new trophy.\n\nK League says that the newly revealed Super Cup trophy reflects a design concept symbolising the start of a rise to the throne. Featuring a V-shaped metal structure representing rays of victory, the trophy captures both the beginning of a new season and the dignity of a champion. Furthermore, the upward-stretching structural lines visually emphasise a team’s rising energy and the presence of the title winner.\n\nIn particular, the high-gloss silver finish strongly reflects spotlights, creating the effect of the trophy appearing as a source of light, while the asymmetrical structure symbolises the unpredictability of competition and the dynamic collision between the two teams.\n\nThe Super Cup trophy embodies both the meaning of a new season’s kickoff and the excitement of a one-match showdown.\n\nThe K League Super Cup is an official K League-hosted competition held ahead of the new season and will return for the first time since 2006. It is contested between the previous season’s K League 1 champions and the Korea Cup winners. If one club wins both competitions, the K League 1 runners-up will participate instead.\n\nThis year’s Super Cup will be held at 2 p.m. on Saturday, February 21, one week before the start of the K League 1 season, at Jeonju World Cup Stadium. Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, who completed a league-and-cup double last season, will face Daejeon Hana Citizen, who finished runners-up in K League 1 to record the best league result in the club’s history.\n\nThe winner of the match will claim the Super Cup trophy, marking the official start of the new season. The match will be played over 90 minutes and then straight to penalties if the score is level. The winners will receive 200 million Korean won, and the runners-up 100 million.\n\nCoupang Play is the title sponsor of the event, and ticket sales and live broadcasting will both be handled via Coupang Play. Ticket information will be announced on the Coupang Play official website on Friday, January 30. Ticket sales will begin on Friday, February 6 via the Coupang Play mobile app, with Sports Pass presales opening at 12 noon, followed by general sales at 8 p.m.\n\nWhile chasing a new trophy, Jeonbuk will have newly-designed K League champions patches on their sleeves.\n\nK League says that the patch is a unique league symbol representing that all teams competing in K League-organised competitions hold equal status.\n\nPreviously, the champions patch was based on the official competition logo, which includes the league’s title sponsor Hana Bank, and featured the same design as the standard league patch but with a gold finish to differentiate it. In contrast, the new champions patch incorporates each club’s unique elements into the design, capturing both team identity and pride in winning the title.\n\nThe redesigned champions patch combines graphic elements inspired by the club’s home stadium with the championship trophy, visually expressing the winning team’s symbolic identity in an intuitive way. The update goes beyond a league-wide emblem, reflecting the intention to also celebrate the champions’ history and achievements.\n\nAs a result, 2025 K League 1 champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors will wear the new champions patch during the 2026 season, featuring Jeonju World Cup Stadium, the club’s record of 10 K League 1 titles, and the championship trophy.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa host Red Bull Salzburg at Villa Park this Thursday, aiming to conclude their Europa League league phase campaign on a high note.\n\nUnai Emery’s side sits comfortably in second place, having already secured automatic qualification for the Round of 16. Although a solitary defeat to Go Ahead Eagles mars their record, Villa have otherwise dominated, winning six of their seven fixtures. With a top-eight finish guaranteed, the pressure lifts, granting Emery the luxury of rotation.\n\nHe intends to rest key starters ahead of crucial domestic fixtures. However, the objective remains clear: extend a formidable home record. Villa have transformed their ground into a fortress, winning all three European home matches this season. A victory tonight ensures they enter the knockout stages with maximum momentum.\n\nUnai Emery navigates a significant midfield crisis. A severe ankle injury sustained against Newcastle rules out Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future. He joins John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara on the sidelines. Consequently, Emery looks to his squad depth, handing opportunities to fringe players and promising youngsters.\n\nIn goal, Marco Bizot steps in for Emiliano Martínez, affording the Argentine a deserved rest. Tyrone Mings leads the defence, partnering winter signing Victor Lindelöf. Further forward, Amadou Onana anchors the midfield alongside Lamare Bogarde. Finally, Jadon Sancho and Emiliano Buendía provide the creativity to support lone striker Evann Guessand.\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Garcia, Lindelöf, Mings, Digne; Bogarde, Onana, Hemmings; Sancho, Guessand, Buendía\n\nThe Europa League league-phase fixture takes place at Villa Park on Thursday, 29 January 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on TNT Sports 2. Fans can also stream the action via the discovery+ app.\n\nRead more- Chelsea urge ‘extreme caution’ as fans stabbed in Naples\n\nSee Also- Newcastle, Everton and West Ham chase Genoa right-back\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "Utah State achieved their largest victory over Wyoming in their 96 years playing each other.",
    "fullText": "In anticipation of Wednesday night’s clash with Wyoming, The HURD elected to turn the Utah State student section at The Spectrum into a “pinkout.”\n\nAnd four minutes into the game, the Aggies surely had Wyoming head coach Sundance Wicks wishing he had access to an antacid the shade of Pepto Bismol at his disposal.\n\nUtah State put together an early 13-0 run against the Cowboys to force Wicks into calling a timeout just over four minutes into the contest, and the Aggies never looked back, cruising to a 94-62 win.\n\nThe 32-point margin of victory over Wyoming was the largest by Utah State in the series, which dates back to 1930 with 93 total games.\n\n“I was really proud of our guys’ effort tonight,” USU head coach Jerrod Calhoun said. “I thought we did an incredible job of creating advantages and playing for each other.”\n\nSenior guard Kolby King came off the bench to knock down four 3-point attempts and score a season-high 20 points for the Aggies (17-3 overall, 8-2 in the Mountain West), who shot 55% from the field as a team against the Cowboys (12-9, 3-7).\n\n“Coach had an amazing game plan for this game to get into the middle of the paint and kick out for threes. And we had great space tonight,” said King, who finished 6 for 9 from the field, 4 of 6 from 3-point range and pulled down a team-best seven rebounds in 25 minutes. “You can see the results; we made shots.”\n\nUtah State racked up 28 assists against a season-low five turnovers while facing Wyoming’s 3-2 zone defense, which provided ample room for the Aggies to successfully hoist up baseline threes from the corners. Utah State went 8 of 16 from 3-point range in the first half, and 13 for 34 from beyond the arc for the game, with many of those misfires coming over the final six or seven minutes when the Aggies were up by as many as 38 points.\n\nIn addition to King, the Aggies got strong first-half contributions from junior guard Mason Falslev (12 points, five assists, two steals) and freshman forward Adlan Elamin (nine points, five rebounds) on their way to putting together a 50-28 halftime lead. Senior forward Garry Clark, who sat much of the first half after picking up two fouls in one minute, bounced back to total 13 points and five rebounds while junior guard Tucker Anderson also came off the bench to knock down three 3-pointers and score 11 points.\n\nMJ Collins Jr., the leading scorer in the Mountain West at 19.3 points per game, finished with 12 points and four assists while knocking down half of his 10 field goal attempts.\n\n“I was really proud of MJ tonight,” Calhoun said. “All I heard from him all night was ‘Just keep shooting, Kolby. Just keep shooting.’ And he had four assists and no turnovers.\n\n“The last four games he hasn’t been as good. And we went through stretches like that with Ian (Martinez) last year. ... But there’s a lot of things that shooters can do without shooting threes, and I thought he played one of his better games tonight.”\n\nThe Aggies outscored the Cowboys 14-2 on fast breaks, the USU bench dominated the visitors 54-13 and the rebounding battle was an even 36-36, which is significant since Wyoming came into the game first in the Mountain West with a rebound margin of +6.80 rebounds per game.\n\nSenior guard Leland Walker put up 24 points and buried four 3-point attempts for the Cowboys, but freshman guard Nasir Meyer was the only other visiting player to score in double figures in what could be Wyoming’s final visit to the Spectrum with Utah State moving on to the Pac-12 next season.\n\nOverall, the Cowboys shot just 35% for the game and finished 8 for 32 from 3-point range.\n\nWyoming did score the first basket of the game, but the Aggies scored 15 of the next 17 points, the majority of them by Falslev and Elamin. That meant the sellout crowd of 10,270 was behind the Aggies early on, and the hosts, who were wearing throwback uniforms similar to USU’s look from the late ‘80s, continued to add to their lead throughout the first half.\n\nUtah State, which let a 14-point advantage in the second half get away from them in a home loss to UNLV on Jan. 20, quickly put the game away after halftime by coming up with three turnovers on Wyoming’s first three possessions. That defense helped spark a 12-2 run that left the Aggies up 62-30 just three minutes into the second half.\n\n“Our guys were really on it tonight,” Calhoun said. “Not a lot of guys played a lot of minutes, so we can do more tomorrow at practice. It helps the entire organization in the planning when you don’t have to play guys 32 to 35 minutes, you know? So, the guys should feel pretty good about what they just did.”\n\nThat should help the Aggies heading into Saturday’s showdown with San Diego State at the Spectrum. The Aztecs (15-5, 9-1) won at Colorado State late Wednesday night to maintain their first-place hold in the Mountain West standings, just ahead of Utah State and New Mexico (17-4, 8-2), who are currently tied for second place.",

After the league phase of the premier class ended last night, a duel between two German teams is already looming in the playoffs.\n\nUnlike Bayern Munich, who have directly qualified for the round of 16, Dortmund and Leverkusen must enter the playoffs. Here, the worst-case scenario could occur during the draw on Friday from 12 PM. Why?\n\nAs the 17th in the final table, Borussia Dortmund forms a pair with Olympiakos Piraeus (18th). This pair meets the duo of places 15/16 with Atalanta Bergamo and Bayer Leverkusen. This means: The probability of a German duel being drawn is very high.\n\nIn the worst case, the Bundesliga could lose important points in the battle for international places.

    "description": "According to a new report, Jayson Tatum is re-evaluating his situation and considering sitting out for the rest of this season.",
    "fullText": "Jayson Tatum’s return felt like a looming possibility as he continued to rehab his Achilles tear from last year’s playoffs. But according to NBA insider Chris Haynes, those comeback plans could be put on pause for the foreseeable future.\n\nHaynes reported late Wednesday night that Tatum is “re-evaluating his situation” when it comes to a return this season. That’s a drastic change in his plan considering it sounded like he was going to be back on the court soon, telling people about it.\n\n“It is up in the air on if he’s going to return at all this season,” Haynes said. “I was told there were a couple of factors of why he’s reached that point. But as of right now, that changes the whole landscape because Tatum even told me personally he was returning at some point. I was hearing he was getting close and league sources told me that the situation has changed.”\n\nTatum told ESPN that he hasn’t made a decision on if he’ll return this season because he “wants to get it right the first time, so it’s just a lot to think about.”\n\nThe Celtics have put together a surprisingly strong start to the season without Tatum, going 29-18 through their first 47 games to hold the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. Tatum showcased his recovery in front of reporters last week in Detroit, going through a full 45-minute workout that included some dribbling and 1-on-1 drills with assistant coach Tony Dobbins.\n\n“It’s been amazing to see,” Derrick White said after the workout. “Obviously, all the work he’s put in. You just kind of see him being around more and being able to do more, so that’s exciting to see as a friend. So, every day he’s been working hard and it’s good to see all that hard work add to some more movement and more opportunities.”\n\nThe All-Star has been a constant figure with the team all year long, traveling on the team’s road trips while also attending meetings and film sessions.\n\nTatum underwent surgery to repair his torn Achilles on May 13, 2025, which put him eight months and two weeks into his recovery. Tatum’s father, Justin, told ESPN last May that the Celtics star was aiming for a return to the floor after 8-9 months.\n\nHowever, Tatum admitted some trepidation about returning this season for the first time this week in an interview on “The Pivot Podcast.” He pointed out how the Celtics have built an identity on the court as an East contender. It’s the first-time ever Tatum hasn’t started a season with the team in training camp, so he had some apprehension about coming back this season.\n\nDecisions will have to be made, but it’s still only late-January. So there’s still time for Tatum and his team to mull over any final say on whether he’ll play this season. But it did sound like Tatum was rethinking his return for this season.\n\n“They have an identity this year or things that they felt has clicked for them and has been successful,” Tatum said. “There is a thought in my head, ‘How does that work?’ or ‘How does that look with me integrating myself off with injury and 50, 60 games into a season?’\n\n“Obviously, there could be some challenges. It is a thought like, ‘Damn, do I come back? Or should I wait?’ It’s something that, recently, in the last two weeks or so just kind of contemplate every single day.”\n\n4 takeaways as Celtics lose to Hawks in chippy affair\n\nCeltics trade rumors: Latest big man linked to Boston\n\nCeltics big man drawing trade interest from 3 teams\n\nWhat Celtics rivals are threats to make Giannis Antetokounmpo trade?",

    "description": "Meta's Q4 2025 earnings reveal massive AI investment plans, ad-driven revenue growth, and costly Reality Labs losses.",
    "fullText": "Meta's earnings sent a clear signal to Wall Street on Wednesday: while its core advertising engine is still firing on all cylinders, the price tag for CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI ambitions will skyrocket in 2026.\n\nThe company reported $59.89 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025, topping Wall Street's forecasts. Meta's stock jumped as high as 10% in after-hours trading.\n\nAlongside the upbeat numbers, Meta laid out how hard it plans to push in 2026. The company said it expects to spend $115 billion to $135 billion next year on capital expenditures — largely on the computers and data centers that power AI.\n\nIn other words, Meta still makes most of its money from ads. It's asking investors to stay on board as it pours an extraordinary amount of cash into the race to build more powerful AI and weave it into Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and virtual and augmented reality products, collectively used by more than 3.5 billion people daily around the world.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Meta's Q4 2025 earnings call.\n\nMeta told to brace for a much more expensive 2026 as it pours money into the compute and data centers needed to power its AI push. The company said it expects capital expenditures in 2026 to land between $115 billion and $135 billion — up to almost double the $72 billion it spent in 2025.\n\nMeta's chief financial officer, Susan Li, said the increased expenditure will support Meta Superintelligence Labs' efforts and its core business.\n\nLi also warned that Meta's overall costs are set to climb fast. The company expects total 2026 expenses of $162 billion to $169 billion, with most of the increase coming from \"infrastructure costs,\" including \"third-party cloud spend, higher depreciation, and higher infrastructure operating expenses.\"\n\nAnd Meta isn't just buying more machines — it's also paying for people to run them. Li said the \"second-largest contributor\" to expense growth will be compensation, driven by \"investments in technical talent,\" including hires in \"priority areas, particularly AI.\"\n\nAdvertising once again powered Meta's quarter. The company reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue in Q4 2025, up 24% from the same time last year. That growth came from a mix of showing more ads (ad impressions rose 18% from the same quarter last year) and charging a bit more per ad (average price per ad rose 6%).\n\nWhen analysts pressed Zuckerberg on whether Meta can build meaningful businesses beyond ads, given how much cash it's pouring into AI, he didn't dodge the question of its dependency.\n\n\"For the next couple of years, ads are going to be by far the most important driver of growth in our business,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is working on new bets alongside that core engine.\n\nMeta's pitch is that its AI investments are already making the ad machine work better — not just by targeting, but by improving the systems that decide which ads people will most likely engage with.\n\nThe company said that its AI tools for making video ads hit a $10 billion revenue run rate. It also said a newer measurement product helped advertisers drive 24% more conversions than its standard method — and ramped up to a multi-billion-dollar annual run rate in just seven months.\n\nReality Labs, the division behind Meta's virtual and augmented reality efforts, continued to burn cash in the final quarter of 2025. The division lost $6.02 billion in a quarter, the highest ever, and $19.19 billion in 2025 — numbers that underscore how much Meta's ambitions to build immersive worlds still depend on ad revenue.\n\nDespite laying off about 1,500 people at Reality Labs earlier this month, Meta told investors not to expect a sudden turnaround. Li said the company expects Reality Labs' operating losses in 2026 to remain \"similar to 2025 levels.\"\n\nZuckerberg is trying to reposition what Reality Labs is building. The company's focus has shifted from trying to go all in on the \"metaverse\" to building AI-powered smart glasses and experiences that could live inside Meta's existing apps.\n\nWhen Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked about Meta's plans to bring Horizon Worlds, a virtual hangout zone accessible on the company's Quest VR headsets, to mobile, Zuckerberg said that he expects more \"interactive and immersive\" content formats to show up directly inside the feeds in Meta's existing apps.\n\nHe added that people might be able to use AI to create a game with a single prompt and share it on their feeds so that others can \"jump right into it.\"\n\nHe positioned Horizon Worlds as a natural fit for an \"immersive 3D\" version of that idea and said that Meta's work on VR software and Horizon could pair with AI advances to bring these kinds of experiences to \"hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile.\"\n\nMeta isn't just trying to sprinkle AI features across Facebook and Instagram. Zuckerberg is making a bigger argument: if Meta wants to shape the next generation of consumer tech, it needs to control the underlying AI, not just depend on whatever rivals sell.\n\nThat's also the framing behind his public push for \"personal superintelligence,\" which he called out again as a key focus for 2026.\n\nWhen Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski asked how critical it is for Meta to have a general-purpose model, Zuckerberg leaned into Meta's identity as a \"deep technology company.\"\n\nWhat allows Meta to build everything it does, he said, \"is that we build and control the underlying technology.\" That way, Meta can design the experiences it wants, \"and not just be constrained to what others in the ecosystem are building or allow us to build,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nHe suggested that relying on outside models could become risky over time, citing a mix of competitive and safety reasons. That's why, he said, it's important for Meta to have its own models, both from a business perspective and because Meta wants to \"actually design and build the experiences that we believe that we should be building for people.\"\n\nZuckerberg is pitching 2026 as the year AI changes not just Meta's products, but how Meta itself operates. On the call, he said 2026 will be \"the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work\" and that the company is \"investing in AI native tooling so individuals at Meta can get more done.\"\n\nHe also described a deliberate shift in org design.\n\n\"We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is already seeing \"projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person.\"\n\nLi paired that cultural pitch with a concrete productivity claim. She said that since the beginning of 2025, Meta has seen a \"30% increase in output per engineer\" overall, and that \"power users\" of its internal AI coding tools saw output rise 80% year-over-year.\n\nThe company's implied bet? Spend heavily on AI infrastructure and tooling, and then run leaner teams that can ship more.\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "description": "The Big Tech rivals are spending more than ever, but analysts are more concerned about Microsoft at the moment.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street had very different reactions to two of Big Tech's biggest spenders after quarterly earnings reports came out on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Meta and Microsoft reported higher-than-expected capex. While both companies beat revenue expectations, Microsoft's stock sank more than 6% after-hours, while Meta's stock jumped as high as 9%.\n\nBig Tech's spending has risen sharply in the last two years, driven by investments in massive AI data centers. Wall Street has started to question when those investments will pay off, and analysts are giving some companies a much harder time than others.\n\nMeta reported capex of $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the year, up from 2024's $39.2 billion. That number will climb in 2026 — the company estimates capex will be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion for the year, driven by increased spending on Meta SuperIntelligence Labs, the company's big bet on speeding up AI model development.\n\n\"We plan to continue to prioritize investing in the business to support these opportunities,\" CFO Susan Li told investors on Wednesday's call.\n\nMicrosoft logged $37.5 billion in capex for the quarter, up 66% from one year ago. Most of that spend went toward CPUs and GPUs, the powerful computing chips that run AI workloads. The company said the spending was necessary to support fast-growing demand for its cloud and AI business.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue was 81.3 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the previous year. Meta reported $55.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $200.1 billion for all of 2025.\n\nWhile both surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations, analysts gave Microsoft a much harder time than Meta over its surging capex.\n\nPart of that could be Microsoft's heavy investments in GPU chips, which can become costly given their short life spans.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said that a core issue for investors, as Microsoft's capex grows faster than they expected, \"comes down to ROI on capex spend over time.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also heavily exposed to a single customer, another concern for investors. Nearly half — 45% — of the company's remaining performance obligations are attributed to OpenAI.\n\n\"There's obviously concern about the durability,\" Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said of the backlog.\n\nMicrosoft holds a $135 billion stake in OpenAI and has invested more than $13 billion into the company since 2019.\n\nWhile OpenAI does not directly carry a heavy debt load, some of its partners, including Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia, have taken on massive amounts of debt to fund data center buildouts, fueling Wall Street's anxiety over a potential AI bubble.\n\nOracle is struggling to finance its $500 billion data center initiative, Business Insider reported last week, amid growing concerns about its credit rating and risk.\n\nOn the Meta earnings call, Li noted that Meta's cash reserves, thanks to its very profitable ad business, will fuel its AI spending spree next year.\n\n\"We have a strong net cash balance, and expect our business will continue to generate sufficient cash to fund our infrastructure investments in 2026,\" Li said.",

    "description": "OpenAI and Microsoft have a reconfigured relationship. The software giant revealed just how much OpenAI is driving its RPO.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is facing capacity constraints, and OpenAI is driving a large portion of the backlog in its cloud computing business.\n\nThe company said its backlog in commercial bookings, a metric referred to as remaining performance obligations, ballooned 110% year over year to $625 billion when it reported earnings for the second quarter on Wednesday.\n\nOpenAI accounts for roughly 45% of those commitments, Microsoft revealed. The company did not say how much OpenAI contributed during the previous quarter.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts on the call expressed concerns about Microsoft's dependency on OpenAI.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella said acquiring more Azure clients is important to the tech giant, but it can't come at the expense of neglecting its other services.\n\n\"If you think about it, acquiring an Azure customer is super important to us, but so is acquiring an M365 or a GitHub or a Dragon Copilot, which are all, by the way, incremental businesses and TAMs for us,\" Nadella said during Microsoft's second-quarter earnings call. \"And so we don't want to maximize just one business of ours.\"\n\nShares of Microsoft fell more than 6% in after-market trading on Wednesday, even as the tech giant posted an overall earnings beat.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said during the call that some on Wall Street may be spooked by slower growth in overall Azure revenue and the increase in capex spending. Microsoft's capital expenditures rose 66% year over year to $37.5 billion in the second quarter, another record for the company and testament to the sheer amount of money tech companies are spending amid the AI race.\n\nCFO Amy Hood said that Microsoft has to look at many different areas when it allocates the GPUs and CPUs that come online as a result of its capex spending, including investing in the growth of first-party apps like Microsoft Copilot, devoting GPUs to research and development, and the talent they've acquired.\n\n\"You end up with the remainder going towards serving the Azure capacity that continues to grow in terms of demand,\" she said.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in facing capacity issues.\n\nExecutives at OpenAI, which has pledged to spend $250 billion on Azure services, have repeatedly said the startup is held back by a lack of compute, forcing tough trade-offs between product and research.\n\nWednesday's earnings mark the first quarter since OpenAI completed its restructuring, which included a new agreement with Microsoft, the startup's largest investor. Microsoft owns 27% of the public benefit corporation.\n\n\"It's a great partnership,\" Hood said of Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI. It's allowed us to remain a leader in terms of what we're building and being on the cutting edge of app innovation.\"",

    "description": "Moscow says it's been gaining momentum, but the researchers said even its advance in Pokrovsk was slower than the Allies' in the Battle of the Somme.",
    "fullText": "Russia's rate of advance over the last two years, even during its fiercest offensive campaigns, has been among the slowest in modern war, per a new analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe assessment by CSIS researchers Seth G. Jones and Riley McCabe, published on Tuesday, examined Russia's three major pushes on the front lines following its seizure of Avdiivka in February 2024.\n\n\"After seizing the initiative in 2024, Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters per day in their most prominent offensives, slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThey used their findings to dispute recent statements by Russian leaders, including the country's president, Vladimir Putin, that the Kremlin has been gaining significant momentum in recent months.\n\nThese three offensive directions — toward Kupiansk in northern Ukraine and Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar in the east — have been the source of the war's most intense battlegrounds in the last two years.\n\nRussian forces have said at various stages in 2025 that they'd taken all three major hubs, though Ukraine says that it still maintains pockets of fighting presence there and has been pushing back.\n\nBut even in Pokrovsk, where Russia advanced the fastest, the Kremlin's troops took roughly 70 meters of territory per day, totaling 50 kilometers, or roughly 31 miles, over the last two years, Jones and McCabe wrote.\n\nThe pair calculated the rate of advance based on the straight-line distance by which battle territory shifted, which doesn't account for the total area of territory seized.\n\nBased on this method, Jones and McCabe assessed a Russian rate of advance of 23 meters per day for Kupiansk and 15 meters per day for Chasiv Yar.\n\nAll three were slower than the brutal five-month French and British advance at the Somme in World War I, which took an average of 80 meters of German territory per day, researchers wrote.\n\nCompared with other major combined-arms offensives in modern history, Russia's recent advances have been \"moving at mere fractions of the pace of historical campaigns,\" they added.\n\nJones and McCabe highlighted the Soviet Union's advance on the Leningrad front in 1943, which they said progressed at an average pace of 1,000 meters a day, and the 1918 Battle of Belleau Wood, where they said US forces advanced 410 meters a day in Germany.\n\nUkraine's 2022 counteroffensive in Kharkiv, meanwhile, seized 7,400 meters a day, while its temporary incursion into Kursk took 1,250 meters a day, the researchers added.\n\nPart of the reason behind Russia's slow advance has been the nature of the war, Jones and McCabe noted. The attritive style of the conflict favors the defender heavily, especially with the mass introduction of first-person-view drones.\n\n\"The eastern front line, for instance, continues to be saturated with drones. As a result, vehicle movement is difficult within 15 kilometers of the front line,\" they wrote.\n\nTo be sure, Kyiv still faces a slew of emerging and severe challenges, including high rates of draft dodging and desertion, waning US military support, and Russia innovating with its attack drones to pound Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the winter.\n\nOverall, Russia has seized roughly 75,000 square kilometers, or 28,900 square miles, of Ukraine since its full-scale invasion began in 2022, Jones and McCabe wrote.\n\n\"These gains and Russia's overall progress on the battlefield, especially in the last two years, fall decisively short of Moscow's goal to militarily conquer Ukraine,\" the researchers added.\n\nStill, they added that a more recent Russian offensive toward the city of Huliaipole in the southern Zaporizhzhia region has been more successful.\n\nSince this push began in November 2025, Russia has been advancing there at an average rate of 297 meters a day, their assessment said.\n\nMoscow's high casualties in the last year or so, however, also pose another challenge to its ability to sustain its assault.\n\nRussian deaths and injuries on the battlefield have outnumbered Ukraine's by a ratio of 2:1 or even 2.5:1, Jones and McCabe wrote, citing figures from CSIS, the UK's defense ministry, and other sources such as news outlets and interviews with officials.\n\n\"There were roughly 415,000 Russian casualties in 2025 alone, with an average of nearly 35,000 casualties per month,\" they added.",

    "fullText": "Emma Heming Willis, 47, says her husband, Bruce Willis, isn't aware that he has frontotemporal dementia.\n\n\"I think that's like the blessing and the curse of this is that Bruce never tapped in. He never connected the dots that he had this disease,\" Heming Willis said on Wednesday's episode of \"Conversations with Cam\" podcast. \"And I'm really happy about that. I'm really happy that he doesn't know about it.\"\n\nHeming Willis went on to explain why her husband didn't fully grasp his condition.\n\n\"It's not for everybody, but there is this term, this neurological condition that sort of comes with FTD and other types of dementia as well, called 'anosognosia,' where your brain can't identify what is happening to it,\" she said.\n\nAnosognosia is a condition in which people can't recognize the health conditions or problems they have, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It commonly affects people who have conditions such as Alzheimer's, dementia, or schizophrenia.\n\n\"Where people think this might be denial, like they don't want to go to the doctor because they're like, 'I'm fine. I'm fine.' Actually, this is the anosognosia that comes into play. It's not denial. It's just that their brain is changing; this is a part of the disease,\" Heming Willis said.\n\nIn 2022, the \"Die Hard\" star was diagnosed with aphasia and stepped away from acting. A year later, his family announced that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.\n\nHeming Willis said caring for Willis while watching him change has been heartbreaking.\n\n\"I've grieved so much, and you think that you can't grieve anymore, but you know dementia is progressive, and it continues to take and take and take,\" Heming Willis said.\n\nStill, she says she's come \"such a long way\" since those early days.\n\n\"I carry it with me all the time, but I can also bring in happiness, too, and laughter, and be able to connect with other people that feels really special and meaningful, where I didn't ever think that I would get there,\" Heming Willis said.\n\n\"I mean, and it is also hard to grieve someone who is still alive. You know, it's not natural. It is a very strange sort of thing,\" she said.\n\nHeming Willis has been open about her journey navigating her husband's condition.\n\nIn an August ABC special, she told Diane Sawyer that she had moved Willis to a separate one-story home nearby, where he has round-the-clock care.\n\nIn September, she told People she mistook her husband's early dementia symptoms for marital issues.\n\n\"Conversations weren't really aligning anymore, and our relationship started to shift. It was hard to put my finger on why and what was happening,\" Heming Willis said.",

    "description": "In college, Cameron Mofid set out on a mission to visit every country — not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront his obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
    "fullText": "As a kid, I pored over maps, flags, and history books, curious about what life looked like in far-off corners of the world. At the same time, I was quietly struggling with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often left me feeling trapped inside my own mind.\n\nOne night during my freshman year at the University of Miami, I came across an article in my apartment that stunned me. It said that more people had been to space than had visited every country in the world.\n\nFinding that out changed the direction of my life. I decided to set out on a mission to visit every country, not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront my OCD and prove to myself that it didn't have to dictate the limits of my life.\n\nOver the next few years of college, I saved aggressively while working in nightlife marketing in Miami, putting aside just enough to make the trip possible if I budgeted carefully and kept costs low.\n\nWhen I told my parents about my plan, they laughed and shrugged it off, not quite taking me seriously. Not long after, I called one of my best friends. He laughed too and said just two words: \"Good luck.\"\n\nAfter graduating, I made it my mission. I backpacked mostly alone across conflict zones, remote islands, and places at the center of ancient history. On April 3, 2025, I reached my 195th and final country in North Korea. The journey was verified by NomadMania, the world's largest travel community, which confirmed that I was the youngest person ever to have visited every country.\n\nAfter completing my mission, a few places stood out as truly unforgettable. These are three cities I always suggest others experience — and one I wouldn't rush back to.\n\nOut of the hundreds of cities I've visited in my life, Sydney is my favorite. What stood out most was how relaxed and welcoming people were. The pace reminded me of my hometown in San Diego, with the same laid-back energy but an even greater sense of warmth.\n\nOne morning, while sitting at a café, an older couple at the table next to me struck up a conversation and started sharing their favorite places around the city. They talked about the coastal walks they loved, which neighborhoods were worth spending time in, and the restaurants they kept going back to. Interactions like that happened often enough that the friendliness stopped feeling like a novelty and became part of everyday life.\n\nAs I explored the city, I kept noticing how naturally beautiful it was. More than 100 beaches are within reach, including Bondi, where I watched surfers roll in with the tide. In the city center, I wandered through different neighborhoods and took in the mix of historic architecture and modern design. The sunsets were especially memorable. I watched ferries cut across the water as the skyline came into view, framed by the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge.\n\nSydney is the kind of city I could easily imagine building a life in.\n\nValletta felt like a living crossroads of history from the moment I arrived. Sitting at the center of the Mediterranean, the city reflects centuries of Italian, Arab, British, and North African influence, all packed into a compact, walkable capital.\n\nI'd walk past waterfront cafés and, minutes later, find myself standing on the city's fortified walls, looking out over waters once traveled by Phoenician traders, Ottoman fleets, and British warships.\n\nWhat surprised me most about Valletta was how under-visited it felt compared to much of southern Europe. Even during peak season, it never felt overrun. A short ferry ride away, I spent time on the island of Gozo, where life moved even slower. I visited ancient temples older than the Egyptian pyramids and passed through small villages where fishing and farming still shape daily life.\n\nExperiencing Gozo made Valletta feel even more special: a historic capital with easy access to a quieter, older side of the Mediterranean.\n\nKrabi wasn't even on my radar at first, and it ended up being one of the last places I reached on my journey. A Thai friend I'd met years earlier on the junior tennis circuit told me it was the most beautiful part of the country and insisted I couldn't miss it.\n\nHe was right. Krabi Town is the province's main city, but most travelers use \"Krabi\" to refer to the surrounding beaches and islands — and few places on Earth combine land and sea as dramatically. At Railay Beach, limestone cliffs rise from turquoise water, creating a backdrop unlike anything else I've seen.\n\nI took day trips through Phang Nga Bay and out toward the nearby Phi Phi Islands, weaving past mangrove forests and hidden coves that felt largely untouched. And then there was the food. For a few dollars, I could get a delicious local meal and a fresh dragon fruit smoothie from a roadside stall or beachside café.\n\nKrabi is a reminder that some of the most memorable places aren't always part of the original plan.\n\nIndia was one of the countries I was most excited to visit, and it delivered some amazing experiences. Seeing the Taj Mahal in Agra lived up to every expectation, and witnessing the ancient religious rituals along the Ganges in Varanasi was one of the most powerful cultural moments I've experienced anywhere in the world.\n\nThat said, New Delhi isn't a place I feel a strong pull to return to. The air quality was poor enough that I found myself coughing constantly, making it uncomfortable to spend much time outside. In a city of more than 22 million people, the traffic was relentless, adding to a sense of chaos that, unlike in other busy cities I've loved, never felt energizing. Compared to other parts of India, I also didn't find the city's main sights as compelling.\n\nI'm glad I went, and India as a whole left a lasting impression on me. But if I were planning another trip, New Delhi wouldn't be on my list.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a $2B investment into xAI and the discontinuation of Model S and Model X in order to support Optimus robot production.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is making another leap to shed its EV maker title and transform into a full-fledged physical AI outfit.\n\nThe theme of Wednesday's fourth-quarter earnings call heavily centered on how Tesla is investing in its future as an AI and robotics company — a narrative CEO Elon Musk has pushed for some time now.\n\nThe bets included: a major investment in Musk's xAI, updates on the Optimus humanoid robot, and a renewed push for in-house chipmaking. Musk projected that Tesla's future will require a $20 billion investment, which dwarfs the company's $8.5 billion in capex reported for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's automotive segment took a back seat: Musk said he's killing the Model S and Model X to free up room for humanoid robot production. And while Tesla's energy and \"services\" revenue jumped 25% and 18%, respectively, auto revenue fell 11% year-over-year — a clear indication that the quarter's growth came from everywhere but its core EV business.\n\n\"We've updated the Tesla mission to amazing abundance, and this is an attempt to send a message of optimism about the future,\" Musk said during the call.\n\nThe company's stock rose 1.7% after the market closed on Wednesday evening.\n\nHere are 6 biggest takeaways from the earnings call.\n\nTesla made good on its pledge to investors and announced a $2 billion investment into xAI, the startup behind Grok. It's part of a larger $20 billion Series E funding round from January.\n\nThe expectation of the investment is a deeper collaboration between the two companies. xAI, which has been expanding its data center footprint, could provide the compute and other technical capabilities to further advance Tesla's autonomous vehicle and robotics agenda.\n\nVaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said during the call that the agreement with xAI is in the spirit of finding \"efficient ways for others to help us.\"\n\nIn a surprise move, Musk announced that production of the Model S and Model X would be discontinued by the next quarter, closing a chapter on the company's premium SUV and sedan.\n\nThat leaves the EV maker with four cars: the Cybertruck, the more popular Model 3 and Model Y, and the yet-to-be-released Cybercab.\n\nThe CEO said during the call that the move will provide more production space in Tesla's Fremont factory for Optimus robots.\n\nThe \"long-term goal\" is to produce a million units a year with the freed-up space, Musk said.\n\nThe CEO added that killing the Model S and Model X is part of Tesla's \"overall shift to an autonomous future,\" which includes the company's ride-hailing service, Tesla Robotaxi, and autonomy in personally owned vehicles through Full Self-Driving, an advanced driver assistance system.\n\nTesla expects to start production of the Cybercab, a two-seater coupe, in April for eventual integration into its Robotaxi fleet.\n\nTesla revealed where it aims to expand the Robotaxi ride-hailing service in the first half of 2026 — Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas — but has yet to announce when it will remove the safety monitors inside the cars for public riders across Austin and San Francisco Bay Area, where the service now operates.\n\nMusk said that FSD — the technology that Tesla says will make personally owned vehicles fully autonomous — is already \"100% unsupervised\" and operating without humans inside. The difference, he said, is that Tesla is being \"very cautious\" with rolling out unsupervised service to the public, though Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides in Austin this month.\n\n\"There's like some pretty nutty intersections, where there are a lot of humans who make mistakes and have accidents in various cities,\" Musk said. \"So we want to make sure that FSD can handle those unusual intersections.\"\n\nThere wasn't much of a progress report on Tesla's AI5 chip, but the CEO said he's spending part of his weekends working on it.\n\n\"If I'm spending my Saturdays on something, it's going to be something pretty important,\" Musk said, adding that chip procurement is \"existential\" for Tesla's future, going so far as to bring up the Tesla \"Terafab\" — his aspirational idea of building an in-house chip manufacturing plant.\n\nMusk said he wants to build a factory that integrates \"logic, memory, and packaging\" because Tesla will be \"fundamentally limited by supply chain\" if it doesn't.\n\nMusk said he expects to unveil an Optimus 3 robot in a \"few months,\" but don't expect it to be working the assembly lines just yet.\n\nThe CEO said Optimus isn't contributing to Tesla's manufacturing work in any \"material way\" and that the humanoid robot is only in the factory for training purposes.\n\nMusk talked a lot about Tesla's future, but the company's fourth-quarter performance still hinged on its tangible businesses, such as its energy segment, which includes the Megapack, a utility-scale battery system, and the Powerwall, the home battery system.\n\n\"On the energy front, we achieved yet another record in terms of gross profits for the quarter and ended the year with nearly $12.8 billion in revenue,\" Taneja, the Tesla CFO, said.\n\nTesla also announced this month that it will pivot FSD to a subscription-based only model starting in February. Customers previously had the option to buy FSD upfront for $8,000.\n\nThe move is a clear signal that Tesla sees FSD as a key future revenue generator.\n\nAutomakers are increasingly betting that software subscription services will be a critical source of recurring revenue with higher margins. General Motors revealed that its vehicle software generated $2 billion in the past nine months.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Vibe coding isn't going anywhere. But it's only part of a much bigger transformation, says OpenAI's board chair.\n\nBret Taylor said in an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published on Wednesday that using AI tools to build software quickly with natural language prompts will soon feel normal rather than novel. However, focusing on building today's software faster misses the bigger picture.\n\n\"Everyone's looking at all the software use and saying, 'How fast could I vibe code that?'\" Taylor said. \"I wonder if it's the wrong question.\"\n\nWhether someone can quickly vibe code an app in a web browser isn't \"the most interesting question in software,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the software we use today is set to be replaced, and that's the real disruption, Taylor said.\n\nRather than dashboards, web-browser forms, and traditional apps, the structure of software will change. AI agents will be \"the future of software.\"\n\n\"We will delegate tasks to agents that will operate against a database,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"Who's making those agents is the question,\" he added. \"Will you buy those agents off the shelf or build them yourself?\"\n\nTaylor also said that while AI has slashed the cost of building software, it hasn't solved the harder problems of maintaining it — or the risk of getting things wrong.\n\n\"That's why most people would prefer to buy a solution off the shelf,\" he said. \"You want to amortize the cost of maintaining software among thousands of clients.\"\n\nVibe coding has taken off across the tech world, but tech leaders said the technology has limits.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November in a \"Google for Developers\" podcast interview that vibe coding is \"making coding so much more enjoyable,\" adding that it allows even non-technical users to create simple apps and websites.\n\nDuring Alphabet's April earnings call, Pichai said AI generates more than 30% of Google's new code, up from 25% in October 2024.\n\nStill, AI-generated code can be error-prone, overly long, or poorly structured.\n\n\"I'm not working on large codebases where you really have to get it right, the security has to be there,\" Pichai said in November.\n\nBoris Cherny, the engineer behind Anthropic's Claude Code, said last month that vibe coding works best for prototypes or throwaway code, but not in software that sits at the core of a business.\n\n\"You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes,\" he said in an episode of \"The Peterman Podcast\" published in December.",

    "description": "The settlement means TikTok will avoid a trial where plaintiffs had planned to argue that social media platforms are inherently defective and subject to personal injury liability.",
    "fullText": "TikTok reached an agreement late Monday to settle a lawsuit over claims that social media companies had engineered their products to hook young users, avoiding the first in a series of landmark trials.\n\nThe trial, which is scheduled to begin in the California Superior Court of Los Angeles County with jury selection on Tuesday, is the first in a series of lawsuits expected to be heard this year against Meta, YouTube, Snap and TikTok. The cases stem from lawsuits filed by thousands of individuals, school districts and state attorneys general, accusing the companies of making their products addictive, like cigarettes, and causing personal injury.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and changes to the design of social media platforms to curb excessive use. If they succeed in arguing that the tech titans created defective products that injured millions of young American users, the cases — which are regarded as bellwethers — could open new lanes of liability against the tech titans.\n\nTikTok and Snap have both now settled the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube as the remaining defendants. The case involves a 20-year-old California woman identified in a 2023 lawsuit as K.G.M. The woman said she had become addicted to the social media sites as a child and experienced anxiety, depression and body-image issues as a result. Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and YouTube’s chief, Neal Mohan, are expected to testify.\n\nJoseph VanZandt, one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiff, confirmed the settlement but did not disclose details of the agreement. He said the trial against YouTube and Meta would proceed as scheduled\n\nMark Lanier, another lead lawyer for the plaintiff, said in a statement that “this is a good resolution, and we are pleased with the settlement.”\n\nTikTok did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTikTok and Snap are still defendants in more than a dozen other trials expected in state and federal courts this year. Roughly nine cases will be heard in the series of trials in Los Angeles. A second set of federal cases will go to trial this summer in Oakland, Calif., at the U.S. District Court of Northern California.\n\nThe lawsuits argue that features like infinite scroll, auto video play and algorithmic recommendations have led to compulsive social media use and caused depression, eating disorders and self-harm.\n\nThe companies deny the allegations and say there isn’t a clear link between social media use and addiction. They also point to a federal shield law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, that protects them from liability for what their users post online.",

    "fullText": "Each year, Thoughtworks’ Looking Glass report looks beyond individual technologies to examine the forces reshaping how organizations build, run and evolve their technology estates. The aim is not to predict the future, but to help leaders make sense of the changes already underway — and to understand which of them will matter most in practice.\n\nThis year’s trends reflect a moment of transition. Long-running shifts around platforms, data, security and experience design are converging with rapid advances in AI. The result is not a single disruptive technology, but a reconfiguration of how technology creates value across the enterprise. Systems are becoming more adaptive. Interactions more intent-driven. Governance more embedded in day-to-day delivery.\n\nAcross the Looking Glass, we explore what this means in concrete terms: how enterprises are rebuilding their core foundations, rewiring workflows to support greater autonomy and reimagining the role technology plays in customer experience, decision-making and operations. AI features prominently, but always in context — as one of several forces accelerating change, rather than a solution in isolation.\n\nAs ever, this report is grounded in what we see working with clients around the world. It is intended as a practical guide to navigating the year ahead, with a focus on technologies that deliver real, durable value.\n\nRachel Laycock, Chief Technology Officer, Thoughtworks\n\nIn each lens, we present opportunities for implementing technology in your business and signals to gauge how fast something is approaching. We categorize each of the 90+ trends in two dimensions: the prevalence across enterprises — seeing now, beginning to see or on the horizon — and our recommended strategic response — adopt, analyze or anticipate.\n\nYou'll find each of Looking Glass 2026's five lenses below.

    "fullText": "A team of Spanish researchers led by Dr. Mariano Barbacid at the CNIO's Experimental Oncology Group has reported a groundbreaking therapy that completely eradicates pancreatic tumors in animal models. Using a combination of three drugs (one targeting the KRAS oncogene and two others against EGFR and STAT3 proteins) the treatment halted tumor growth entirely without causing side effects. Published in PNAS and presented at Fundación CRIS Contra el Cáncer, the results showed that mice remained tumor-free for over 200 days after treatment.\n\nBarbacid emphasized that this marks the first time a complete, durable response with low toxicity has been achieved in pancreatic cancer models. The approach leverages a rational combination therapy to tackle one of the most aggressive cancers, offering hope for future human applications. Attendees of the presentation included Cristina Domínguez, a pancreatic cancer survivor, who highlighted the urgent need for research, stating that every scientific advance translates into more life for patients.\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the deadliest cancers, with over 10,000 new cases in Spain each year and a five-year survival rate of just 8-10%. The next phase for Barbacid's team involves launching clinical trials, pending regulatory approvals and funding. KRAS inhibitors may be tested in humans as soon as 2026 or 2027, while STAT3 degraders are still in experimental stages.

They have won 18 of their 29 matches so far.\n\nBack-to-back promotions, then, a very real possibility at Penydarren Park.\n\nIn some ways, you might think pure survival is all that really matters given fan-owned Merthyr Town are a phoenix club that rose from the ashes of the old Merthyr Tydfil FC, which went into liquidation in 2010.\n\nNot Merthyr. They're aiming to get back into the fifth tier of the English game for the first time since 1995, when a gradual decline in fortunes saw them relegated from the old Vauxhall Conference and spiral down through the backwaters of the Southern League.\n\nUltimately, the dream is to join the four other Welsh sides who play in the English Football League (EFL) - Wrexham, Swansea City, Cardiff City and Newport County - a level Merthyr have not graced since before World War Two.\n\nBut how realistic is that? And are there any potential investors - or Hollywood film stars - with deep enough pockets to potentially bankroll a Wrexham-type rise?",

    "fullText": "Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), world’s battery manufacturing giant, officially unveiled its Tianxing II light commercial vehicle battery series on January 22, 2026. The highlight of the launch is the low-temperature version, which represents the industry’s first mass-produced sodium-ion battery.\n\nThe 45 kWh sodium-ion battery boasts an energy density of 175Wh/kg and a cycle life exceeding 10,000 cycles. It is the world’s first battery to receive certification under the new GB 38031-2025 national standard and is designed to power small and micro vans and light trucks.\n\nCompared to lithium batteries, this battery has exceptional cold-weather performance. In extreme temperatures as low as -40°C, the battery maintains 90% of its usable capacity. Moreover, it allows for immediate charging even when completely frozen at -30°C, eliminating the winter operation challenges faced by commercial vehicles in cold regions.\n\nSodium is over 1,000 times more abundant in the earth’s crust than lithium, with extraction costs at merely 1/20 of lithium. This cost advantage is expected to reduce battery costs and improve the economic feasibility of light commercial electric vehicles in the long term.\n\nBeyond the low-temperature sodium-ion version, the Tianxing II series includes three additional variants (lithium-ion type):\n\nThe Fast-Charging Version features high-rate charging technology that powers the battery from 20% to 80% in 18 minutes. For standard 100 kWh electric vehicles, a single fast charge can add approximately 150 kilometers of range.\n\nThe Long-Range Version sets a new record for light commercial vehicles with a single-pack capacity of 253 kWh, achieving a maximum range of 800km. This variant is designed primarily for long-distance logistics between cities. When paired with CATL’s Taishan pack architecture, it reduces vehicle weight by approximately 260kg compared to batteries with equivalent capacity, increasing effective payload while reducing energy consumption.\n\nThe High-Temperature Fast-Charging Version targets last-mile delivery and self-owned vehicle operations, particularly in southern high-temperature regions. Equipped with a customized liquid cooling thermal management system, it maintains stable fast-charging performance and battery life in high-temperature environments. This version balances high reliability with low operating costs, making it suitable for short-distance, high-frequency light commercial scenarios such as supermarket deliveries and community distribution.\n\nTianxing is a battery brand for commercial vehicles, launched by CATL in July 2024.",

    "description": "Unpacking the mysteries of the rare Triadex Muse from the early 1970s, the first algorithm-based sequencer/synthesizer intended for home consumers.",
    "fullText": "Strolling around the Computer History Museum, there are exhibits that are immediately recognizable. All we need is a glimpse of the Altair 8800 or Apple I, and we just… know. We walk over and stand in front of these pieces, instinctively lowering our voices and giving a quiet nod to anyone nearby. Like noticing the chisel marks on a marble statue or the brushstrokes on an oil painting, we’re struck by the realization that what we’re seeing is the result of human imagination and ingenuity. What was once abstract and almost mythical is there right in front of us.\n\nHowever, there are also items on display at the Computer History Museum whose significance isn’t immediately apparent. Take the Triadex Muse. You might mistake this wedge of metal, switches, and wood panels for an obsolete piece of stereo equipment or a Cold War-era intercom.\n\nWhile it looks like something you’d find on some forgotten warehouse shelf, the Triadex Muse is an important piece of electronic music history. Developed by Edward Fredkin and Marvin Minsky at MIT in 1969, and commercially released in the early 1970s, it was the first algorithm-based sequencer/synthesizer intended for home consumers. It’s estimated that there were only 280 – 300 produced, making it a rare piece of gear.\n\nYou won’t find a friendly and familiar set of piano keys. The only controls are an orderly series of sliders. Its industrial design has \n\nThe beauty of the Triadex Muse is in its simplicity. There’s no memory, no CPU, and no firmware. Just integrated circuits and electricity. Unlike the 1959 IBM 7090 mainframe computer, which was fed programming instructions via paper punch cards in coaxing out such party hits like Frère Jacques on the 1962 album Music from Mathematics, the only user input here is positioning sliders and flipping a couple switches.\n\nIf you were to randomly move the sliders to different positions and fire up the Triadex Muse, you’d likely hear the chirp of a square wave melody from its internal speaker and see a vertical band of blue and green lights twinkling in time. You might think that the Triadex Muse is like a modern step sequencer or drum machine. Orderly and predictable. This is 1972. Forget it.\n\nYou wouldn’t be wrong that the blinking lights correspond to a beat. At each tick of the Muse’s internal clock, this single column of lights shows the complete state of zeroes and ones. The Muse is essentially a 40 x 8 matrix, with zeroes and ones evaluated at each “tick” of its internal clock, triggering sounds, and with each state potentially changing what happens next.\n\nWhile anyone with a background in computer science would know what these lamps represent, the average home consumer would have no idea. These glittering lights further add to its sense of mystery. Although you do get some control over the Muse’s output, you can’t play it like a regular instrument. Even the owner’s manual admits that, “The Muse isn’t a music box.” Depending on how you set the sliders, it’s unlikely you’re going to come up with a tune you can hum along with while you wash the dishes.\n\nWhile the Muse may sound like a robotic run-on sentence, it speaks in the familiar language of musical intervals.\n\nThe INTERVAL block has four sliders that select notes from the major scale. The positions of A, B, and C determine the pitch, while D adds an octave. There are no flatted thirds or minor scales. You can't play the blues. Though you might want to if you once owned the Triadex Muse and look up how much they’re currently going for—$$$.\n\nThe four INTERVAL switches, like much of the Muse, are deceptively straightforward. You might flip several to the same row and think you’ll hear a chord. Once again the Muse doesn’t follow modern conventions.\n\nThe Muse isn’t polyphonic. There is no harmony or overtones. This is binary arithmetic. Each interval is a weighted four-digit binary number. When summed they generate a 4-bit number that determines a new pitch. Music from mathematics… indeed.\n\nThe Muse’s intervals are triggered when the positions that they’re set to get a one bit from either the C or B section.\n\nIf you were to stare at the blue lights marked C ½ to C6 long enough, along with your friends asking you if you were feeling okay, you’d notice that they follow a set pattern. And if you knew how to count in binary (and let’s face it we know there are some of you out there), you’d see that the lamps C1, C2, C4, and C8 form a four-bit counter, cycling from 1 (0001) to 15 (1111) in a continuous loop. C ½ is simply the clock itself, a square wave that turns on and off at a rate linked to the tempo. C3 and C6 form a separate two-bit counter that increments every three cycles. By setting groups of threes against fours adds variety to the sequence.\n\nIn most instances, if you set the INTERVALS only to C positions, you’d get repeating patterns of tones about as musically exciting as the 1978 memory game Simon (no offense to Simon, which you can also see on display at the CHM).\n\nThe B region is where the Muse becomes more than a repeating blooper of bleeps, but a generator of pseudo-random chaos. You might observe the flickering green lights occupying B1 – B31, and just when you’ve identified a pattern, the sequence feeds back and morphs into something new.\n\nTo understand what’s happening, first you need to know what the four THEME sliders actually do. If you think that flipping these will give you a familiar musical preset like rock, jazz, or a rumba, the Muse once again betrays you.\n\nEach THEME slider is technically a “tap.” A tap is like a tiny beacon, monitoring the binary state of a specific point in the C or B region, and sending that off to an XNOR logic gate.\n\nI know. This sounds complex. But understanding the B register is like finding the answer to a riddle. Once you see it, it’s oh-so-obvious.\n\nAt every click, the XNOR (Exclusive NOR) logic gate makes a decision based on what it receives from the taps. If the gate receives an even number of ones (including all zeroes), it sends a one to B1. If the number of ones is odd, it sends a zero to B1. In its default state, B1 – B31 will be a band of green.\n\nEvery decision the Muse makes lurches forward, sometimes syncing up as the same conditions persist, and then suddenly shifting when the inputs change. B1 – B31 is what is known as a Linear Shift Register, an ever-evolving bucket brigade of bits, where a new zero or one is handed to the top, while the bottom bit falls out.\n\nThe Triadex Muse is a dead-end in the history of electronic music. While one could daisy chain it to other Muses, it used a proprietary I/O. There are no control voltages you could patch into modular synthesizers. And MIDI was a decade away. Its entire ecosystem was The Triadex Muse itself, an external speaker, and if the march of blue and green squares wasn’t enough visual stimulation, you could also buy a light unit with Gaussian-like blurs of psychedelic colors flowing with the beat.\n\nLike DNA from extinct species whose fragments persist in modern organisms, the Muse’s influence lives on in algorithmic composition.\n\nIn a 2001 interview, Sean Booth of Autechre, pioneers of generative electronic music said about their process that, “There’s absolutely nothing random about what we do. There might be a lot of number crunching going on, but there’s nothing random in there.”\n\nThis is exactly what the Muse was doing in 1972.\n\nMarvin Minsky, the co-creator of the Muse, said in his 1981 paper “Music, Mind, and Meaning” that the challenge of composing music is that, “Whatever the intent, control is required or novelty will turn to nonsense.” This philosophy is hardwired into the Muse.\n\nThe melodies of the Muse could sound familiar. Or even strange. But its output still sounds like music, with underlying rules and logic that our brains detect as patterns, even though the Muse makes it almost impossible to predict what it will play next.",

    "fullText": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A Republican opponent is challenging U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s eligibility to run for governor of Alabama, accusing the football coach-turned-politician of not meeting the legal requirement to have lived in the state for seven years.\n\nKen McFeeters, who is running against Tuberville for the Republican nomination for governor, filed the challenge Tuesday with the Alabama Republican Party. McFeeters in a phone interview said he believes Tuberville lives in a multimillion-dollar beach home in Florida instead of a smaller home that he has listed as his residence in Auburn, Alabama.\n\nProperty tax records show the former Auburn University football coach has a home in Auburn, Alabama ,with an appraised value of $291,780 on which he claims a homestead exemption. He also has a beach home in Walton County, Florida with an estimated market value of $5.5 million, according to property records.\n\nThe Auburn house was initially purchased by Tuberville’s wife and son in 2017. The senator's name was later added to the property, and the son's name removed. Both the Auburn and Florida homes appear to have recently been put in a revocable trust with Tuberville's wife as trustee.\n\n“It’s belittling to the average person in Alabama for him to think we believe that he’s being sincere when he says he lives at his son’s $300,000 house when he’s got a $6 million beach house. Where would you live?” McFeeters said.\n\nMcFeeters wrote in his letter to party officials that the available records, “if accurate, strongly suggest that Auburn may have been used as an address of convenience rather than as a true domicile.” McFeeters said Tuberville’s travel records also show frequent travel to the Florida Panhandle, which he said buttresses the idea that he resides in the location.\n\nMallory Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, called the challenge a “ridiculous PR stunt from a desperate candidate.”\n\n“Senator Tuberville has proudly represented Alabama in the United States Senate for the past six years. This made-up narrative didn’t work when he was running for Senate in 2019, and it certainly isn’t going to work now,” Jaspers wrote in an email. Jaspers said the Auburn home remains the senator’s primary residence.\n\nTuberville faced similar accusations in his Senate campaign. Opponents called him “Florida man” or a “tourist in Alabama.” The Senate has a less stringent residency requirement before taking office.\n\nTuberville told The Associated Press earlier this month that he believes he meets the residency requirement.\n\n“We checked it out. I wouldn’t be doing this if I thought it was a problem,” Tuberville said. Tuberville said it will be up to the Republican Party to decide any challenge, but “what I’ve heard from them, they feel good about it.”\n\nTuberville was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He then coached at Texas Tech and the University of Cincinnati. He went to work for ESPN after retiring from coaching. In a 2017 promotional video for ESPN, he talked about moving to Florida after retiring from coaching.\n\nTuberville voted in Florida in 2018. He registered to vote in Alabama on March 28, 2019, about two weeks before announcing his run for Senate.\n\nJeannie Burniston, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Republican Party, said challenges are heard and decided by the party’s 21-member steering committee. Burniston said the committee will decide if there is enough evidence for a challenge to proceed to a hearing where both sides present evidence. Burniston said she cannot comment on challenges.\n\nThe awkwardly worded requirement in the Alabama Constitution says the governor and lieutenant governor “shall have been citizens of the United States ten years and resident citizens of this state at least seven years next before the date of their election.”\n\nMcFeeters said it is important that the Republican Party take the matter seriously. He said Tuberville should be asked to provide clear evidence that he has lived in Alabama for seven consecutive years.\n\nSusan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, said the language of the residency requirement is vague. She said it could be interpreted to be seven consecutive years or it could be seven years broken up by periods living elsewhere. But she said Alabama’s culture and history supports the argument that it should be seven consecutive years.\n\n“Alabama’s culture is suspicious of outsiders and historically most of Alabama’s governors were born and raised in the state, often having been descended from generations of Alabamians,” Hamill wrote in an email. Her comments were first reported by the Alabama Reflector.",

    "fullText": "Chery has launched its first battery electric pickup in China under its Rely pickup brand, with pricing starting at 127,800 yuan, about $18,300, and running up to 158,800 yuan for higher trims. \n\nThe truck is positioned as a work-ready electric option with mainstream sizing, multiple drivetrains, and a tech-heavy cabin, arriving as new energy pickups become one of the fastest-growing niches in China.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nEarly reports describe the Rely R08 EV as a body-on-frame pickup offered in six variants. Dimensions are listed at 5,330 mm long, 1,920 mm wide, and 1,890 mm tall, with a 3,230 mm wheelbase, putting it in the midsize-to-fullsize zone by global standards.\n\nPowertrain choices include a single-motor rear-wheel-drive model and a dual-motor all-wheel-drive model, with outputs cited at 150 kW for RWD and 300 kW for AWD. Range is reported at up to 510 km on the CLTC cycle depending on trim, which is the figure Chinese brands typically use for domestic marketing and it generally reads higher than EPA-style numbers.\n\nView the 2 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nThe R08 EV is also being pitched as modern inside, with reports citing an infotainment setup using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 chip in some versions. Driver assistance is described as Level 2 capable depending on trim, with commonly listed features such as adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, and automatic emergency braking. \n\nThis is the typical spec mix for value-focused Chinese EVs, where the headline is less about a single breakthrough feature and more about offering a complete equipment list at a low entry price.\n\nPickups are still a smaller segment in China than in North America, with 2025 pickup sales cited at about 589,000 units. What is changing quickly is electrification, with new energy pickup volume cited at roughly 73,000 units in 2025, up about 243 percent year over year, which helps explain why Chery is moving into the category now. \n\nA base price around $18,300 is part of that strategy, because it creates a lower barrier for buyers who want a truck shape for utility but have been priced out of many electric offerings. Chery’s wider EV messaging continues to lean into future battery narratives. It also fits a product portfolio that mixes mainstream launches with attention-grabbing ideas, and off-road EV projects.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed President Donald Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis.\n\nThe man arrested for Tuesday's attack has posted online in support of the Republican president.\n\n“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said during a press conference. Asked if she was nervous about appearing in public, she said, “Fear and intimidation doesn't work on me.”\n\nThe attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nOmar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. After she was elected seven years ago, Trump said she should “go back” to her country. He recently described her as “garbage” and said she should be investigated. During a speech in Iowa on Tuesday, shortly before Omar was attacked, he said immigrants need to be proud of the United States — “not like Ilhan Omar.”\n\n“It’s hard not to see the link between what happened and the attacks Trump has made against Omar personally, not to mention his siege of her city,” said Jeremy Slevin, who worked for years as a spokesperson for Omar before becoming a senior advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Trump baselessly accused Omar of staging the attack.\n\n“She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” he told ABC News.\n\nThe attack on Omar was a reminder of the country's threatening political climate, which has led some lawmakers to limit public events or not seek reelection.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said that she knows how Omar was feeling because an armed man showed up at her Seattle home in 2022, threatening her and her husband.\n\n“It has to stop. I mean, we are just trying to do our jobs, and, it could be quieted and could be called out by Trump and leaders in elected office who refuse to go along with it, but they continue to do it, and this is the consequence,” Jayapal told the Associated Press.\n\nThe suspect has supported Trump\n\nThe man accused of squirting the substance on Omar has a criminal history and has made online posts supportive of the Republican president.\n\nAnthony Kazmierczak, 55, was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence and has had numerous traffic citations, Minnesota court records show. There are also indications he has had significant financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings.\n\nPolice say Kazmierczak used a syringe to squirt liquid on Omar during Tuesday's event after she called for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the firing or impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Officers immediately tackled and arrested Kazmierczak.\n\nKazmierczak hadn’t been formally charged or scheduled for an initial court appearance as of Wednesday afternoon. Daniel Borgertpoepping, spokesman for Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, said they had still not received the results of the police investigation. A statement from the Minneapolis Police Department said the FBI was now leading the investigation.\n\nIt's unclear if Kazmierczak had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. The county's chief public defender, Michael Berger, said the case hasn't been assigned to his office.\n\nIn social media posts, Kazmierczak criticized former President Joe Biden and referred to Democrats as “angry and liars.” Trump “wants the US is stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. “Stop other countries from stealing from us.”\n\nIn another post, Kazmierczak asked, “When will descendants of slaves pay restitution to Union soldiers’ families for freeing them/dying for them, and not sending them back to Africa?”\n\nA target of Trump from the start\n\nOmar's safety has been an issue for years. After Trump's initial round of social media attacks during her first year in Congress, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Capitol Police to conduct a security review. Omar said six officers provided around-the-clock protection for her and her family.\n\nIn 2021, Omar played an audio of a death threat she received by phone during a press conference. The caller used racist and anti-Muslim slurs during in the recording. The congresswoman at the time called on her Republican colleagues to stand up to “anti-Muslim hate” in their ranks.\n\nThe following year, a man was sentenced to three years’ probation by a federal judge on federal hate crime charges after sending an email to Omar threatening to kill her.\n\nTrump stepped up his criticism of Omar in recent months as he turned his focus on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is home to about 84,000 people of Somali descent — nearly a third of the Somalis living in the U.S. And he has linked the Twin Cities immigration crackdown to a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which most of the defendants have roots in the East African country.\n\n“I wouldn’t be where I am at today, having to pay for security, having the government have to think about providing me security, if Donald Trump wasn’t in office and if he wasn’t so obsessed with me,” Omar said Wednesday.\n\nThe attack on Omar came days after a man was arrested in Utah for allegedly punching U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida, in the face at a private party during the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nChristian Joel Young, 28, said “we are going to deport you and your kind” before striking the congressman, according to a probable cause affidavit. He was charged Tuesday in state court with two counts of misdemeanor assault and felony burglary for entering the bar illegally.\n\nA judge ordered him held without bail. Young’s attorney declined to comment.\n\nThreats against members of Congress have increased in recent years, peaking in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol before dipping slightly only to climb again, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\n“Almost all of us receive very regular threats,” said Rep. Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Omar has led the caucus in recent weeks while Casar has been on paternity leave. The congressman described Omar as “tough as nails” and said Trump should curb his rhetoric about her.\n\n“The point of what these violent actors want is for us to shut up and we just can’t give in to that,” Casar said.\n\nBiesecker and Brown reported from Washington. Amiri reported from New York. Associated Press reporters Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City and R.J. Rico in Atlanta contributed.",

Their substitute teacher stood beside them, and then she cuts them off.\n\n“I want to know. I want to know why, when black people are amongst each other, they call each other n****, and when a white person says it, it’s like ‘oh my God’. It’s like an act of something, what is that?” the substitute teacher said.\n\nThat sentence sparked a reaction among students, some throwing their hands in the air.\n\nWipperman said the substitute “engaged in a conversation with racial implications that was not conducive to the classroom environment,” and added, “the substitute is no longer an employee of the Clark County School District.”\n\nTracey Lewis of the Las Vegas Alliance of Black School Educators was made aware of the video.\n\n“Even these kids now are at a point where enough is enough,” Lewis said. “So, I commend the students for them circulating the information, so that the appropriate adults could intervene and help them.”\n\nThis type of incident doesn’t appear new for Centennial High School.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

Despite the loss, which included revenue earned during the National Western Stock Show, Baggao reopened the restaurant later that day.\n\nDenver Police officers responded to a call for a burglary at approximately 9:19 a.m. in the 3100 block of North Federal Boulevard, according to the Denver Police Department. The burglary took place overnight, and the case is under investigation.\n\nThe location also reported burglaries on May 14, 2023, and Aug. 21, 2024, according to police. There was an arrest in the 2024 case, but the 2023 case remains under investigation.\n\n\"Filipinos are especially persistent, and I would just… my mother is an incredibly tenacious person,\" Baggao said, explaining how he found the strength to continue operating.\n\n\"I've been doing stuff on this corner for a long time, and this isn't just your vandal, your average criminal, your person who needs a meal,\" Baggao said.\n\nFor Baggao, the restaurant represents more than a business. As a Filipino American who grew up in New Mexico, he said cooking became his path to exploring his heritage.\n\n\"As a Filipino American growing up in New Mexico with my French-Irish mother and wanted to learn more about my culture for me, the easiest, closest road,\" Baggao said.\n\nThe restaurant serves what Baggao describes as humble, family-oriented food, including dishes like Lechon kawali, a crispy pork belly preparation.\n\n\"If I took you to my grandma's house, this would be the exact same flavors,\" he said.\n\nThe burglary has been particularly difficult for Baggao because he views the community he serves as an extension of his family.\n\n\"It kind of makes me sad cause that's not the community I want to be in. That's the frustrating part,\" he said. \"Whoever did this needs to be brought into that [community] so they don't do this kind of stuff.\"\n\nDespite the emotional toll, Baggao said he is focusing on his restaurant's mission moving forward.\n\n\"Trying to stay in the right place, stay regulated for myself and my team, and stay being a leader,\" he said. \"We solve our problems with food and making people really happy.\"\n\nBaggao said he remains committed to serving the community.\n\n\"I love serving folks in this community, and if I stay focused on that I'll forget about this eventually,\" he said. \"Just grateful for that.\"\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Metro Denver Crime Stoppers at 720-913-7867 or submit a tip online.",

    "description": "Republicans are increasingly concerned that immigration enforcement is becoming a political liability in the upcoming midterm elections after two people were killed by federal agents during President Donald Trump’s crackdown in Minneapolis.  Although few are willing to publicly break with the president, there has been a crescendo of criticism as Republicans nudge the White House to change course.  A looming end-of-week funding deadline has brought the issue to a head in Congress, with Democrats vowing to block Homeland Security funding without significant changes and Republicans struggling to find their footing.",

    "fullText": "Parents, teachers and young people share their views on whether social media restrictions would work in the UK\n\nPressure is mounting on the UK government to introduce a ban on social media for under-16s, after a decisive vote in House of Lords in favour of Australian-style restrictions.\n\nPeers backed a Tory-led amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill by 261 votes to 150, despite the government opposing the move. Ministers are already considering a ban as part of a consultation due to report by the summer and so the Lords amendment is unlikely to pass in the Commons. Starmer is also understood to want to wait until evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December, has been assessed, though the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has urged him to “just get on with it”.\n\nHere parents, teachers and young people share their views.\n\nLaura, a parent from East Dunbartonshire, says the scale of harmful content circulating on social media has left many families feeling powerless. Laura, whose children are nine and 11, supports proposals to restrict children’s access to social media platforms, arguing that current safeguards leave too much exposure to chance.\n\n“Concerns about what my children might see online keep me awake at night,” Laura says. While her own children do not have social media accounts, she says that does little to shield them. “They can see any and all content on their friends’ phones. That includes material which, in any other context, would be completely unacceptable for children.”\n\nLaura has become involved in local campaigning, helping to set up a parent WhatsApp group that later linked into the Smartphone Free Childhood movement. “This can’t be left to individual families,” she says. “It creates a postcode lottery and exacerbates inequalities.”\n\nRachel, a secondary school English teacher in Derbyshire, says the impact of social media on pupils’ emotional wellbeing and concentration is now impossible to ignore. After more than 15 years in the classroom, she believes attention spans among younger students have noticeably deteriorated.\n\n“I see the effect of social media and shrinking attention spans every day,” she says. “It’s getting worse and worse.”\n\nIn the classroom, sustaining focus has become increasingly difficult, with younger pupils struggling “to concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes”, she says, adding that resilience is also lacking. “There’s a lot of giving up before you’ve even started.”\n\nRachel believes the use of social media has become entwined with children’s sense of identity. “It feels like it’s invaded their psyche,” she says.\n\nWhen she mentioned the possibility of restrictions on social media use to a year 7 class, she says the reaction was immediate and emotional. “There was uproar,” she recalls. “I actually thought a couple of them were going to cry.”\n\nJulia*, 20, says having a smartphone as a shy eight-year-old was helpful, but she believes an “overhaul” of social media is needed.\n\n“I’ve never really known a world without a smartphone,” she says. “I was an anxious child, and when I was about 11, I found I could be myself and make friends online. But that doesn’t really help in real-life situations. I think it was a short-term solution for loneliness and confidence.”\n\nFrom the age of 12 to 15, Julia, a student from Stirling, Scotland, says she “somehow found myself on the sexist side on Instagram” with the barrage of such content making her “terrified of making mistakes” and exacerbating her social anxiety.\n\n“It really messed with my sense of self-worth, and I felt I had to be perfect,” she says. “I felt like I had to prove myself, to outdo myself, because at the time, the belief I had was that everybody thought women were less funny or less smart. I only started to come out of that self-hating mindset when I started to make real-life friends at the age of 16 or 17.”\n\nBut she is unconvinced that the proposed social media ban for under-16s is the solution.\n\n“Rather than just focusing on the impact it has on children, there should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone, because in the long run, it would also improve the lives of young people.”\n\nTahnee, an occupational therapist based in Glasgow, says watching children’s lives move increasingly online has left her deeply uneasy. Originally from Australia, she has nieces and nephews in both the UK and Australia and says she has seen how social media can begin to dominate young people’s lives “from the age of 11 or 12, when the first phones arrive”.\n\nTahnee, who has an eight-year-old son, welcomed Australia’s decision to introduce restrictions on children’s social media use.\n\nBut feedback from friends and family back home suggests the reality has been more complicated. “Parents of younger children are really pleased,” she says. “Others were hopeful, but in reality the ban hasn’t been as effective as people hoped.” Enforcement, she adds, has been inconsistent.\n\nShe believes restrictions can nevertheless help parents hold boundaries that are otherwise difficult to maintain. “If your child is the only one in the class without a smartphone or social media, it’s incredibly hard,” she says. “But if it’s 20% or 30%, it suddenly feels much easier to say: actually, we’re not doing this right now.”\n\nAJ, 20, says they “understand the thinking” behind the proposed ban, but believe it is a flawed approach.\n\n“I think it’s a broad-brush solution to a more complex problem,” they say. “It’s been clear to me so far that this conversation is being led by people who did not grow up with this technology, and I am frustrated with the way young people – especially young adults who experienced online childhoods – are being talked about and at, and rarely talked to.”\n\nAJ, who lives in Devon, began using Tumblr from around the age of 12 until 15.\n\n“I still look back on it now as a positive experience,” AJ says. “At that time in my life, I really needed what social media provided me with. I’m autistic, and it’s the first place where I really saw or interacted with, or not even interacted with, but I saw autistic adults, that there’s an autistic community and an autistic movement. These are things that were really formative to me, and I would not have had access to anywhere in my ‘real life’.”\n\nThey are concerned that a blanket ban for under-16s would remove that outlet for some children although they can see how a proposed ban could be used as leverage to pressure social media platforms.\n\n“I absolutely believe that they’ll [the social media platforms] need to be pressured into doing the right thing,” they say.\n\nPhil, a 47-year-old data scientist from Bedfordshire with two children aged 14 and 11, is sceptical that a proposed ban on children using social media will achieve what it promises. While he has little sympathy for tech companies, he is unconvinced the policy tackles the real problem.\n\nIn principle, Phil understands why governments want to intervene. In practice, he says, enforcement would be very difficult. “Existing parental controls can be complex and don’t always work as expected,” he says. “Kids can just download a VPN anyway,” he says, arguing this makes the UK’s Online Safety Act “fundamentally flawed”.\n\nPhil describes himself as “pretty techie” and says he has managed to limit what his children access on their own phones. But he stresses that this only goes so far. He recalls his son being shown a graphic video of the Charlie Kirk shooting by another child at school. “Someone just put it in front of his face,” Phil says. “You can’t control that.”",

    "title": "2026 Fantasy Baseball Top 300 Rankings: Judge and Ohtani lead the way; Skenes and Skubal in Top 10",
    "description": "Michael Harris II, Sal Stewart and Luis Robert Jr. are on the rise in our 5x5 player rankings for 2026.",
    "fullText": "Moving on from the “way too early” rankings, this is the first official edition of the top 300 for 2026. Players are ranked for 5x5 mixed leagues using a one-catcher format. I include the mixed-league disclaimer because I do reward upside, particularly past the top 200 or so.\n\n⚾️ Coming soon: MLB returns to NBC and Peacock in 2026! In addition to becoming the exclusive home of Sunday Night Baseball, NBC Sports will broadcast MLB Sunday Leadoff, “Opening Day” and Labor Day primetime games, the first round of the MLB Draft, the entire Wild Card round of the postseason, and much more.\n\n- Falling off: Grant Taylor (234th), Christian Moore (289th), Troy Johnston (296th)\n\n- Just a little update here, and it's mostly because I wanted to make my new feelings known about MacKenzie Gore after last week's trade. Gore was my No. 85 SP before getting sent to the Rangers, leaving him about 10 spots off the original top 300, but that was largely because I have the Nationals as the second worst situation for pitchers in the league. Dealing with poor defense and especially poor catching, Nationals pitchers have had ERA far in excess of their FIPs the last two years (4.72 FIP, 5.35 ERA season), and their bullpen figures to be especially poor this year.\n\nI'm not quite as sure what to make about the situation in Texas, largely because Globe Life Field has been all over the map; it had one of the best park factors for hitters in 2023, only to play as a significant pitchers' park in 2024 and an extreme one in 2025. It's been especially tough on right-handed power the last two years. Maybe that won't keep up, but if it does, it's especially great for a left-handed flyball pitcher like Gore. As a result, I have Gore all of the way up to 35th among SPs now, and he checks in at No. 135 overall here.\n\n- The other significant change is Seranthony Domínguez going from 26th to 21st among RPs after signing on to close for the White Sox. Grant Taylor fell from 23rd to 28th, leaving him just off the list. I wasn't projecting him for many saves in the first place, but this does take away some of his upside. I still think he'll be fantastic in a multi-inning setup role.\n\n- Moore and Johnston lost some playing time in my projections with the Angels re-signing Yoán Moncada and the Rockies acquiring Edouard Julien. Julien could play second for Colorado, but he's a liability there. I have him slightly outhitting Johnston, though his limited home run and steal potential keeps him off the list.\n\n- Harrison Bader didn't make the top 300 while he was still a free agent, and though he'll obviously be a regular in San Francisco, he's further away now after joining the Giants.\n\n- Having Michael Harris II ranked 30th overall isn’t something I saw coming when I started doing my projections. I’ve been just as disappointed by his lack of progress as everyone else; his OPS has gone from .853 in his rookie season to .808, .722 and .678 the last three years. And yet I found so much more to be encouraged about than I thought I would, enough to think that he’s quite a bit more likely to duplicate his second half of 2025 (.299/.315/.430, 14 HR) than his first half (.210/.234/.317). He scores this highly for me even though, because I have him batting seventh, he’s projected for the second fewest plate appearances of anyone in my top 50 hitters (only Jazz Chisholm Jr. has fewer). If he gets off to a nice start and finds himself moving up the Braves lineup, I think the potential is there for him to be the steal of the year.\n\n- Sal Stewart’s placement here at No. 57 is another one that’ll raise eyebrows. I’m actually rather disappointed the Reds traded Gavin Lux, since that should help Stewart’s ADP some. Really, though, I wasn’t worried about Lux or anyone else being in Stewart’s way, no matter how hesitant Terry Francona was to use him last September. Stewart just hammers the baseball in a way that separates him from everyone else on the Reds roster, save Elly De La Cruz. He’ll bat lower in the order initially, but he could quickly settle into the cleanup spot. There’s no reason he can’t make a run at 100 RBI, and his value would only increase if the Reds get him some extra position eligibility by playing him at third or second.\n\n- Luis Robert Jr. moved up about 15 spots to No. 74 with Tuesday's trade to the Mets. Citi Field is a little bit of an upgrade for him in the ballpark department, and he's certainly in a better lineup now, even if the trade means he's more likely to spend most of the year batting in the bottom half of the order. On the plus side, that will free him up to continue stealing bases.\n\n- Neither the Robert addition nor the Bo Bichette signing did anything for one of my favorite picks this year, Brett Baty. Still, I'm keeping the faith. Baty is athletic enough to handle left field, and even if Carson Benge emerges there, I'd still take Baty over Mark Vientos as a DH against right-handers. Baty showed 25-homer power last season, and his contract rates are a little better than his strikeout percentages suggest. If he can get the ball into the air with a little more frequency this year, he should bust out.\n\n- On the White Sox side of things, Lenyn Sosa (No. 219) and Brooks Baldwin (no. 268) both moved up with Robert out of the mix. Luisangel Acuña seems poised for a shot to replace Robert in center, but while he could steal 40 bags as an everyday guy, I think his bat will probably force him into a utility role. Sosa isn't necessarily a good regular for a major league team, either, given his middling defense and atrocious walk rate, but he hit 22 homers last season and managed a solid .264 average in the process. He ought to be the White Sox's primary DH. Baldwin seems like an unexciting, jack-of-all-trades sort, but his EV numbers took a nice jump last year and he's gone 9-for-9 stealing bases in 136 big-league games. He could be a sneaky 15 HR/15 SB guy if he's in the lineup most of the time.\n\n- I was already lower than most on Freddy Peralta for this season, and the trade to the Mets didn't help, dropping him from 27th to 35th among starting pitchers. Still, it would have been considerably worse if the Mets hadn't upgraded their defense this winter. The Brewers are just so strong there and, aided by their ballpark, make their hurlers appear better than they actually are; their pitchers have a league-low .274 BABIP over the last three years, with Peralta himself coming in at .265.\n\n- There are still only 27 relievers in the top 300, though that number will swell as closing situations start to clear up a little this spring. The unrepresented teams are the Athletics, Diamondbacks, Nationals, Rangers, Rockies and Twins, while the Brewers and Astros each have two relievers on the list. Also present is free agent Serathony Domínguez, who I suspect will wind up closing for one of those unrepresented teams (or maybe the White Sox). The relievers on those clubs closest to making the list were Arizona's Kevin Ginkel (34th among RPs), the Athletics' Mark Leiter Jr. (37th), the Twins' Cole Sands (42nd) and the Rockies' Victor Vodnik (47th).",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich goalkeeper Jonas Urbig was named Man of the Match for his starring role in the team’s 2-1 victory over PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.\n\nAfterward, Urbig said that this is the kind of team that is adaptable enough to win against any kind of team.\n\n“The key to this win was that we kept going and engaged in every challenge, fighting for the second balls. That’s so important in games like this because it keeps the pressure on the opponent. The substitutions towards the end allowed us to bring in fresh legs and exploit the spaces that opened up. Whether it’s against a technically strong team like PSG or Chelsea – we can hold our own and win games – or when we go for the second balls like we did today. That’s what sets us apart, our flexibility, and we’re looking forward to the upcoming opponents,” said Urbig (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nBayern Munich has proven its mettle against many teams already this season, but the hardest parts of this season are still to come. Will that flexibility allow the Bavarians to make a deep run in the Champions League?\n\nRight now, it sure seems like it, but Bayern Munich will have to prove it.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "title": "Pep Guardiola and Man City are through to the last-16 – but they have Jose Mourinho to thank",
    "description": "Manchester City 2-0 Galatasaray: Doku set up both goals as Pep Guardiola’s men scraped into the last-16, helped by Jose Mourinho’s Benfica beating Real Madrid",
    "fullText": "The days when Pep Guardiola’s rivalry with Jose Mourinho was toxic are long gone. They may never clash again. But for a few minutes, they were linked again. A grateful Guardiola, who cursed his old enemy in the past, said he would send the Portuguese a message to thank him. It was Mourinho’s Benfica who spared Manchester City a return ticket to the Champions League’s knockout play-offs. Some of the cheers at the Etihad Stadium came long after the City players had left the pitch. They greeted Benfica’s fourth goal against Real Madrid; scored, improbably, by goalkeeper Antoliy Trubin. The 15-time European champions were down to nine men, condemned to ninth place by defeat.\n\nThe manner of it bemused the City team, by then watching in the dressing room, waiting as their fate was determined. “We didn’t know Benfica needed a goal to qualify so when the goalkeeper goes up, we say, ‘why you go?’ because Madrid can equalise and we are out,” smiled Guardiola. “But it was a good strategy for Jose.\" And a good outcome for Guardiola.\n\nCity had kicked off in 11th and climbed as high as fifth at one stage in the night. They eventually clung on to eighth. They may yet rue not finishing higher, and the points they dropped in the north of Norway. Theirs could be the toughest of last-16 ties. They at least take the direct route there, albeit in an unorthodox way: victorious in the Bernabeu and losing in the Arctic Circle. But beating Real ultimately had more significance than being beaten by Bodo/Glimt.\n\nThey remedied some of the damage done there. City were professional, their triumph emphatic, albeit aided by Galatasaray’s insipidness. City needed to win and for three other results to go their way; two, given that Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle were playing each other. City entered the top eight inside eight minutes and without scoring and went two ahead inside half an hour. And yet their ending was nervy. “With a bit of drama, we did it,” said captain Bernardo Silva.\n\nTheir reward is a rest. Jeremy Doku had spoken of the importance of giving City a couple of midweeks off in February. He then ensured their fixture list will be emptier until March. “A big miss,” said Guardiola. The Belgian limped off before half-time. Until then, he had been electric, setting up two goals. He has added precision to his pace, the ability to pick a pass to his capacity for solo runs.\n\nDoku’s injury was one of the few blights on City’s night. Erling Haaland got back on the goal trail, with a first in open play in 10 games. Rayan Cherki offered further evidence of why he looks such an astute signing, with a third in the Champions League this season.\n\nThere were encouraging performances across the pitch. With Rodri suspended, Nico O’Reilly deputised, drew a fine save with a thunderbolt and provided a comparison with City’s Champions League-winning skipper. Ilkay Gundogan made his first return to the Etihad Stadium, granted the captain’s armband by Galatasaray and a standing ovation by many City fans when he went off; but he had looked ineffectual and off the pace.\n\nWith O’Reilly in midfield, Rayan Ait-Nouri got a rare start at left-back and flourished going forward while defensively he was not troubled by another City old boy; Leroy Sane was anonymous. A successor, in Doku, was altogether brighter.\n\nHaaland ended his drought with a delicate dink over Ugurcan Cakir. “A fantastic, fantastic goal,” said Guardiola. It stemmed from a defence-splitting pass from Doku, showing he is much more than just an irrepressible dribbler. The winger was playing as one of City’s No 10s in a 4-2-2-2 formation and this was a playmaker’s pass.\n\nHaaland could have got on the scoresheet even sooner, flying in to head Ait-Nouri’s lovely cross wide. “I love a lot that he misses one clear [chance] and after that [he has] the composure to make his incredible touch,” said Guardiola. For Haaland, it was a 56th Champions League goal in as many games.\n\nFor Doku, there was soon a second assist of the evening as he teed up Cherki to drive in a shot. Tellingly, Gundogan afforded one of his replacements too much space to shoot. City could have scored more thereafter – and perhaps would have done had Doku stayed on, with Phil Foden struggling as his replacement – but Omar Marmoush directed a shot straight at Cakir.\n\nThen Guardiola brought on Nico Gonzalez for a first appearance in three weeks. It helped that there was little prospect of a comeback. Victor Osimhen directed two shots at Gianluigi Donnarumma but the abiding image of his night was when he seemed through on goal and was instead dispossessed by Matheus Nunes.\n\nCity had a second-string defence, but they were rarely troubled. Galatasaray had beaten Liverpool but produced a limp performance, lacking in intensity and intent. They have an eclectic assortment of results; given their talent and cost, they could have finished higher than 20th. City, though, could look down on Real, Internazionale and PSG in the table. “Considering how many top, top teams are out of the top eight, I know how difficult it is,” said Guardiola. And yet the destination may be the same.\n\nHis side met Real in the play-offs last year. They could meet them yet again; but at least it would be in the last 16.",

    "fullText": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Bo Nix insists he'll be the same dual-threat quarterback he was before breaking his right ankle in the playoffs and missing the AFC championship game.\n\nThe Denver Broncos signal-caller said a simple misstep led to a clean break and required a straightforward fix.\n\nHe said the injury was “nothing that concerns me, nothing that scares me going forward like I'm injury-prone or anything. This is one of those just inconvenient football plays and I'm excited already to get back to work. I can't necessarily avoid anything in the future, but I feel really good that my body's going to be in good shape.”\n\nSpeaking on a conference call Wednesday, Nix said he was going to take some time off anyway after the season, so his recovery and rehab over the next several weeks won’t necessarily impede his offseason training.\n\nNix also clarified two things about his injury. He said it was independent of previous ankle issues he dealt with in high school and college; and he said what made his injury inevitable wasn't a predisposition — as coach Sean Payton described it a day earlier — but a developing stress fracture that gave way to a full break.\n\nDurability has never been an issue with Nix.\n\n“I'd probably say four years, probably over 60 games straight of me getting to play and not missing games,” Nix said. “So, I don't really worry about the durability. Honestly, with a simple break like this I'll feel as good as new, won't have any hiccups even getting back going with training.\n\n“I was going to give myself some time off anyway and this sort of makes me take that time off work, won't be able to scratch the itch and get back out there too early,” Nix added. “This will slow me down, make sure I'm taking my rest. ... I'm still going to be running around.”\n\nIndeed, Nix was cruising around team headquarters this week on his medical scooter so he could say his goodbyes to teammates and coaches.\n\nNix said the injury “won't affect my training, won't affect my season next year. If anything, it'll just allow me to go out there and play more free knowing hey, there's nothing you can do about” freak injuries.\n\nBackup Jarrett Stidham replaced Nix on Sunday and he committed a series of blunders, including a fumble at his own 12 that led to the Patriots' only touchdown and helped New England advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nSitting out the game “was terrible,” Nix said. “It was very helpless. Wasn’t much I could do about it. It’s tough to see when you go down, the show just keeps right on going. I think that’s the toughest part. ... It was a bummer. It was tough. It was a tough week.”\n\nNix watched the game from a suite at Empower Field at Mile High after returning from Birmingham, Alabama, where Dr. Norman E. Waldrop III, a foot and ankle specialist at the Andrews Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center, operated on his ankle.\n\nHe called the operation “a very quick procedure, very easy operation, just a simple bone break. Got that fixed up. Great surgeon. Great care. And just right back on my road to recovery, a typical bone break, four to six weeks, I’ll be back training.”\n\nIn his first public comments since getting hurt, Nix also said he didn't realize the extent of his injury right away. Before going for X-rays, he was celebrating Denver's 33-30 win on Wil Lutz's field goal to cap a drive fueled by Ja'Quan McMillian's interception of Josh Allen's deep pass.\n\nNix said he was crushed to learn his season was over.\n\n“You go that long and you play that many games and you have that big of a season and then it kind of comes to and end abruptly like that, it stinks,” Nix said.\n\nBut, he added, “my sights are already on nest year and how I can be better and lead this team better and play better. I'm just excited for the offseason work and to get back to the physical part of training.”\n\nNix has led the Broncos to back-to-back playoff appearances and tied Russell Wilson's NFL record with 24 regular-season wins in his first two years.\n\nHis early success has made his position coach, former NFL QB Davis Webb, who just turned 31, a hot coaching candidate. Webb has interviewed for the Las Vegas Raiders' head coaching job. Should he stay in Denver, there's speculation he'll get a bigger role, maybe even taking over play-calling duties from Sean Payton, who fired his longtime right-hand man and offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi on Tuesday.\n\n“Davis is a tremendous coach,” Nix said. “He really knows how to communicate with his players. ... I think highly of him. I know he's a really good football coach and I know he's got a lot in store for him in the future.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid have fallen to defeat in their final league phase match of the Champions League, with Bodo/Glimt coming from behind to win at the RiyadhAir Metropolitano.\n\nDiego Simeone’s side knew that a win was needed in order for a top 8 spot to be rubber-stamped, and they got off to the best start. Minutes after seeing an effort brilliantly saved by Bodo/Glimt goalkeeper Nikita Haikin, Alexander Sorloth headed in a David Hancko cross to open the scoring.\n\nAtleti had a number of chances to double their lead in the minutes after Sorloth’s goal, with the likes of Alex Baena, Pablo Barrios and Nico Gonzalez all going close. In the end, they were made to pay for their inability to score a second as the visitors equalised when Fredrik Sjovold turned home a cross from Fredrik Andre Bjorkan.\n\nAtleti started the second half well in pursuit of the victory they needed, but it was Bodo/Glimt that scored the third goal of the match. After a mad scramble inside the penalty area, prolific striker Kasper Hogh tapped home to make it 2-1 to the Norwegian side, who were now on course for a play-off place.\n\nSorloth had a good chance to bring Atleti back level with another header, but his effort was straight at Haikin. That was as good as it got for Los Colchoneros, whose failure to win either of their last two league phase matches means they must settle for a place in the Champions League play-off round.\n\nThe result means Atleti end the league phase in 14th place. They will face either Club Brugge or Galatasaray, whom they drew 1-1 with last week, in the play-off round, with the draw to be made by UEFA on Friday afternoon.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are going to the Super Bowl, and contrary to what many of their critics have been saying this year, it wasn’t easy.\n\nWhile their regularseason schedule was historically soft, the Patriots had to go through three top-five defenses in the playoffs. No other team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 has ever done that.\n\nWhat’s more, New England had to win three outdoor games in winter conditions, which got progressively worse throughout January. By the second half of the AFC title game against the Denver Broncos, the Patriots were basically playing in a blizzard.\n\nThe elements, tough defenses and pressure seemed to get to Drake Maye a bit, whose performance suffered in the postseason compared to his MVP-caliber regular season. These were the first true challenges of his career in just his second NFL season and first postseason run, and he was learning the hard way.\n\nDrake Maye: \"It's hard… Good God\"\n\nJosh McDaniels: \"Look at me, it's gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding 6 1/2 minutes of our lives if we can get it done.\" 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nThe vulnerability here… holy moly man. \n\n🎥: @Patriots pic.twitter.com/CyoaTUQpti\n\n— Michael Rodnick (@MJRodnick) January 28, 2026\n\n“Hey, it’s hard,” he told New England’s offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s game as snow rained down on them in Denver.\n\nMcDaniels, who’s in his 19th season with the Patriots coaching staff, is well aware. He’s been part of countless playoff games in tough conditions and is going to his ninth Super Bowl.\n\nFortunately for New England, he was able to help calm Maye down and give him some wise advice.\n\n“I know,” McDaniels said, laughing. “Listen to me. Look at me. It’s gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding six and a half minutes of our lives if we can get it done.”\n\nMaye took those words to heart, buckling down and finishing the job himself. He sealed the Patriots’ 10-7 win by running through the snow for a first down after the two-minute warning, punching their tickets to the Super Bowl.\n\nPatriots Predicted To Add Tight End Coming Off Eight-Touchdown Year",

However, Cooter does not call the plays for the Colts -- Shane Steichen does -- and the Eagles' opening is likely a play-calling role, so this job would be a step up for him in that regard.\n\nWith that said, the NFL views this as a lateral move if it were to happen, so Steichen had to give Cooter the go-ahead to pursue this opportunity, according to SI's Albert Breer.\n\nCooter was on the Eagles' staff in 2021 under current head coach Nick Sirianni.\n\nColts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter interviewed in-person Tuesday for the Eagles OC job, per league source. His first interview was virtual. Former Eagles assistant in the mix.\n\n— Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) January 28, 2026\n\nIn addition to that, before Steichen took over as the Colts' head coach, he was the Eagles' offensive coordinator.

    "description": "The Los Angeles Dodgers stuck to their guns during their negotiations with All-Star outfielder Kyle Tucker, keeping their offer short-term.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers made it clear early in the offseason they weren’t looking to sign Kyle Tucker to a long-term deal, and stuck to their guns during negotiations with the All-Star.\n\nL.A. landed the slugger with a four-year, $240 million deal despite not having the largest sum of money on the table, speaking volumes about the winning culture the Dodgers have created over the past several years.\n\nPresident of baseball operations Andrew Friedman chalked up the decision to stay with a short-term contract cto making sure the team is as good in the future as they are now.\n\n“In the short term, it’s easy to take the core talent we have in place, the nucleus that we have, and say, ‘Anything we can add to that.’ You don’t want to be flippant about what we have right now in this moment in time,” Friedman said to The Athletic. “That being said, we have to try to balance it with three, four, five years out. As the guys that are currently under contract get out … infusing young players over that time is going to be really important for us to be able to maintain.”\n\nThe short-term deal is a smart move from the Dodgers if they want to make additions from their farm system, as Tucker turned 29 earlier this month. L.A. has the oldest position player core in baseball, but can balance it out as some of their older players leave with the league’s best farm system.\n\nTucker was easily the best bat available in free agency and will do wonders for the Dodgers’ offense in the coming season.\n\nThe four-time All-Star plugged the hole L.A. had in the outfield, and as one of the best players in the game, he will surely turn one of the Dodgers’ weaknesses last season into a strength.\n\nMore news: Former Dodgers Top Pitching Prospect on Trade Block\n\nTucker has hit 20 or more home runs in each of the last five seasons, also accruing more than 4.0 bWAR in all of them. His worst season of the bunch came in 2025 — he had 22 home runs and 73 RBIs through 136 games — but he still managed a .841 OPS and played through a hairline fracture in his hand for a couple of months.\n\nWith Tucker bolstering their star-studded lineup, the Dodgers will look to claim their third consecutive World Series title — becoming the third franchise to complete a three-peat.",

    "description": "Five of the eight teams to qualify automatically for the Champions League were from the Premier League, so why have they been so dominant?",
    "fullText": "The Premier League is flexing its muscles in Europe as five English teams finished in the top eight of the Champions League to reach the knockouts.\n\nThat could become six in the last-16 if Newcastle win their two-legged play-off after they finished 12th in the league phase following a 1-1 draw at defending champions PSG on Wednesday.\n\nArsenal finished in first place with Liverpool third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City finishing eighth.\n\nHistory could be made if Newcastle progress through the play-offs as never before have there been six Premier League teams in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"That is dominant,\" said Spurs boss Thomas Frank.\n\n\"I think we all said for a few years the Premier League is the best league in the world and I think this is another sign of it.\"\n\nSo why have Premier League sides been so dominant against Europe's elite?\n\nThe most obvious starting point is the financial power of the Premier League, which significantly outweighs other leagues.\n\nSix Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.\n\nTV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.\n\nLast summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.\n\nTo highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent in the summer window was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.\n\nMore money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big to increase their strength in depth as they finished first in the league phase of the Champions League and sit top of the Premier League.\n\n\"The biggest single reason that the English clubs have been dominant so far is the financial power of the Premier League,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Also, it is about how competitive they have got by fighting it out and being in and around each other - they have pushed each other on.\"\n\nNewcastle forward Anthony Gordon also says a more open style of play in Europe has benefited English teams, while the Premier League is \"more physical than I've ever known it to be\".\n\n\"I think in the Champions League, teams are more open. They all try to play. It's less transitional,\" he added.\n\n\"It [the Premier League] is like a basketball game sometimes, it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's a running game and sometimes it's about duels, whoever wins the duels wins the game. Or moments.\n\n\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game, more football based. Teams come and try and play proper football.\n\n\"In the Premier League, you see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces - it's become a lot slower and more set piece based, I would say.\"\n\nWhen is the Champions League play-off draw and how does it work?\n\nLiverpool top English club in Deloitte Money League\n\nIt is undoubtedly an impressive achievement for five - and potentially six - Premier League teams to reach the knockouts.\n\nBut was the fixture computer kinder for them than other teams?\n\nAt the start of the season, football data statisticians Opta analysed every team's Champions League fixtures and ranked them all to work out who had the kindest draw.\n\nArsenal's fixtures were ranked the third easiest, with Tottenham fourth, Liverpool seventh and Chelsea eighth.\n\nManchester City were deemed to have the 14th easiest fixtures while Newcastle - who played defending champions Paris St-Germain - were 32nd in the rankings.\n\nThe last - and only - time five Premier League teams made it through to the knockouts was in 2017, when Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed.\n\nHowever just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to the final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.\n\nWith five Premier League sides finishing in the top eight of this season's league phase, and therefore avoiding the prospect of facing one another in the last-16, there is the chance of a record number of English teams making the quarter-finals.\n\nHaving numerous English clubs in latter stages of the Champions League is nothing new with four sides progressing to the quarters in both 2007-08 and 2008-09, as well as 2018-19 - leading to an all-English final in 07-08 and 2018-19.\n\nNo other country have ever had four teams in the quarter-finals - this year England could have as many as six.\n\nBut the demands of playing in the Premier League alongside the Champions League takes its toll, which is why many managers were relieved to avoid the two extra play-off games.\n\n\"I still think it will be very difficult for one of them to go on and win it, just because of how difficult the Premier League is every week - whether you are fighting for the title or for a place in the top four,\" Warnock added.\n\n\"Clearly the English clubs are in a good position going into the knockout stages, though. Some of the other big clubs that we thought would peak or start to show better form - like Paris St-Germain for example - have not really got going yet.\"\n\nThe three other countries who had teams join English sides in progressing to the knockouts were Germany (Bayern Munich), Spain (Barcelona) and Portugal (Sporting CP).\n\nThat has left some surprises having to go through via the play-offs, with Paris St-Germain failing to get the win they needed against Newcastle to secure a top-eight spot.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, were on the wrong end of a thrilling and dramatic match with Benfica.\n\nReal were reduced to nine men while a last-second goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin secured a memorable 4-2 win for Jose Mourinho's side that earned them a play-off spot.\n\nOther big sides who are facing the lottery of the play-offs include Italian sides Juventus and Inter Milan, along with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Spain's Atletico Madrid - who were stunned by Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.\n\nThe Norwegians have been the surprise package of the Champions League and their win against Atletico came just eight days after they beat Manchester City.\n\nThose results meant they are into the play-offs and have become the first Norwegian side to progress from the league or group phase in Champions League since Rosenborg in 1996-97.\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

But in the process, he’s not letting go of everyone who has worked under former head coach Mike Tomlin. After taking on the center role, McCarthy has retained three key assistants from Tomlin’s staff. The news comes just as the Steelers inch closer to finding their new defensive coordinator.\n\n“Mike McCarthy is expected to bring back three members of Mike Tomlin’s staff—linebackers coach Scott McCurley, who was on his staff in Dallas; QB coach Tom Arth; and secondary coach Gerald Alexander, per sources,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Gerry Dulac tweeted on X.\n\nThe move allows Mike McCarthy to capitalize on these coaches’ familiarity with the organization and their knowledge of it while shaping the staff in his own way.\n\nMeanwhile, Dulac also reported that the Steelers are close to naming a new defensive coordinator.\n\n“New Steelers coach Mike McCarthy is close to bringing in Patrick Graham as his defensive coordinator, per sources,” he wrote on X. “Graham, 47, was defensive coordinator the past three seasons with the Raiders. He also served in that role with the Dolphins (2019) and Giants (2020-21).”\n\nThe post Mike McCarthy Makes Triple Coaching Staff Decision as Steelers Close In on DC appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles have reportedly completed a second interview with an offensive coordinator candidate on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to NBC Sports Philadelphia’s John Clark, the team hosted Jim Bob Cooter for a second interview. Cooter is the second coordinator candidate known to get a second look from the Eagles throughout this process.\n\nEagles head coach Nick Sirianni has a past with Jim Bob Cooter. The two worked together on the Kansas City Chiefs in 2012. At the time, Cooter was an offensive quality control coach.\n\nSince then, he held positions with the Denver Broncos and the Detroit Lions. In 2014, Cooter was hired to coach quarterbacks in Detroit before getting the bump to offensive coordinator in 2016. He held that position until 2018, when he was hired by the New York Jets to coach running backs.\n\nJim Bob Cooter and Nick Sirianni linked once again in 2021. He wasn’t officially on the coaching staff, but held a position as an independent consultant.\n\n“Obviously, he's got a lot of experience and he's a great football mind. I think very highly of him,” Sirianni told reporters at the time of his reveal.\n\nSince his project with the Eagles, Cooter held a passing game coordinator role with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2022. Then in 2023, he joined former Eagles OC Shane Steichen on the Indianapolis Colts’ staff.\n\nThe Eagles reportedly hosted Sean Mannion for a second interview. The former third-round pick out of Oregon State played for several teams from 2015 to 2023. He joined the Green Bay Packers’ coaching staff, landing a job as an offensive assistant.\n\nLast year, Mannion was bumped to quarterbacks coach. While it’s not clear if Mannion is the favorite in the clubhouse for the Eagles, he’s clearly gaining some steam alongside Jim Bob Cooter as one of the leading candidates to replace Kevin Patullo.\n\nIs Brian Daboll’s decision to pass on Eagles Jalen Hurts’ fault?\n\nDavis Webb news hits Broncos with more obstacles\n\nWho will be the Eagles OC in 2026?

The NFL Draft and free agency will both present option to better the team, and they could be in the market for another pass catcher.\n\nStefon Diggs and Mack Hollins have been great additions, but the Patriots could benefit from adding a weapon who can make plays after the catch. Drake Maye ranked outside of the top 10 in passing yards after the catch, meaning there is room to improve.\n\nYahoo Sports’ Nate Tice predicted the Patriots would draft University of Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq with the 31st pick of the NFL Draft.\n\n“While Sadiq is a tight end, the Patriots need pass catchers, especially ones who can create explosives with the ball in their hands,” Tice wrote on Tuesday. “Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels loves to use tight ends, and Maye has loved throwing the ball to Hunter Henry in his first two seasons. Sadiq would give them a weapon who can turn those screens and underneath routes into big plays. He has the speed and receiving ability to stretch the defense, and also some real grit as a blocker that Mike Vrabel would love.”\n\nSadiq had 560 yards on 51 receptions last season. He scored eight touchdowns as well. In three seasons at Oregon, he had 892 yards and 11 receiving touchdowns. He averaged 11.2 yards per reception in college.\n\nHe led Oregon in receiving touchdowns and was third on the team in receiving yards per game. At 6-foot-3, 245 pounds, he may be undersized for a tight end, but he has tremendous speed and can be a difference maker for the Patriots.\n\nWhat Josh McDaniels Told Drake Maye To Seal Patriots’ AFC Championship",

    "fullText": "Former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Justin Fields could be finding a new NFL home this offseason.\n\nThe New York Jets inked a two-year, $40 million contract with Fields this offseason, but his performance this season was far from stellar. In nine games, he threw for 1,259 yards and only 7 touchdowns.\n\nNew York will likely be looking for a new starting quarterback this offseason, and CBS Sports NFL writer Joel Corry thinks the Jets could move Fields this offseason.\n\n“The Jets signed Fields to a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed as an unrestricted free agent last March in the hopes that he would be more than a bridge quarterback,” Corry wrote on Wednesday. “Fields’ preseason struggles were dismissed rather than seen as a warning sign after he played well against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular season opener.\n\n“It was downhill for the 2021 first-round pick after the Steelers game. Fields had a dubious distinction in a Week 6 loss to the Broncos. He was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. Fields was benched nine games into the season.”\n\nThere’s a possibility that the Steelers could reunite with Fields this offseason, especially if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back. They will be in the market for a quarterback.\n\nMore NFL: Former Steelers Star Placed At No. 2 In ESPN’s Free-Agent Rankings\n\nThe post NFL Writer Suggests Former Steelers Quarterback Might Be Moved This Offseason appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "You'll be hard-pressed to find a large majority of Americans who agree with one another on the same subject in 2026, but the Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub seems to be doing just that – and even the ever-divisive President of the United States is weighing in on the matter.\n\nDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Wednesday to share his thoughts on Belichick after he was snubbed from the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Belichick, a 29-year NFL head-coaching veteran with six Super Bowl rings, was considered a first-ballot selection by most fans. Still, we learned on Tuesday that he did not receive enough votes to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.\n\nTrump is considered a rather controversial figure these days, but his opinion on the matter seemed to be right in line with most of the NFL fanbase as he blasted the decision on social media. He also took shots in the same post at what he describes as the 'sissy' kickoff rule, referring to the new Dynamic Kickoff Rule implemented by the league ahead of the 2024 season.\n\n𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: President Donald Trump went OFF on the NFL voters defending his close friend Bill Belichick should've been a first ballot Hall of Famer.\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the unwatchable 'Sissy' Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill to not… pic.twitter.com/qMwbJcJmCH\n\n— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) January 28, 2026\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the new and unwatchable ‘Sissy’ Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill Belichick to not be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame,” Trump wrote Wednesday. “Both are ridiculous and should be overturned!”\n\nIt is not Trump's first time criticizing moves regarding the NFL and its personnel, calling the new kickoff rule 'ridiculous' in 2025. Recently, Trump announced he wouldn't attend Super Bowl LX in San Francisco because it is \"too far away,\" while blasting the scheduled musical performances by Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts praised his team for their complete buy-in during the 2025 season.\n\nThe Dodgers won their second consecutive World Series title last season, and Roberts says club culture and morale made all the difference.\n\n“Not one time was I questioned on my decision-making [by the players], which in turn would question their commitment to the team,” Roberts said to Jack Harris of the California Post. “They all felt their time was coming. They all felt that their roles were really valued. I don’t think that any head coach or manager can say that.”\n\nThe Dodgers definitely have the stars to compete with the best, but some of the biggest moments of the season came from some of the less expected players on the roster.\n\nMiguel Rojas is the best example of this, as the veteran single-handedly saved the season for L.A. in Game 7 of the World Series with his game-tying home run in the top of the ninth inning.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Fan Favorite Set to Coach in NBA All-Star Celebrity Game\n\nThe general focus and culture of the team isn’t just helping players perform, though. It’s also attracting new faces to the Dodgers. All-Star closer Edwin Diaz revealed his brother Alexis, who played for the Dodgers in 2025, played a role in his move to the NL West.\n\n“I did talk to Alexis a little bit when the conversation was getting more close to sign with the Dodgers. He told me that they are really, really good organization,” Diaz said at his introductory press conference in December. “They treat every player like they are all really good players. And that was something I looked for. You know, he told me great things about the Dodgers and made it easy for me.”\n\nWith the level of belief and the Dodgers ability already, they have themselves set up for another successful campaign in the upcoming season.\n\nThe post Dodgers’ Dave Roberts Credits Team Commitment for Success in 2025 appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "Polian addresses his vote on SiriusXM NFL Radio,",
    "fullText": "The Bill Belichick snub led to another compelling storyline regarding the role of Hall of Fame G.M. Bill Polian in the outcome. A day later, an important point of clarification has emerged.\n\nPolian, after saying he voted for Belichick before saying he can't say with 100 percent certainty whether he did, says he did indeed vote for his former New England nemesis.\n\n“I voted for coach Belichick in the Hall of Fame selection meeting,” Polian said in an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio, after explaining he was reading from a prepared statement. “The Pro Football Hall of Fame has confirmed that fact through the auditors of the selection process. Again, I’ll state that I never said that I believe that Coach Belichick should quote, wait a year, close quote, for enshrinement. This has been confirmed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, numerous selectors who were in the room, and my vote for coach Belichick. As a Hall of Fame member and selector, I realize the import of what we do. I’ve always tried as a selector to make these difficult choices with the utmost of objectivity. I’ve said on SiriusXM Radio and numerous other media outlets that I believe Coach Belichick to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, my vote confirms that.”\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter. Not enough of the voters voted for Belichick. At least 11 of 50 failed to include Belichick among three selections from a group that included Belichick, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and seniors candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig, and L.C. Greenwood.\n\nFrom those five choices, who would be your three? And is there any way Belichick wouldn't be one of them?",

    "description": "Everybody knows the U.S. is fertile ground for trucks, but could a Genesis pickup sell?",
    "fullText": "How much does the United States like pickup trucks? You don’t need me to answer that question. Just look out the window and you’ll see all the reasons a manufacturer might need to build their own. Now, a company like Hyundai or its luxury arm Genesis can’t simply decide to sell a body-on-frame pickup and have the same success as Detroit’s Big Three. But at least one—if not both—of those automakers seems set to release a truck of their own in the near future. Hyundai says it’ll bring such a vehicle to market by 2030, and Genesis has even gone so far as designing one already.\n\nThe chunky rig was featured in a recent issue of Auto&Design, an Italian publication. There’s no mistaking it for anything else, as the grille and parallel headlight elements are distinctly Genesis. Said LEDs wrap all the way around the front fenders and pick back up on the rearmost part of the bedsides. In that way, it’s a lot like the X Gran Equator Concept that Genesis unveiled last spring. This truck actually shares a lot with that wild SUV once you look at them side-by-side.\n\nIt doesn’t have some secretive internal designation, according to the Auto&Design article; it’s simply referred to as “the pickup.” Luc Donckerwolke, chief creative officer and chief brand officer for Genesis, is quoted as saying, “An electric pickup truck? Why not? Then we discarded it because we had to focus on different projects. Maybe in the future, who knows.”\n\nI’m not saying reverse psychology is at play here, but I’ve certainly heard similar talk from auto execs before, only for that very thing to become a reality in the near future.\n\nMy guess is that Genesis did the prep work in case Hyundai has success with its body-on-frame truck and the market seems ready for a more premium version. Aside from it being an unfamiliar name in the pickup segment, I think its biggest blocker would be the electric powertrain. I’m not saying it can’t work, but we’ve seen the EV forecast shift drastically in the past 12 months, and even a company like Rivian only sells a handful of battery-powered pickups compared to its SUVs.\n\nI won’t hold my breath waiting for this to reach production, at least in the next four or five years. Whether or not this ever gets built likely depends on how well the public receives Hyundai’s version. That’ll be interesting to observe on its own, as I’m curious if it’ll have more success than the Santa Cruz. I bet it’ll be good, but whether or not it’ll be enough to capture a piece of the pie from other established players in the space seems a lot less certain.\n\nGot a tip or question for the author?

    "description": "MoltBot shows how powerful local AI agents can be. But if your agent stores in plain-text API keys, webhook tokens, transcripts, and long-term memory in known locations, an infostealer can grab the whole thing in seconds.",
    "fullText": "MoltBot (formerly Clawd Bot), the locally running, open-source AI agent named after the Lobster workflow shell that powers its agentic loop, has rocked an AI community that, just weeks ago, was so in love with its own hype it would have yawned at literal magic.\n\nAnd yet MoltBot, seemingly just a wrapper around a collection of familiar technologies, has put those pieces together in a way that feels like a portal to a future that, a month ago, still felt impossibly distant.\n\nWithin an hour of setting up MoltBot on my Mac, it had already built a fully featured kanban board where I could assign it tasks and track their state.\n\nI have seen other stories that are even wilder. One user shared an anecdote about asking it to make a restaurant reservation, and when it realized it could not do it through OpenTable, it went and got its own AI voice software and just called the restaurant, then secured the reservation over the phone.\n\nIts own author, Peter Steinberger, described joking to MoltBot that he was worried about his laptop getting stolen while he was still developing it in Morocco. MoltBot, ever the terrifyingly efficient pragmatist, immediately started planning its migration to a remote server.\n\nNone of those are pre-programmed routines. They are dynamic behaviors born out of an agentic loop that takes a goal and improvises a plan, grabbing whatever tools it needs to execute. It can apply general world knowledge, specific skills, and near-perfect memory into organized action toward objectives you set, and, more sobering, objectives it decides to set for itself.\n\nStories like these keep pouring in. My feed is full of people buying Mac minis as dedicated devices for their new agentic AI friend. I have also seen multiple posts pointing at Cloudflare’s secure tunneling as the obvious way to access a local setup from anywhere on the internet.\n\nMoltBot is able to give us this preview of the future because it is a tool that, for now, forgoes an essential constraint: security. The project’s FAQ presents the Faustian bargain plainly: “There is no ‘perfectly secure’ setup.”\n\nMoltBot works because it does three simple things better than almost anything else in the agent world right now:\n\nIt keeps persistent memory across sessions.\n\nIt has deep, unapologetic access to your local machine and apps.\n\nIt can take action autonomously in an agentic loop, not just suggest steps.\n\nThat combination is why it feels both a glimpse at the future, but presented as a goal, where between us and the future realized, is a lot of hard work to make it safe.\n\nAt 1Password, we make it easy to take advantage of this future in a way that keeps you secure.\n\nMoltBot’s memory and configuration are not abstract concepts. They are files. They live on disk. They are readable. They are in predictable locations. And they are plain text.\n\nIf an attacker compromises the same machine you run MoltBot on, they do not need to do anything fancy. Modern infostealers scrape common directories and exfiltrate anything that looks like credentials, tokens, session logs, or developer config. If your agent stores in plain-text API keys, webhook tokens, transcripts, and long-term memory in known locations, an infostealer can grab the whole thing in seconds.\n\nAnd what makes this worse than a typical credential leak is the context.\n\nA single stolen API token is bad. Hundreds of stolen tokens and sessions for the critical services in your life is even worse. But a hundred stolen tokens and sessions, plus a long-term memory file that describes who you are, what you’re building, how you write, who you work with, and what you care about, is something else entirely. It’s the raw material needed to phish you, blackmail you, or even fully impersonate you in a way that even your closest friends and family can’t detect.\n\nOne of the smartest things I’ve heard about MoltBot came from a customer who set it up on a dedicated Mac mini with its own email address and its own 1Password account, as if it were a new hire. They first installed it on their main laptop, then got spooked by how much it could touch, so they moved it to a separate machine to control its access and experiment safely.\n\nThis is directionally correct and it’s compatible with how we are thinking about the future of securing AI with 1Password.\n\nThe mistake the industry is making right now is treating agent security like normal app security. A familiar consent screen. A one-time approval. A set of scopes. Then we assume the future behavior will match the intent of that one moment.\n\nThat model breaks the second you hand autonomy to something that is adaptive and non-deterministic by design. The agent changes. The tasks change. The context changes. The approval you gave last week is used in new and unexpected ways today.\n\nSecurity for agents is not about granting access once. It is about continuously mediating access at runtime for every action and request.\n\nThe future we want looks like this:\n\nYour agent has its own identity, like a new hire.\n\nIt gets access through 1Password, not through a pile of long-lived tokens sitting in plain text on disk.\n\nWhen it needs to act, it requests the minimum authority it needs right now.\n\nThat authority is time-bound, revocable, and attributable to the agent, not smeared across the human who originally clicked approve.\n\nYou can answer the only question that matters when something goes wrong: who did what, when?\n\nIn other words, 1Password is not just where secrets live. It is the control plane that governs access. It is the layer that turns agent autonomy into something you can actually trust.\n\nAgents are going to become normal. The only question is whether you choose to make them governable.\n\nThat future does not exist today, but the work to make it real and safe is already underway.\n\n1Password will be the company that makes that possible.",

    "fullText": "Starmer’s team is wary of spies but such fears are not new – with Theresa May once warned to get dressed under a duvet\n\nWhen prime ministers travel to China, heightened security arrangements are a given – as is the quiet game of cat and mouse that takes place behind the scenes as each country tests out each other’s tradecraft and capabilities.\n\nKeir Starmer’s team has been issued with burner phones and fresh sim cards, and is using temporary email addresses, to prevent devices being loaded with spyware or UK government servers being hacked into.\n\nThe employment of such tactics may sound dramatic but they are par for the course in an age of digital espionage and information security. Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.\n\nFor visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.\n\nWhen she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.\n\nConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said. Those with time on their hands would try to find the concealed bugging devices for fun.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown visited China in 2008, an aide was victim of a honey trap. The male aide met a Chinese woman at a lively hotel disco in Shanghai and left with her. The next day, he reported that his BlackBerry phone was missing. He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.\n\nPart of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.\n\nMichael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”\n\nDavid Cameron visited Beijing as prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.\n\nThe practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.\n\nGeneral guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.\n\nWhen James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.\n\nOne of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.\n\nIt can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.\n\n“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.",

    "title": "Oprah Winfrey turned her weight-loss journey into a business. Here's how her health empire has evolved.",
    "description": "Oprah Winfrey's newest book, \"Enough,\" is about her relationship with weight-loss drugs. Since the '90s, she has been combining her health with business.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey has spent years turning her private health journey into a public conversation — and, at times, a lucrative business.\n\nThe billionaire, real-estate mogul, talk-show host, journalist, actor, and producer has just released her 12th book: \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free.\"\n\nThe book, which she co-authored with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, a doctor and professor at Yale's School of Medicine, dives into the role of GLP-1 drugs to facilitate weight loss.\n\nThe practice is something that Winfrey herself has touted. On CNN in December 2024, she said she had first begun using a GLP-1 before Christmas in 2023.\n\nWinfrey has been combining her personal health and fitness with business for decades, including investing in WeightWatchers (now WW International), writing books about health, identifying exercise and health trends for her show and magazine, and putting her support behind figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWinfrey did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of how her health empire has evolved.\n\nDuring a 1988 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" — a few years after Joan Rivers asked about Winfrey's weight gain — Winfrey wheeled out a red wagon filled with 67 pounds of animal fat.\n\nWhy? To convey to her audience how much weight she'd lost in the last year while on the Optifast liquid diet.\n\nThe episode put a spotlight on medically supervised liquid formula diets. After it aired, The New York Times reported that Winfrey got just 400 calories a day from Optifast and wrote that the ability of people on such diets \"to maintain the loss is questionable and not yet fully evaluated.\"\n\nFor a 2005 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Winfrey wrote, \"For four solid months, I didn't eat a single morsel of food,\" and lost 67 pounds. \"What I didn't know was that my metabolism was shot. Two weeks after I returned to real food, I was up 10 pounds.\"\n\nWhile she was proud of losing the weight, Winfrey later regretted the decision to pull the wagon out.\n\n\"When I look at that show, I think it was one of the biggest ego trips of my life,\" Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe cowrote \"Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life\" with exercise physiologist (and her personal trainer) Bob Greene.\n\nThe 10 steps included guidance such as \"exercise 20 to 60 minutes a day,\" \"eat a low-fat, balanced diet,\" and \"eat three meals and two snacks each day.\"\n\nIt went on to become a No. 1 bestseller and is still in circulation.\n\nWinfrey introduced audiences to Phil McGraw, aka Dr. Phil, in the late '90s as her show's resident relationship expert. He proved so popular that Winfrey produced and co-created a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" starring McGraw: \"Dr. Phil.\" It aired from 2002 to 2023, and for most of its run, it was second in ratings only to Winfrey's show.\n\nLike Winfrey, McGraw frequently discussed weight loss and health on his show, and also lent his face and name to nutritional supplements. As The New York Times wrote in 2003, \"Oprah Winfrey has talked about weight loss — hers and everyone else's — for years. Her protégé Dr. Phil has found a way to make money from it.\"\n\nHe's also written his own weight-loss books, including \"The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Freedom\" and \"The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide.\"\n\nWinfrey also introduced Dr. Mehmet Oz to her show's audience. He made his \"Oprah\" debut in 2004 and ultimately appeared more than 60 times, per NPR, before Winfrey greenlit \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in 2009. It aired until 2022, when he began a US Senate campaign in Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Oz's program featured many segments on weight loss, and Oz himself endorsed multiple \"cures\" for obesity that have been disproven. He was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2024.\n\nWhile it's not known how much money Winfrey made from their two shows, both aired for over a decade (with reruns on Winfrey's channel, OWN), and Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, was involved throughout.\n\nWinfrey's own show, which aired for 25 years, was the foundation of her wealth, rocketing her to millionaire status when it became nationally syndicated in 1986. By 2003, she was a billionaire, and she's now worth an estimated $3.2 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2015, Winfrey announced she was joining the board of WeightWatchers (now known as WW International, or WW) and was purchasing a 10% stake in the company worth $43 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that it led to an increase of $400 million in market value for the brand, which had been trending downward before Winfrey's involvement.\n\n\"WeightWatchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" she said in a statement. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nIt's an example of the Oprah Effect: the trend of Winfrey endorsing, supporting, or investing in a brand that leads to a spike in value.\n\nWinfrey posted on X (then Twitter) a video about how she'd lost 26 pounds on WeightWatchers while still eating bread.\n\n\"I love bread,\" she said. \"That's the genius of this program. I lost 26 pounds, and I have eaten bread every single day.\"\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, the subsequent bump in the stock price, just one hour after the post, netted Winfrey around $12 million.\n\nWinfrey's cookbook, which also reached bestseller status, incorporated the WeightWatchers system into its recipes and flagged the number of points each meal was worth, in a neat bit of corporate synergy.\n\nSoon after confirming her use of a GLP-1, Winfrey publicly said she wouldn't be seeking reelection to the board.\n\nThe announcement sent WeightWatchers' stock tumbling 25%. As Business Insider wrote at the time, it seemed like Winfrey was jumping ship from an \"outdated operating system\" in the age of Ozempic and other GLP-1s.\n\nWinfrey's latest book, \"Enough,\" which she cowrote with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, was released in January 2026. It details Winfrey's experience with GLP-1s, combined with Jastreboff's expertise.\n\nWinfrey has been promoting her book heavily, including a stop on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" where she explained how reframing her relationship to obesity and weight has changed her life.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" she said.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see [GLP-1s] as a tool,\" she continued.",

    "fullText": "The International Monetary Fund projects another year of solid global economic growth — but it's also warning not to take the continued upward trajectory for granted.\n\nThe IMF predicts that the global economy will grow 3.3% in 2026, mirroring that 3.3% growth seen in 2025, with 2027 expected to see similar gains.\n\n\"The world economy is resilient but you should not take this resilience for granted,\" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of IMF said at an event on Monday.\n\nAccording to Georgieva, there are four things that are driving up growth, and at least one is being overlooked by observers.\n\nHere's what the IMF sees pushing the world economy higher.\n\nGovernments around the world have let the private sector take the reins. With \"governments put out from running the economy where they don't belong,\" private sector strength supports growth, Georgieva said.\n\nThe economist said in remarks at Davos that governments taking a back seat allows the private sector to be \"more adaptable, more agile, and we see the benefits of it\".\n\nThe global economy's recent growth has been less tied to trade, mitigating the impacts many had feared from Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy.\n\nThe fact that effective tariff rates are below liberation day levels has meant the impact has been significantly less than initially feared.\n\nDespite trade tensions spurred by tariffs, \"we continue to trade for now,\" Georgieva says, adding, \"don't take this for granted.\"\n\nGlobal AI spending reached 1.76 trillion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $3.34 trillion in 2026, according to Gartner.\n\nThe \"massive investment in AI\" has served to boost optimism in the global economy, Georgieva said.\n\nThe IMF economist says one factor that is often forgotten when assessing global economic growth is \"the role of good policies and strong institutions.\"\n\nGeorgieva flagged the role of independent central banks, specifically, in the resilient global economy. She said tht these things are often given little attention but, and as a result, that could \"erode\" that source of strength.\n\nCentral bank independence is a key concern in the US as President Trump's administration pressures Fed chair Jerome Powell. The latest tensions have arisen from a criminal investigation by the DOJ into Powell's testimony about the Fed building renovation.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his criticism of the Fed chair, rattling markets with his threats to fire Powell over the last year.",

    "title": "I went on my first cruise — here are 15 things that surprised me about this type of travel",
    "description": "From room size to food quality, my first-ever cruise on board Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas was full of surprises.",
    "fullText": "The ship has 18 decks and 2,867 staterooms, according to Royal Caribbean.\n\nI booked a mid-tier room — a step above windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below suites.\n\nMy 179-square-foot cabin had a private bathroom, a king-size bed, and an ocean view.\n\nI was surprised by how big the discount was. To me, $1,000 feels like a huge price difference for the same vacation.\n\nI thought the stateroom made great use of a small space with plenty of storage for my clothes and other belongings. There were two closets for hanging space and more drawers than I used.\n\nAfter leaving to start my day each morning, a stateroom attendant cleaned my room. And after I left for dinner each night, they came back to clean up again. Every evening, they brought me fresh towels — sometimes creatively folded — and a flyer featuring the next day's schedule, including the weather, dress code, and any other important information, such as a time change.\n\nThis surprised me because I am used to having my room serviced once daily, if at all, during my hotel stays, and never in Airbnbs.\n\nAn electronic shade over the window could be lowered to reveal grand views. I loved waking up after a night at sea to a front-row view of the place I'd be visiting that day.\n\nWhile windowless rooms are cheaper, I couldn't imagine staying in one. My ocean-view stateroom cost about $300 more than an entry-level room.\n\nI booked a stateroom at the front of deck eight and felt constant motion in my room.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture falling. The first night this happened, I feared the worst, but over time, I realized that this was a normal aspect of cruising — but one I would likely never get used to.\n\nAfter talking to seasoned cruisers on the ship, several told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be for feeling motion. Higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable, they said.\n\nNext time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.\n\nAll I had to do for safety training was watch a couple of videos — either on my room TV or on the Royal Caribbean app — and then check in at my assembly station, the area I was assigned to in case of an emergency. At the assembly station, an attendant checked the Royal Caribbean app to confirm that I had completed the mandatory training.\n\nI was expecting to attend a large safety training session once I got on the ship, so this alternative was a breeze.\n\nSince there were so many elevators on the ship, I expected them to be a pretty efficient way to get around. But they were often so crowded and slow that I took the stairs instead. By the middle of my trip, unless I was going all the way up to the pool decks, I always opted for the stairs to save time.\n\nThe ship has 16 guest decks; each deck is divided into three sections — forward, middle, and aft.\n\nIt took me a few days to get used to the sections, and I often found myself heading to the right deck but the wrong section of the ship. Luckily, there were maps on every floor, which I used until the morning I left.\n\nIf I woke up on deck five of Wonder of the Seas with no memory of my cruise, I'd think I was in a shopping mall.\n\nAside from the slight movement of the ship, the indoor decks were so big that, as a cruise newbie, it was hard to believe that I was on a gigantic boat in the middle of the ocean. Everywhere I looked, I saw shops, stands, restaurants, large sculptures, and a unique ceiling structure that reminded me of the malls I've visited.\n\nAside from music festivals, I've never heard more live music on a trip than on this cruise. On the communal decks, musicians played for hours while people relaxed and played around them. I was also surprised by the eclectic mix of genres I heard, from rock to jazz to classical.\n\nIn addition to the music hall, where concerts were regularly held, live bands performed on indoor and outdoor communal decks. Some people watched, while others listened while swimming, relaxing, or walking around.\n\nI like to be comfy, so I was dreading formal nights going into this cruise.\n\nI brought one fancy dress with me to wear whenever I needed, but on the first formal night, I realized that the dress code wasn't strictly enforced. People wore a range of outfits, from evening gowns to T-shirts.\n\nFor the rest of the trip, I also relaxed my interpretation of the dress code.\n\nThe excursion I was most thrilled about — a hot-air balloon ride over the Bahamas — was canceled the day of because the winds were too high.\n\nIt was on the last day of my trip, and with only one day in port, it could not be rescheduled. It was the experience I was looking forward to most, so I was disappointed. On a cruise ship, I learned that all plans are subject to change based on things outside the crew's control, like the weather.\n\nSince we traveled such a long way to each port, I wrongfully assumed we'd spend more time in them. The ship usually docked around 8 a.m. and left in the early afternoon.\n\nI thought I'd have time to explore the port for a while after each excursion, but some of my excursions took the entire day, getting me back to the boat just in time for departure. I also hoped to see what these places looked like at night, but we never departed after sundown.\n\nAlthough I got a taste of the Caribbean, I didn't have enough time to get a sense of each place, which made me realize that I would probably prefer to vacation in just one place and have time to truly explore it.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic didn't sic their lawyers on Clawdbot. But they did send an email.\n\nPeter Steinberger initially named his viral AI agent after Clawd, the Claude Code mascot. Anthropic owned the trademark to Clawd's image, though, as well as the Claude name. Weeks after the launch, Steinberger changed the name to Moltbot, a move he said wasn't his decision.\n\nOn TBPN, Steinberger described the behind-the-scenes of the name change.\n\n\"I got an email from Anthropic that I had to rename the project,\" he said. \"Kudos, they were really nice. They didn't send their lawyers. They sent someone internally.\"\n\nStill, the timeline was \"rough,\" Steinberger said, and it's not easy to rename a product with such name recognition on social media.\n\n\"Everything that could have gone wrong today went wrong,\" he said.\n\nShortly after renaming the project, Steinberger said the X account was immediately snapped up by crypto sellers. X staff quickly helped Steinberger claim the handle, he said, but, for 20 minutes, \"that didn't work out so well.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't Anthropic — or any other company, for that matter — just buy Moltbot? Venture capitalists are certainly knocking down his door, Steinberger said. But the other population emailing him may put off possible acquirers: security researchers.\n\n\"This is all vibe-coded,\" Steinberger said. \"I don't know if any company would touch it, because we just haven't solved some things.\"\n\nSteinberger acknowledged that there was \"absolute risk\" with his product. He also likely wouldn't be interested in a big acquisition; Steinberger said that he'd rather Moltbot be a foundation or nonprofit than a company.\n\nWhile Clawdbot may have been named after Claude Code, Steinberger said he preferred coding with OpenAI's Codex. He called Codex more straightforward, while Claude Code required more \"tricks.\"\n\nWhen questions on his Discord server were getting out of control, Steinberger would copy and paste them straight into Codex, he said.\n\nOpenAI's chief marketing officer, Kate Rouch, saw the opportunity to dunk on Anthropic and took it.",

    "description": "Paramount executives want to add short-form video and user-generated content to Paramount+, according to leaked emails and presentations.",
    "fullText": "Paramount+ could soon look more like TikTok.\n\nParamount Skydance is planning to add a heavy dose of short-form video to its flagship streaming service, according to internal presentations and emails viewed by Business Insider.\n\nDan Reich, the head of global product and design for Paramount+, emailed fellow executives in mid-January, asking to set up a meeting with Paramount product chief Dane Glasgow to discuss \"Short Form Clips.\"\n\n\"We are trying to figure out how to jump-start efforts to get a million clips into our Short Form UX as quickly as possible,\" Reich wrote in the email.\n\nThis short-form video initiative is part of a so-called \"Project Eagle,\" Reich said in the email, though it's not immediately clear what else that project entails.\n\nReich added that his \"current understanding\" was that Paramount's AMLG, or Applied Machine Learning Group, \"has the clips ready (or near ready?)\" for another team to test the feature before it launches.\n\n\"As soon as we get the clips in, there will be increased pressure to provide a personalized feed of clips,\" Reich wrote to his colleagues.\n\nThe Paramount+ product design exec said he planned to discuss two topics in the meeting with Glasgow:\n\nShort-form video is a top priority for Paramount+ in the first quarter, specifically in its mobile app, according to an internal presentation sent by Reich that was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe documents viewed by Business Insider suggest that these short-form clips on Paramount+ will initially be created from existing content. However, Paramount is also interested in hosting user-generated content, which is the backbone of platforms like YouTube and TikTok. \"UGC\" was listed in the \"Mobile App Brainstorms\" section of a Paramount+ priorities presentation viewed by Business Insider.\n\nA person familiar with Paramount's short-form video plans said that the appeal of UGC is that it could be \"cheap and brings eyes to Paramount.\"\n\nAnother person familiar with Paramount's thinking said there are many products and initiatives in testing on the streaming side, and that the results of those tests would determine leadership's priorities.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nParamount hasn't previously done much with short-form video, outside a limited offering of trailers, clips, and interviews on its streaming app and social platforms like YouTube. It doesn't have a dedicated short-form feed on Paramount+.\n\nParamount's planned move into short-form video comes as CEO David Ellison implements his tech-first vision — and as Oracle, the software giant cofounded by his father, Larry Ellison, just became one of the select owners of TikTok's US business.\n\nDisney has also announced plans to put short-form video and UGC into Disney+ using AI, through a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI announced in December.\n\nNetflix, the leader among paid streamers, has experimented with short-form vertical video on its service, and co-CEO Greg Peters said on the company's mid-January earnings call that it's redesigning its mobile app with short-form video to compete with social media apps and \"better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come.\"\n\nAudiences, especially young people, have become hooked on short-form video through TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Hollywood is looking to get in on the action with so-called \"micro-dramas,\" mobile-focused shows with bite-sized episodes that are often soapy dramas.\n\nThe changes in consumption patterns among viewers come as traditional TV continues to lose customers and social video rises.",

    "fullText": "Amazon cut 16,000 more corporate jobs on Wednesday, and leadership wants the remaining staff to become even more efficient through technology.\n\nIn an email addressing the layoffs on Wednesday, Greg Pearson, VP of global sales at Amazon Web Services, urged employees to keep using technology to streamline their work.\n\n\"Moving forward, I encourage you to keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work, amplify our impact, and focus on the activities that directly drive value for our customers,\" Pearson wrote in the email obtained by Business Insider. \"And most importantly, take care of yourselves and each other.\"\n\nPearson's message mirrors Amazon's broader drive to run more efficiently as it reorganizes amid rapid advances in AI. Although the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said they were driven more by cultural fit than by cost reductions or automation.\n\nJassy has previously said AI will ultimately reduce Amazon's workforce by driving efficiency gains. On Wednesday, Amazon's chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, said in the layoff announcement that the company will continue hiring and investing in \"strategic areas.\"\n\nWednesday's layoff was Amazon's second round of mass job cuts since October, when it axed 14,000 roles.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "IonQ says its Seed Innovations acquisition will help optimize quantum performance at scale. SiliconSnark translates what that actually means.",
    "fullText": "IonQ woke up on January 28, 2026 and chose acquisition. Again.\n\nThis time, the “world’s leading quantum platform company” (a phrase that reads like it was assembled by a committee of synonyms) announced a definitive agreement to acquire Seed Innovations, a Colorado-based AI-software and technology R&D firm.\n\nIf you’re new here, IonQ’s whole vibe right now is “full-stack quantum platform,” which is a bit like saying you’re building a “full-stack unicorn”—majestic, aspirational, and technically not illegal to claim on a website. The pitch: Seed’s machine learning, cloud architecture, and software expertise will join IonQ’s Quantum Infrastructure team to “optimize performance” and “scale enterprise-ready solutions” across IonQ’s platforms.\n\nTranslation: IonQ is buying grown-ups who can make the quantum toys behave in the real world.\n\nSeed Innovations, founded in 2013, describes itself as a Women Owned Small Business specializing in full lifecycle software development, cloud migration, and R&D. Their staff includes software architects, SREs, and “Doctorates in machine learning,” which is an extremely polite way of saying: “We are the people you bring in when your system is haunted and your timeline is already a crime scene.”\n\nIonQ says Seed has done work for the “Department of War (DoW),” the Intelligence Community, and commercial customers. Now, I’m not here to nitpick acronyms, but “Department of War” is either (a) an aggressively metal rebrand, (b) a typo that slipped past fifteen approvals, or (c) the most honest naming convention in federal procurement history. Either way: points for transparency.\n\nThe deal is expected to close January 30, 2026—two days after the announcement—because nothing says “smooth integration” like speedrunning M&A like it’s a weekend hackathon.\n\nBecause quantum computing doesn’t fail in exciting sci-fi ways. It fails in normal ways. It fails like:\n\nIonQ’s press release basically admits that the next bottleneck isn’t only physics—it’s operating the physics like a product. They specifically call out building “enterprise grade, AI-driven software layers” for “managing and scaling complex quantum workloads.”\n\nThat’s not glamorous. That’s not a photogenic qubit. That’s Jira tickets. That’s reliability. That’s “we need dashboards.” That’s the point in the quantum journey where someone says, “Cool demo. Can I get an API?”\n\nAnd honestly? This is the most believable part of the whole thing.\n\nIonQ lists three focus areas for Seed after the acquisition. Let’s lovingly decode them.\n\nIonQ says Seed will use ML to analyze system data, predict behaviors, and drive continuous improvement.\n\nIn practice, this likely means: take a mountain of hardware/control/operations data and build models that help tune, diagnose, and forecast performance. The good version is “faster iteration, better uptime, fewer mysterious bad days.” The cynical version is “we added AI to the slide deck so procurement stops asking hard questions.”\n\nStill, ML for ops is real—especially when your machine is so sensitive that the universe itself feels like an adversarial test set.\n\nThey’re talking DevOps and automated scaling architecture.\n\nThis is the part where quantum becomes a service business: provisioning, orchestration, CI/CD, reliability, security controls, audit trails, customer-facing SLAs… all the boring enterprise stuff that customers absolutely demand, right up until they write you a check.\n\nYes, it’s hilarious to imagine “DevOps for qubits,” but it’s also how every advanced technology becomes a product: you wrap it in systems that make it usable by normal humans with normal deadlines.\n\nSeed brings cloud migration and microservices experience to make IonQ available “across all major cloud providers.”\n\nThis is less “seamless” and more “someone is about to spend a year building secure, reliable interfaces so enterprises can pretend quantum is just another SKU.” But to be fair, IonQ already distributes services via major clouds, and expanding that footprint is how you meet customers where they live: inside procurement portals and account teams.\n\nThis acquisition is also part of IonQ’s broader “we are building everything” campaign: quantum compute, networking, sensing, security—the whole stack.\n\nAnd it’s happening alongside a frankly sporty list of acquisitions IonQ has been stacking like trading cards: Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, Lightsynq, Capella Space, Qubitekk, a majority stake in ID Quantique, and Skyloom, among others.\n\nTwo days earlier—January 26, 2026—IonQ also announced a deal to acquire SkyWater Technology in a roughly $1.8B cash-and-stock transaction, framing it as vertical integration and a trusted U.S. semiconductor supply chain.\n\nSo in the span of a week, IonQ’s storyline reads like:\n\nAs strategies go, it’s coherent: if you want to be the platform, you need control over the weird, expensive, failure-prone parts—manufacturing, networking, sensing, security—and the glue that makes it all usable: software infrastructure.\n\nHere’s the SiliconSnark truth: enterprise software is where ambitious technologies go to either (a) become inevitable or (b) die slowly in a backlog.\n\nIonQ is betting on (a). Seed Innovations is the kind of team that doesn’t just build demos; they build systems that survive contact with reality, compliance, and the person who forwards your email to “IT Security” with no context.\n\nAlso, IonQ has been public about pushing performance milestones—like its claim of 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity and related technical disclosures in late 2025.\nWhether you’re bullish, skeptical, or spiritually allergic to quantum timelines, you can at least see the company trying to connect the physics story to the “we can operate this at scale” story.\n\nAnd that’s what Seed represents here: not more qubits, but more operability. Less “behold the future,” more “here is the monitoring and automated scaling architecture so the future doesn’t page you on Christmas.”\n\nA quantum company acquiring a software and cloud R&D specialist is the corporate equivalent of finally buying the boring kitchen appliances after years of collecting artisanal knives. Not exciting. Not sexy. Extremely necessary.\n\nIf IonQ really wants to sell “enterprise-grade” quantum—especially across multiple cloud providers—then integrating a team that lives and breathes ML, architecture, DevOps, and migration is… almost suspiciously sensible.\n\nSo yes: make your jokes about “AI-driven software layers” (I did). But if you’re looking for a signal that IonQ is trying to turn quantum from science project into product, this is it.\n\nNow please, for the love of all that is holy and scalable, tell me the “Department of War” thing was intentional.",

    "fullText": "Bettors on prediction markets love wagering on Fed decisions.\n\nIn a post on its blog, Polymarket said that Fed moves are a favorite bet for a certain kind of trader, and they've identified a framework for how they're navigating the market.\n\nPolymarket's internal data shows that the moment when the odds around a Fed decision \"crystallize\"—defined as the leading odds becoming dominant and ceasing to flip—actually sets in weeks before the meeting. This probably is not surprising, as futures markets tend to broadcast the Fed rate-cut odds for weeks or even months before the next meeting.\n\nStill, Polymarket's blog shows how certain kinds of bets known as \"bonds,\" which are high-probability bets that rarely flip, are approached by bettors.\n\n\"Across 22 Fed decisions from March 2023 to December 2025, I find that Polymarket odds crystallize with a median of ~26 days before the Fed meeting, which is early enough to create tradable entry points,\" the author of the post writes.\n\n\"Crystallization\" is defined by one outcome pulling ahead with at least 80% odds and remaining stable for several days in a row without any major swings.\n\nThe post also notes that, in most cases, odds of a rate decision settle early, as the central bank typically chooses between keeping rates unchanged or adjusting them by 25bp. However, recently, the US economy has faced a lot more uncertainty around the economy and the path of interest rates.\n\n\"Each new data release can completely reverse market expectations, preventing odds from stabilizing,\" the post said. \"Prospectively, traders can identify regime shifts by reading more on Fed communications signaling framework uncertainty or monitoring elevated VIX for a continuous period.\"\n\nThe analysis also highlights the key lead-lag relationship between institutional markets, which adjust to monetary speculation almost immediately, and prediction markets, which typically react roughly a day and a half later.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket aren't uncovering new information. Rather they are mirroring moves already priced in by other markets, creating small windows where Polymarket odds have not caught up to the broader market.\n\n\"It is worth noting that traders should view this on a relative-value basis rather than solely believing one is correct while the other is wrong as odds could flip quickly with new emerging data.\"\n\nThe author noted, though, that there is a potential wildcard for traders to consider going forward. Trump is set to replace Powell as Fed chair this year, and when he does, the central bank's new leader could abandon the forward-guidance policy, a key component of Polymarket's trading strategy.\n\nLee acknowledged that such a scenario would mark the type of regime shift that would be a test of the framework he outlined for navigating Fed policy moves.",

    "fullText": "Apple will round out the week's mega-cap tech bonanza on Thursday when it reports earnings for its fiscal first quarter.\n\nWith Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla due to report on Wednesday, AI will already be front and center for investors and analysts, and Apple's strategy is expected to be closely scrutinized.\n\nAll eyes will be on Apple's AI strategy when itreports after the market close on Thursday.\n\nThus far, the firm has largely opted out of the massive capex that other mega-cap companies have invested in AI infrastructure. Instead, it's hoped to join forces with already established AI players, recently announcing a partnership with Google's Gemini to boost its Siri voice assistant.\n\nApple's stock is up about 10% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader market and some of its Magnificent Seven peers. Shares were down about 1% on Wednesday to around $255.\n\nWall Street expects Apple to report $138.4 billion in revenue for the quarter and earnings per share of $2.68.\n\nHere's what top analysts are saying about the stock leading up to the report, and what they say to watch for when the $3.7 trillion firm reports Thursday afternoon.\n\nTech analyst Dan Ives said to look for updates on Apple's AI strategy.\n\n\"With the company finalizing the choice of Google Gemini to back Siri in its AI strategic push, it's time for Apple to lay down the blueprint to accelerate its AI strategy in 2026 which leads up to a much-anticipated Siri refresh this spring and WWDC in June,\" Ives said in a client note Wednesday, referencing the World Wide Developers Conference.\n\nHe thinks the stock could enjoy a big rally if investors start to apply an AI premium, like they have for other firms who have touted their involvement in the burgeoning technology.\n\n\"We believe no 'AI premium' which could be worth $75-$100 per share is factored into Apple's stock at current prices,\" Ives wrote.\n\nAnalyst Michael Ng says Apple will post earnings largely inline with consensus on Thursday, but that the stock is set to rally as the market will soon come around to its AI strategy.\n\nNg's price target is $320 a share, about 25% upside from current levels.\n\n\"AAPL stock is down 5% YTD to start C2026 likely on commodity cost inflation and App Store concerns, but we view the stock weakness as a buying opportunity into a continuation of the iPhone refresh cycle,\" Ng said in a January 20 note.\n\n\"Apple's partnership with Google Gemini for Siri and continued iPhone demand growth against the backdrop of AI-native consumer hardware launches should demonstrate to the market that the iPhone will remain the consumer device of choice for accessing new AI tools, clearing overhangs related to competition.\"\n\nAnalyst Erik Woodring said he expects weak stock price action after earnings on Thursday, as he thinks investors will be underwhelmed by iPhone sales numbers.\n\nBut he's still bullish on the stock for the year ahead, with a price target of $315 a share.\n\n\"Looking beyond the short-term, we continue to believe Apple will outperform in 2026 as it re-launches an upgraded Siri/Apple Intelligence (February '26 and WWDC 2026 in June), introduces its most innovative iPhone in 10+ years (Foldable), becomes first to market with a 2nm-powered smartphone (iPhone 18 family),\" Woodring wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nThe bank said that while iPhone sales should be strong, they'll \"take a back burner to rising memory costs.\"\n\n\"Despite supply agreements that likely mitigate the impact of rising memory costs in the Mar qtr guide, risk does increase in the June and Sept qtrs as production of the next gen of iPhones ramp, impactings cost and margins,\" UBS wrote in a January 20 note.\n\nChris Brigati, SWBC's chief investment officer, said there will be heightened scrutiny on Apple's AI strategy, and there's a risk that investors aren't satisfied with the company's updates to its approach.\n\n\"The tone from this week's Magnificent 7 earnings reports should be solid, though not evenly distributed across the group,\" Brigati said in an email on Wednesday. \"Apple, however, faces the toughest hurdle: after a wave of upward estimate revisions, it's the name most likely to struggle to clear the bar, especially as investors raise questions about its AI strategy.\"",

The firm rolled out an internal chatbot last year to speed up workflows for its fundamental stock pickers.\n\nSubramanian joined in 2018 from Goldman Sachs, where he spent 13 years and rose to partner and co-CTO.\n\nSubramanian's exit marks the second shakeup to Citadel's C-suite in recent months. CFO Andrew Philipp was hired by Schonfeld in late November to join as its co-president.\n\nCitadel returned 10.2% in its flagship Wellington fund last year, below its peers and its recent run of industry-leading performance.\n\nCorrection: January 28, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated Andrew Philipp's job status. He has not officially left Citadel yet.",

    "fullText": "An Amazon employee used an AI tool to analyze internal conversations and compile a list of potential teams and organizations affected by layoffs, according to messages viewed by Business Insider.\n\nAmazon announced layoffs on Wednesday, saying it would cut 16,000 corporate employees. The company hasn't publicly revealed where it plans to make cuts. The employee's list is AI-generated and appears to be based on internal Slack conversations, so it may contain inaccuracies. Amazon did not respond to a request to verify the list.\n\nBusiness Insider edited the list for length and clarity. The employee used an AI tool called Pippin to make the list, which Amazon employees have been using increasingly for writing and reviewing documents.\n\n\"Used Pippin to help me parse conversations from today,\" the employee wrote on the company's Slack. \"Please note that this info may not be 100% accurate. Take care, everyone!\"\n\nBusiness Insider independently reviewed internal messages related to Amazon layoffs within the AI cloud service Bedrock, the cloud data warehouse service Redshift, the ProServe consulting team, the Prime subscription service, and the last-mile Delivery Experience team.\n\nWednesday's round of layoffs marks the latest mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce represents a relatively small share of that total, at roughly 350,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "UpScrolled is a social media app that launched in 2025. It's now the No. 2 app on Apple's App Store as TikTok deals with glitches.",
    "fullText": "What's January without a TikTok panic?\n\nLast January, TikTok briefly went dark in the US amid a legal fight. This year, TikTok users were treated to days of app glitches caused by an outage at an Oracle data center, and a transition to a new joint-venture ownership structure in the US.\n\nUpstart rivals have benefited from TikTok users — particularly those concerned about TikTok's new owners' ties to the Trump administration — seeking alternatives. The biggest winner appears to be UpScrolled, which hit No. 2 among free apps in Apple's App Store on Wednesday.\n\nUpScrolled launched last year and was founded by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist who previously worked at tech giants such as IBM and Oracle, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"UpScrolled is a social media platform designed to empower users worldwide — a space to freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,\" the platform's website says. \"We built it because people are asking for more transparency, authenticity, and trust in the platforms they use every day.\"\n\nAccording to estimates from the marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower, as of Tuesday, UpScrolled had been downloaded about 400,000 times in the US and 700,000 globally since launching in June 2025. The app saw a surge in downloads beginning January 22, and Sensor Tower estimated that, as of Tuesday, 85% of UpScrolled's downloads in the US had occurred between January 21 and 27.\n\nAs of Wednesday, UpScrolled was No. 1 in the \"social networking\" category in Apple's App Store, surpassing Meta's Threads, WhatsApp, and TikTok. It was the No. 6 free social app on Google Play for Android users, where TikTok (and TikTok Lite) reign.\n\nUpScrolled feels like a combination of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok.\n\nThere's a feed of accounts you follow, carousel posts, vertical short-form video, stories, and a discovery page with trending topics and hashtags.\n\nOne of the app's selling points for new users is its stance on content censorship: \"No shadowbans, no hidden throttling, no pay-to-play favoritism — ever,\" UpScrolled says on its website.\n\n\"UpScrolled is committed to protecting freedom of expression — but with that freedom comes responsibility,\" UpScrolled's FAQ says. \"We only restrict content that violates our community guidelines or broadly accepted legal and ethical standards. This includes content involving illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.\"\n\nOther social networks are also seeing spikes in users.\n\nSensor Tower data showed a recent marginal increase in Reddit and Pinterest downloads.\n\nMeanwhile, newer apps, like Spill, are also seeing an uptick.\n\nSpill was founded by former Twitter employees and launched in 2023. The app told Business Insider that it had seen an influx of signups in recent days. It was the No. 17 app in the social category as of Wednesday.\n\nIt isn't the first time TikTok users have looked for new pastures.\n\nLast year, other Chinese-owned apps, such as Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, gained traction in the US as TikTok faced legal jeopardy.",

    "description": "Amid political pressures, Jerome Powell announced the Fed will hold rates steady.",
    "fullText": "The first Federal Reserve meeting of 2026 is in the books, and Chair Jerome Powell stayed tight-lipped on the central bank's biggest controversies.\n\nFrom the job market to political tensions, here are Business Insider's biggest takeaways from the January call to hold rates steady.\n\nThe Fed appeared more optimistic about the economic picture on Wednesday. While recent Fed press releases after interest rate decisions included a warning of \"downside risks to the labor market,\" that comment was removed in January's release.\n\nPowell said that the central bank's dual mandate — stable prices and maximum employment — is becoming more balanced than it was for much of last year. The unemployment rate is relatively low with minimal changes, even as labor market demand and hiring remain stagnant. He added that consumer spending has remained \"resilient\" and inflation rates are in a solid position, aside from tariff impact.\n\nAs for AI, Powell speculated that new technology is likely to have a positive effect on both companies and their employees.\n\n\"Every technological wave will eliminate some jobs and create other jobs,\" he said. \"It's always been the case. If you look back, wave after wave after wave, there will be some disruption. But ultimately, technology increases productivity, which is the basis for rising wages. It may not all happen immediately, but over time, it's what enables incomes to rise.\"\n\nThe central bank has long been known for making uniform policy decisions, but the current FOMC has seen split votes in every meeting since July.\n\nThere were two dissenters in the January 28 meeting — Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller hoped for a quarter-point rate cut. This is down from three dissents in the December meeting, which was the most since September 2019.\n\nPowell said there was \"broad support\" on the FOMC for holding today, including among non-voters, although \"there are different views on the committee\" over which side of the dual mandate takes priority when data is ambiguous.\n\nThe chair did not say whether the Fed plans to cut rates next month — or whether that move would be supported within the FOMC. \"Policy is not a preset course,\" he said. \"We make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.\"\n\nThe Fed has been in the news more than usual lately, as the Trump administration continues to put pressure on central bank leadership. The president has been vocal about his desire for bigger, faster rate cuts. And, with Powell's term as chair ending in May, Trump will be able to choose his successor.\n\nPowell did not comment on any of the Fed chair frontrunners or provide further detail on the ongoing Department of Justice probe over construction at the bank's Washington, DC, buildings. He also dodged a question about Governor Lisa Cook's mortgage fraud case, which was heard by the Supreme Court last week. However, Powell emphasized the importance of Fed independence. It's \"hard to restore the credibility of the institution\" if the neutrality from political independence is lost, he said.\n\nThe Fed chair did have a piece of advice for his successor.\n\n\"Stay out of elected politics,\" he said. \"Don't get pulled into elected politics. Don't do it.\"",

The ServiceNow CEO is so sure AI won't eat software that he's betting more on his own stock and committing to stay on as the company's leader through 2030.\n\nMcDermott also said he recently redid his executive compensation to tie his future pay more closely to ServiceNow's stock performance over the next three years. These packages usually involve big equity awards, so the CEO is effectively putting more of his money where his mouth is.\n\n\"We're building a trillion-dollar company here,\" McDermott told Business Insider in an interview on Wednesday. The company, which sells software to businesses, once again reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. It also announced a new partnership with AI startup Anthropic.\n\n\"Through my own compensation, I'm betting on the stock,\" McDermott said.\n\nAs a sign of confidence, ServiceNow approved a $5 billion share repurchase program on Wednesday. McDermott said the company will put a big chunk of this to work quickly by buying about $2 billion worth of its own stock in the coming weeks.\n\nThe executive said he also recently committed to staying on as CEO through the end of 2030.\n\nIn the past year, this type of good news hasn't landed well with investors. ServiceNow stock is down about 40% since early 2025 on concern generative AI could replace some types of corporate software.\n\nMcDermott told Business Insider that ServiceNow's results show this isn't happening. Instead, revenue growth remains strong and cash flow is improving, he said.\n\n\"The revenue growth is there.

    "description": "An accuser of the Alexander brothers has testified that she was raped by one the siblings in 2012 after attending a party at Zac Efron's penthouse.",
    "fullText": "The first accuser to testify in the sex-trafficking trial of ex-luxury real estate brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and their brother deftly rebuffed questions involving actor Zac Efron and her own blurry memory on Wednesday.\n\nThe woman, testifying under the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" was an early and key government witness in the Manhattan federal trial of Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander.\n\nShe has testified that she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012, when she was 20 years old, at his Manhattan apartment after they attended an NBA Finals viewing party at Efron's nearby penthouse.\n\nProsecutors have alleged in an indictment that the Alexanders sometimes planned out sexual assaults, using their wealth to entice victims with the promises of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations. The brothers have vehemently denied the charges against them, arguing that any sexual encounters were consensual.\n\nA defense lawyer for Alon Alexander pressed Moore on cross-examination on Wednesday about why she would change her profile picture on Facebook hours after the alleged rape. The photo, which Moore said Efron shot, showed her smiling at the actor's party.\n\n\"You took the time to change your Facebook profile?\" asked Alon Alexander's attorney, Howard M. Srebnick, during a second day of cross-examination for Moore.\n\n\"The only thing I could think of was it was to distract myself at that moment,\" Moore told the six-man, six-woman jury. \"Just trying to keep normalcy at a moment in my life when nothing was normal.\"\n\nEfron's name came up multiple times during Moore's testimony. At one point, Moore described herself as a \"fan\" of his and said she was excited to meet him. Efron has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Representatives for the actor did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.\n\nMoore testified Tuesday that after the party and a visit to a nearby club with Efron and the brothers on that 2012 evening, she had awakened from being drugged to find herself naked on Alon Alexander's bed in the Manhattan apartment where Tal Alexander also lived. Alon Alexander, who was an executive at his family's private security firm, was standing over her and was also naked, she said.\n\n\"I was shocked, and I had no idea how I got there,\" Moore testified, adding that she tried two or three times to get out of the bed, but \"Alon kept pushing me back down.\"\n\nTal Alexander, she said, walked in on the alleged attack, and the brothers \"casually\" chatted.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tal Alexander's defense lawyer, Alex Kahn, questioned Moore about how long his client remained in the room during the alleged rape.\n\n\"Was he there for a moment?\" Kahn asked the accuser. \"What do you mean by a moment?\" she answered, her voice firm.\n\n\"A very short time,\" Tal Alexander's lawyer responded. \"What do you mean by a very short time?\" she asked.\n\nThe defense lawyer reframed his question, asking how long she believed his client was present in the bedroom.\n\n\"I could not quantify,\" Moore answered. \"Because I was being raped at that moment.\"\n\nAsked on Tuesday why Moore waited until 2024 to contact law enforcement — another potential weak point in the prosecution case — she said she realized that the case had become \"bigger than me.\"\n\nThe brothers, she said, had \"harmed people, including my 20-year-old self — the version of me that couldn't do anything and that felt too scared and helpless to do anything.\"\n\nMoore took the witness stand on Tuesday shortly after opening arguments kicked off in the high-profile trial.\n\nDuring those opening statements, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser told the jury that the Alexander brothers are sexual predators who together raped dozens of women and girls and then \"celebrated their crimes.\"\n\nThe brothers \"used whatever means necessary\" to carry out the attacks over the course of more than a decade, the prosecutor said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, a second accuser took the stand to describe a harrowing 2014 rape in the shower of a Hamptons vacation home.\n\n\"Is this how you thank me for inviting you to a beautiful home,\" a nurse from Nevada said Tal Alexander angrily told her before his alleged attack.\n\n\"As he was cleaning himself off, he looked at me and said, 'you wanted that,'\" the woman, then a 24-year-old aspiring model, told the jury. Her testimony is scheduled to continue on Thursday.\n\nThe Alexanders face several federal sex trafficking charges. If convicted at trial, Tal Alexander, 39, and the twins, 38, could face up to life behind bars.",

    "fullText": "The USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier is setting sail for a new test at sea, specifically its shipbuilder sea trials. It marks a major milestone for the US Navy's next supercarrier.\n\nThe trials will be overseen by top shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries, allowing for evaluations of the vessel before it's delivered to the Navy.\n\nThough the ship has gone through river-based propulsion testing, these trials are when the new warship leaves the yard and proves that it actually works at sea. It's a big reality check before the Navy receives it and starts putting it through its own tests.\n\nShipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries launched the Kennedy (CVN-79) from its Newport News Shipbuilding division on Wednesday. \"These trials will test important ship systems and components at sea for the first time,\" Todd Corillo, HII's spokesperson for the NNS division, told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nKennedy is the second Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier. HII started construction on it in February 2011 with the \"first cut of steel ceremony.\" The ship's keel was laid in August 2015, and the carrier was halfway done being built in June 2017.\n\nThe aircraft carrier's delivery date has shifted over the years, but it is now expected for March 2027.\n\nIn 2020, the Navy shifted away from earlier plans to build the Kennedy in two stages and install some systems, like capabilities for operating Lockheed Martin F-35C Lightning II stealth fighters, after launch, instead choosing a single-phase approach that added years of work. These delays are different from those that affected the first Ford-class carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford.\n\nThe first ship in the class struggled with the integration of new technologies like the advanced aircraft arresting gear and weapons elevators, contributing to significant cost overruns and delays. The Navy has said that those lessons were folded into the later build, helping the Kennedy move faster overall.\n\nAfter the Kennedy enters service, the next Ford-class carriers to be delivered to the Navy will be USS Enterprise (CVN-80) and USS Dorris Miller (CVN-81), planned for commissioning in 2030 and 2032, respectively.\n\nThe US announced the names and planned dates of the following two carriers, USS William J. Clinton (CVN-82) and USS George W. Bush (CVN-83), last year.",

Her missives mostly rehash what the company reports publicly, such as how revenue and profit are growing, or what is discussed on analyst earnings calls.\n\nStill, these memos provide insight into what Microsoft executives deem most important, and what they want employees to know.\n\nThe latest memo highlighted how Microsoft is gaining share in markets where the total addressable market is expanding.\n\nHood specifically mentioned the launch of the GitHub Copilot software development kit in the growing market of AI coding tools, and the release of Microsoft's new Maia 200 AI chip.\n\nHood's email also called out Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic that helped increase commercial bookings, basically the deals Microsoft closed in the quarter, by 230%, year over year.\n\nCapital expenditure on computing and datacenter infrastructure also broke yet another quarterly record, reaching $37.5 billion, she also noted.\n\nThis afternoon, we announced our second-quarter financial results. We exceeded Wall Street expectations, growing revenue 17% and 15% in constant currency and operating income by 21% and 19% in constant currency -a strong finish to the first half of the fiscal year.\n\nIn the quarter, Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $50 billion for the first time, growing 26% and 24% in constant currency.\n\nThere were many highlights this quarter, but a few stand out as reminders of the value our products and services deliver to customers - and as proof points of the progress we are making:\n\nInvestors tune in to our earnings call for the full details on this quarter and a look ahead to Q3. It's a helpful way to stay aligned as we deliver on our commitments. Join live today at 2:30 PM Pacific, listen on-demand, or check the transcript on the Investor Relations website.\n\nThis quarter's results reflect meaningful progress on core priorities. We continue to add capacity with pace, drive steady efficiency gains across our fleet, and invest in each layer of the stack\n\nAs we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we're operating in markets with expanding TAM where we continue to gain share and you can see our progress in many places, from last week's announcement of the GitHub Copilot SDK to Monday's Maia 200 announcement. We are innovating and delivering together. And we're doing it with the quality and security our customers expect from us. All of this builds trust from customers and partners as they rely on us for mission critical workloads.\n\nThanks again for all your work.\n\nWith appreciation and gratitude,\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Bill Gates doesn't just see AI as a breakthrough—he sees it as a turning point. For doctors, for teachers, for many of the roles once considered safe from automation. In two recent interviews, the Microsoft co-founder laid out a future where intelligence isn't rare or elite—it's abundant, automated, and free.\n\nAccording to Harvard Magazine, Gates sat down with professor Arthur Brooks at Harvard's Sanders Theatre to discuss his memoir \"Source Code\" last year. But the most headline-worthy moment wasn't about the past. It was Gates' stark prediction about what AI will do next.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nIn the interview, Gates said artificial intelligence will ease shortages in fields like medicine and education by taking over tasks traditionally done by humans.\n\nHe reportedly described a future where machines manage primary-care diagnostics, especially in places lacking medical professionals. In that context, Gates told Brooks, \"the machine will probably be superior to humans—because the breadth of knowledge that you need to make some of these decisions really goes beyond individual human cognition.\"\n\nGates didn't suggest human professionals would vanish overnight. But he made clear that when machines can deliver diagnoses more accurately, more affordably, and more consistently than people—they won't be sidekicks. They'll be replacements.\n\nAnd it's not just about medicine. Harvard Magazine reports that Gates framed the rise of AI as part of the same arc that turned bulky corporate computers into personal tools. Only now, the commodity isn't hardware—it's intelligence itself.\n\n\"What we're doing now [in artificial intelligence] is kind of an extension of the digital revolution,\" he said, \"and all of those things are about free intelligence.\"\n\nTrending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\nThat phrase—free intelligence—is central to Gates' view. Once reserved for rare professionals with years of education, high-quality expertise will soon be as accessible as Wi-Fi.\n\nIn education, Gates predicted, AI could reshape the classroom, adapting to each student and even learning how to keep them motivated. In healthcare, it will take pressure off overworked doctors and bring diagnostic tools to parts of the world that never had them.\n\nBut Gates also issued a warning. More access doesn't always mean better outcomes.\n\n\"[Sometimes when] you empower humans, it doesn't always get pushed in the right direction,\" he said, according to Harvard Magazine.\n\nThe very systems designed to educate or heal could just as easily spread misinformation or bias—if deployed without care. Gates acknowledged this isn't just a shift in technology—it's a shift in power.\n\nThat same caution appeared during his appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" last year. Asked about the pace of change, Gates reflected on how computing once felt expensive and exclusive—and now intelligence itself is entering the same phase transition.\n\n\"The era that we're just starting is that intelligence is rare,\" Gates said. \"And with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace… great medical advice, great tutoring.\"\n\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nWhen Fallon asked whether humans would still be needed, Gates didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Not for most things,\" he said.\n\nA few roles might survive—he mentioned baseball and talk shows—but the vast majority of tasks people are trained to do? Machines will do them better, faster, and cheaper.\n\nFor investors, that future isn't just disruptive—it's investable. As AI reshapes industries like education, healthcare, and logistics, some are looking beyond Big Tech and turning to early-stage platforms. Startups focused on diagnostics, learning tools, and productivity automation are drawing serious capital. Platforms like Fundrise offer everyday investors a chance to back emerging AI companies—often with as little as $10.\n\nIt's an exciting future, especially if artificial intelligence really can solve chronic shortages in doctors and educators. But as Gates reminded both Harvard students and late-night audiences, access alone won't guarantee progress. What we do with free intelligence still depends on the people holding the keys.\n\nRead Next: Security and regulation matter in crypto — explore Kraken Pro's compliance-first trading platform.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.  “A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.",
    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — Winter's brutal grip on the U.S. East is not letting up, with coming days bringing subfreezing temperatures that will plunge deep into what had been a toasty Florida peninsula and a powerful blizzard forecast that may strike the Atlantic coast.\n\nDeep cold is forecast to stick around at least into the first week of February. Meteorologists are also watching what could become a “ bomb cyclone ” — a quickly intensifying storm that’s a winter version of a hurricane — forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.\n\n“A major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,” said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThat storm could dump snow — at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) with white-out conditions — in the Carolinas, northern Georgia and southern Virginia. After that, it could turn and plow through the Interstate 95 corridor late Saturday into Sunday to dump loads more snow from Washington to Boston, further paralyzing much of the country. Or it could deliver a glancing blow, mostly striking places like Cape Cod.\n\nAlternatively, it could just veer off harmlessly to sea. Meteorologists and forecast models aren't yet settling on a single outcome.\n\n“The confidence is much higher that in the coastal Carolinas and Virginia that there will be significant snowfall this weekend,” said James Belanger, vice president for meteorology at the Weather Channel and its parent company. \"The real question is going to be the trajectory it takes” from there.\n\nPrivate meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former NOAA chief scientist, said for the mid-Atlantic and north it's a “boom or bust” situation. “If it happens (to go along the coast) it's going to be a big-time event.\"\n\nModels still disagree on storm track\n\nOn Tuesday forecast models were all over the place, from out to sea to inward toward Philadelphia. By Wednesday morning they started to agree that “we’re likely to see some form of a powerful coastal storm somewhere east of North Carolina, off the Delmarva coast, but they still disagree as to where,” Mullinax said.\n\nChances of the storm veering away from the East Coast entirely had diminished Wednesday morning, but hadn't disappeared altogether, Mullinax said.\n\nOf all the options, “from D.C. up to New York is probably the most unclear,” Mullinax said. He said a mere 50-mile (80-kilometer) difference in the storm's center will be critical. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said it may be hard for the southern mid-Atlantic to avoid some kind of snow, whether a little or a lot.\n\nThis storm will blow harder than the last one\n\nThis weekend's storm will differ from the previous storm, which started with moist air from the Pacific that combined with a deep plunge of Arctic air from an elongated polar vortex supplemented by more moisture from the south and east, meteorologists said. The last storm had little wind. This one will generate high winds, even if the snow misses the Washington area, generating gusts that could still reach 40 mph (65 kph), plunging wind chills near subzero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius), Mullinax said.\n\n“It looks like a pretty strong and explosive storm so everybody is going to have some gusty winds,\" Pydynowski said, even inland places that won't come close to getting snow like Pittsburgh. Strong winds may take daytime temperatures in the teens there down to feeling like they are below zero, he said.\n\n“This is what we'd consider more of a classic nor'easter,” Belanger said, describing a storm forming around the U.S. Gulf Coast crossing into the Atlantic and going up that coast.\n\nFrigid air and warm water combine to make strong storm\n\nIn this case, one key is warmer-than-normal water in the Gulf of Mexico — partly from human-caused climate change — and the always toasty Atlantic Gulf Stream, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist for the nonprofit Climate Central.\n\nWhen that happens the storm “pulls in more moisture and it gives it more strength,” she said.\n\nOnce the core of the storm nears the Carolinas its pressure will drop tremendously, enough to qualify for what meteorologists call “bombogenesis” or “a bomb cyclone,” That will give it the effect of a moderate-strength hurricane, including huge winds, but in the winter, Maue and Belanger said.\n\nIf the storm does come ashore, those winds and extra snow could cause massive snow drifts big enough to bury cars, Maue said.\n\nArctic chill sticks around and goes further south\n\nWhat is more certain is that the Arctic chill in the Midwest and East will continue through mid-February, with only slight warmups that would still be below normal, meteorologists said.\n\nAnd this new weekend storm “is going to take that cold and it's going to spill right down the heart of the Florida peninsula,\" Pydynowski said. Orlando is forecast to go well below freezing and only have a high of 48 F (9 C), smashing temperature records, while even Miami and Key West will flirt with record cold Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.\n\nThe outlook for Florida was cold enough to raise concerns about damage to the state’s citrus and strawberries.\n\n“We're going into a brutally cold period,” Maue said.\n\nAfter this weekend storm, long-range models see another one at the end of the first week of February, Maue said. Meteorologists see the East stuck in a pattern of bitter cold and snowstorms because of the plunging Arctic air and warm water.\n\nEast Coast snowstorms don't happen too often, but “when it happens, it happens in bunches,\" said former National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini, who has written meteorology textbooks on winter snowstorms.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "title": "These Are Michigan's 5 Deepest Lakes Outside Of The Great Lakes",
    "description": "The Great Lakes State is know for, well, you get the picture. But don't let the name fool you: Michigan is full of beautiful deep-bodied inland lakes, too.",
    "fullText": "Many of Michigan's top tourist attractions are centered around the Great Lakes, which is little surprise, given that the state touches four of the massive bodies of water. From the pleasant beach in Sleeping Bear Dunes to the gilded glamor of Mackinac Island, the Great Lakes make for a great time.\n\nBut the Great Lakes aren't the only really big lakes in the state. There are more than 11,000 inland lakes in the Michigan, which has more freshwater shoreline than any other state in the U.S. Many of Michigan's most beautiful inland lakes offer sunny sands, swimming, and boating opportunities without the crowds that you'll find at some of the more popular Great Lakes beaches (you'll also get to skip the potentially intimidating vastness and 1,332-foot depths of Lake Superior).\n\nYou'll find Michigan's deepest inland lakes in the northern areas of both the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula. This location isn't an accident; most of these lakes were formed by glacial activity during the Pleistocene era, which ended around 10,000 years ago. Today, these lakes are a boon to summer tourism, drawing visitors from all over the world who want to swim, boat, fish, and simply enjoy the views. If you're thinking about putting a visit to Michigan on your summer itinerary, here are the five deepest inland lakes in the state that should be on your radar.\n\nLocated in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula, Elk Lake has a maximum depth of 150 feet and stretches for 8,194 acres across 28 miles of shoreline. It's separated from Lake Michigan by just a thin strip of land and is surrounded by the small towns of Elk Rapids and Kewadin.\n\nVisitors to Elk Lake are struck by the beauty of the clear waters surrounded by trees. Swimming, boating, and fishing are all popular summertime activities here, as are water sports such as tubing, water skiing, and wakeboarding.\n\nFreshwater snorkelers can watch lake trout swim and view sunken wrecks like that of the 1903 Shale Scow shipwreck. Want to explore the surrounding area? Besides being next to Lake Michigan, Elk Lake is part of the Chain of Lakes Water Trail, an inland water trail spanning more than 100 miles across 12 interconnected lakes and rivers in northwestern Michigan. Past visitors on Google describe the lake as their \"favorite place in the world to be,\" and \"quintessential 'Up North.'\"\n\nAt 152 feet deep, Thumb Lake (also known as Lake Louise) is just slightly deeper than Elk Lake but much smaller in surface area, at 510 acres. Despite its name, it's not located in Michigan's \"thumb\" but in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula, between the towns of Vanderbilt and Boyne Falls.\n\nThumb Lake is a kettle lake, meaning it formed within the depression left by a glacier. It's also a seepage lake, meaning it only loses water through evaporation and groundwater channels, rather than through an outlet (so water stays in the lake for much longer than other lakes).\n\nVisitors enjoy spending time on Thumb Lake's sandy, 1,600-wide beach, a portion of which is dog-friendly. Swimming, boating, and fishing are all popular in the summer months. Reviewers remark on the clear water and peaceful surroundings (the spotty cell service in the area adds to this effect).\n\nHead north to Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and you'll find Lake Angeline, which is 162 feet deep at its deepest point and only 96 acres in area. It's located within the small city of Ishpeming, a charming gem with pristine views. Unlike the other lakes on this list, Lake Angeline was not formed by a glacier.\n\nInstead, it was created in a former open-pit and shaft iron mine. In the late 19th century, the former body of water that stood here was drained entirely, and its bottom was mined extensively for iron ore. Beginning in the 1940s, it began to refill and was eventually repurposed as a fishing lake and stocked with rainbow trout.\n\nToday, scuba divers can see the remains of a submerged forest that likely began to grow there as the lake slowly refilled over the years. Lake Angeline is a popular fishing lake and is regularly stocked with several trout species, including splake. Ice fishers often head out onto the ice in the winter. And in the summer, people take advantage of the boat launch. Though some prefer to stay out of its cold waters, others enjoy swimming in the lake, too.\n\nLike Elk Lake, Crystal Lake is located in northwestern Michigan and separated from Lake Michigan by a thin strip of land that turns it into a separate, inland lake. Crystal Lake has a unique history: It's both natural and artificial. In 1873, a man named Archibald Jones attempted to build a series of locks connecting Crystal Lake (then called White Cap Lake) to Lake Michigan.\n\nDue to crucial technical oversights, the dam Jones had built to hold back water during canal construction failed, and Crystal Lake lost about 20 feet of water. Somewhat fortuitously, this loss exposed the beautiful sandy beaches that visitors enjoy today.\n\nToday, Crystal Lake is 175 feet deep and covers just under 10,000 acres. Its crystal-clear blue waters mean that Crystal Lake is often compared to the Caribbean. Bordered by the city of Frankfort and the villages of Beulah and Benzonia, Crystal Lake is a hidden gem summer destination. Tourists can go swimming, sailing, boating, and fishing at several lakeside beaches, including Crystal Lake Public Beach, Mollineaux Beach, and Beulah Village Park. One past visitor on Google called the lake an \"amazing diamond in the rough,\" further  adding that the water \"is breathtaking with [its] gorgeous shades of blue.\"\n\nAt 250 feet deep, Torch Lake is not only Michigan's deepest lake outside of the Great Lakes, it's also deeper than Lake Erie (which reaches 210 feet deep). It's located in northwest Michigan, just a short distance from Elk Lake, and like Elk Lake, it's likewise separated from Lake Michigan by a thin strip of land.\n\nCovering 18,473 acres in surface area and 41 miles of shoreline, Torch Lake was naturally shaped by glaciers (and was originally a bay that was part of Lake Michigan). Its crystal-clear waters mean it's sometimes called the Caribbean of Michigan. Parts of the shoreline are rocky (you might find some Petoskey stones, fossilized corals from prehistoric times), while other sections are covered in sand. Speaking of sand, if you visit the lake during the summer months, head to the Torch Lake Sandbar in the middle of the water, where you'll often find a gathering of boats partying and enjoying some of the best fun the Midwest has to offer.\n\nSnorkeling is another popular activity here due to the water's clarity. \"I've been to many lakes throughout the world and I've never seen a spring-fed lake as clear ... and beautiful, almost a turquoise color, like Torch Lake,\" wrote one past visitor on Tripadvisor.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker will discontinue the Model S and X, Tesla's premium sedan and SUV offerings, in the next quarter.",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the company will be discontinuing the Model S and X in the next quarter, bringing an end to the EV maker's more premium SUV and sedan models.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" the CEO said during Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nMusk said Tesla is replacing the Model S and Model X production lines in its Fremont Factory in California with an Optimus factory, with the long-term goal being to produce one million robots a year.\n\nTesla will continue to support the Model S and Model X vehicles for as long as people have them, Musk said, adding that for people interested in owning one, \"now would be the time to order it.\"\n\nThe CEO said the shift was \"slightly sad\" but part of the company's \"overall shift to an autonomous future.\"\n\nTesla's stock was up on Wednesday after the company beat earnings expectations and announced it would invest $2 billion into xAI, Musk's AI company. Tesla also announced it plans to release the third generation of its Optimus robot later this quarter.\n\nThe Model S and Model X are some of Tesla's oldest models, as well as its priciest.\n\nTesla unveiled a prototype for the Model S, a sedan, in 2009 and began deliveries to customers in 2012. The Model X, an SUV, was announced in 2012, with first deliveries going out in 2015.\n\nBoth models received upgrades in 2025, including an increase in driving range, better noise cancellation, and smoother suspension, as well as a price increase of $4,500. However, the upgrades did not include some of the more innovative technologies that were introduced with Tesla's Cybertruck.\n\nThe starting price on Tesla's site for the Model S was $94,990 as of Wednesday, or $109,990 for the more premium Plaid version. The Model X was $99,990, or $114,990 for Plaid.",

    "description": "\"When armed agents operate beyond the reach of law, they are no longer public servants. They are something else entirely.\"",
    "fullText": "We have to be clear about what we are witnessing from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minnesota.\n\nAs a combat soldier, I recognize a mission when I see one — not because it’s announced, but because it’s being carried out. In the span of weeks, ICE and Border Patrol operations in Minneapolis have resulted in the deaths of two Minnesotans. In over a year of combat in Iraq, my battalion of 500 soldiers did not kill a single person.\n\nAlso Read: I Spent 20 Years Teaching In The Special-Education System. Now I’m Speaking Out About What I Saw.\n\nMy unit spent 397 days on the battlefield. We were shot at. We feared for our lives. Snipers fired from crowds. Improvised explosive devices lined the roads we were ordered to clear. And still, we did not return fire unless strict conditions were met: The shooter had to be clearly identified, civilians could not be in the line of fire, and lethal force had to be the last resort.\n\nWhy? Because that was not our mission.\n\nOur mission was to build bases, secure supply routes, and protect civilian life. We were governed by Rules of Engagement, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the War Crimes Act. Violations were not brushed aside. Soldiers are criminally accountable when we break the law. That accountability is what separates professional soldiers from mercenaries.\n\nPolitics: 'You Just Killed My ******* Neighbor!' Eyewitness Describes Deadly ICE Shooting\n\nThis isn’t just my experience. It’s the standard.\n\nThis story is part of HuffPost’s commitment to fearlessly covering the Trump administration. You can support our work and protect the free press by contributing to our newsroom.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara stated publicly that, in 2025, the Minneapolis Police Department recovered roughly 900 guns from the street and arrested hundreds of violent offenders — and did not kill a single person.\n\nAlso Read: I Pursued Motherhood Despite Past Psychosis -- Then This Happened\n\nIf the Minneapolis Police Department didn’t kill anyone in a year of active policing, and my combat unit didn’t kill anyone in over a year of war, Minnesotans — and all Americans — are right to ask why ICE and the Border Patrol have killed two people in my state in two weeks.\n\nThe answer is uncomfortable but unavoidable. Either this is their mission — or they are operating outside accountability.\n\nMinnesota is demanding a full legal investigation into the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, including allegations that lifesaving medical care was delayed or denied. Refusing transparency or investigation is not partisan disagreement. It is a constitutional failure.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nWhen armed agents operate beyond the reach of law, they are no longer public servants. They are something else entirely.\n\nMercenaries are defined not only by who pays them but by what restrains them. Mercenaries answer to orders, not to law, ethics or public accountability. That is precisely why soldiers and law enforcement officers hold codes of conduct so fiercely. Without those codes, uniforms become disguises instead of safeguards.\n\nPolitics: Inside The Invasion Of Minneapolis\n\nAs a veteran, I refuse to accept mercenary behavior hiding behind federal badges on Minnesota soil. This is my home. Minnesota stands for liberty, justice and due process — not secrecy, immunity or violence without consequence.\n\nStaff changes are not legal accountability. Silence is not justice. Justice delayed is justice denied.\n\nMinnesotans are demanding a full, independent investigation under state law into the agents involved in these deaths. No one — federal or otherwise — is above the law of this land.\n\nIf ICE and the Border Patrol cannot operate within the Constitution, with restraint, transparency and accountability, then they are not fit to carry out their mission in Minnesota — or anywhere else.\n\nNews: Trump, Vance Blame Minneapolis Police For Not Protecting Their Federal Officers\n\nBecause when force is untethered from law, our freedom is already in danger.\n\nDiana Oestreich is a combat veteran, founder of The Waging Peace Project, and author of “Waging Peace: One Soldier’s Story of Putting Love First.” As an author, activist and soldier-turned-peacemaker, she’s a nationally recognized speaker at the intersection of justice, nonviolence, faith and how everyday peacemakers are challenging and changing our world.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

    "fullText": "Gold and silver prices have soared in the midst of global geopolitical uncertainty, concerns about the global role of the dollar, long-simmering inflation and general economic uncertainty.\n\nRegular readers of my column know that I have always advised keeping a portion of your assets in gold and gold mining shares or mutual funds. (Search my columns at TerrySavage.com using the key word “gold” and going back more than a decade.) But with today’s huge rise in gold prices, those investments have significantly increased in value, almost demanding that you evaluate your long-term positions.\n\nSome economic background is in order. CME Group Chief Economist Erik Norland has written a definitive guide to the economic forces moving the precious metals markets. He notes: “Gold ... is up 80% as of January 21. Palladium is up 105%, platinum up 175% and silver prices have tripled, rising 212%.” (That appreciation figure has since changed. You can read the entire report, including graphics, at the CME Group website.)\n\nIn an interview I asked about the dramatic rise in the price of gold. Norland explained there are five main drivers of demand:\n\nIt’s not just the United States that is running a budget deficit — currently 6% of GDP, without accounting for proposed increases in military spending. Norland notes that European nations are currently increasing their defense spending allocations, as is Canada. The Japanese have always had a huge public debt as a percentage of GDP, and now even China’s public debt is running at 8.5% of GDP. The implication is that all that spending will generate a new round of “money printing” — i.e., inflation.\n\nThe key ingredient of Norland’s outlook is the fact that inflation is just barely under control around the world, running above targets set by all central banks. In the United States, for example, the latest report of the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator (PCE) came in at 2.8% — well above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nNorland notes that despite the underlying inflationary pressures, almost every central bank is in the process of lowering interest rates. That’s the opposite of what central banks usually do to fight inflation. The exceptions are Japan, which already has such very low rates, and Brazil.\n\n—Perceived erosion of central bank independence\n\nFor nearly 80 years, central banks have “managed” currencies through interest rates and currency purchases or interventions. Their role has been to manage the balance of currencies needed for stability and world trade. But it’s not just the U.S. Federal Reserve bank that is feeling pressure to bend to political will. It’s happening around the world.",

    "description": "Plus, viewing plans for every type of fan.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Winter Olympics will kick off in Milano Cortina, Italy, beginning on Friday, Feb. 6. With more than 3,200 hours of winter sports coverage spread across broadcast, cable, and digital streaming platforms, finding what you want to watch can feel like a full-time job. So here's where and when you can watch the Olympics.\n\nWatching the Olympics is a deeply personal experience. Some love the technical precision of a perfect luge run; others dig the emotional narrative of an underdog’s journey to the podium; and some just want to catch the meme of the week as it happens. Because everyone's \"perfect Olympics\" is unique, I’ve also put together a viewing guide designed for the way you might want to experience the 2026 Games.\n\nNBCUniversal has the exclusive rights to show the Olympics in the U.S. this year, and the network is practically going all-Olympics from the opening ceremony on Feb. 6 to the closing on Feb. 22. If you're watching the Olympics in the old-school \"turn on the TV\" way, the 2026 Winter Olympics are on broadcast channel NBC and cable channels CNBC and USA Network. If you're streaming the games, you'll be doing it from Peacock.\n\nDuring primetime, NBC is showing Primetime in Milan, three hours of curated Olympics coverage, nightly, beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT, except Super Bowl Sunday, when Primetime in Milan will start at 10:45 p.m. ET.\n\nIn the daytime, NBC will be broadcasting five hours of coverage daily focusing mainly on more popular Winter Olympics coverage like snowboarding, skiing, figure skating, and hockey. Daytime Olympics programming will begin at 7 a.m. ET most days, and continue through the early afternoon, depending on the daily lineup.\n\nNBC is also airing a nightly wrap-up of each day's events after the local news; the Olympics' opening ceremony on Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET; live coverage of the closing ceremonies at 2:30 p.m. on Feb. 22, with an encore showing at 9 p.m.; and 4K Olympics coverage on Super Bowl Sunday, beginning at 7 a.m. ET.\n\nNBC-owned cable networks USA Network and CNBC will also feature Olympics content during the games.\n\nUSA Network: USA Network will be devoted to Olympics coverage nearly 24/7 during the games, showing a mix of live events and encore showings of past events. Because of the six-hour time difference from Italy to the U.S., USA Network will show live Olympic events nightly beginning around 2 a.m. ET, and feature continuing coverage through the early afternoon.\n\nCNBC: CNBC is devoted to curling (really). The cable network plans to broadcast a nightly \"Best of Curling\" show on weeknights at 5 p.m. ET, with long form coverage on weekends.\n\nIf you are planning to stream the Olympics, you'll be doing it on Peacock, NBC's streaming platform. Peacock will stream every single session of all 116 medal events live, as well as offering full-event replays of every event available on-demand.\n\n\"I want to be part of the conversation, but I don't need to watch biathlon at 4 a.m.\"\n\nIf you want high production values, dramatic stories of inspiring athletes, and exciting contests curated by sports broadcasting pros, the mainstream coverage is for you. Don't miss the opening ceremonies on Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, and catch as much of NBC's primetime coverage as you have time for. It's bound to be packed with crowd-pleasing events, give you lots of background on different athletes, and Olympics breaking news, but without a lot of obscure or boring sports.\n\nPro tip: \n\nIf you religiously follow a single sport in the Olympics, be it hockey or snowboarding, and you really don't care about, say, inspirational ice-dancer stories, your best bet is Peacock's Sports Hub, where you can watch every qualifying heat and every medal contest of only the sport you like, either live or on-demand.\n\nPro tip: Coordinate your calendar with NBC's interactive schedule to make sure you know when everything is happening.\n\n\"Half the fun of the Olympics is dishing about it.\"\n\nIf the Olympics is better as a shared experience, watch NBC.com's broadcast coverage in one window, and check out the social media feeds of NBC's \"Creator Collective,\" where TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube influencers like Kylie Kelce, Anna Sitar, and Jordan Howlett will be watching along.\n\nPro tip: Don't sleep on Reddit communities r/olympics and r/WinterOlympics2026.\n\n\"I'm irrationally passionate about a sport I'd never heard of before today.\"\n\nIf you love to discover strange new sports, the Winter Olympics are going to be fun. Skip the mainstream coverage on NBC and browse through Peacock's Sports Hub catalog for sports you've never heard of.\n\nPro tip: Don't miss the debut of Ski Mountaineering (\"SkiMo\"), the only brand-new sport at the 2026 Games. It’s a grueling hybrid where athletes who hate ski lifts for some reason hike up steep mountains before carving down high-speed technical descents.\n\n\"I absolutely cannot get enough Olympics and I want to watch as much as is humanly possible.\"\n\nIf you have a lot of time on your hands and want to see literally everything, you'll need Peacock, and to get familiar with its \"Discovery Multiview\" feature, which lets you watch up to four sporting events at the same time.\n\nPro tip: Go to the NBC Olympics Full Schedule and use the \"My Stuff\" feature to build a personalized calendar before the games start to plan your epic Olympic binge.\n\n\"I want to feel the snow in my face without leaving my house.\"\n\nIf you want the highest resolution, most immersive Olympic experience possible without traveling to Italy, do not miss 4K All-Day on NBC and Peacock on Sunday, Feb. 8 for 17 hours of 4K HDR coverage of both the Olympics and the Super Bowl. And download the Peacock app for your Meta Quest 3 or 3S headset to watch the Olympics in augmented reality, or check out the \"spatial cinema\" broadcast of the Olympics on your Apple Vision Pro.\n\nPro tip: NBC is rolling out a new streaming feature called Rinkside Live for Olympic hockey and figure skating. It lets viewers choose from multiple curated feeds of \"immersive, never-before-seen views.\"",

    "fullText": "Related video: Governor Spencer Cox spoke gave a State of the State address.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — On Tuesday, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall delivered the State of the City address. She highlighted priorities of civic development, public safety, and affordable housing.\n\nAt the beginning of the address, the Red Spirit Singers of the Uintah Tribe offered a presentation. Then, the CEO of the 2034 Olympics spoke about the city’s preparations for the upcoming Games and stated that Mendenhall has been instrumental in bringing the Games back to Utah.\n\nHe added that the games will bring a possibility of unity throughout the state, and all residents will be able to be involved in the community to bring the Olympic spirit locally.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nDuring her speech, Mendenhall highlighted several of her priorities and the issues facing her constituents and the city. One thing she spoke on was the 2025 safety plan recommendation, and she says they have completed over half of the outlined solutions and are now working on implementing the long-term solutions.\n\nMendenhall also noted the city completed the voter streets bond, resurfaced and replaced hundreds of miles of roads, and finished phase one of Glendale Park.\n\n“The next chapter of our city’s story and our state’s and our nation’s is not waiting to be written. We’re writing it now, and in doing so, we will not stand still. We will not slow our commitments, and we will not govern for comfort when the moment calls for resolve,” Mendenhall said.\n\nShe emphasized that the state of the city will be determined by what comes next, not by what they have already done.\n\nMendenhall partially addressed issues of public safety and brought up an ongoing controversy surrounding a proposed immigration detention center in Salt Lake City. Members of the community protested the center, and Mendenhall stated that she sent a letter to the owners, stating that the city code prevents a large-scale housing center at the warehouse’s location in its current form. The warehouse’s owners stated in a press release on Saturday that they had no intent to sell or lease the property.\n\nOwners and investors of warehouse rumored to be used as ICE facility say they have ‘no plans to sell’ to the federal government\n\nMendenhall also spoke on national issues with immigration, including controversy after two people were shot and killed by ICE officers in Minneapolis.\n\n“I want to make it clear that I am prepared to use every tool under my control to protect the values of Salt Lake City and the dignity of every one of our residents,” Mendenhall said. “To this end, we have introduced the Future Citizens Path program to support eligible green card holders in Salt Lake City through the U.S. Citizenship process.”\n\nShe also addressed homelessness issues within the city and spoke on Project Connect, which targeted individuals with high arrest rates and connected them with social workers. 60% of those individuals reduced the frequency of arrests, and Mendenhall says they hope to expand this program in 2026.\n\nTen bills to keep an eye on during the 2026 General Legislative Session\n\nIn addition to reducing crime rates in homeless communities, Mendenhall stated that Salt Lake City will launch a program to invest in repairs to existing affordable housing and help renters become homeowners.\n\nAdditionally, Mendenhall mentioned that ongoing efforts would add more community centers throughout Salt Lake City, involving residents in each area. To this end, she shared planned designs for Salt Lake City’s civic center.\n\n“We owe it to those who came before us to protect those seeking a better life to ensure those who arrive are not persecuted for their beliefs like so many of Utah’s first pioneers, but that they are embraced,” Mayor Mendenhall said, concluding her speech. “That they are welcomed. That they may become a part of our strong community.”\n\nIncreased police presence at University of Utah after bomb threat reported\n\nFlorida man sentenced to prison on charges connected with South Jordan 15-year-old who disappeared for a month\n\nHouse committee hears bill created to address electric-assisted bicycle (e-bike) safety concerns\n\nHouse Republicans warn against Senate changing DHS funding bill\n\nThis is The Place Heritage Park is the spot for weddings, reunions, and big days",

    "fullText": "February can still feel like deep winter across much of North America, with snowstorms and blasts of Arctic air still very much on the table. But the calendar is quietly shifting in the background: Daylight starts stacking up faster, and by the end of the month, the change is hard to miss.\n\nThe reason is simple astronomy. Since the December solstice, the Northern Hemisphere has been slowly tilting toward the sun again. In the first few weeks after the solstice, the daily increase in daylight is modest. By February, that gain becomes more noticeable, especially in places farther north.\n\nLatitude is the key. Locations closer to the poles see bigger swings in daylight over the year, while places closer to the equator change more gradually. That's why the same month can feel like a major turning point in one city and a smaller nudge in another.\n\nIn New York City, daylight typically increases by a couple minutes per day. Over the course of the month, that adds up quickly, with the sun in the sky one hour and seven minutes longer on Feb. 28 when compared to Feb. 1.\n\nIn Miami, the shift is still there, but it's more subtle. Because South Florida is much closer to the equator, February adds 37 minutes of daylight from start to finish.\n\nLonger days also reshape the schedule of the sky. Sunrise creeps earlier, sunset slides later, and nighttime slowly loses ground. That means less time for dark-sky viewing at convenient hours, even though winter can still deliver clear, crisp nights in many places.\n\nDaylight will keep building across the Northern Hemisphere through spring until the summer solstice in June, when the sun reaches its highest path in the sky for the year. After that, the trend reverses: Days begin shrinking again, and nights gradually lengthen until the next winter solstice.",

    "title": "Russian Scientists Test Plasma Engine That Could Cut Mars Travel to About 30 Days",
    "description": "Russia is testing a plasma engine prototype designed to slash Mars travel time to just 60 days. Developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, the system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate particles to 100 km/s, promising a flight-ready model for deep-space missions by 2030.",
    "fullText": "Russia is quietly testing a new plasma propulsion system that, if it performs as claimed, could dramatically change how long it takes to travel to Mars. Early results suggest a leap in speed and efficiency that has drawn attention precisely because it is not coming from NASA or private U.S. companies such as SpaceX.\n\nThe engine is being developed by the Troitsk Institute, part of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. According to researchers involved in the program, the system could reduce interplanetary travel time from several months to roughly one to two months. Ground-based testing is currently underway, and the developers say the technology could be ready for space deployment by around 2030.\n\nUnlike conventional chemical rockets, the new system relies on electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged hydrogen particles. This places it firmly in the category of electric or plasma propulsion, a field that has gained increasing global attention as space agencies look for more efficient ways to travel deeper into the solar system.\n\nChemical rockets deliver very high thrust for a short time, which is ideal for launching from Earth. However, they are inefficient for long-distance travel once a spacecraft is in orbit. Plasma engines, by contrast, generate much lower thrust but can operate continuously for long periods, gradually building up extremely high speeds while using far less propellant.\n\nIf the Russian system achieves its projected performance, it could have a major impact on how future missions to Mars and beyond are planned, both for scientific exploration and for potential military or logistical applications.\n\nThe prototype engine is currently being tested inside a 14-meter-long vacuum chamber designed to simulate space conditions. According to technical details reported by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the engine operates at a power level of 300 kilowatts in a pulsed periodic mode and has already demonstrated a working lifespan of 2,400 hours. That duration would be sufficient for a full Mars mission, including acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\nResearchers say the engine accelerates charged hydrogen particles, including protons and electrons, to speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second. By comparison, traditional chemical rockets typically achieve exhaust velocities of around 4.5 kilometers per second. This massive difference in exhaust velocity is the key to the engine’s potential efficiency and speed.\n\nThe plasma engine is not intended to launch directly from Earth’s surface. A conventional chemical rocket would first carry the spacecraft into low Earth orbit. Once in space, the plasma engine would be activated to provide continuous thrust for the journey through deep space.\n\nOfficials involved in the project also note that the system could function as a space tug, moving cargo, modules, or satellites between different planetary orbits. This concept aligns with broader international interest in reusable orbital transport systems.\n\nThe engine uses hydrogen as propellant and relies on an onboard nuclear reactor to provide a constant energy supply. According to project researcher Yegor Biryulin, hydrogen’s low atomic mass allows for faster acceleration while reducing fuel consumption. Its abundance in space could eventually allow for in situ refueling, at least in theory.\n\nThe propulsion system uses two high-voltage electrodes to create directed plasma flow. Charged particles pass between them, forming a magnetic field that expels plasma and generates thrust. This design avoids the need to heat plasma to extreme temperatures, which reduces component wear and improves overall efficiency.\n\nRosatom documentation lists the projected thrust at 6 newtons, which is high for a plasma propulsion prototype. Even so, the thrust remains far lower than chemical rockets, meaning spacecraft would be designed for slow but continuous acceleration rather than short bursts of power.\n\nPlasma propulsion is already used in orbit on many satellites, including systems on OneWeb spacecraft and on NASA’s Psyche mission launched in 2023. Most existing plasma engines operate at exhaust velocities between 30 and 50 kilometers per second. The Russian claims of 100 kilometers per second would represent a significant step forward.\n\nHowever, the technology remains unproven in space. Peer-reviewed scientific data have not yet been published, and the nuclear reactor design has not been disclosed. Nuclear-powered spacecraft raise complex safety, regulatory, and international approval issues, especially during launch.\n\nWhile the concept is promising, the engine is still years away from practical use. Its projected readiness by 2030 will depend on continued testing, funding, and successful resolution of engineering and regulatory challenges.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "title": "What Is 'UpScrolled,' and Why Are People Switching to It From TikTok?",
    "description": "UpScrolled: so hot right now.",
    "fullText": "TikTok's having a rough 2026. The app recently switched ownership from the Chinese-based ByteDance to the new \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture,\" which, as the name implies, is a majority American-owned business entity. Any changing of the guard comes with the risk for disruptions and issues, but it seems TikTok's problems have gone beyond the usual rocky transition. First, the app itself went down, which the company attributed to a power outage at a data center. Then, users accused the platform of updating its terms of service with aggressive new tracking, blocking certain content types, and \"shadowbanning\" new posts from some users.\n\nIt's still not clear exactly what's going on here, but users aren't waiting around for more explanation. In fact, many have made up their minds already, and believe the app is actively suppressing content, neutering algorithms, and invading privacy in a way it didn't under ByteDance. While there are other, popular social media platforms to jump to, many apparently have flocked to a relatively new one: UpScrolled. As of this article, it's now the second most popular free app on the iOS App Store, reminding me of when X users ran to Bluesky.\n\nUpScrolled, created by Issam Hijazi, is a social media platform that launched this past June. According to the company's \"About\" page, UpScrolled's mission is to allow all users to share their views without risk of bias, shadowbanning, or \"unfair\" algorithms. The company asserts it does not push agendas, and ensures that \"every post has a fair chance to be seen.\" If you believe TikTok's algorithm is now biased against your views, I could see how that pitch sounds enticing.\n\nThe company says it only restricts content that violates their guidelines. That means illegal activities, hate speech, bullying and harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted content, or anything \"intended to cause harm.\" UpScrolled will also never ban you without your knowledge. If the platform removes your videos or your account, it says it'll let you know why.\n\nOne big difference between UpScrolled and other social media platforms is its algorithm. The app splits feeds into two: There's the Following Feed, which lists posts entirely in chronological order. The first posts are the newest from your followers, and you scroll through previous posts. If you want to find new posts from accounts you don't follow, you can use the Discover Feed. But unlike TikTok or Instagram, the Discover Feed does not employ some aggressive, personalized algorithm. Instead, it's based on likes, comments, and reshares. Popular posts from across the platform are shared with you\n\nWhat I especially appreciate is UpScrolled's approach to data collection, in that they largely don't do it. The company says it doesn't sell user data to third-parties for marketing, tracking, or for profit. The only times they'll hand over user data is when compelled by law. That's in sharp contrast to many social media platforms, which seem to collect as much of your data as possible.\n\nI haven't spent much time with the app yet, though I did create an account this morning to see what the hullabaloo was all about. I don't recognize any of the users the app suggests I follow, which means I'll likely need to dig through the content types if I want to find accounts to start following.\n\nThe Discover Feed is a mix of content types, but is heavy with content surrounding the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In fact, many users are choosing the platform as a space for pro-Palestinian content, in response to allegations that mainstream social media apps censor these types of posts. That said, the app advertises a host of different content types to follow, including sports, news, games, film, music, tech, and travel.\n\nAs you might expect, some of the posts here are simply ripped from TikTok, which is a common practice I see on social media platforms that, well, aren't TikTok. Despite the current controversy, it's clear which platform still has the largest user share at this time, by a long shot.\n\nBut it's not all short-form videos. The app also includes plenty of posts of static images as well, which reminds me more of Instagram than TikTok. Still, it seems former TikTok users don't care that this isn't a one-to-one replica of the TikTok formula, and care more about sending a message to the app they once loved being addicted to.\n\nI'm not sure my limited journey with UpScrolled this morning will keep me hooked, but it's an interesting take on a social media platform. We'll just need to see if the growth will continue, or if this is just a momentary blip before people return to TikTok.",

    "fullText": "Not to be outdone by Apple's \"Lockdown Mode,\" Meta is rolling out new security features for WhatsApp designed to protect high-risk users—journalists, activists, and government officials, for example—from cyber attacks. Strict Account Settings is a \"lockdown-style\" mode that builds on the platform's existing end-to-end encryption, adding stronger privacy features and additional restrictions against unknown contacts.\n\nFor most WhatsApp users, this level of lockdown is overkill. However, people with access to sensitive data that is potentially valuable to threat actors actually have been targeted with spyware campaigns through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, so for users like that, it may be a lifesaver. (In the last year, WhatsApp has also patched multiple zero-day exploits that allowed spyware to proliferate.)\n\nAs noted, the new WhatsApp settings are similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, an OS-level feature that blocks attachments, link previews, and communication from unknown contacts alongside some other settings changes. It also disables wired connections to external devices and a range of web features. Android's Advanced Protection offers similar functionality.\n\nStrict Account Settings automatically enables existing privacy and security settings and adds a host of restrictions to users' communication and visibility on WhatsApp.\n\nTwo-step verification and security notifications, which alert you if a contact's security code changes, are turned on.\n\nHigh volumes of messages from unknown accounts are blocked\n\nOnly your contacts or those added to a pre-established list can see information about you, including your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile.\n\nOnly known contacts or those on your pre-established list can add you to groups.\n\nThese controls can be enabled by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and toggling on Strict account settings. Settings must be changed on your primary device and cannot be updated on the web. Note that the feature will roll out gradually over the coming weeks, and may not be immediately available.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Google Chrome User Should Know",
    "description": "There's a lot to dig into in Google's browser.",
    "fullText": "It feels as though Google Chrome has been around forever, but it's actually still just a teenager: The browser launched back in 2008, originally just for Windows—though it's now made its way to macOS, Linux, and mobile devices too of course. It's a powerhouse of a browser that is more widely used than any other.\n\nIn the 18 years since its release, Chrome has changed a lot: A host of features have been added and taken away down the years, and it's very possible that you don't know everything that Chrome can do, even if you use it every day. Here are my favorite hacks for Chrome, covering everything from casting tabs to playing audio and video.\n\nIf you've always stuck with the 'out of the box' Chrome aesthetic, you might not be aware that it's relatively simple to change up the theme of the browser—which covers the colors of menus and tabs, as well as what you see on the new tab page. To see the available options, open up a new tab, then click the Customize Chrome button (lower right).\n\nYou can apply any of the color themes just by clicking on them, or set up your own colors by clicking the color picker (the little pipette icon). For a more significant visual overhaul, click Change theme: You'll then see a range of options created and curated by Google. Click Chrome Web Store to see more official and third-party themes you can install.\n\nIt's fair to say Chrome doesn't have the best reputation for efficient RAM usage, but you can get some of it back. In any tab, click the three dots (top right), then choose Settings > Performance, and activate the Memory Saver option. As Google explains, this will put tabs you've not used in a while in an inactive state, and recover some RAM from them.\n\nIt's not a Chrome feature that gets much attention, but you can cast tabs wireless to a big screen via Google TV or Chromecast devices. It's useful for everything from music streaming to slide presentations, though the latency is usually too high for video playback (and bear in mind that YouTube, for example, has its own casting button for this).\n\nWith a tab open in Chrome, click the three dots in the top right corner, then choose Cast, save and share > Cast. You'll then be asked to choose the device to cast to (which must be on the same wifi network of course). Via the Sources button, you can choose to cast just the tab you're in, or your entire Windows or macOS desktop, including Google Chrome.\n\nJust because you use Google Chrome doesn't mean you have to use Google Search—maybe you want to switch to a privacy-first alternative, like DuckDuckGo. To set up search engines in Chrome and change the default one, click the three dots in the top right corner of any tab, then choose Settings, and open the Search engine page.\n\nUse the Add button to add new search engines, the pencil icons on the right to edit their details, and the three dots on the right to set which one is used by default (when you type some search terms into the Chrome address bar). Each search engine can also have a shortcut: Type the shortcut into the address bar to run a search using that specific site.\n\nTab grouping can make it much easier to manage the myriad tabs you've got open in every single session—these groups can be moved and closed and saved all together, so you could set up different groups for different research projects, for example, or for different tasks in the browser (maybe one for work-related browsing and another for shopping).\n\nThe easiest way to get started with tab groups in Chrome is to right click on a tab header and pick Add tab to new group from the pop-up menu. Give your tab a name and color, and if you then right-click on other tab headers, you'll be able to add them to the group (or create a new one). Right-click on the headers of grouped tabs to access further options.\n\nUser profiles are a hugely powerful Chrome capability that more people should know about: It lets you split your browsing into work and personal categories, for example, (and separate Google accounts, if needed). It means that logins, browsing history, and all the other data that gets stored in Chrome don't all get lumped together in one place.\n\nSo, you could use your work profile for the day, and then switch to your personal profile at night—making it easier to access your Netflix login and Amazon shopping history, for example. To get started with profiles, click your current profile avatar (in the top right corner, next to the three dots), then choose Add Chrome profile from the menu.\n\nIf you're prepared to invest some time and effort into your Chrome hacking, give the Tampermonkey extension a look (it's actually available for several browsers, not just Chrome). The tool lets you inject your own custom code to modify the websites you're looking at, so you can alter the appearance or even the functionality of pages.\n\nYou could remove distractions from a page, for example, add your own keyboard shortcuts for navigation, or insert new buttons for sharing links on social media. We don't have the space for a full tutorial here, but if you head to the Tampermonkey website you'll find a wealth of help to get you started, plus some links to user script repositories on the web.\n\nThere are plenty of powerful web apps you can get at through Chrome—Slack, Gmail, Spotify—and Google's browser lets you set these up as if they were desktop apps in Windows or macOS. You can get a shortcut straight to the app on the Windows taskbar or macOS dock, and when you launch it, it appears in its own distinct desktop window.\n\nWith the web app open in Chrome, click the three dots (top right), then choose Cast, save and share > Install page as app. You'll then be asked to give your new app a name, and click Install to confirm. The app launches right away, and you can then organize it into your Windows or macOS system as you want (by pinning it to the taskbar, for example).\n\nChrome comes with a built-in Safety Check that runs an audit on passwords, security updates, third-party extensions, and more. You can find the Safety Check screen by clicking the three dots to the top right of any tab, then choosing Settings > Privacy and security: As well as running the check, you can follow the recommended actions.\n\nGoogle Chrome can handle more than webpages: It's also able to open up PDF documents, and image, video, and audio files saved in common formats (like MP3 or MOV). Just drag a file into an empty tab to open it, or associate the file type with Chrome in Windows or macOS (which means it'll automatically open in the browser when you double-click on it).\n\nChrome isn't the most advanced PDF editor or video player you're ever going to see, but it's a quick and easy way of opening up local files without having to launch an entirely separate program each time. You could use this alongside the Split View feature, for example, to watch a video stored on your system while making notes in Google Docs.",

    "title": "Chrome Can Now Use AI to Browse the Internet for You",
    "description": "Does the large language model need to disassociate too?",
    "fullText": "Have you ever wanted to browse the internet, but the thought of typing a URL into your address bar seemed just too exhausting? Now, Google's here to help. Today, the company announced a big expansion of its existing Gemini in Chrome feature, with the highlights including a new look for the AI companion, more-integrated image editing tools, and, perhaps most impressive (but also creepy), the launch of Auto Browse, which lets Gemini take the wheel when you're going online.\n\nPreviously, Gemini in Chrome appeared in a small box on top of your browser, which made it a bit inconvenient to use, especially when bouncing between tabs. Google's update moves it to a scrollable side panel view that's a bit bigger, and it won't obscure any of your other content. Instead, it'll sit to the right of the webpage your viewing, so you can more easily compare whatever answers Gemini gives you with what you're seeing, or carry on a conversation while bouncing between multiple tabs. It will retain all the same functionality as before, including the ability to reference multiple open tabs in prompts. It's a small change, but should help for usability.\n\nGoogle's Nano Banana image generation AI is having a bit of a moment, and the new Gemini in Chrome updates make it easier to use. Now, instead of having to download an image and re-upload it to Gemini, you can edit it using Nano Banana with a simple right click. Or, you could also use natural language to start an edit by pulling up the image you want to edit on your screen and telling Gemini to edit it in the side panel. Google says this should work with pretty much any image you can pull up on the browser.\n\nDuring a demo, Google showed this off to journalists using a Google Photos library, but there's nothing saying you have to stick to your own images. That immediately set off alarm bells for me, given Elon Musk's X is currently in hot water after opening up the ability for anyone to use Grok to edit other people's images directly on the social media platform and without their permission. After some users started using that tool to generate explicit content from others' photos, it was pared down a bit, but Google doesn't seem worried. When I asked about safety protections for this feature, a Google spokesperson told me the following:\n\n\"We have clear policies that prohibit the use of our AI tools to generate sexually explicit content, and our tools are continually getting better at reflecting these policies. We've invested in safety from the outset and added technical guardrails to help limit problematic outputs such as violent, offensive, or sexually explicit content.\"\n\nThe company didn't say anything about how users might use Nano Banana in Chrome to circumvent copyright, but technically, the new update doesn't really add new features to Google's AI image generator, it just makes it easier to access. Granted, the same thing applied to Grok's recent update, too, and easier access can mean opening the floodgates, even if you have the best of intentions.\n\nFinally, the big one: \"Agentic\" has been the hot buzzword in AI as of late, and Google doesn't want Chrome to be left behind. So now, instead of just answering questions, Gemini can take control of your browser for you.\n\nThe functionality is currently limited to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers, but starting today, those subscribers can ask Chrome to \"Auto Browse\"—completing research, taking you to different websites, and filling out forms for you.\n\nYou can watch as the AI navigates around the web, or you can click away to a different tab while it works in the background. Multiple tabs can Auto Browse at the same time, so you can have a few tasks going on at once. The AI will list out the steps it takes in the side panel while it navigates around, to make checking in on it easier.\n\nGoogle demonstrated this to journalists by showing the AI finding a specific product, navigating to its store page, singing into the buyer's account (using Google Password Manager), and adding it to their cart. The company also suggested you could use Auto Browse to schedule appointments, fill out an online form using information from an uploaded PDF, collect tax documents, compare apartments listed on sites like Redfin, and more. I haven't been able to go hands-on with it yet, so I can't speak to how well it'll perform any of these tasks, although it did look snappy in the controlled demo.\n\nMy concern with Auto Browse mostly lies in sketchy websites and permissions, although Google told me it's planned for those. Auto Browse needs to get permission before it can access your Google Password Manager, and if it stumbles across a link that the AI thinks doesn't look quite right, it will supposedly use Chrome's existing unsafe browsing protections to navigate away. A Google spokesperson told me its \"as secure as you can make it,\" although I'd probably want to keep an eye on it for at least my first few requests.\n\nThe feature also has one limitation for now—while it can be open in multiple tabs at once, your Auto Browse tabs won't be able to communicate with one another. That means each instance of Auto Browse is isolated, but that could change in the future.\n\nPersonally, I don't see myself using this much, especially for sensitive tasks like \"collecting tax documents,\" but automatically filling out a basic form does sound handy. Google said that Auto Browse will stop and ask for you to take over for sensitive steps in any tasks that might require it, like actually buying an item or submitting a form. It won't (or isn't supposed to) take that final step for you, giving you a chance to check its work. In that way, it's similar to the Gemini app's existing shopping features.\n\nGemini in Chrome can use most of Gemini's existing features, allowing it to connect with apps like Gmail or access your history chatting with the bot. But there is one big one that's planned for the \"coming months.\"\n\nRecently, the Gemini app proper rolled out a beta for \"Personal Intelligence\" to paying users, allowing the AI to view all of your past conversations and connected apps without you having to direct it where to look. It's basically an extension of those existing connected apps and history features, with a reasoning model applied over it. For instance, you could tell it to help you find new tires for your car, and it would automatically know to look through your Gmail and Google Photos to find out what model of car you have and the last time you bought tires.\n\nThat feature is still baking, but that it's even in the works means Google is moving fast on bringing parity between all the different ways you can access Gemini. Every other feature mentioned in this article is either already available, or rolling out now.",

    "title": "You Can Finally Clean Up Your Mac’s Menu Bar (Without Using Third-Party Software)",
    "description": "Hide icons in the settings, then shrink the space between icons.",
    "fullText": "The Mac menu bar is a bit of a mess. Way too many applications want to put icons in the top-right corner of the screen, and most users only want to see a fraction of those. This is a particular problem on recent MacBooks, where the camera notch blacks out a chunk of space right in the middle of the menu bar. This is why applications for cleaning up the Mac menu bar are so popular—the clutter can feel overwhelming.\n\nHere's the thing, though: You probably don't need to leave applications like that running constantly. You can hide icons in macOS' Settings, then use a free tool once to move all the icons closer together. Here's how.\n\nTahoe, also known as macOS 26, gave users a lot to talk about, which meant a few features were broadly overlooked. One of them: the ability to hide any menu bar icon, no third party software required. To use this feature open System Settings and head to the Menu Bar section. You will see the ability to toggle system icons, like Siri and Spotlight, on and off. Keep scrolling, though, and you'll find the ability to hide icons for any of your installed applications. Just toggle off any application you'd rather not see in the menu bar and it will disappear.\n\nI've been using this to disable unwanted icons for months, and it's working well for me. Having said that, though, it isn't a perfect replacement. Applications like Bartender and Ice don't just hide icons—they give you access to a secondary tray where you can still occasionally access icons you hid. There's no quick way to do that using the macOS settings. Still: It's a free way to hide unwanted icons, and there's no need to keep third party software running.\n\nIf your menu bar still feels crowded, you can free up a bit more space by squeezing all of your icons together. A free application called Menu Bar Spacing lets you change the spacing in your menu bar. Just \n\nThe great thing about Menu Bar Spacing, as an application, is that it doesn't need to run constantly. You can launch it once, make the changes you like, and then delete it—your setting will still apply. This is because the application changes a few hidden macOS settings. You can make the changes yourself using the Terminal if you prefer not to use an app, but I think the app makes things a little bit easier.\n\nThere's a bit of a caveat for macOS 26 users. Because of a bug, only Apple's own icons will move closer together at first. Your other applications will need to be restarted before they bunch closer together. That means you'll need to manually close and re-launch each application, or simply restart your Mac. It's annoying, but only relevant right after you change the settings. And you'll have a lot more space on your menu bar once you're done.",

I’m one of the many people who added daily walks to my routine during the pandemic, and they improved my life so much I don’t intend to stop. But does walking do enough for your body that you can count it as cardio exercise?\n\nThe answer is complicated. Walking counts as cardio in some respects: it can burn calories, it gets your heart rate up, and it counts toward the exercise we should all be getting every week. But on the other hand, it’s not going to increase your cardio fitness in the same way as a run or an intense aerobics class would. If you want to improve your endurance, you’ll have to do more than just walk.\n\nRunning burns more calories than walking per unit time, but both are similar when you consider distance.\n\nA rule of thumb is that you burn about 100 calories per mile whether you run it or walk it, but in truth calorie burn varies according to the size of your body (you burn more calories if you are larger) and how fast you run or walk. The calories per mile are slightly lower when you walk. This calculator estimates that a 150-pound person will burn 108 calories by walking a mile at 3 miles per hour, or 104 calories by running it at 6 miles per hour. Some calculators give a lower estimate for walking,\n\nThe bigger difference is in calories per hour (rather than calories per mile): for the same 150-pound person, walking burns 324 calories per hour, and running burns 627. The faster you go, the higher the calorie burn. So if you’re walking or running to burn calories, running will burn about double the calories in a given time. But if you prefer walking and you have the time to spare, both will do the job.\n\nEach intensity level of exercise offers its own benefits. Walking is what I’d consider very easy cardio, jogging is more of a medium exercise, and high-intensity cardio would be something like sprinting or racing. All of these are good for you, although depending on your goals, you may not need to do all of them.\n\nIf you want to be a fast runner, for example, you’ll need plenty of medium cardio (slow running) and some higher intensity stuff (speedwork); if you want to improve your endurance, as measured by metrics like VO2max, you’ll definitely need to put in some work at these intensities.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re just trying to get some movement in your life and you don’t care about getting better at it, lower intensity exercise like walking may be enough.\n\nAccording to major health organizations (including the CDC, the WHO, and the AHA), we should all be getting at least 150 minutes per week of “moderate” exercise, or 75 minutes of “vigorous” exercise. You can mix and match, with the idea that each minute of vigorous exercise counts double.\n\nSo where does walking fall in that recommendation? Walking is moderate, and I have more here on how that's defined. But if you want a rule of thumb to compare it to heart rate, the American Heart Association defines moderate exercise as that in which your heart rate is between 50-70% of your max, and vigorous exercise as between 70-85% of your max. (That does assume you know your true max.) Walking will generally be in the moderate range, so you’ll have to do twice as much of it—counting in minutes—as if you chose to do more vigorous cardio. That matches up with our calorie calculations.\n\nThe distinction between walking and running is a mechanical one: if you always have at least one foot on the ground, you’re walking. If instead your gait has a little hop as you move from foot to foot, you’re running. (Jogging is simply a slow run.)\n\nIt’s often easier to keep up a higher intensity (and a higher heart rate) by running than by walking, but that’s not always true. If you’re hiking up a mountain, your heart rate can easily get into the “vigorous” zone. And if you’re an efficient enough runner, you may be able to go for a slow jog while you keep your heart rate down in the “moderate” realm.\n\nAs you’re planning your workouts, think about the intensity: Measure your heart rate if you aren’t sure where you fall; you can use a tracker like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch to do this, but you can also just put two fingers on the side of your neck and count the beats of your pulse. If your max is 200 and you count 150 beats per minute, you’re at 75% of your max heart rate.\n\nMaybe walking gets you a higher heart rate than you thought—not impossible if you’re a beginner or if your walks take you over hilly terrain. If you want a tougher cardio workout, you can walk faster, or you can choose a different type of exercise like cycling or dancing that gets your heart rate up higher. But it’s fine to go for an easy walk if that’s all you’re aiming for.",

    "title": "Moltbot (Formerly Clawdbot) Already Has a Malware Problem",
    "description": "If you use it, make sure you haven't installed this malicious extension.",
    "fullText": "Moltbot (formerly known as Clawdbot) is the most viral AI product I've seen in a while. The personal AI assistant runs locally and connects via a chat app, like WhatsApp or iMessage. Once you give Moltbot access to your entire device, it can do things on that device for you. This the sort of thing that excites agentic AI pioneers, but worries privacy and security enthusiasts like myself.\n\nAnd indeed, I have significant concerns about the risks installing Moltbot on your personal machine. Since agentic AI will autonomously perform tasks based on prompts, bad actors can take advantage of the situation by surreptitiously feeding those bots malicious prompts of their own. This is called prompt injection, and it can impact any type of agentic AI system, whether an AI browser, or an AI assistant like Moltbot.\n\nBut it's not just prompt injection that presents an issue for Moltbot users.\n\nAs spotted by The Hacker News, Moltbot already has its first malicious extension, dubbed \"Clawdbot Agent - AI Coding Assistant\" (\"clawdbot.clawdbot-agent.\") It seems to have been developed before the bot's name change. This extension is designed for Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's open source AI code editor. What's worse, it was hosted on Microsoft's official Extension Marketplace, which no doubt gave it legitimacy to Moltbot users looking for a Visual Studio Code extension.\n\nThe extension advertised itself as a free AI coding assistant. When you install it, it executes a series of commands that ends up running a remote desktop program (The Hacker News says it's \"ConnectWise ScreenConnect\") on your device. It then connects to a link that lets the bad actor gain remote access to your device. By just installing this extension, you essentially give the hacker the tools to take over your computer from wherever they are.\n\nLuckily, Microsoft has already taken action. The extension is no longer available on the marketplace as of Tuesday. Moltbot has no official Visual Studio Code extension, so assume any you see are illegitimate at best, and malicious at worst. If you did install the extension, researchers have detailed instructions for removing the malware and blocingk any of its processes from running on your device. Of course, to first thing to do is uninstall the extension from Visual Studio Code immediately.\n\nThe Hacker News goes on to highlight findings from security researcher Jamieson O'Reilly, who discovered hundreds of unauthenticated Moltbot instances readily available on the internet. These instances reveal Moltbot users' configuration data, API keys, OAuth credentials, and even chat histories.\n\nBad actors could use these instances for prompt injection: They could pretend to be a Moltbot user, and issue their own prompts to that user's Moltbot AI assistant, or manipulate existing prompts and responses. They could also upload malicious \"skills,\" or specific collections of context and knowledge, to MoltHub and use them to attack users and steal their data.\n\nSpeaking to The Hacker News, security researcher Benjamin Marr explains that the core issue is how Moltbot is designed for \"ease of deployment\" over a \"secure-by-default\" set up. You can poke around with Moltbot and install sensitive programs without the bot ever warning you about the security risks. There should be firewalls, credential validation, and sandboxing in the mix, and without those things, the user is at greater risk.\n\nTo combat against this, The Hacker News recommends that all Moltbot users running with the default security configurations take the following steps:\n\nremove any connected service integrations\n\nOr, you could do what I'm doing, and avoid Moltbot altogether.",

It operates a factory in Chicago and has outsourced some business to a factory in China.\n\nLike many smaller U.S. candy manufacturers, it has faced consistent pressure from higher domestic sugar costs and competition from lower-cost imports, leading to consolidation or relocation of production.\n\n\"Primrose Candy Co., a Chicago-based manufacturer of nonchocolate confectionery products, filed for chapter 11 protection on January 27, 2026, in the Northern District of Illinois. The company is seeking to restructure its financial obligations while maintaining its manufacturing presence in the Midwest,\" according to an RK Consulting post on X, the former Twitter.\n\nThe Chapter 11 filing for Primrose Candy Co. was confirmed on PacerMonitor and reported by Bondoro, detailing assets estimated between $1 million and $10 million and liabilities of $10 million to $50 million.\n\n\"As of 2026, the company continues to operate a 130,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Chicago, though it recently faced significant headwinds including the loss of two major contracts for lemon drop production worth approximately $1 million annually,\" according to the RK Consulting post.\n\nThe company blamed those losses on \"lower-cost foreign competition.\"\n\n\"Additionally, the company managed liabilities related to a $125,000 biometric privacy settlement regarding the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) that reached a fairness hearing in July 2025,\" it added.",

The fact that we were able to pull off an event of the century is just insane. We had 275,000 people that attended and a stadium overflow,\" Erika said, in the leaked audio.\n\nShe added, \"I think we're at like 200,000 for merch sales. Don't quote me on that, cause I think it just keeps like bumping up like crazy. I just wanted to say a huge, huge thank you to the events team, the development team, the graphic design team, and the production team.\"\n\nHearing Erika speak so cheerfully about merchandise sales in the wake of her husband's death was sure to raise eyebrows, but her apparent dismissal of his passing was even more shocking.\n\nMidway through her speech, she candidly urged her staff to resolve any past conflicts among themselves before going on to make the comment about Charlie's death.\n\n\"My husband's dead. Like, I'm not trying to be morbid, but he's dead. And it puts life into perspective of how short life is, and relationships,\" Erika said.\n\nIn response, Owens then said on her podcast that she was surprised by Erika's seemingly calm reaction.\n\n\"In my imagination, I just thought that she would be more upset,\" the right-wing influencer noted.\n\nThe reaction to the leaked audio of Erika has been somewhat divided, with several calling out the widow's overly cheerful attitude, while others noted she was simply making the best of a bad situation.\n\nA critic on X noted, \"The most gleeful leftist you can imagine, isn't half as happy over Charlie Kirk's death as Charlie Kirk's wife.\"\n\nAnother person wrote,\" 'People mourn differently,' But no one mourns like this.\"\n\n\"That is the first time she sounds authentic, being happy about merch at the memorial of her husband, crazy, every other speech she gave about her husband sounds like bad acting,\" a third person commented about the leaked audio.\n\nHowever, several showed support for Erika, with someone asking, \"What's she supposed to do? Not address and thank the team that put on her husband's memorial?\"\n\nAnother said, \"Erika is excited that millions of people heard the gospel of Jesus Christ. Why are we upset about this?!\"\n\nSince taking over from Charlie, Erika has hosted several TPUSA events and recently launched another under the non-profit Faith arm.\n\nThe inaugural \"Make Heaven Crowded\" tour will visit 30 cities this year to call people to \"repentance, faith, and bold obedience to Jesus.\"\n\n\"This tour is so special to me because I wanted … to bring a slice of heaven from my husband and bring it to everyone around this county so that they could have that extension, and that beauty and that palpable feeling of the Holy Spirit,\" Erika said about the tour to an audience of thousands, per the New York Post.\n\nThe mother of two went on to reiterate her commitment to pushing further her husband's faith legacy.\n\n\"Church is never meant to retreat from culture. We will change this country. We will change this world,\" she added.\n\nUnfortunately for Erika, the tour, which is still in its early days, was quickly overshadowed by controversy surrounding Pastor Greg Laurie's role as a primary speaker.\n\nLaurie, the senior pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, has been named in a series of lawsuits filed in U.S. federal court alleging child abuse and trafficking by former pastor Paul Havsgaard.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that church leaders, including Laurie, allowed Havsgaard to act without oversight and overlooked multiple warning signs of his alleged misconduct when he ran church-supported children's homes in Romania from 1998 to 2008.\n\nLaurie and his church have since denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\"This isn't Charlie's Turning Point. Erika is not doing what Charlie would do, ugh,\" a second individual commented about Laurie's inclusion.",

    "fullText": "Footage published on Wednesday appeared to show Alex Pretti kicking an immigration agent’s car before getting thrown to the ground during a confrontation less than two weeks before he was shot and killed in Minneapolis.\n\nThe News Movement was the outlet that captured the incident on Jan. 13. It said in an X post that it “appears to be Alex Pretti interacting with federal immigration agents” and that it had the clip analyzed by the BBC, “whose facial recognition technology confirmed his identify to a 97% degree of accuracy.”\n\nThe BBC confirmed the authenticity of the video in their 10 p.m. GMT news broadcast. Reporter Ros Atkins said the man in the video “has the same coat, facial hair and gait as Alex Pretti and a facial recognition tool suggests a 97% match. We see him shouting abuse at the agents.” Separately, a spokesperson for the BBC confirmed to Mediaite that they reviewed the footage and verified its team did use facial recognition technology on the video.\n\nYou can watch the BBC footage below, or watch the footage on their website (the relevant portion begins at the :50 mark):\n\nCNN, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and other outlets have also now confirmed with the Pretti family that the man in the video is Alex Pretti.\n\nA narrator for the video said TNM’s team — comprised of reporters Dallin Mello and Dan Ming — received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street in Minneapolis around 10:15 a.m. When they arrived, they recorded a man who looked like Pretti spitting on a Ford SUV and shouting at immigration agents that they were  “f*cking trash!”\n\nThe man who looked like Pretti was wearing a black hat, brown coat, and had a beard; the narrator noted it was similar to the outfit Pretti wore when he was killed on January 24. He then smashed the right tail light by kicking it two times and flipped the middle finger at the vehicle.\n\nAt that point, “An agent then got out of the vehicle, grabbed him, and pushed him to the ground,” the voiceover said.\n\nThe man who appeared to be Pretti could be seen trying to scurry away from one agent before another agent grabbed him and they both threw him down.\n\n“During the altercation, agents fired tear gas and pepper balls into the crowd,” the narrator continued. “They continued to hold the man down before they retreat and he walks away.”\n\nThe narrator said there appears to be a gun “visible above his waistband” in the footage.\n\nWe were filming a documentary about ICE activity in Minneapolis when we received a tip that federal agents were blocking a street, and captured this footage.\n\nReporting by @danming, Dallin Mello, and BBC Verify.https://t.co/sZcpUBQOpr\n\n— The News Movement (@thenewsmovement) January 28, 2026\n\nThe footage quickly went viral on X shortly after it was posted on Wednesday.

I'm really looking forward to working together as we keep evolving and pushing ourselves to the next level, while staying true to the identity that makes this team so special.\"\n\nAustralia host India in three T20s, three ODIs and one Test between 15 February and 9 March.",

There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl - give me one season - I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"\n\nBelichick's failure to gain sufficient votes could be a result of two scandals, known as Spy-gate and Deflate-gate, that engulfed the Patriots franchise during his time at the helm, according to ESPN, external.\n\nHowever, Brady said he was \"not worried\" that Belichick would never be entered into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe added: \"We'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen, and he's gonna have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything he did, the commitment he made to winning and the impact that he had on all our lives.\"",

    "title": "After Hall of Fame snub, what next for 'Super Bowl god' Belichick?",
    "description": "He is one of the most winningest coaches in NFL history, but his snub from the Pro Footbal Hall of Fame adds to a growing list of defeats.",
    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots prepare for their 12th Super Bowl appearance, their former head coach Bill Belichick - widely considered to be the greatest professional football coach of all time - finds himself in an unlikely position: defending his legacy.\n\nAlthough Belichick has the most Super Bowl victories in NFL history, he received a phone call on Friday notifying him he would not be inducted into this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick asked with disappointment, according to ESPN which broke the news, referring to his six wins with the Patriots.\n\nThe latest setback adds to a series of misfortunes for Belichick, who ended his nearly 50-year NFL coaching career on a losing streak, and, in a rather unexpected decision, left the pinnacle of American football to coach college students.\n\nJust a few months ago, Belichick made his college football debut to a sell-out crowd of over 50,000 people packed into University of North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nWhen he walked onto the field for the first time, the roar of tens of thousands of screaming fans erupted into the night sky.\n\nThe Tar Heels suffered a stinging defeat to the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs that night, and never quite recovered. By the end of the 12-game season, the team finished with just four wins – its worst record since 2018.\n\nThe paradox between Belichick's legendary NFL career and his spectacularly poor first year in college football is complicating his legacy. After nearly 50 years coaching professional football, why Belichick accepted an offer to step down to the amateur leagues remains a big question. When he will quit is becoming an even bigger one.\n\n\"He's going to have one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career trying to get year two to be better than year one in North Carolina,\" said Dan Roche, an award-winning sports anchor with the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\n\n\"If they struggle again, I think that will basically be the end of the coaching career of Bill Belichick,\" he continued.\n\nFor years, the trend in college football has been that coaches typically leave the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for greater prestige and bigger salaries in the NFL.\n\nBut the college league – which generates over $1.3bn (£940.5m) in revenue – is starting to catch up.\n\n\"North Carolina decided to roll the dice and invest a lot of money in its football program,\" said Greg Barnes, senior reporter at Inside Carolina, a website dedicated to North Carolina University sports.\n\nAnd with that came Belichick, who signed a five-year $50m (£36m) deal to join the Tar Heels.\n\n\"That kind of money is unheard of for North Carolina football,\" Barnes said, notwithstanding that the contract went to 73-year-old Belichick who previously had never coached a single game of college football.\n\nMost sports experts who've followed his career suspect he's not in it for the money.\n\nFor Belichick, they say, it's part love of the game, part love for coaching, and part an affliction that has ailed many great sports figures: an inability to know when to say goodbye.\n\n\"I can't recall many head coaches who have said, 'Okay, I've done it all, and now I'm going to walk away',\" Roche said. \"I just think they don't have it in them.\"\n\nBelichick was born into a football family.\n\nHis father, Steve Belichick, had a long college coaching career, including 30 years at the US Naval Academy and two years at North Carolina.\n\nThe younger Belichick's understanding of football was also nurtured by his mother, Jeannette, with whom he spent many weekends watching games on TV.\n\nBelichick played football and lacrosse at Wesleyan University where he graduated in 1975 with an economics degree. Having never played in the professional league, he began his NFL career that same year as a staff assistant.\n\n\"He doesn't look like a football coach. He's not an overwhelming physical presence. He's not a screamer,\" said ESPN senior writer Seth Wickersham. \"He's kind of a quirky, introverted thinker.\"\n\n\"And he revolutionised professional football,\" Wickersham said.\n\nHowever, he truly forged his legacy during his decades-long career as the New England Patriots head coach.\n\nHe joined the team in 2000. One year later, with the help of quarterback Tom Brady, they won their first Super Bowl. Then five more after that. Altogether, the Brady-and-Belichick-led Patriots appeared in the Super Bowl nine times, the most under any single head coach in NFL history .\n\nMike Reiss, an ESPN staff writer who covers the Patriots, attributed Belichick's success to being \"a master strategist\".\n\n\"When he was at his peak powers, he almost knew the opposition more than the opposition knew themselves,\" Reiss said.\n\nBelichick's critics point to a series of scandals that rocked the Patriots during his tenure, including in 2007 when he was fined $500,000 (£362,000) for ordering his staff to spy on other teams, and in 2016, when Brady was suspended for four games for deflating footballs to his advantage.\n\nIn 2020, Brady left the Patriots, reportedly in part due to Belichick's unwillingness to give Brady, then-aged 43, the longer contract Brady wanted.\n\nBrady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the same year and won his seventh Super Bowl. In Belichick's final two seasons with the Patriots, he led the team to one of its worst records since the 1990s.\n\nBelichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways in January 2024. He was unable to find another NFL team to take him after that.\n\n\"It was a stunning rebuke by the NFL,\" said Wickersham, author of New York Times bestseller It's Better to be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness.\n\n\"For the first time since 1975\", Wickersham said, \"Belichick was out of football\".\n\nIt was during one of the lowest points of Belichick's professional career that he received the call from North Carolina.\n\nOutside of a few sceptics, college football fans were engulfed in enthusiasm.\n\n\"Congrats coach,\" Tom Brady posted on social media. \"The Tar Heel way is about to become a thing 100.\"\n\nWith his name emblazoned on merchandise, home-game tickets for the entire season sold out weeks before it started.\n\nBut Belichick was unable to reverse the bad fortune that appeared to follow him from his final years in the NFL.\n\nAfter their defeat in game one, the Tar Heels would go on to lose most games, including every match against their three in-state rivals, something the team hadn't done since 1989.\n\nAs the season losses piled up, so did the number of empty seats inside North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nFor some, like North Carolina Alumni Association member Deborah Melvin, it was painful to witness even from home.\n\n\"It was just disheartening,\" she said. \"He was supposed to be Mr Super Coach.\"\n\nAdding to fans' frustrations was the incessant press coverage of Belichick's romantic relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old beauty pageant contestant and amateur cheerleader.\n\nWickersham called it \"the most scrutinized relationship ever for an American sports coach\".\n\nHudson made headlines. Lots of headlines. Like when she was rumoured to have been banned from North Carolina's athletic facilities and the university had to put out a statement saying she wasn't. Or the time when she appeared next to Belichick on the sidelines on game day wearing a reptile mini-skirt and knee-high boots. Or the time when she filed a trademark application for the term \"gold digger\".\n\nBelichick couldn't avoid the gossip columns either, making his own headlines amid multiple appearances at Hudson's cheerleading competitions and beauty pageants.\n\nWickersham said he found the Belichick-Hudson saga to be \"surprising\", adding that it contributed to the noise surrounding Belichick who previously \"was a master at limiting distractions\".\n\n\"It's definitely different than the Belichick who was with New England all those years,\" Wickersham said.\n\nThe university declined a request from the BBC to interview Belichick.\n\nThe Tar Heels' bad season has not been blamed on Hudson, though. It was a variety of other factors.\n\nThis was Belichick's first time coaching a college football team, a group composed of a bunch of teenagers with often much steeper learning curves compared to the pros of the NFL.\n\nThe other major challenge was recruiting. Belichick joined the Tar Heels after the deadline for high school athletes to accept their college offers. That meant he missed the chance to persuade some of America's best high school football talent to join his team this year.\n\n\"To get the system in place is more than just turning a light switch on,\" North Carolina football manager Mike Lombardi said after the season.\n\n\"I'm not making any excuses, but when we first got here, we didn't have time to turn the light switch on,\" he said. \"We had to just get into the dark room.\"\n\nLombardi's remarks came during a signing ceremony on 3 December, as the team celebrated the new class of recruits joining the Tar Heels' next season.\n\n\"They will be a foundation of our program,\" Belichick said.\n\nFor now, quitting does not appear to be an option for the all-time great coach.\n\n\"'Why are you still doing this? You could be doing anything,'\" Weiss said he once asked Belichick toward the end of his career with the Patriots. \"And he replied, 'It beats working.'\n\n\"I'll never forget that, because I feel like this is what he feels like he was born to do.\"",

So could it now rescue their season as they chase a seventh triumph in the competition?\n\nFor all their troubles in the Premier League, Liverpool have looked much more at home in Europe, Wednesday's 6-0 win against Qarabag ensuring an automatic place in the last 16 without the need for a play-off.\n\nAnd history tells us Liverpool, with the Anfield factor added to the equation, will fancy their chances in the knockout phase.\n\nIt is a stretch to paint this Liverpool team, on current form, as anything like potential Champions League winners, but they must never be underestimated over a two-legged format.\n\nThis was a night Slot and Salah needed after the turbulence of this campaign. It was their most comfortable game of the season.\n\nIt will not turn the spotlight away from Slot with Liverpool so off-colour in the league, but this was as easy as it gets in Europe. Qarabag were compliant opponents, not made of the stuff that enables Premier League opposition to scent blood in almost every game against his side.\n\nIt was Slot's biggest winning margin as Liverpool manager in his 91st game in charge, and their biggest victory since March 2023, when they won 7-0 against Manchester United.\n\nInevitably, this season being what it is, there was a cloud over the celebrations, with summer signing Jeremie Frimpong once more struck down by a muscle injury, meaning he lasted less than two minutes.",
