    "fullText": "Look at Sam Kerr’s roar of frustration as she made her way back to the bench, or Erin Cuthbert lying flat out in the Arsenal goalmouth, hands on head, after missing a golden opportunity to bring her side back into the game. Look at Aggie Beever-Jones or Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s uncharacteristic hesitancy in the box in the second half, or the three shots Lauren James struck off-target in the final ten minutes.\n\nListen to Sonia Bompastor in the post-match press conference, unable to answer after being asked what had caused her side’s run of seven points in five Women’s Super League games.\n\nIn so many ways, Chelsea did not look like Chelsea on Saturday: they looked beatable.\n\nBompastor’s comments took place against a soundtrack of muffled dance music, presumably coming from the nearby away dressing room as Arsenal’s players celebrated a first win away at Chelsea in the league since September 2018.\n\nAfter an even but goalless first half, Beth Mead slotted Arsenal in front ten minutes after the break and Mariona Caldentey doubled the lead just after the hour. Chelsea let a series of promising chances go begging and are now six points behind leaders Manchester City, who play eighth-placed London City Lionesses today.\n\nThere are simply not enough superlatives to explain the excellence of @ArsenalWFC’s Mariona Caldentey 🌟#BarclaysWSL pic.twitter.com/YBHC7KTCvP\n\n— Barclays Women’s Super League (@BarclaysWSL) January 24, 2026\n\nThe most significant thing about Saturday’s result, though, is not necessarily its implications for the title race, in which City were already clear favourites. It is more that Chelsea’s aura of invincibility took a major beating.\n\nChelsea have lost before. Everton, who sit tenth, beat them 1-0 in December — but that felt like a defeat against the run of play, which could mostly be put down to Chelsea’s wastefulness (as well as Everton’s dogged defending). This was different; this time they were outplayed.\n\nRenee Slegers’ game plan worked perfectly, with Emily Fox and Katie McCabe pinning wing-backs Sandy Baltimore and Ellie Carpenter. The pair, usually crucial to how Chelsea progress up the pitch, had little space and were not able to link up with the forward line. Arsenal’s press saw Chelsea struggle to play out from the back, and they struggled to pick their way through the midfield, having to resort to long balls. Alyssa Thompson, playing up front with Kerr, was the main outlet — but her constant chasing in the channels stopped her threatening in the central area.\n\nChelsea were physically outfought, too, unable to make any of their nine corners count. Bompastor said her side were “not aggressive enough”, allowing Arsenal too much space to build their confidence.\n\nTheir finishing let them down, as it has multiple times this season. Of their 18 attempts, only one — a long-range effort from Lucy Bronze, comfortably saved — was on target. What is worrying for Chelsea is that this poor finishing is no longer a blip or a dry spell; it has persisted throughout the campaign. They have still scored in all but two of their games this season, but no longer feel like the same inevitable force in front of goal.\n\nThat bluntness is one thing — but the major lesson the rest of the WSL will take from today is that Chelsea can be outplayed. Rather than sitting back and hoping that Chelsea’s huffing and puffing will not blow their house down, there are ways to proactively hurt them.\n\nChelsea have looked imperfect before. They have looked wasteful before. But they have never looked low on confidence. Their dominance has been built on a deep, high-quality squad, and an unshakeable belief that they will come out on top. That is now being truly tested, as was clear from Bompastor’s words post-match.\n\n“Sometimes you need to recognise the other team was better than us today,” Bompastor said. “I think that’s what brings the excitement in this league, because the competition is high and I think to be able to perform in every game and to win every game, it’s tough.”\n\nShe is, of course, absolutely right. Chelsea’s consistency has defied logic — but they have never seemed to doubt their ability to keep it up. If they allow that faith in themselves to slip, it will only feed other teams’ confidence.\n\nIf Beth Mead has time and space, there is only ever ONE outcome 🔥@ArsenalWFC @BarclaysWSL pic.twitter.com/JBMG6r9Fo6\n\n— Barclays Women’s Super League (@BarclaysWSL) January 24, 2026\n\nSo what does a beatable Chelsea mean?\n\nFor Manchester City, their path to the title is clearer than ever. If they beat London City, they will move nine points clear — and have the opportunity to deal Chelsea a body blow in person next weekend when Bompastor’s side come to the Joie Stadium. For the rest of the chasing pack — Arsenal, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur — it means the Champions League race feels more open than ever. Chelsea are only in the top three by four points, and Tottenham and United have a game in hand.\n\nFor Chelsea, being beatable means their guard must be up. Not every WSL side has the quality that Arsenal used to exploit their weaknesses today, or to execute a similar gameplan — but the few that do will be smelling blood. They still need to face City and United again in the league, as well as a possible Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal if Slegers’ side make it through the playoffs.\n\nChelsea know what it is to be the team everyone wants to beat, and have worn that as a badge of honour. The challenge now is to stop it from becoming a target on their backs.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "3 reasons why Ja Morant's injury could be good for the Grizzlies originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Grizzlies playing without Ja Morant is nothing new.\n\nThe electrifying point guard has missed 100 games due to injury in his career and he's set to miss more after suffering a UCL injury on Wednesday.\n\nAt face value, this is a huge blow for Memphis. Even with Ja Morant in trade talks, he's their best player and the face of the franchise, for better or worse.\n\nBut it could be a blessing in disguise for the team and its future. Here's why.\n\nIt's no secret that Memphis has a couple of young prospects that are already paying dividends this year.\n\nCam Spencer, a second-year guard out of UConn, has been a sparkplug for the Grizzlies offense. He averages 12 points per game and boasts a 46% clip from the 3-point line. He's been a big benefactor in games Morant is out and should continue to shine in his absence.\n\n21 PTS 💥 5 REB 💥 11 AST 💥 7/9 FG\n\nANOTHER double-double for Cam Spencer! The former @memphishustle assignee has now racked up six double-digit assist games this season. #GLeagueAlumpic.twitter.com/GrTNNRq9oL\n\n— NBA G League (@nbagleague) January 24, 2026\n\nCoward, a rookie out of Washington St., has risen to one of the more reliable Memphis players. He averages 14 point and 6.4 rebounds per game. With Morant gone, more of the scoring responsibility will go to him.\n\nBoth Coward and Spencer will have more opportunities to develop as young players with Morant's usage gone from the offense. It could increase their confidence and growth to fill bigger roles even when Morant returns.\n\nWhile Ja gets nursed back to health, reinforcements are on the way for the Memphis backcourt.\n\nJerome, a big offseason signing for the Grizzlies, has not taken the floor yet this season. He suffered a calf strain in preseason but is nearing his return in the coming weeks.\n\nTy Jerome is doing 5-on-5 work in practice. Tuomas Iisalo said he needs to build up over the next week or two for game action.\n\n“We are very close.”\n\n— Damichael Cole (@DamichaelC) January 23, 2026\n\nScotty Pippen Jr. also has hardly seen the floor this year after suffering from a left toe injury. He had surgery in October of 2025 and is expected to return in February.\n\nMORE: How long is Ja Morant out? Grizzlies guard to miss significant time with UCL injury\n\nBoth those players can command an offense and generate baskets themselves or by setting up others. It's what Memphis will need in Morant's absence.\n\nMorant, as talented as he is, is followed by the stench of controversy. Whether it's the multiple gun-related suspensions or his outspoken father, the All-Star point guard dominates headlines for the wrong reasons.\n\nIt was just last week that a heated conversation between Morant and teammate Vince Williams was caught on camera.\n\nJa Morant’s heated argument with Grizzlies teammate Vince Williams Jr. has been revealed 🗣️\n\nMorant: “It is what it is. Y’all don’t **** with me, I don’t **** with y’all. WHAT. WHAT. WHAT?”\n\nWilliams Jr.: “Let’s go to the back.”\n\nMorant: “Why? I’m right here. I’m right here! 5… pic.twitter.com/B8EzroDnjJ\n\n— Courtside Buzz (@CourtsideBuzzX) January 15, 2026\n\nCombine that with Morant being in trade rumors, all is not peaceful inside that locker room.\n\nThe Grizzlies obviously don't want to be without their best player. But there are reasons to see why they could be better off with some of their younger pieces taking on bigger roles.\n\nMorant will be out at least three weeks so Memphis will have plenty of time to see how the group responds.\n\nMORE:76ers' Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe address rumors after sideline argument",

    "fullText": "The Henderson Silver Knights paid tribute to the International Hockey League’s Las Vegas Thunder, and they did good to live up to the memory of Southern Nevada’s first professional hockey team.\n\nOn Saturday, the Silver Knights relied on late-game heroics and strong defense to ride out a close 4-3 victory over the Tucson Roadrunners.\n\nIt would not take long for the Silver Knights to get themselves on the board. Ten seconds into their first power play, the Silver Knights were able to cash in for an early lead. Lukas Cormier, making his return to the lineup, got a shot off from the point, and Kai Uchacz took advantage of the chaos and finished the play by sliding the puck past Roadrunners goaltender Matthew Villalta to break the ice.\n\nMinutes later, Sloan Stanick would keep his momentum rolling and give his team a cushion. The undrafted forward has already made waves early in his time in Henderson, and he did it again on an incredible solo effort. Getting a turnover in the offensive zone, Stanick launched a wicked shot that beat Villalta clean and secured his third goal in his first five AHL games.\n\n“He’s gotten to the hard areas to score goals,” said head coach Ryan Craig about the rookie. “I think his first two goals were from the top of the crease. His goal tonight, he reloads back above and scores between the hashmarks with a real good shot.”\n\nThe good times would not always last, however. Andrew Agozzino would put Tucson on the board on a quick-developing play to make good on the Roadrunners’ first possession in the offensive zone.\n\nNo change in the score during the second period, but what remained apparent was how aggressive the Silver Knights forecheck was. By the time the second was over, they had limited the Roadrunners to only seven shots.\n\n“They didn’t have any offense,” said forward Tuomas Uronen.\n\nJesper Vikman would be up for the challenge, however, especially on a breakaway save in the second period.\n\n“Every save matters. Obviously, that one maybe meant a little more to our team,” said Vikman.\n\nThe third period would see the Roadrunners catch yet another break. Keeping the play on the offensive zone by mere inches, Tyler Tullio was able to best Vikman on the glove side to tie the game up at two.\n\nHowever, the Henderson power play would once again make the difference. Taking advantage of a prolonged power play and Villalta breaking his stick, Uronen saw his opportunity and beat a Roadrunners defender to the front of the net. The Finn did not miss from point blank range, getting the puck between Villalta’s pads to put the Silver Knights back in the lead.\n\n“There’s moments in games, and I think that was the moment in this game,” said Uronen on the quick play.\n\nUronen would finish the job on another power play, besting Villalta with a beautiful shot off the post and into the net.\n\nAn Austin Poganski deflection would cut the lead back down to one to keep things interesting, but the Silver Knights would close the deal out to take the fans and Thunder alumni home happy.\n\nHowever, Craig wants more as the Silver Knights approach the second half of the season.\n\n“Still learning, still growing,” said Craig about his team. “We haven’t necessarily seen everybody together for a little while, which is okay. Opportunities are here for guys.”",

    "fullText": "Snowboarder Scotty James parlayed a never-before-landed trick combination into his fifth straight X Games title on the halfpipe Saturday and tied Shaun White with eight overall gold medals at the biggest event this side of the Olympics.\n\nIn the final major contest before next month's Milan Cortina Games, the 31-year-old Aussie capped off his winning run with two straight backside 1440-degree jumps. That's two tricks spinning with his back facing down the hill to start, one while riding forward, the other riding backward — or “switch.” They are among the toughest on the halfpipe.\n\nJames briefly put his hand onto the snow to stay upright after the second jump, but the judges rewarded him anyway. His score of 95 easily beat second-place finisher Haku Shimasaki of Japan.\n\n“I felt I wanted to do something for myself and for halfpipe and to push backside riding as much as I can,” said Scott, who wore his trademark red boxing gloves and celebrated by crowd surfing into the hundreds of fans who watched the action in Aspen, Colorado. “Tonight, I think it always was the plan. I wanted to come out and do the first back-to-back backside 14s, and I'm pumped.”\n\nJames is looking like the favorite heading into the Milan Cortina Olympics. Last week, he won the Laax Open in Switzerland — a contest in which defending Olympic champion Ayumu Hirano suffered a nasty fall and broke bones in his face, throwing his status for next month's Olympic halfpipe contest into limbo.\n\nJames has Olympic silver and bronze medals. In a documentary on his life that dropped earlier this Winter, he made no secret that he needs the Olympic gold to round out an otherwise impeccable career.\n\nJames has also shown a triple cork — three head-over-heels flips — as part of his repertoire this season, though the back-to-back 1440s was something nobody had seen.\n\nHe said he has always admired groundbreakers, such as slopestyler Mark McMorris, 2014 Olympic halfpipe champion Iouri Podladtchikov (the iPod) and White, and wanted to use this latest X Games performance to add something new.\n\n“I get a chip on my shoulder every year, thinking maybe I wouldn't be expected to show up and try again and win again,” he said. “I managed to do that today, and I'm speechless, honestly.”\n\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "UFC 324 results, highlights: Justin Gaethje wins interim gold following brutal war against game Paddy Pimblett originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor years, the UFC promoted Paddy Pimblett as the next big thing. His rise to the top was meant to result in the Liverpool-born fighter holding gold.\n\nHowever, in his path at UFC 324 was a dangerous Justin Gaethje, who brutalized “The Baddy” for five rounds to once again win interim lightweight gold.\n\nThe UFC’s first show on Paramount+ began with a retrospective on the promotion's history, honoring those who laid the foundations for what it is today. UFC 324 showcased the future, with fighters using their skills to deliver highlight-reel wins.\n\nIt also helped that the UFC recently upped the ante with performance bonuses ($25k for KOs), as the first four bouts ended via knockout. The theme of the night transitioned smoothly to the main event.\n\nGaethje (27-5) came into the fight looking to retire as champion by 2027. He started guns blazing and didn’t slow down. “The Highlight” landed several uppercuts and jabs that cut the face of Pimblett (23–4), participating in the toughest fight of his career.\n\nThe eyes of Pimblett got poked at one point. He attempted to use elbows to hurt Gaethje. At certain points, they were efficient. Gaethje’s strikes, which dropped Pimblett, were just too much.\n\nPIMBLETT IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE EARLY\n\n📺 @paramountpluspic.twitter.com/ooBFDwjofz\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nPimblett had a second wind and proved his toughness against the toughest opponent of his career. He chopped Gaethje's legs in an attempt to keep him off balance. Pimblett even landed sharp uppercuts.\n\nGaethje, known for having a tough chin and attacking when smelling blood, was on another level.\n\nGaethje landed 178 significant strikes while Pimblett landed 169. The former landed 219 total strikes. The loss ended Pimblett's nine-fight win streak. Gaethje has now won two straight.\n\n\"That Scouser does NOT get knocked out.\" - Justin Gaethje\n\n📺 @paramountpluspic.twitter.com/LvqwmMGxqQ\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nUp next for Gaethje? It all depends on the status of champion Ilia Topuria, who is dealing with a personal matter. The interim champion could also fight Arman Tsarukyan, the top contender within the division.\n\nSean O’Malley may have secured a title shot on the White House card after beating Song Yadong in the co-main event. O’Malley (19-3, 1 NC) battled against Yadong (22-9, 1 NC), the latter landing leg kicks that hurt. “Suga” won round one and did enough in round three to get the win.\n\nO’Malley called out Petr Yan for the UFC bantamweight title, likely on the White House card. He understood if former champion Merab Dvalishvili got a third fight with Yan, but it appears likely the UFC will book O’Malley against the champion.\n\nWaldo Cortes-Acosta took it to Derrick Lewis, hurting the big man following vicious shots on the floor.\n\nRanked fifth at heavyweight, the Dominican used jabs and kicks to slow Lewis (29-13, 1 NC) down. Following a slip by Lewis, Cortes-Acosta (17-2) took advantage to get his third straight win.\n\nMORE: All you need to know about the UFC's partnership with Paramount+\n\nNatalia Silva earned a win against a former champion for the third straight time when she beat Rose Namajunas. Silva (20-5-1), replacing Alexa Grasso, was tentative to start the fight. The first round could have gone to anyone, but all three judges favored Silva.\n\nAs time went on, Silva looked confident. She took Namajunas (14-8) down late in the third, and it was enough to secure a win. With 13 straight wins, Silva may be next for flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\n\nArnold Allen and Jean Silva are known for their striking. They did so for three rounds, landing everything from leg kicks to uppercuts. Allen (20-4) used jabs to bloody Silva (17-3), while the latter used elbows and kicks to affect the spirit of Allen.\n\nSilva is back to his winning ways as a member of The Fighting Nerds.\n\nThe Sporting News provided results, analysis, and highlights from UFC 324.\n\nGaethje won via unanimous decision.\n\nRound five: Gaethje with several big shots. he missed and Pimblett took advantage.

    "title": "Lasses Preview: Can Sunderland Make Life Tough For The Saints?",
    "description": "Sunderland are back in league action as Southampton make the trip north. Charlotte Patterson preview’s today’s game!",
    "fullText": "Today, Sunderland welcome Southampton to Eppleton for a fixture that feels far more significant than the table alone suggests.\n\nOn the surface, it’s eighth versus sixth in a mid‑season meeting between two sides who’vw shared enough history in recent years to make the fixture familiar, if not outright fierce. But beneath that surface lies a deeper tension and a sense that today’s game could shape the direction of Sunderland’s season in ways that will only become clear weeks from now.\n\nWith a difficult run‑in looming and points becoming increasingly precious, this is the kind of game that can tilt momentum, shift belief and redefine expectations.\n\nSunderland arrive with twelve points from their opening run of fixtures, sitting eighth in the table with a goal difference of minus three. They’ve scored seventeen and conceded twenty, winning three, drawing three and losing five. It’s a record that reflects a season of mixed fortunes and where moments of genuine promise have been offset by lapses that have proved costly.\n\nSouthampton, meanwhile, sit sixth with eighteen points, having played one game more.\n\nTheir record of five wins, three draws, and four defeats, with twenty six goals scored and sixteen conceded, paints a picture of a team who’ve found a level of consistency that Sunderland are still striving to reach. They’re not runaway contenders, but they’re steady, structured, and capable of grinding out results even when not at their best. Their goal difference of plus ten suggests a side who manage both boxes well, who take their chances and limit their opponents’ opportunities.\n\nToday, the two sides meet, and with Sunderland’s upcoming fixtures offering little in the way of comfort, the stakes feel unusually high for a January afternoon at Eppleton.\n\nThe story of Sunderland’s season so far has been one of contrasts.\n\nThere have been spells where the team has looked capable of troubling anyone in the division. The attacking play has featured flashes of fluidity, with intelligent movement, sharp passing and a willingness to commit bodies forward. The midfield has occasionally dictated tempo and disrupted opponents, and the defence has produced periods of solidity.\n\nHowever, those spells haven’t always lasted and Sunderland have often been punished for brief lapses in concentration; moments where the standard of organisation has slipped or the decision‑making has faltered.\n\nThe twenty goals conceded are that of a team that’s been overwhelmed at times and have struggled to maintain control for the full ninety minutes. A missed clearance here, a poorly defended set piece there, a moment of hesitation in transition…these are the moments that’ve turned draws into defeats and wins into draws.\n\nEppleton — usually a source of strength — has mirrored that inconsistency.\n\nThe crowd remains as passionate and committed as ever, capable of lifting the team and unsettling opponents, but the results have not always matched the atmosphere.\n\nThere have been afternoons during which Sunderland have dominated without reward, and others where they’ve struggled to impose themselves. Today offers an opportunity to reaffirm Eppleton as a place where points are earned the hard way — and where visiting teams know they’ll be tested physically, tactically and emotionally.\n\nSouthampton, meanwhile, arrive with a different kind of rhythm.\n\nTheir season hasn’t been flawless but it’s been defined by structure and clarity. They know what they want to do, and they do it with discipline. Out of possession, they are compact and organised, difficult to pull apart and quick to close down space. In possession, they’re purposeful rather than flamboyant, moving the ball with intent and waiting for the right moments to commit numbers forward. .\n\nControl rather than chaos is what makes them such a challenging opponent for a Sunderland side still searching for consistency.\n\nSouthampton have the kind of team that punishes half‑mistakes, turns small openings into meaningful chances and manages games with a level of maturity that Sunderland are still developing. They don’t need opponents to be poor — they simply need them to be slightly off.\n\nThere’s also an emotional aspect to this fixture that adds another layer of intrigue.\n\nThese two sides have faced each other enough in recent seasons to build a quiet rivalry, one defined not by animosity but by familiarity. There have been tight contests, late goals and occasions on which one side has left feeling they deserved more. Those memories linger, shaping the tone of the encounter even before a ball is kicked.\n\nFor Sunderland, there is the added motivation of wanting to put right some of the frustrations of recent meetings; for Southampton, the confidence that comes from having taken points from this fixture before.\n\nThe players know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. The supporters recognise the patterns of the matchup, and the sense of narrative is impossible to ignore.\n\nFor Sunderland, the challenge today is to turn performances into points — and the attacking numbers show that there’s enough of a threat within this side to trouble any defence.\n\nWhen Sunderland move the ball quickly, when the rotations in midfield click and when the wide players are direct and brave, they create chances. The issue hasn’t been creating opportunities — it’s been taking them with the ruthlessness required at this level.\n\nDefensively, the task is to cut out the avoidable errors.\n\nToo many of the goals conceded have come from situations that felt manageable and from moments where a bit more aggression or clearer communication might’ve made the difference. Against a side like Southampton, those details matter. They don’t give up many chances and they don’t need many to score.\n\nSouthampton’s strengths are well known.\n\nTheir level of defensive organisation is among the highest in the division, and their ability to control the tempo makes them difficult to disrupt. Their midfield is composed and intelligent, capable of dictating the rhythm of the game, while their attack is efficient, with players who can finish clinically even if they aren’t creating a high volume of chances.\n\nHowever, they’re not without vulnerabilities. They don’t enjoy being forced to chase games, and they can be unsettled by quick transitions.\n\nTheir full backs — who play an important role in their attacking structure — can leave space in behind if turned around, and their centre backs, although strong positionally, aren’t the quickest over long distances. For Sunderland, that points towards a clear route to success: win the ball in midfield, transition quickly and exploit the spaces left by Southampton’s aggressive positioning.\n\nIt’s one thing to identify where the opportunities lie but it’s another to commit to exploiting them. Sunderland will need to trust their structure, trust their movement and trust each other. They can’t afford to play within themselves or allow Southampton to dictate the terms of the contest.\n\nWhat elevates today’s match beyond the status of a regular mid‑season fixture is the run‑in that awaits Sunderland.\n\nThe away trips to Charlton and Birmingham loom large, both sides with promotion ambitions and both grounds where points are notoriously difficult to come by. These are the kinds of fixtures where even a strong performance can end in a narrow defeat, and where the margins are slim and the pressure is high.\n\nThen there are the long journeys to Portsmouth and Ipswich.\n\nOn paper, these might be seen as opportunities to pick up points, but football rarely follows the script. Long travel, unfamiliar surroundings, and the mental and physical fatigue of the season can complicate even the most favourable fixtures. Portsmouth are stubborn and well‑organised at home, while Ipswich, despite their inconsistencies, have enough quality to cause problems.\n\nThis is why today feels pivotal — and Sunderland can’t afford to drift into that run‑in needing miracles.\n\nThey need to build momentum now, to create a buffer, to give themselves the confidence and belief required to navigate the challenges ahead. A win today wouldn’t solve everything, but it would change the mood, shift the narrative and make the table look a little less daunting.\n\nThere’a also the psychological aspect to consider.\n\nSunderland’s players know where they are in the table. They know the type of goals they’ve conceded and they’re aware of the games that’ve slipped away. What they need is a day where things go right, where the performance and the result align and where the work on the training ground is reflected on the scoreboard.\n\nEppleton can play a crucial role in that.\n\nWhen the crowd is engaged, when the noise builds and when the energy flows from the stands to the pitch, it can be a difficult place for visiting teams. Southampton — who prefer control and composure — may find that environment unsettling, but atmospheres are built, not assumed, and Sunderland need to give the supporters something to latch onto — whether it’s an early chance, a strong tackle or a spell of pressure.\n\nSuccess today does not require perfection — it requires clarity, conviction, and a willingness to embrace the challenge.\n\nSunderland need to be organised without the ball, brave with it, and ruthless inside both boxes. They need to manage the game, avoid the lapses that’ve cost them in the past, and trust that their best football is good enough to take points from a side like Southampton.\n\nIf they can do that, the table will look different tonight. The mood will shift, the run‑in will feel less intimidating and the season will take on a different complexion. If they can’t, the margins will tighten, and the climb will become steeper.\n\nIt’s a chance to change the tone and to show that Sunderland are a better side than their current position suggests. It’s also a chance to make Eppleton a fortress again; to give the supporters something to believe in and to set the stage for the challenges to come.\n\nThe season will not be defined by one match, but some matches shape the path that follows. Today feels like one of those and it’s up to Sunderland to seize it.\n\nAnd yet, on a personal note, there is a bittersweet twist.\n\nAs the writer of this preview, I find myself preparing to head off on holiday for a few days, meaning I won’t be there in person — a frustrating inevitability of timing, especially for a fixture that promises so much.\n\nI’ll do my best to catch the first half from the airport, phone in hand, suitcase at my side, hoping for a strong Sunderland performance to accompany the start of my travels. Even from afar, the pull of Eppleton and this Sunderland team remains impossible to ignore.",

    "fullText": "Vicky Mboko called Sunday's match at the Australian Open against first-seeded Aryna Sabalenka “a learning curve.”\n\nIf so, the 19-year-old Canadian is catching on very quickly.\n\nSabalenka won in two sets — 6-1, 7-6 (1) to reach the quarterfinals — but Mboko put enormous pressure on the world's top-ranked player in the second set and was a few shots away from forcing a third at Rod Laver Arena.\n\nAfter trailing 4-1 in the second set, Mboko rallied to force the tiebreaker and seemed to have the momentum until Sabalenka did, well, Sabalenka-like things and won her 20th straight tiebreak.\n\n“I think at the end of the day it really came down to experience,” Mboko said. “She played really great tennis. I, of course, had my chances.”\n\n“It was a pretty nice experience being it was my first time on the center court playing against the world No. 1,\" she added.\n\nMboko, No. 16 in the WTA Tour rankings, is becoming famous as a slow starter, which she was in the first set against the top-ranked Sabalenka. But it was different in the second once she seized an opening.\n\n“Trying to find my rhythm as the match went on was important for me,” she said. “I was pretty close in the second set.\"\n\nMboko has been showing off her tennis all across Australia.\n\nShe was the runner-up a week ago in the Adelaide International, losing to Mirra Andreeva in the final 6-3, 6-1. However, she defeated defending Australian Open champion Madison Keys 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the semifinals.\n\nMboko noted that against lesser players she's able to escape even when she hits shots that are short — not deep enough into the court.\n\n“But with her (Sabalenka) it was from the start, the moment my shot quality wasn't good enough, she was dictating right away,” Mboko said. “So that's something I could work on and learn from the next time.”\n\nAnd there will surely be a next time in every Grand Slam from here into the foreseeable future. Sabalenka, who is shooting for her third Australian Open title in four years, also made that point.\n\n“She’s an amazing player,” Sabalenka said of Mboko. “It was quite a fight. I’m super happy that I was able to close this match in straight sets. The second set was a bit tricky.”\n\nSabalenka faces another rising star in American 18-year-old Iva Jovic in the quarterfinals.\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are set to make a short trip across the capital to take on struggling Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, looking to preserve their 17-match unbeaten run against the Eagles.\n\nThe Blues are chasing back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since November, and could also extend their winning streak to three games on the bounce.\n\nLiam Rosenior has had a fine start to life at Chelsea, winning three of his four games in charge so far (L1).\n\nThe only defeat in that run came against Arsenal, with the Blues falling to a 3-2 defeat in the first leg of their EFL Cup semi-final clash at Stamford Bridge.\n\nSince then, Chelsea have kept back-to-back clean sheets, and Rosenior will hope for more of the same when the Blues head east of the capital later today.\n\nChelsea are heading into this fixture on the back of a narrow 1-0 Champions League win against Cypriot top-flight side Pafos in midweek.\n\nThat win moved them up to eighth in the Champions League standings, keeping their hopes of securing automatic qualification to the last 16 alive.\n\nThe win against Pafos came after a 2-0 success over Brentford, which ended a deplorable run of five Premier League games without victory.\n\nRosenior has made it clear that he will rotate his squad as much as he can to keep everyone fit, particularly after losing a couple of players to injury.\n\nThat means he could make up to seven changes from the side that beat Pafos in midweek.\n\nRobert Sanchez should return in goal, with Marc Cucurella, Trevoh Chalobah, Wesley Fofana, and Reece James ahead of the Spanish goalkeeper.\n\nCole Palmer was left out of the squad that faced Pafos, but should return for the game against Palace.\n\nHis return would move Enzo Fernandez back to central midfield alongside Moises Caicedo, while Alejandro Garnacho and Estevao line up on the flanks.\n\nRosenior has named Estevao as one of the players he wants to protect, but his cameo performance in midweek should give him the nod ahead of Pedro Neto.\n\nMeanwhile, Joao Pedro could replace Liam Delap at the top end of the pitch.",

    "title": "Vikings Rumors Spinning on a New OL Coach, Geno Smith, Kyle Rudolph’s Trade Idea",
    "description": "As the Minnesota Vikings move to put a punctuation mark on Offseason Week No. 3, the last several days delivered real […]",
    "fullText": "As the Minnesota Vikings move to put a punctuation mark on Offseason Week No. 3, the last several days delivered real intrigue, with developments including a new offensive line coach theory, Geno Smith floated as a quarterback option, and Kyle Rudolph’s quarterback endorsement.\n\nThree new angles hit Minnesota’s offseason in one rumor mill burst: a coaching possibility, a QB trade whisper, and a Rudolph-driven proposal.\n\nIt’s the second Purple Rumor Mill of the week, with all the trimmings.\n\nThe Vikings’ rumor mill doesn’t rest, so here’s the latest edition.\n\nRumor: Dwayne Ledford could be a candidate for Minnesota’s vacant OL coach post.\n\nLedford is suddenly available, and the Vikings, in theory, could pounce.\n\nSI.com’s Garrett Chapman outlined the Falcons’ staffing shakeup this week, noting, “The Atlanta Falcons have officially hired former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski to take over their franchise. The team announced the news on Saturday night, and by Sunday, there were more decisions that came to light as the new staff is put together.”\n\n“News will continue to evolve at the coordinator position, but one major piece of the puzzle has reportedly been highlighted. According to NFL insider Mike Garafolo, the Falcons will be bringing in Bill Callahan to coach the offensive line. The correlating result of this move is that longtime offensive line coach and run game coordinator Dwayne Ledford will become a free agent.”\n\nLedford has been a stabilizing force in run game structure, and his availability immediately puts offensive-minded teams on alert. Minnesota should take notice.\n\nWill Ragatz, also of SI.com, underscored the opportunity, “If the Vikings could find a way to land Ledford, it would be a big hire for O’Connell and company. They’ve got all the makings of a strong offensive line with Christian Darrisaw, Brian O’Neill, Will Fries, Donovan Jackson, and whoever’s playing center in 2026.”\n\n“Health is critical there, but so is coaching. If hired, Ledford would also presumably replace RBs coach Curtis Modkins as run game coordinator. The Vikings have never finished above 22nd in EPA per rush in four years under O’Connell.”\n\nMinnesota’s run game hasn’t lacked talent so much as oomph. Ledford would fix it.\n\nRumor: Geno Smith may be on the Vikings’ trade radar this offseason.\n\nESPN’s Kevin Seifert addressed the Vikings’ quarterback situation this week: “Adofo-Mensah and O’Connell made clear this week that they can’t count on that progress, after seeing the results of counting on it in 2025. It’s an understandable assessment. But quarterback acquisition is hard. The Vikings had a solid plan in 2025 and couldn’t execute it. Can they be better with their next opportunity? Their 2026 season almost certainly depends on it.”\n\nSeifert then turned to a familiar batch of names while surveying the league’s quarterback carousel.\n\n“The San Francisco 49ers’ Mac Jones and the Las Vegas Raiders’ Geno Smith could be available via trade, and the Miami Dolphins might part ways with Tua Tagovailoa. Jones has been a backup for two seasons, Smith ranked No. 27 in NFL QBR this season, and Tagovailoa ranked No. 26,” he wrote.\n\nSo, Smith joins Minnesota’s growing quarterback rumor mill, at least on paper. Here’s his NFL ranking among all quarterbacks per EPA+CPOE in the last four seasons:\n\nIn 2022, banked 4,282 passing yards and 30 passing touchdowns.\n\nSmith is a sideways option for the Vikings at quarterback, somebody with ample experience to support J.J. McCarthy. But his case is no better than others’. Too, Minnesota would have to send a draft pick to Las Vegas to get Smith, as he’s under contract in 2026.\n\nRumor: Kyle Rudolph thinks the Vikings should sniff around a Mac Jones trade.\n\nRudolph spoke to Kay Adams this week, name-dropping Jones as a Vikings quarterback target this offseason.\n\n“I think you got Mac Jones. To me, if I’m looking at that list, Aaron Rodgers, if he wants to come back and make a run with an incredibly talented roster in a division that he’s very familiar with, completely agree. But yeah, bringing somebody in doesn’t really matter who it is,” Rudolph opined.\n\n“There’s plenty of high-caliber veteran quarterbacks that could come in, and Kevin O’Connell always gets the most out of them. There’s no better quarterback whisperer than KOC, and I think he would be a great spot if you’re a veteran quarterback like Tua Tagovailoa, trying to revitalize your career, if he is on the market. Wouldn’t be a bad place to look.”\n\nThe 49ers’ brass also said this week that Jones won’t necessarily be for sale this offseason, so we shall see if Minnesota agrees with Rudolph and offers San Francisco a trade it can’t refuse.",

    "fullText": "St. James’ Park sets the stage for a gripping Premier League clash on Sunday afternoon as Newcastle United welcome Aston Villa to Tyneside.\n\nOn paper, Newcastle head into this fixture as underdogs, with the visitors sitting 10 points ahead in the Premier League table.\n\nHowever, the Magpies are in better form than Villa after putting together a four-match unbeaten streak in the Premier League (W3, D1).\n\nThe only blemish in that run came in a frustrating goalless draw against basement boys Wolverhampton Wanderers last weekend, which ended a three-game league winning run.\n\nDespite dominating proceedings, Newcastle couldn’t find a winner and will head into Sunday’s outing sitting 9th in the Premier League table.\n\nEddie Howe’s attacking unit recaptured their goalscoring form in the Champions League as the Magpies bounced back in emphatic style.\n\nThey claimed a comfortable 3-0 win against Eredivisie champions PSV Eindhoven at St. James’ Park, courtesy of goals from Yoane Wissa, Anthony Gordon, and Harvey Barnes.\n\nHowe will demand more of the same when his side return to Premier League duties, with the Magpies eyeing back-to-back home wins in all competitions.\n\nA win for Newcastle will also move them level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool as they look to reclaim their place in the top four.\n\nHowe would be wary of shuffling the XI that put PSV to the sword in midweek, but a fresh injury blow could force the Englishman to make one change for the Villa clash.\n\nNick Pope should retain his place in goal, with an unchanged back four of Kieran Trippier, Malick Thiaw, Sven Botman, and Lewis Hall ahead of the English goalkeeper.\n\nThe solitary change could come in midfield with academy talent Lewis Miley coming in for Newcastle skipper Bruno Guimaraes, who picked up a knock against PSV.\n\nThe Brazilian midfielder is ready to play through the pain. But Howe will likely protect the “pivotal” midfielder by giving Miley the nod alongside Sandro Tonali and Joelinton in midfield.\n\nAn attacking trio of Gordon, Wissa, and Barnes should also remain unchanged after their stellar Champions League display.\n\nWissa’s performance spells trouble for £69 million summer signing Nick Woltemade, who is on an eight-match goal drought since bagging a brace against Chelsea in December 2025.",

    "description": "Stan Winston and Michael Lantieri detail their real-world practical solutions to creating the film’s huge stars.",
    "fullText": "The jeep heads right for us, the driver so terrified he smashes into a log, shearing the windows and the seat backs clean off as the vehicle skids under, spinning almost out of control. A roar echoes from the dense grove behind the jeep; trees shudder, toppling down, crushed by some monstrous weight. Then it appears, its vast body supported by two powerful legs, its voracious jaws filled with teeth the size of daggers — a living Tyrannosaurus rex. The huge creature gives chase, careening through the mud. The T-rex smashes through the log, reducing it to kindling, then crashes into the jeep, denting its side and upending it into the mud. The driver and his companions stumble from the wreckage as the fearsome beast, more terrifying than any dragon of legend, chases them deep into the dense jungle of Jurassic Park.\n\nThis startling sequence, filmed in a single breathless shot, is one of dozens of collaborations between full-scale dinosaur creator Stan Winston and mechanical effects supervisor Michael Lantieri on Steven Spielberg's long-awaited adventure epic. Along with stop-motion animator Phil Tippett and ILM visual-effects supervisor Dennis Muren, ASC [whose contributions are further detailed in AC July, 1993], Lantieri and Winston round out Jurassic Park's revolutionary dinosaur-design team.\n\nUsing every known effects technique, and some they created out of necessity specifically for Jurassic Park, they may well have done the impossible: given convincing life to an unholy menagerie of creatures who haven't walked the earth in millions of years. It’s an achievement that may well change forever the way we look at effects films.\n\nLantieri and Winston's work was used almost exclusively for the live-action dinosaur effects during principal photography. Together, they helped one another solve problems that have plagued effects experts such as Willis O'Brien from the prehistoric era of cinematic illusion — the silent The Lost Continent and the legendary King Kong — to the present day. “We really worked as one crew,\" Lantieri marvels. “Early on, our four-person design team took this pie, which represented all of the effects in Jurassic Park, and cut it up. We figured who could best do each effect, and then one or the other would say, 'We can go so far with this; can you pick up from here and run with it?'\"\n\nIn the beginning there was Stan Winston. As the multi-Academy Award-winning makeup effects artist will tell you, every dinosaur created for Jurassic Park began on the drawing boards at his Stan Winston Studio in Van Nuys. The bearded makeup impresario is a cagey fox, dazzling his audience with reams of techno-jargon, but the man has undeniably produced some of the most remarkable creations in screen history: the xenomorph queen of Aliens, the Pumpkinhead demon (from the film he also directed), the robotic cyborg of The Terminator and the shape-shifting T-1000 in Mark 'Crash' McCreary.\n\nWhat gives Winston's mechanical marvels their edge seems to be a philosophy stemming from his own humble beginnings as a struggling actor who fell into the field he now dominates almost by accident. \"I got involved in a makeup apprenticeship program while I was waiting to be a star,\" he admits. \"I was a big Lon Chaney fan and I was inspired by him to create wonderful, bizarre and incredible fantasy and real characters for film. When I realized a prosthetic makeup on an actor's face wouldn't allow me to fully realize the characters I was asked to create, I began using special effects technology to create fantasy characters that were completely animatronic puppets. I haven't gone from makeup to special effects; I have increased my palette with more colors that allow me to create characters using all the technology available, be it a makeup, a prosthetic, or dinosaurs for Jurassic Park.\" Unlike others in Winston's field, he sees his creations as characters who have to perform, on cue, like any other actor. This makes his task more demanding, and more rewarding.\n\nOne and a half of Winston's two years on Jurassic Park were spent designing the creatures who populate fictional billionaire John Hammond's bizarre island amusement park. All told, Winston's crew visualized nine different species of dinosaurs, most prominent of which were two-legged predators such as the Tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptors [above], and \"spitters,\" [the dilophosaurus] along with four-footed vegetarians such as triceratops and the mammoth brachiosaurus. \"Steven felt that there should be a consistent dinosaur design,\" Winston explains, \"so even dinosaurs that were only realized in the computer at ILM, such as the ostrich-like gallimimus, were designed here. The approach is very simple and it's what we do on every project: artistically, everything starts on the drawing boards. We're certainly not going to throw two tons of clay at an armature and start sculpting a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex and hope that it looks great! On Jurassic Park, our concept artist was Mark 'Crash' McCreary, who did all the final renderings of the dinosaurs. The creatures' skin coloring was created by Shane Mahan and John Rosengrant, among many others.\"\n\nOnce the designs were finalized on paper, Winston's crew created 1/5th-scale sculptures of each dinosaur, except for the brachiosaurus, which was so huge in life that Winston opted to do him as a 1/19th-scale model. These clay maquettes were molded, cast in fiberglass and painted not only to show Spielberg what the creatures would look like in three dimensions, but also to serve as the models for the computer-generated dinosaur effects created by Phil Tippett in conjunction with ILM and Dennis Muren. Winston's crew also fabricated 1/5th-scale mechanical versions of each character destined to become a full-scale animatronic puppet.\n\nWinston says it was a brainstorm in the middle of the night that led him to devise a system for exactly translating his miniature dinosaurs into their full-scale counterparts: using cross-sections taken at precise intervals from his 1/5th-scale dinosaurs, he had them blown up five times and made into wooden patterns which were then strung along metal spines. \"We covered the wooden patterns with fiberglass to create a smooth solid surface, then started putting clay on it to make our finished sculpture,\" Winston boasts, \"and that became our sculpting armature. It ended up looking exactly like a very large version of those wooden dinosaur skeleton toys you can buy! The form of the dinosaur was done virtually by mechanical drawing, so our full-scale creations were identical to our 1/5th-scale maquettes. All we had to do then was to sculpt the skin and the detail. Later I learned this was exactly the way the Statue of Liberty was built!\"\n\nEach of the full-scale dinosaurs, which included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the spitters, the velociraptors, a triceratops and an insert brachiosaurus head and neck, took teams of sculptors months to craft to Winston and Spielberg's satisfaction. The sculptures were then molded, and from these molds flexible skins were cast which were then fitted over graphite and metal skeletons laden with all manner of mechanical devices: air bladders to simulate breathing, cable-actuated systems to perform certain body movements, radio-controlled servo motors to control facial motion. The creatures were all designed to operate in real time.\n\nMeanwhile, mechanical effects supervisor Michael Lantieri was hard at work creating what the four man design team laughingly called “dinosaur interfaces,” mechanical systems that would help these full-scale behemoths to stand, walk and perform in scenes. \"We always joked that Stan got the glamorous end of it,\" Lantieri says, \"but the behind the-camera work turned out to be really important and Stan was great about including us. We really worked together. If he'd made a creature that was only there from the waist up, we built out of our special 'dinosaur interface' things that could be attached to the creature to move it. Stan and I talked about where we could attach our interfaces, how we would move them and the speed [we would use]. We built a lot of different rigs that would accommodate Stan's puppeteers, underground cranes and dollies, as well as pneumatic cranes that would assist with the broad movements. In addition, my guys would be involved in the shoving and pushing needed to give the full range of motion.\"\n\nOf all the life-size dinosaurs, the velociraptors embody the most controversial blending of techniques: at the core of several of the various effects models are human beings. Given the dubious legacy of el cheapo productions such as Unknown Island, The Land Unknown, and Japan's legendary contribution to the genre, the Godzilla series, the idea of man-in-a-suit dinosaurs has been reviled by cineastes from time immemorial. Today, the man-in-a-suit approach has become state-of-the-art, and Winston is almost single-handedly responsible for the public's dramatic change in attitude. \"If there was a man inside a dinosaur, there was a great deal of technology inside that dinosaur, too,\" Winston observes.\n\n\"For Jurassic Park, we designed and built full-sized, performing, live-action dinosaurs. The methods we used involved whatever technology was required to create the performance needed. We built two man-in-suit raptors and two fully animatronic, no-human-being puppet raptors utilizing a combination of cable and servo control. We also made a set of walking legs and a set of running legs from the waist down. For certain shots, we created insert hands which could, for example, open doors. Then we fabricated our stunt raptors, full-sized floppy puppets and poseable puppets. All told, we built 8 to 10 full-sized raptors that did different things. We also built a baby raptor splitting out of its shell [seen featured image at top of page], which was totally real-time using cable control.\"\n\nWinston's goal was to create fluid, believable dinosaurs that bore no trace of the mechanics which gave them life. Specifically, he wanted to conquer the phenomenon he refers to as \"waga-waga,\" which he scientifically defines as the jolt that occurs when a large moving mass comes to a stop. Such jolts, which mimes employ to simulate robotic movement, work fine for machines like in The Terminator, but they would have seriously undermined Winston's attempt to bring his dinosaurs to convincing life. Through the careful application of some unusual, though strangely related technologies, the raptors and some of Winston's other dinosaur creations, most dramatically the full-scale Tyrannosaurus rex, employed a breakthrough \"anti-waga\" system. They were dubbed \"Steadi-Dinos\" because their movements were based on neutral buoyancy, the same principal which is integral to the Steadicam. This concept was envisioned by Craig Caton, one of Winston's key mechanical designers.\n\n\"I saw the relationship between a person having a hard time trying to hold a camera at the end of his arm and the need to hold up a head mechanically on a long neck,\" Winston beams, \"and I realized that the same wonderful system of counterspringing the camera so the weight load becomes neutral could help us mechanically. We realized that this could work very well for us in terms of certain head and neck movements, to make everything fluid. The actual infrastructures of our dinosaurs were countersprung just like a Steadicam, which made our creatures' movements totally fluid and organic. That technology went into the spitters and the velociraptors, two of our most active dinosaurs.\"\n\nBut this system achieved its most remarkable results in Jurassic Park's star attraction, a 40'-long, 9,000-pound animatronic machine that perfectly recreated the appearance and fluid motion of a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex. \"The technology of the T-rex is beyond anything I think anybody has ever seen,\" Winston says. \"One of our big problems was figuring out how to make this 40'-long creature move quickly and violently, perform wonderfully, yet come to a smooth stop on cue without the waga-waga you would expect. We solved the problem through a series of computer-involved aspects of ramping up and ramping down speed, and by building accelerometers into our anti-waga devices. A series of accelerometers enabled us to measure the speed of the hydraulic rams moving within our dinosaur, which allowed us to counter that movement with other rams moving in the opposite direction elsewhere in the body. So our T-rex never completed a particular move and stopped without another aspect of the body compensating immediately. In order to keep this creature moving with speed and dynamics, nothing was allowed to come to a hard stop against its rigid 9,000 pounds without something else counterbalancing that motion. When its head comes to a sudden stop, something moves in the neck to compensate for it at that exact split second, which acts as a shock absorber. It's wonderful how this guy performs — he’s fast and big and dangerous and he's a great actor.\"\n\nWinston was concerned that the T-rex, weighing in at 9,000 pounds, was potentially as lethal off camera as on, and he began to worry about how to control this gigantic performer so it would interact on cue with its environment and not present a safety hazard. \"Unlike any other hydraulic creature you've seen in an amusement park, say King Kong [at Universal Studios], whose specific moves have been programmed in over a long period of time and who repeats those movements over and over, our Tyrannosaurus rex was this big hydraulic machine that had to perform on cue,\" Winston states. \"When you're an actor in a film, you have to be able to take direction immediately, so I was concerned about how to coordinate the computer keyboards with 8 or 10 people on them to make these big moves. The biggest problem we had beyond all this technology was safety. There's a real big danger factor working on a set with a 9,000-pound machine. This dinosaur could've killed someone really easiiy.\"\n\nAs with many of Winston's best ideas, the ideal solution to this hazard presented itself in the middle of the night. Winston had worked with performance Waldos many times before, but these telemetry suits, which translate the motion of the person wearing them into the performance of the mechanical creature itself, were designed for more humanoid characters. No one had ever devised a telemetry system for creatures that didn't mimic human motion. \"Thinking back to our 1/5th-scale mechanical T-rex prototype, I had the brainstorm that we could actually use one similar to it as our telemetry puppet!\" Winston says. \"I realized that we could literally build a performance Waldo for the T-rex that duplicated every motion he made in 1/5th scale, and use that as an interface for us to organically puppet the creature. Instead of having linear potentiometers linked to a control board, each potentiometer would correspond to a cylinder in our puppet version of the T-rex, so we had a 9,000-pound puppet that was literally operated by puppeteers manipulating a small version. That way, Steven could say, 'Let him rear up' and we could pull our 1/5th-scale Waldo back and let him act; our full-scale T-rex performed on the spot. If a situation required a really critical move, we could puppet it on the fly, and then, using the computer system that controlled our T-rex, we could record that move and repeat it over and over again at the push of a button.\"\n\nThe animatronic Tyrannosaurus rex was built in two parts. The upper body from head to tail down to the knee made up one section, while the legs comprised the other. The two sections could appear to be one creature by strategically placing a tree branch across the joint, there was also a set of dummy legs that could be positioned under the mechanical upper body. The effects team also constructed a foresection of the T-rex consisting of the front half of his body, which at 4,000 pounds was easier to move around than the full 9,000-pound version.\n\nThe gross movements of the nose to tail T-rex's massive upper body were controlled via a motion platform Winston calls the \"Dino-Simulator\" because of its similarities to a flight simulator, a hydraulically actuated, computer-operated platform capable of handling all six axes of movement smoothly, even while bearing an enormous weight load. Winston stresses that the full scale T-rex's articulation was tied directly into the flight-simulator concept. \"We took that same technology and, like branches on a tree, moved it right out to the tip of its nose,\" he says. \"The basis for the hydraulics and the mechanics and the fluidity of the T-rex's movement was the methodology behind flight simulators. The Dino-Simulator could fluidly move the creature forward, back, from side to side, and up and down. We took that system and continued to work up into the beast with hydraulic cylinders, transducers, and the addition of accelerometers, so what worked the Dino-Simulator also moved the entire dinosaur. Our problem was that it wasn't enough for the T-rex to move fluidly; it had to perform, so we had to take another step because now we had a long load-bearing situation that was setting itself up for an amazing waga! The solution involved computer cards to rapidly ramp-up and ramp-down speed, combined with counter-moves to stop the waga.\"\n\nAssisting with the construction of the Dino-Simulator was only the tip of the T-rex for veteran floor effects specialist Lantieri, who gives off the impression of a youthful elf with enormous enthusiasm for the problem-solving that comprises most of his work. It's hard to believe he got his start some 20 years ago handling effects for The Six-Million Dollar Man series at Universal Studios, where he now works his magic from his permanent, Spielberg-funded workspace on the lot. Along the way, Lantieri has won two Academy Award nominations and three British Academy Awards for his ability to contribute invisible expertise to such landmark productions as Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Back To The Future films.\n\nEven with all of this experience, however, Lantieri had never faced problems like those confronting him on Jurassic Park: \"Once you bring a dinosaur in for a shot, then what do you do with it? Not only did we have to move our creatures within the shot, we had to move them into position for the next setup. We had to be able to turn them around and move them out of the way. This meant we had to build very dinosaur-friendly sets to accommodate our winches and cranes and air bearings, most of which helped move the creatures into position and also, for certain shots, handled some of their broad movements in conjunction with Stan's puppeteers.\n\n\"We literally built a walker with training wheels to move the full set of T-rex legs. We also mounted the Dino-Simulator onto a tower that I built which was on air bearings, so we could use high-pressure air to glide a great deal of weight. Air bearings are used for moving heavy equipment out in the real world, but we use it for simulating earthquakes and other effects where we move big, heavy objects.\"\n\nSuch as 9,000-pound dinosaurs. This concept brings us back to the aforementioned shot in which the tyrannosaurus rex wreaks havoc on a jeep. \"The T-rex was supposed to give chase, run through a grove of trees, break through a gigantic log that's fallen across the road, then slam into the jeep,\" Lantieri smiles, pausing to catching his breath. \"Naturally, Steven wanted it in one shot. Upon the action cue, we were controlling half a dozen large real trees that had to be mowed down in sequence before we even see the T-rex. Each tree had to be scored, precut and hinged using internal cables, as well as cables on a pulley at a 45-degree angle. We set off sequential charges in the trees and had them spring loaded so they'd seem to plow from the back forward.\n\n\"Then we had this tree that had fallen across the road, which had to rip the windshield and shear the seat backs off our jeep as it crashes under it, but then break as our T-rex plows through it!\" Lantieri says, shaking his head. \"The fallen tree was built as a hollow log. It was made out of steel, then skinned with fiberglass and real bark and real limbs and real leaves. We then put a big air-driven piston through the center of it, so that when it was closed, just like a big barrel bolt, the log was sturdy and sound. The jeep actually drove into it at 30 m.p.h. and sheared the windshield off as everyone ducked at the last second, which was a real stunt that Gary Hymes supervised.\n\n\"A beat behind that, in the same shot, the T-Rex plunges through this log chest-first, which meant that we had to weaken the log and cause it to break itself open so we didn't hurt our creature! The second the jeep went through, I used high-pressure air to pull the piston and create a weak joint in the middle of the tree. The tree was then pulled back from the outside edges using hydraulics, like a swinging barn door, so that at the moment of impact with the T-rex we didn't hurt our star dinosaur.\n\n\"Lastly,\" Lantieri says with visible relief, \"we kept the shot going as the T-rex hits the side of the jeep, denting it and causing it to raise off the ground. Since our 9,000-pound animatronic puppet didn't have the strength to do what a real T-rex weighing 20 tons might do, we had to build a jeep that would dent itself on cue and appear to raise off the ground from the impact! We had the entire side of the jeep rigged with pneumatic rams and covered with lead sheets painted to look like the genuine steel skin. The ram, which was extended and welded to the lead skin, was then closed at high pressure at the moment of impact with the T-rex, and it sucked a great big dent in on the side of the jeep. We also had a pneumatic foot hidden behind the rear tire that slammed down into the ground and lifted the jeep off the ground, all of which had to be timed to the movement of the creature. This whole sequence was done in one shot, so you can imagine the amount of timing and cueing required in order for my crew and the stunt people to all hit their marks at the right moment. That was a huge mechanical effect.\" For added protection, the shot was also done as a motion-control move minus the T-rex, which could then be added later by ILM.\n\nThe film's most elaborate mechanical effects set piece again involved the Tyrannosaurus rex, who ravages a two-car caravan on a tour of Jurassic Park. The tour vehicles were supposed to be driverless Ford Explorers on a magnetic track. In reality, they were either radio-controlled or blind-driven vehicles which a driver controlled from underneath the hood. Lantieri had gained a lot of experience with these systems on Roger Rabbit, but he had never created a car that would literally crush itself. \"The crushable car was a real Ford Explorer,\" Lantieri explains. \"We replaced the door panels we wanted to crush with lightweight aluminum and lead, and we created replaceable, crushable roofs as well. We built a telescoping roll cage inside the headliners of the car, which was what actually pulled the roof down. We also had metal buckling on the side and glass breaking. It was all hydraulically driven, like a big crush press that we could control with joysticks. We stood right by the camera and Steven would say, 'Crush it a little more... a little more.' We were trying to give the feeling that this creature's foot was actually on top of the car, crushing it, which meant it couldn't seem like a mechanically clean crush. The car had to rock and crush at the same time, which required some puppeteering. When we shot our pickup scene inside the car with the two kids, we had to be sure that the roll cage was engineered to come to a stop at the right height so it wouldn't harm them, because Steven wanted it to look as if they were almost crushed.\"\n\nOnce the T-rex finishes demolishing the Ford Explorer, he bulldozes it over a cliff, where it lands in the branches of a huge tree. The kids then clamber out of the crushed vehicle as the branches give way, and the car chases them down the tree. The mix of kids and a 3,000-pound falling Ford had all the elements of a full-scale real-life disaster, but both Lantieri and Spielberg were fanatical about safety precautions. \"The tree was built on Stage 27, which is a pit,\" Lantieri recalls. \"Our tree was 60' high, and so detailed that its trunk was even covered with rolled bark that would scrape off as the car slid down it. The tree had to hold the weight of the real Explorer we were going to fly down after it got shoved over a cliff, so you can imagine all the safety precautions we had to go through. We used one of our regular cars with the motor removed, so it was just the frame and body, and we removed or replaced every piece that could break off. The only pieces that broke were ones that we controlled so we knew where they were going to fall. The car was always on a cable, but it still had to fall like it wasn't. It couldn't jerk when it fell. We actually put it into freefall using custom-built hydraulic wedges with electronic braking. That way, we could bring the car from a freefall to a controlled stop in one foot and it wouldn't snap on the cables because of the braking. It was all controlled digitally using a system we built combined with a descender rig that was capable of holding three or four tons. That way, we were able to drop a full-sized car on a limb above people's heads and do close calls. It was a tremendous responsibility, as well as a challenge, to make this look real.\"\n\nTo complicate matters further, the entire effect had to be completely timed out to Spielberg's nod. \"We had hydraulically controlled branches that would break on cue,\" Lantieri reveals, \"so I could build that cinematic tension that Steven loves to create — he's famous for it. After the car hit, the branch slowly started creaking and bent until he nodded, and then we let the branch break and the car fall. Steven knew exactly the length of suspense that he wanted to build. He'd say, 'Let it slip a little... let it slip... now!' and the car had to go right on the money. And it had to be repeatable. After the tree branch broke, we reset and reskinned it. We were all set to go while he waited, or we wouldn't be there the next day. That's part of the joy and challenge of working with someone like Steven.\"\n\nLantieri and company also created the usual atmospheric effects — rain, mist and fog — on set and on location, and also took care of details such as dinosaur tracks and park fences. \"Fencing!\" Lantieri shrieks. \"Let me tell you about a simple job, the kind of thing that would just slide by on this movie. When I read the script, the last thing on my mind was fencing! I was thinking, 'My God, the special effects on this movie! Do I really want this job?' But once we got the drawings and they said, 'Okay, just go put some fence up for us,' well, that took months.\"\n\nAnd yet, Lantieri concludes, \"I'm wondering where I go from here. I hope that having the opportunity to work on this film, with Steven as our fearless leader, wasn't a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nWinston concurs, adding: \"To me, the most exciting thing about Jurassic Park is that these dinosaurs are beautiful, they're real, and everything about their movements and their looks is organic. Some of the finest artists in the world worked for the longest time designing them, creating their look, their texture, and their movement, and the piece de resistance is the fact that they do perform and that they can act. And when they can't do something, that's where ILM and Dennis Muren come in. It'll be a beautiful, seamless mix of technologies so that what you see are living dinosaurs that are almost too real to be real.\"\n\nAlso from the June 1993 issue of AC is Jurassic Park: When Dinosaurs Rule the Box Office, in which cinematographer Dean Cundey, ASC details his approach to the project.",

    "fullText": "1993 was an important one for going to the movies, but for this screenwriter in particular it was magical. It was the year of The Fugitive, The Firm, True Romance, So I Married an Axe Murderer, and many more. Most importantly, though, it was the summer of Jurassic Park. It’s difficult to state what the world was like before Jurassic Park, because it was such a watershed moment in cinema. It was the biggest movie to come out that year, but one of the biggest movies to come out in cinema history—not just in terms of cinema history, but in terms of cultural impact. It’s a bonafide classic and after 30 years—or 65 million, depending on your reckoning—it still has so much to teach screenwriters, filmmakers, and storytellers.\n\nAdapting the Spirit if Not the Details\n\nJurassic Park was adapted into a screenplay by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, based on the book of the same name by Michael Crichton. Anyone who has read the novel and watched the movie will tell you that they bear only a passing resemblance to each other. There is nothing more boring than watching a movie that is a shot-for-shot remake of a novel, they tend to be way too long and monotonous. I’m thinking specifically of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone—a kitchen-sink adaptation that is just completely limp and makes no choices. But smart screenwriters understand that the medium matters and what works in a book does’t always work in a movie.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and What it Can Teach Screenwriters\n\nThe screenplay adaptation of Jurassic Park is a masterclass in changing things to make it more crowd-pleasing and easier to understand. In the book, there’s a subplot where they’re also racing against the clock to make sure no dinosaurs get off the island, streamlining that out of the narrative of the film was the right call.\n\nJohn Hammond is also given a redemption arc in the film that doesn’t exist in the novel. Reading an unapologetic capitalist who causes a disaster in a novel remains an unapologetic capitalist feels very realistic and natural, but in a film, audiences expect a change in characters.\n\nThe spirit of the book remains the same, but the adaptation creates something much more universal for the medium. Jurassic Park as an adaptation, even after thirty years, is worth studying in both directions for the beats of storytelling and how to do an adaptation correctly.\n\nJurassic Park would be a completely different movie if they didn’t explain the genesis of the dinosaurs. Try to imagine that film without explaining the science behind living dinosaurs. Would you, as an audience member, feel comfortable just jumping into that world without getting an answer about how the dinosaurs were made? So much of the fascinating science-fiction element of that film comes from the science behind how they might have brought the dinosaurs to life.\n\nThe movie wouldn’t work without that detour into the science because audiences would have spent too much time asking themselves why the dinosaurs existed. Crichton and Koepp, the writers of Jurassic Park, understood the assignment that they were given. It would be easy to look at all of the running time and script pages spent explaining the science and jump straight to the excitement, but the story unfolds in a much more mature way, allowing audiences to suspend their disbelief and follow the science.\n\nWithout the science, Jurassic Park likely wouldn’t be classified as science fiction—it would be just another B-adventure monster movie like King Kong. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with King Kong, but that’s just not what audiences were signing up for with a movie based on a Michael Crichton story.\n\nIt’s also fascinating to see the vehicle with which much of the science is revealed: a theme-park like video and ride that reveals the information at a low level, as if for children, frustrating the scientists who want to go deeper and ask more in-depth questions. It functions to let kids follow along and answer those more intelligent questions in a really elegant way.\n\nWhen you’re looking at what questions your story needs to answer, think about what they’re expecting and what questions they’d ask that would be to the detriment of the story. Make sure you’re answering everything you can that won’t get in the way.\n\nIt would have been easy for Jurassic Park to start with the dinosaurs—well, more than it already does with Muldoon battling the raptors. Aside from this opening tease, the dinosaurs are kept behind the proverbial curtain until our point-of-view characters—Doctors Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm—see them for the first time.\n\nThis is something that sets the tone for the film and lets us see how amazing this really is. By holding the reveal, the audience is able to bask in the wonder at the same time as the characters that have just entered this world.\n\nBack to the Future: A Perfect Trilogy for Writerly Study\n\nThink about this like the introduction of Orson Welles as Harry Lime in The Third Man. The characters all talk about him relentlessly, and we get to know him through everyone’s perception of him. When that light clicks on and he smiles devilishly, we know so much about what this could possibly mean in a way that really focuses the audience on their participation in the narrative. Jurassic Park does the same thing, but adds the element of the impossible to it—I mean, we can’t really clone dinosaurs yet.\n\nAs you build the major turns and reveals in your story, how can you craft them in a way that preserves that surprise and allows the audience to take part in the breathtaking awe? There are few better examples than this.\n\nThink about the build up of the velociraptors in the same context as Harry Lime. We see Muldoon struggle with one unseen at the beginning. We hear the stories Dr. Grant tells about them to scare children. They discuss how dangerous they are over their locked and hidden paddock. And then… once we know exactly how lethal they are, they’re released. It’s a perfect build up and is the only reason they’re so terrifying by the end.\n\nIf there’s another thing with celebrating in Jurassic Park, it’s the characterization and dialogue of each of the characters. They’re all so incredibly unique and lovable in their own ways (even if you hate them.) As you watch the movie, see if you can imagine any of the dialogue from one character coming out of the mouth of another character. There might be a tiny little bit of overlap between the kids, but aside from that, everyone is an expert in their field and talks in a really distinct way based on their background, training, and point of view.\n\nIf you were looking at the dialogue on the page without the character names attached, you’d be able to tell who was speaking. John Hammond speaks in a very proper way, his accent is practically dictated by his word choice. Dr. Sattler’s is generally more upbeat than Dr. Grant, and they differ in their specialties (paleobotany vs. more general paleontology). Dr. Malcolm is a force on his own with every line he utters. Even Dennis Nedry and the bloodsucking lawyer—both greedy—can easily be told apart.\n\nIt’s a master class in paying attention to each of the concerns, backgrounds, desires, education levels, and upbringings of a wide cast of characters. And none of them speak the same way.\n\nThe characters are also defined by small, subtle actions that are just as relatable to an audience as the words they speak. Think about Alan Grant tying the seatbelt on the helicopter together and his dislike of children. Add to that his decision to launch that flare and rescue the children when the T-Rex attacks, we have a very complicated character.\n\nAs you’re looking to refine your screenplay, think about ways you can set your characterizations in one direction, and show what the character is truly made of by making decisions in other directions.\n\nJurassic Park is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and it’s worth doing so. The story is tight, the filmmaking is incredible, and the John Williams score puts it over the top. But it all starts with words on the page and the script for this one is an all-timer. After 30 years, it still sings, maintaining the bombastic and mesmerizing effect that Steven Spielberg imbued it with initially.\n\nAlthough it’s hard to capture the feeling of watching it for the first time in 1993, do your best to put on those fresh eyes and see how well the screenplay works for the first timers. You’ll be surprised how many secrets a script can hold after all this time.\n\nJurassic Park is currently streaming with your Peacock subscription.

driver of this increase in stabilization performance has been in the gyroscopic sensors used to measure the vibration and control electronics used to correct it.  For these types of applications, the accuracy of the zero offset of the gyro sensor is often the limiting factor.  Even when perfectly still, noise will cause the sensor to read a small but non-zero value, which will in turn cause the stabilization system to drift.  The smaller the drift, the longer the stabilization system can hold an image steady.  If there were no noise on the gyro sensor and the stabilization system worked perfectly, it should in theory be able to provide an infinite number of stops of benefit.  However, at somewhere around 6 stops of shutter speed increase, the limiting factor stops becoming the electronics, and instead becomes the rotational motion of the Earth!\n\nTo illustrate , lets imagine that you are somewhere on the Earth’s surface, pointing the camera due East or West.  For simplicity, lets assume you are on the equator, but your latitude doesn’t actually matter for this analysis.  There are 86,400 seconds in a day, so Earth rotates at a rate of 2π/86400 radians/second, or 7.27*10^-5 rad/s.  That means that your subject, which is presumably stationary on Earth’s surface as well, is rotating at this rate.  Your camera, which is using its IBIS system to attempt to keep everything as still as possible, may not realize that you are rotating with your subject and will instead try to zero out any rotation of the camera, including that of the Earth.  More technically, the camera is trying to maintain stability with respect to an inertial reference frame, which by virtue of the Earth’s rotation, you and your subject are not.\n\nThe camera will of course move with the Earth and your subject, but will rotate relative to the subject.  If the camera is pointed east as shown in the figure above, it will rotate up relative to the subject.\n\nLets say that you have an exposure time given by the variable T.  IBIS will therefore cause the image to move by a distance on the sensor given by:\n\nUsing our typical standard for the maximum allowable blur to be 1 pixel width, we get the maximum allowable shutter time to be\n\nA 24 megapixel full frame camera will have pixels that are 0.0059mm wide.  Plugging this into the above equation, we get\n\nIf we take 1/Focal Length as the standard advice for the maximum shutter speed you can use to achieve sharp images, this equation says we can use shutter speeds 81 times as long with stabilization before Earth’s rotation blurs the image by one pixel.  In more familiar terms:\n\nNeat.  Of course not all cameras have the same 0.0059mm pixel pitch, but the rule for the maximum hand-held shutter speed will vary accordingly, so this 6.3 stops will be consistent across most cameras.  We can turn this around and say that in order to provide 6.3 stops of stabilization, the system must be able to measure and compensate for rotations of the camera as slow as the Earth’s, or 360 degrees per day.  That’s pretty impressive.\n\nPresumably, a calculation like the one above or very similar was the inspiration for the claim by Olympus Camera:\n\n“6.5 stops is actually a theoretical limitation at the moment due to rotation of the earth interfering with gyro sensors”\n\nSince then the plot has thickened.  Olympus has released the OM-D E-M1X which claims to have 7.5 stops of stabilization, and Panasonic claims their new 70-200 f/2.8 has 7 stops of stabilization.  How could this be?  Without access to the data used to perform the CIPA stabilization rating test for these pieces of equipment, it’s difficult to say for sure.  In theory though, there are some possible ways to work around the limitations placed be Earth’s rotation:\n\nThe first isn’t a good solution for many reasons.  Don’t have GPS signal?  Shooting next to a magnet?  Your system won’t work.  The second solution is much more plausible, but still very difficult.  The user would have to be pointing the camera at the subject for long enough such that the drift in their aim at the subject is smaller than the drift from the rotation of the earth.  This is also implausible.  What is concerning though, is that this second method is one that could work very well to cancel out Earth’s rotation on the CIPA specified stabilization test apparatus.\n\nFor the CIPA stabilization test, the camera is mounted to a vibration platform.  The camera is then moved by the platform in a way that is determined by a CIPA provided waveform designed to mimic the motions from hand-holding a camera.  The setup is shown below:\n\nIn this test setup, the camera is mounted to a very stable platform and held there for a long time before and after the test images are being taken.  In theory, this could make it much easier to for the camera to identify and filter out any effects from Earth’s rotation.  If the waveform has no very low frequency components, it would be easy to identify any low frequency motion as Earth’s rotation.  Without knowing exactly what waveform is given to camera manufacturers to perform this test though, it’s impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions.  It would be great if we could get some independent verification of the stated stabilization values, but CIPA seems to make that deliberately difficult.  As quoted on their application guide:\n\nThis seems unnecessarily restrictive to me and makes independent verification and analysis of the test impossible.\n\nThis has been a long way of saying that I don’t know if Olympus and Panasonic have found a way to compensate for the Earth’s rotation in their stabilization systems, breaking through the 6.3 stop limit, or if they are achieving 7+ stops through oddities of the CIPA rating test.  If anyone has one of these cameras with 7+ stops of stabilization and some time on their hands, it would be really cool to show the camera breaking through the Earth rotation barrier.  If the cameras can’t, and you could show that Earth’s rotation is actually the limiting factor on the stabilization system, well that would be pretty cool too.",

    "description": "Jack Edwards shapes the online world’s reading habits from BookTok. But can he handle his success?",
    "fullText": "“Samuel Johnson, William Hazlitt, Harold Bloom and James Wood. And now you?”\n\n“Oh, I mean, that’s pretty crazy to hear, but I don’t know.”\n\nDr Johnson never filmed a “spicy books with cartoon covers” vlog. But Jack Edwards cannot quite deny being the most important literary critic in the world. In commercial terms, he certainly is. A nod from him fills bathtubs, train carriages and public parks with copies of a book he likes. Booksellers buy and arrange their stock to his taste. And he is not confined to new releases. When he dug up an obscure Dostoevsky (White Nights), his positive review moved it from cellars to shop windows instantaneously. I first met him for this interview around the time of the 2024 International Booker Prize. He had been asked to host the ceremony – and to livestream it. I watched him cruise up the red carpet, encircled by cameras and attendants.\n\nEdwards is a literary tastemaker, but not in the familiar mode. You will not find any submissions of his languishing in the LRB slush pile. Instead he posts on BookTok and BookTube, the social media planes concerned with reading, where millions of viewers watch videos about books. At first, BookTok was confined to the lonely bedrooms of coronavirus lockdowns. Now it has stalls at the Hay Festival and the National Literacy Trust. Waterstones has “BookTok made me buy it” tables.\n\nEdwards is the foremost star of these platforms. Per his bio, he is the “internet’s resident librarian”. He is 27 years old and, on YouTube, has 1.5 million subscribers and 158 million views – which is roughly 16 and 1,755 Wembley Stadiums respectively. He is conventionally handsome, and excitable and sensitive in manner. He started YouTube while at secondary school in Brighton. His first videos were “day in the life” vlogs, study tips and A-level results reactions.\n\nThe boom came when he progressed to Durham University to study literature. His atmospheric recordings of undergraduate life proved so popular that the dean of his college now calls its oversubscription “the Jack Edwards effect”.\n\nHis next major growth spurt came when his university career ended. When Oxford University rejected his master’s application in 2020, Edwards posted a video of himself crying, entitled “oxford university rejected my masters application… (sorry this video is sad)”. Social media rewards confession. Authenticity, sincerity and vulnerability were important – more important than orthodox intellectual baubles. He described social media to me as “democratic… When you log on, you don’t need a qualification, you don’t need to be an established journalist.”\n\nGraduating into the pandemic was “confusing and strange”, he says. Edwards did not feel he could be a “StudyTuber” if he was no longer a student. He spent a month alone. During it, he read 30 books and decided he wanted a career in them. But he could not secure a job in a hotel, let alone one in publishing.\n\nUnlike other hopefuls, however, Edwards had a platform. He could not get jobs with publishers, but HarperCollins was willing to publish his guide to university life, The Uni-Verse. Having tried the conventional routes into employment, Edwards launched himself as a full-time book influencer. He posted reading-related videos from London, Paris, New York, Korea and elsewhere. The period was “really special” to Edwards. He read favourite authors in their native locations. He started Mieko Kawakami’s All the Lovers in the Night on the bullet train to Tokyo and finished the last page as the train arrived. “From the first page I was just absolutely entranced… I felt this real sense of catharsis, that I’d been through this entire journey, physically throughout Japan, but also with that author.” Occasionally, in a bodega, a coffee shop, a bookstore or a library, people would “tap me on the shoulder and say that they read their favourite book because they found it from my channel. And there’s no better feeling in the world than that – nothing.”\n\nLike many graduates his age, Edwards settled down in London. He posts reviews, commentary and hauls. His style as a literary creator has become defined, and honours the lessons of his social media success. Books get positive reviews if they stir his emotions – especially if they make him weep. With social media, he told me, “we can visually see people reacting to a book and having a kind of subjective emotional response that feels even more personal than maybe a book critic or journalist can. [In traditional reviews] we don’t get to see them crying in response to a book that broke their heart. I think that’s part of the magic of BookTok.”\n\nEdwards champions BookTok and also defends it. Critics argue that the platform is more about being seen reading than actually reading, and that it promotes low-quality fiction. Edwards rejects that characterisation energetically: “The only feature common to all ‘BookTok books’ – which can mean both enemies-to-lovers roommate novels and Greek mythological retellings – is popularity with a young audience.” He reminds me of “White Nights”, the Dostoevsky story that his review placed “alongside Colleen Hoover and Sarah J Maas on a ‘BookTok made me buy it’ shelf… I’ll recommend contemporary novels alongside classics because I think often we’re looking for those moments that resonate with us and that feel perennial, that feel evergreen.”\n\nHis favourite classics are by Toni Morrison and James Baldwin. They are “people who I think really understood the human condition, what it was to feel, to love, and to interact with the people around us.” More recently, “I’m a big Sally Rooney fan. She talks about when you’re on your deathbed you’ll think about the people that you loved and that you interacted with… it’s not frivolous to make art about the people that you loved and that you interacted with.”\n\nHe keeps his core content mostly apolitical. There is a progressive, inclusionary tone to his videos – “a book from every country in Asia” or “banned books and rainbow capitalism” – but he is seldom explicitly partisan online. He is more outspoken, however, on his X account, where he reposts Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana and makes no secret of his dislike for Keir Starmer’s Labour government.\n\nMostly, his commitment is to books. He told me: “I think one of the truest things for the world right now is that the worst of times can facilitate really incredible art, and we need that sort of self-expression.” Where we have come from, where we are going, and so on are crucial considerations when giving praise: “They always do represent where we’re at as a society and a culture.” Edwards quoted Bertolt Brecht, asking if there will also be singing in the dark times – and answering yes: there will be singing about the dark times.\n\nWhen we first spoke I was struck by how open and positive Edwards was. It may come easily to the enormously successful, but Edwards maintained a generous, pleasant perspective the whole time we spoke. Abusive comments: “Sometimes people’s responses can be quite personal. I suppose that’s probably the drawback. But the pros outweigh the cons by a long way!” A spanner about the Booker’s politics: “You’re making me work for it, I’m on my toes!” Suffering a fanbase pile-on, as he did after criticising the author of The Kissing Booth: “Yeah! People feel very strongly about books. That’s part of the fun!” On the relevance of establishment awards: “For me they’re a good guiding light to discover new things.” On pressure: “I obviously feel pressure being online… to always keep it kind.”\n\nIt seems he has always been that way. A student at university contemporaneously with Edwards told me how sardonic whispers would circulate whenever it became known that “the YouTuber” was in a bar. People would ask for selfies, not without a trace of nastiness. At that time, Edwards was far from successful enough to overwhelm such sneers. But he was always a good sport. I was shown a picture in which he had been willing to hold up a baby doll that he had been handed without explanation.\n\nBut soon after our first interview, Edwards’s output waned. His videos became sparser and more subdued, and they stayed that way for the rest of 2024. Then, at the start of 2025, Edwards posted a confessional video titled “every book I want to read in 2025 (and why i stopped posting book reviews)”. He described last year as “something to survive” and admitted that it had “got to the point where I had to really seriously consider whether I wanted to continue doing this.”\n\nEdwards is subject to copious online abuse. On camera, he mentioned withholding his opinions on pop culture because people called them cringe. But the harassment is much harsher than that, and touches on topics Edwards does not mention. The top posts on his own Reddit page accuse him – without citing evidence – of not reading the books he talks about, plagiarising reviews and “scamming” his followers with unsubstantial paid-content tiers. The thread about him on the gossip forum Tattle Life has been remade after reaching the site’s comment limit four times. The comments often speculate, cruelly, about his sexuality.\n\nOn top of calculated abuse, Edwards also suffered from the ambient pressures of fame. For instance, the book review site Goodreads labels Edwards’s account “#1 most read”: if he leaves a review on a book, it will be the first one users see, meaning a negative review can severely affect a book’s chances of success.\n\nAll this got to Edwards. Friends asked if he realised he was apologising and issuing disclaimers before speaking when he socialised with them. He lived with his “guard up all the time, flinching constantly, feeling just genuinely afraid to share anything”. He stopped posting opinions and even changed his accent because of criticism. In the video in which he discussed his withdrawal, he acknowledged commenters who said they missed “the old Jack”. He said, “I miss him too, I really do.”\n\nBecoming an influencer is now by many accounts the most popular career ambition for the young. But many who succeed take long breaks for their mental health, or withdraw entirely. Edwards reckons that online fame is “not something the human brain is wired for”. He described it as “traumatic” to see “so many people discussing something about you.” It feels “so invasive and intimate”.\n\nEdwards was born in Brighton in 1998 with terrible eyesight. A prescription of 8.75 keeps you off the football pitch. “You don’t really see the ball until it’s, like, inches from your face, and by that point it’s too late to pick which part of the head it’s gonna hit,” Edwards told me when we spoke again in August last year. His bookishness proceeded from his near blindness; his parents taught him the letters very young so they could get him a proper eye test. He started a blog to review the new Hunger Games film when he was 14.\n\nIf reading was a solitary pastime for Edwards the child, it is a solitary job for Edwards the man. He lives in a flat in Soho – not a cheap part of London – with another content creator for a flatmate. He never joined anything like a graduate scheme with colleagues his age. He rents a co-working space because, he says, “I like to feel like there is life going on around me.” He sometimes wishes someone would give him feedback on his work before he publishes it, because when the first judges are the commenters, “at that point there’s no room to manoeuvre… you kind of get tested in the public court before you, you know?”\n\nEdwards’s Zoom background featured the same bookshelves visible in his dejected January 2025 video. But he seemed to have developed a new toughness since then. He looked older, with a more muscular neck and longer, slightly receding hair, and he seemed almost bloody-minded about pushing on. In his own words, “Maybe my prefrontal cortex just developed, but I no longer care to have to argue my point or prove my moral worth every time I don’t enjoy something.” He dismissed unfair criticism flatly, calling it “nitpicking culture” and “moral panic” that is “not how the world works”. Where his old videos overshared in “toxic honesty”, he now has definite lines about not discussing his friends or relationships. That “really cutting remarks” are the comments that “stay with you”, he acknowledged as an unfortunate but permanent fact. He had a detached view of social media. As well as disdaining the angsts it causes, he distrusts the comforts it offers. “You have this illusion of community,” it was surprising to hear him say, “when we’re really very alone.”\n\nHis latest project is an attempt to forge real community, though it is still essentially a social media product. He wants his new book club, Inklings, to be “this book club community where I can have something that’s a bit more solid, tangible”. When I asked about his hopes for the next five years, he said he was focusing on the work. At that time, Inklings had no episodes but was already the fastest-growing club in the platform Fable’s history. Since then, its episodes have featured Oisín McKenna (Evenings and Weekends), David Nicholls (One Day), Coco Mellors (Cleopatra and Frankenstein), Luke Thompson (Bridgerton) and the actor Cillian Murphy.\n\nIn September, he recorded an episode with Palestine-born novelist Yasmin Zaher at the Saatchi Gallery. A large, orderly crowd filled pews in a white gallery lit by pink accent lights. I had been the only man of the first 20 people to queue. It was possible to track the location of a daddy long legs that was floating through the room by the screaming and lurching it provoked. Edwards came down the aisle in a t-shirt and corduroy trousers, laughing nervously and smiling at his fans, who cheered. On stage, he said it was “so special for me to get to be here with you all… to take this thing we do in isolation… moments we spend in our own heads… and turn it into community”.\n\nEdwards said he escaped feeling overexposed by “finding something – for me, it’s been books and reading – to refract everything through”. He asked whether Zaher’s characters obsessed over “being clean, perhaps because there’s little else they can control”, and whether, in the case of another, the “dirty parts of her she couldn’t clean then became a target”. He said we knew “almost too much” about the protagonist when we heard her “sexual perversions and hot takes”, and mentioned another who “withholds, and she keeps for herself almost as a way of maintaining ownership of, and having control of, her identity, and saying, actually, I can’t be defined by external sources; I define myself”.\n\nZaher’s novel, The Coin, was her debut. Edwards asked if being unknown allowed her a “lack of inhibitions”. She agreed that you are freer when “you don’t know who your audience may be”. Edwards knows who his audience is, and they know him. He told me of fans commenting on his interviews that they could answer every question for him.\n\nBut if the relationship is not free; it is tender. Rose, 25, unemployed after failing to find a job in publishing, had been watching him “constantly for five years”. She said, “I literally rediscovered the love of literature through him – so big, big fan.” Allesia, 21, unemployed after recently graduating, had gotten into Edwards after immigrating from Ukraine six years ago, at which point she could not read in English. “I like how accessible he is to people who don’t read or have just started reading.” Ryan, 28, had watched Edwards for a decade. He now directs AI engineering at a tech company but had previously worked for influencers in LA. He had seen that “it’s all consuming when your entire life is to be someone; that can be brutal”.\n\nAlmost everyone was there by themselves. Some came with a parent or a friend, but I didn’t see a crowd of three. Rose said Edwards’s content was “the kind you stumble onto when you’re, like, in your room alone”. Ryan said that in his decade of viewing he had come to “enjoy my self more”. Almost immediately after taking the microphone, Edwards had said, “Bear with me while I try not to cry.” It was easy to imagine his audience feeling he had done the same for them. Edwards helped people, Rose reckoned: “He brings a lot of, like, humanity and empathy… I think the world would be a better place if everyone read fiction. It’s literally learning how to put yourself in other people’s shoes.”\n\nEdwards is working on his first novel. He would only tell me that it is historical and set in the UK. He will certainly find a publisher. He claims his whole life has been “that pursuit of letters on a page”. Whether that pursuit will lead to literary greatness of course remains to be seen. He may not become Dr Johnson – but Jack Edwards seems, at last, to be becoming himself.\n\n[Further reading: Cats are better than dogs – and much better than David Baddiel]",

    "title": "How China's 'Hurricane 3000' Microwave Weapon Drops Drones From The Air",
    "description": "Drone swarms can quickly overwhelm defenses and are difficult to combat effectively, but China's new microwave system could be about to change that.",
    "fullText": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has changed the face of battlefields forever. The widespread use of drones has left traditional air defenses floundering; launching missiles that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to counter threats that may only cost a few hundred dollars is not practical. Scale this up to countering swarms of drones, and the logistics, costs, and effectiveness of such systems wane even further. This is why systems like Israel's Iron Beam laser weapon that can destroy drones for a few dollars \"a pop\" are being developed and introduced into combat service.\n\nThe Chinese Hurricane 3000 system is another new weapon developed to tackle the growing use of drones in combat. However, unlike the laser-based Israeli system, the Hurricane 3000  system uses microwaves to disable drones and drone swarms at ranges exceeding 3 kilometers (1.9 miles). This is a similar weapon to the US Army's Leonidas microwave weapon, although China claims that the 3000's reported three-kilometer-plus range is over a kilometer more than the Leonidas system.\n\nThe Zhuhai Airshow in 2024 was when the public got a first peek at the new system, and it was later showcased during a military parade in Beijing in September 2025. More recently, Norinco, the Chinese state-owned contractor that developed the system, has disclosed some of the system's technical details and its intended role. Both systems are vehicle-mounted and can be operated independently or networked into a cohesive air defence system with missile, laser, and artillery units.\n\nThe history of war is not just a tale of conflicts; it's also often a story of an arms race that can seesaw dramatically. The rising use of drones on the battlefield amply demonstrates this point, as arms manufacturers clamor to come up with practical solutions to address this threat not just effectively, but cost-effectively. The use of high-power microwave weapons (HPM) is one area where developers have thrown a lot of resources, and the Chinese weapon is the latest manifestation of this.\n\nUnlike laser or kinetic weapons, HPMs are designed to overwhelm a drone or a UAV's electronic systems using bursts of concentrated electromagnetic energy. These bursts travel at the speed of light and can cause drones to fail in several ways, including EMI-induced timing errors and physical damage to electronic components. Another feature of such weapons is their versatility; advanced systems like Epirus' Leonidas can not only target specific drones but have already disabled a swarm of 49 drones in a few seconds. And, as long as they have power, the other main advantages of these weapons are a bottomless ammunition supply and an exponentially lower engagement cost.\n\nThe fact that these beams travel at the speed of light allows a rapid response once a target is detected and tracked. This makes them effective against fast, low-flying drones that are difficult (and potentially costly) to intercept using traditional air-defense methods. However, the system isn't flawless; it's generally considered to be a line-of-sight weapon, and its effectiveness can be reduced with effective shielding.\n\nThe Hurricane 3000 and its smaller Hurricane 2000 variant are mobile, truck-mounted systems that have moved from the experimental stage to field deployment and were showcased at China's 2025 V-Day Military Parade. The more advanced Hurricane 3000 system has a longer range,  improved tracking, detection, and fully automated combat capabilities. Overall, according to Yu Jianjun, a Norinco expert, the 3000 represents a \"comprehensive upgrade in combat performance compared to the Hurricane 2000.\"\n\nThe system uses radar to detect threats at longer ranges. Once detected, the system switches to optoelectronic sensors to guide the microwave antennas onto the target. However, this is not designed to replace existing air defenses. Rather, it's intended to complement the existing \"traditional\" missile and artillery systems to form an \"iron triangle\" drone defense system, with each system used to its own strengths.\n\nWhile the primary focus of the development program was to develop an effective way of countering the drone threat, Norinco says it wants to explore other potential applications for the platform. Mr. Yu said that among the options being explored are the use of the weapon to counter electronic warfare aircraft, interrupt communications, counteracting precision weapons, and, it's being proposed as a non-lethal active denial system against people. The latter is a beam of focused energy that can cause the recipients to encounter an intolerable burning sensation that has a minimal risk of injury.\n\nIn short, the Hurricane and similar weapons exist because shooting million-dollar missiles at hobby-grade drones stopped making sense.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Sometimes a video shows someone doing something so ill-considered that it leaves viewers wondering how the person made it out of the situation uninjured — as was the case with footage of a tourist effectively picking a fight with a sea lion instead of enjoying a peaceful vacation.\n\nThe reel shared by the Tourons of National Parks (@touronsofnationalparks) Instagram account prompted strong criticism of the subject's decision-making.\n\nThe video shows a man spotting a sea lion at the boat launch of a marina. Instead of leaving the animal in peace, he goes up to terrorize it, egged on by voices off-camera. Lunging at the creature, raising a balled fist, and then trying to tackle the animal, the tourist jokingly appears to instigate a fight.\n\nLuckily, for his sake, the sea lion only squares up to him without doing serious damage. However, sea lion attacks have been on the rise in certain areas, according to CNN, and people have reported bites and uncharacteristic aggression that the news report attributed to toxic algae impacting the sea creatures.\n\nSadly, the encounter in the video is far from the first time that tourists have provoked wild animals. Videos of them aggravating elk, taunting bison, and getting charged at by oryx antelopes have gone viral, with many commenters criticizing the subjects for their thoughtless, dangerous, and cruel behavior.\n\nWild animals are not living their lives to entertain humans, and the audacity to try to harass a sea lion for no reason is dangerous. Not only is the tourist in the video causing stress to the animal, but he is also putting both himself and the sea lion at risk of harm. Wild animals can be euthanized if they attack people, whether they were provoked or not.\n\nInstagram users flooded the comments with extreme distaste for the man's actions.\n\n\"Those things can DESTROY you!\" one person remarked.\n\n\"Alcohol was definitely involved,\" another added.\n\n\"They kill sharks,\" a commenter warned. \"Stop messing with nature unless it messes with you.\"\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court rejected the Justice Department's bid to charge five more people accused of disrupting a Minnesota church service this ​month, according to court documents made public on Saturday, revealing the lengths the Trump administration ‌has gone to prosecute those involved in the demonstration.\n\nThe ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest ‌legal setback for the Justice Department as it pursues demonstrators who interrupted a service on Sunday in protest of a pastor's apparent connection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One judge involved in the case said the department's request appeared to be unprecedented.\n\nA federal magistrate judge this week declined to approve arrest warrants ⁠for five proposed defendants, including former ‌CNN anchor Don Lemon, who recorded the demonstration, citing a lack of evidence. The judge approved charges for three alleged leaders of the demonstration, but struck ‍a proposed charge accusing them of physically obstructing a house of worship.\n\nDEFENDANTS ACCUSE ADMINISTRATION OF RETALIATION\n\nThe case has drawn substantial attention as the Trump administration pursues a sweeping immigration crackdown in the state and administration officials have vowed ​to protect Christian services.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ‌three defendants — activists Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly — were each charged with conspiracy against rights for allegedly intimidating and harassing parishioners, according to a criminal complaint. They have accused the Trump administration of retaliation over their protest.\n\nThe Justice Department first asked the chief trial judge and later the appeals court to immediately intervene and approve warrants for the five other proposed defendants, citing ⁠a risk of similar church disruptions.\n\nThe chief U.S. District Court ​judge in Minnesota, Patrick Schiltz, described the Justice Department's request ​as \"unheard of in our district\" and any other under the 8th Circuit, which covers seven U.S. states, according to a letter made public on Saturday.\n\nAll three judges ‍on the 8th Circuit panel ⁠agreed not to intervene. One judge, Leonard Steven Grasz, wrote that he believed prosecutors had shown enough evidence to justify charges against the other proposed defendants, but that prosecutors have ⁠ways to get them approved other than through the appeals court.\n\nThe Justice Department can still ask a grand jury to ‌approve charges against the demonstrators or seek to present additional evidence to the magistrate judge.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The bloodiest crackdown on dissent since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution is slowly coming into focus, despite authorities cutting off the Islamic Republic from the internet and much of the wider world.\n\nCities and towns smell of smoke as fire-damaged mosques and government offices line streets. Banks have been torched, their ATMs smashed. Officials estimate the damage to be at least $125 million, according to an Associated Press tally of reports by the state-run IRNA news agency from over 20 cities.\n\nThe number of dead demonstrators reported by activists continues to swell. Activists warn it shows Iran engaging in the same tactics it has used for decades, but at an unprecedented scale — firing from rooftops on demonstrators, shooting birdshot into crowds and sending motorcycle-riding paramilitary Revolutionary Guard volunteers in to beat and detain those who can’t escape.\n\n“The vast majority of protesters were peaceful. The video footage shows crowds of people — including children and families — chanting, dancing around bonfires, marching on their streets,” said Raha Bahreini, of Amnesty International. \"The authorities have opened fire unlawfully.”\n\nThe killing of peaceful protesters — as well as the threat of mass executions — have been a red line for military action for U.S. President Donald Trump. An American aircraft carrier and warships are approaching the Mideast, possibly allowing Trump to launch another attack on Iran after bombing its nuclear enrichment sites last year. That risks igniting a new Mideast war.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to detailed questions from the AP regarding the suppression of the demonstrations.\n\nThe demonstrations began Dec. 28 at Tehran’s historic Grand Bazaar, initially over the collapse of Iran's currency, the rial, then spread across the country.\n\nTensions exploded on Jan. 8, with demonstrations called for by Iran's exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi. Witnesses in Tehran told the AP before authorities cut internet and phone communication that they saw tens of thousands of demonstrators on the streets.\n\nAs communications failed, gunfire echoed through Tehran.\n\n“Many witnesses said they had never seen such a large number of protesters on the streets,” said Bahar Saba of Human Rights Watch. “Iranian authorities have repeatedly shown they have no answers other than bullets and brutal repression to people taking to the streets.”\n\nAli Akbar Pourjamshidian, a deputy interior minister speaking on state TV Wednesday, acknowledged the violence began in earnest on Jan. 8.\n\n“More than 400 cities were involved,\" he said.\n\n“Tonight you all must be vigilant. Tonight is the night for keeping mosques, all bases everywhere filled with ‘Hezbollahi,’” Yekta said, using a word for “followers of God” that carries the connotation of fervent supporters of Iran's theocracy.\n\nAlready weakened by the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June, the authorities decided to fully employ violence to end the demonstrations, experts said.\n\n“I think the regime viewed it as this was a moment of existential threat and that they could either allow it to play out and allow the protests to build and allow foreign powers to increase their rhetoric and increase their demands on Iran,” said Afshon Ostovar, an expert on the Revolutionary Guard and professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California.\n\n\"Or they could turn out the lights, kill as many people as necessary ... and hope they could get away with it. And I think that’s what they ultimately did.”\n\nBasij key in disrupting protests\n\nIn Iran, one of the main ways its theocracy can squash demonstrations is through the Basij, the Guard's volunteer arm.\n\nMosques in Iran include facilities for the Basij. Guard Gen. Heydar Baba Ahmadi was quoted by the semiofficial Mehr news agency in 2024 as estimating “79% of Basij resistance bases are located in mosques and 5% in other holy places.”\n\nIranian state media repeatedly has aired images of mosques damaged in the protests without exploring their links to the Basij.\n\n“Most neighborhood Basij bases are co-located with mosques and most neighborhood Basij leaders are associated with the mosque leadership,\" Ostovar said, adding that demonstrators “going after regime targets” associated with repression would have considered them “a legitimate part of it.”\n\nVideos show Basij holding long guns, batons and pellet guns. Anti-riot police can be seen wearing helmets and body armor, carrying assault rifles and submachine guns.\n\nThe videos show police firing shotguns into crowds, something authorities deny despite corpses showing wounds consistent with metal birdshot. Scores have reportedly suffered blinding eye wounds from birdshot — something seen in the protests around the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.\n\nIran's semiofficial ILNA news agency reported that Tehran's Farabi Eye Hospital, the premiere clinic for eye injuries, called in “all current and retired doctors” to help those injured.\n\nWe “received accounts that the security forces were just firing relentlessly at protesters,” said Bahreini of Amnesty International.\n\n\"They’re not just targeting one or two people to create a climate of terror for people to disperse ... but just relentlessly firing at thousands of protesters and chasing after them, even as they were fleeing so that more people were just collapsing to the ground with severe gunshot wounds.”\n\nCasualties grow as crackdown intensifies\n\nFor two weeks, Iran offered no overall casualty figures. Then on Wednesday, the government said 3,117 people were killed, including 2,427 civilians and security forces. That left another 690 dead that Pourjamshidian identified as “terrorists.”\n\nThat conflicts with figures from the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which put the death toll on Saturday at 5,137, based on activists inside Iran verifying fatalities against public records and witness statements. It said 4,834 were demonstrators, 208 were government-affiliated personnel, 54 were children and 41 were civilians not participating in protests.\n\nDeath tolls in Iran have long been inflated or deflated for political reasons. But the fact that Iran's theocracy offered any death toll — and gave a number beyond any other political unrest to strike the country in the modern era — underlines the scale of what happened.\n\nIt also provides a justification for the ongoing mass arrest campaign and internet shutdown. State media report dozens to hundreds of people detained daily.\n\nPourjamshidian also gave an extensive list of vandalism from the protests and crackdown, including 750 banks, 414 government buildings, 600 ATMs and hundreds of vehicles that sustained damage.\n\nMeanwhile, uncertainty looms for Iran's theocracy over what Trump may or may not do.\n\nTraditionally, Iranians hold memorial services for their late loved ones 40 days after their deaths — meaning the country could see renewed demonstrations around Feb. 17. Online videos from Behesht-e Zahra, the massive cemetery on the outskirts of Tehran, show mourners chanting: “Death to Khamenei!”\n\nSatellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by the AP show large numbers of cars daily at Behesht-e Zahra’s southern reaches, where those killed in the demonstrations are being buried.\n\nElaheh Mohammadi, a journalist at Tehran's pro-reform newspaper Ham Mihan, recently noted it had been shut by authorities. She said journalists were working on stories about Behesht-e Zahra they weren't able to publish.\n\n“We send out a message to let people know we’re still alive,” Mohammadi wrote online. “The city smells of death.”\n\n“Hard days have passed and everyone is stunned; a whole country is in mourning, a whole country is holding back tears, a whole country has a lump in its throat.\"",

What the f*ck is wrong with you?” the woman yelled as ICE agents surrounded their target and dragged him to the ground. As ICE continued to wrestle with the man, a shot rang out, followed by multiple more shots as the officers moved away from the victim.\n\nThe woman holding the camera screamed and moved away from the scene before returning and yelling repeatedly, “What the f*ck did you do?!”\n\nThe video then showed the man lying on his back motionless as the ICE officers backed away, some with guns pointed at the victim.\n\nOthers were heard screaming in the background as the person with the orange backpack ran toward the woman recording.\n\n“Oh, my God, Oh, my God! What the f*ck did you just do?” the woman yelled repeatedly as the ICE agents stood over the man.\n\n“Someone call the ambulance!” the woman yelled over and over as another person yelled “Call 9-1-1!”\n\n“Somebody call 9-1-1! I can’t believe they just did that!” the woman recording screamed. “Holy sh*t, holy sh*t!” she yelled while recording an ice agent kneeling next to the victim.\n\n“Oh, my God, you f*cking people, man! You’re f*cking killing us!” she yelled. “Why would you do that?!”\n\nOne ICE officer then prodded the victim’s leg, but the victim did not move.\n\n“I can’t believe I’m seeing this!” the woman cried as more of the officers knelt around the man.\n\nThe victim was identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nLater Saturday, senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino gave a press conference during which he claimed the man had a gun and meant the agents harm.\n\n“This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” he said.\n\nThe post WATCH: Stunning New Close-Range Video Of Trump Feds Shooting Man first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Wichita saw about 3.2 inches of snow from Friday through noon Saturday, with the potential for a few more inches before the storm ends, Wichita-based National Weather Service meteorologist James Cuellar said.\n\nWichita was originally forecast to get 6-10 inches of snow. Cuellar said Wichita will likely now be \n\nAreas north of Wichita have already seen more snow than that, with the highest amount being around seven inches near Beloit.\n\nHowever, most of Kansas will end up having less snow than originally forecast, as the storm, which is affecting most of the eastern half of the U.S., has now shifted south of most of Kansas.\n\nHere is a look at how much snow has fallen across Kansas through 10 a.m. Saturday:\n\nFriday’s prediction also called for snow hitting Wichita area in two rounds, the second being Saturday night into Sunday morning. Cuellar said the forecast now shows snowfall throughout the day Saturday, that will likely taper off in the evening.\n\nBut, he said, “Wichita is going to be right on the border” of a band of snow hitting tonight that’s more likely to hit along and east of the Turnpike in south-central and southeast Kansas. The band will be a “pretty sharp line” where 20 miles will mean a large difference in snowfall, he said.\n\nIf it does hit Wichita directly, it could push the top-end total snowfall to about 7 inches, he said. It would also keep the snow falling in Wichita later into Sunday morning.\n\nEven if the original snow predictions fall short, the cold was the biggest concern for Kansas with this storm. The coldest wind chill so far in Wichita was negative 17 degrees before 11 p.m. on Friday night, with the wind chill remaining in the negative teens all Saturday morning. The temperature hasn’t climbed above the single digits since late Friday morning.\n\nNegative wind chills are still forecast in the mornings on Sunday and Monday.\n\nIn states south and east of Kansas, there are still concerns for “catastrophic ice accumulation,” according to the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center.\n\n“Long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous and impassable travel conditions are likely,” the prediction center said. “Catastrophic impacts are expected where freezing rain amounts exceed one-half inch, with locally over one inch ice accumulation possible in parts of northern Louisiana, central and northern Mississippi, southern Tennessee, and the southern Appalachians.”",

    "description": "John...",
    "fullText": "A powerful statement from Jacob Frey pleads with Trump to pull ICE forces out of Minneapolis before more people are killed.\n\nOne day after tens of thousands of Minnesotans marched in sub-zero weather to call for an end to the violent presence of federal forces on the streets of Minneapolis, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed another Minnesotan Saturday morning on the streets of the city where, on January 7, an ICE agent gunned down 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.\n\nPresident Trump, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials quickly issued unsubstantiated claims that the Minnesotan who died Saturday—a man identified as Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse who worked with the Veterans Administration and was an active member of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3669—was an armed “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law enforcement,” and that the federal agent fired in self-defense.\n\nBut the immediate responses from the administration, with their propagandistic and contradictory language (including an unwarranted DHS claim that Pretti, who was reportedly a 37-year-old licensed gun owner with no known criminal history beyond traffic citations, intended to “massacre law enforcement”), mirrored discredited and widely condemned statements made by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other officials following the Good shooting. Expressing deep skepticism about statements from DHS and ICE as a rush to judgment, and urging calm, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz promised a thorough investigation, while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a sober yet impassioned call to President Trump to end ICE’s mass surge into the city.\n\nBack on January 7, Mayor Frey made international headlines when he challenged the validity of claims by Noem and her aides and associates, which contradicted the evidence from videos recorded as Good was killed. “Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bullshit,” said Frey, who declared, “To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”\n\nFrey’s statement following Saturday’s shooting employed different language. Yet it was no less powerful, and no less compelling. And it is worth considering in its entirety.\n\nI just saw a video of more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death. How many more residents, how many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end? How many more lives need to be lost before this administration realizes that a political and partisan narrative is not as important as American values? How many times must local and national leaders plead with you, Donald Trump, to end this operation and recognize that this is not creating safety in our city?\n\nAs you’ll hear from [Minneapolis Emergency Management Department Rachel] Sayre in just a second, we have seen these kinds of operations in other places, in other countries, but not here in America—not in a way where a great American city is being invaded by its own federal government.\n\nI’m done being told that our community members are responsible for the vitriol in our streets. I’m done being told that our local elected officials are solely responsible for turning down the temperature. Just yesterday, we saw 15,000 people peacefully protesting in the streets, speaking out, standing up for their neighbors. Not a single broken window, not a single injury. Those peaceful protests embody the very principles that both Minneapolis and America was founded upon.\n\nConversely, the mass militarized force and unidentified agents who are occupying our streets, that is what weakens our country. That is what erodes trust in both law enforcement and in democracy itself. So, to everyone listening, stand with Minneapolis. Stand up for America. Recognize that your children will ask you: What side you were on? Your grandchildren will ask you what you did to act to prevent this from happening again, to make sure that the foundational elements of our democracy were rock solid. What did you do to protect your city? What did you do to protect your nation?\n\nThis is not what America is about. This is not a partisan issue. This is an American issue. This administration, and everyone involved in this operation should be reflecting. They should be reflecting right now, and asking themselves, what exactly are you accomplishing? If the goal was to achieve peace and safety, this is doing exactly the opposite. If the goal was to achieve calm and prosperity, this is doing exactly the opposite. Are you standing up for American families right now or are we tearing them apart?\n\nThe invasion of these heavily armed masked agents roaming around on our streets of Minneapolis, emboldened with a sense of impunity, it has to end. This is not how it has to be.\n\nSo, to President Trump, this is a moment to act like a leader. Put Minneapolis, put America first in this moment. Let’s achieve peace. Let’s end this operation; and I’m telling you, our city will come back, safety will be restored. We’re asking for you to take action now to remove these federal agents.\n\nWith that, the mayor called on Sayre, the director of the Emergency Management Department for the City of Minneapolis, to address the chaos that unfolded since the beginning of the Trump administration’s massive Operation Metro Surge, which is targeting the city’s immigrant communities.\n\nDescribing “the terror and the feeling of helplessness” of the people of Minneapolis, Sayre added, “My background is in international humanitarian response in conflict zones. In Yemen, Haiti, Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine. What I’ve seen here is what I’ve seen there. A powerful entity violently and intentionally terrorizing people, making them afraid to go outside so they can’t earn a living, so that kids are forced out of school. This has a lasting generational impact. People can’t plan a single day of their lives because they don’t know who is around the corner and if their family member or a neighbor is about to be taken away.”",

    "description": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts wears No. 30 as a tribute to his late mentor and friend, Maury Wills.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts wears No. 30 as a tribute to his late mentor and friend, Maury Wills.\n\nWills previously wore the number when he played for the Dodgers as their shortstop from 1959-1966 and 1969-1972. Roberts formed a close friendship with his mentor when he was a member of the Dodgers from 2002-2004.\n\nWills worked as a special instructor for the Dodgers and worked closely with a young Roberts on baserunning and bunting. While Roberts was traded in the middle of the 2004 season to the Boston Red Sox, the pair maintained a close relationship.\n\nRoberts continued to wear No. 30 after his playing career was over as he chose to sport the number when he became the Dodgers’ manager in 2016.\n\nWills passed away in September 2022 and had expressed to Roberts prior to his death that he hoped nobody else would wear No. 30.\n\nFlash forward to 2026, the Dodgers signed Kyle Tucker to a four-year, $240 million deal. The All-Star outfielder had previously worn No. 30 throughout his entire career, but chose a new jersey number after a conversation with Roberts.\n\n“It was a fun conversation that Tuck and I had,” the Dodgers skipper said at Tucker’s introductory press conerence. “It was just more of, Maury and I have just had such a great relationship. And one of the things that he was like, ‘Gosh, before I die, I hope—or when I die, I hope that no one else wears that number.’ And so, it’s really near and dear to me.”\n\nRoberts first joined the Dodgers as a fourth-year player after playing the first three seasons of his career with the Cleveland Guardians, where he wore No. 20.\n\nRoberts was traded to the Red Sox in the midst of this third season in LA. The outfielder became a key figure for Boston’s improbable World Series run in 2004, most notably for his stolen base in Game 4 of the 2004 AL Championship Series.\n\nWhile Roberts only played 45 regular season games for the Red Sox, he became a beloved figure in Boston as his stolen base represents the turning point for the organization’s World Series title.\n\nRoberts has a .266 career batting average with 23 home runs, 213 RBIs and 243 stolen bases. He accumulated a 9.1 career bWAR over 10 MLB seasons.\n\nWhile Roberts had a respectable playing career, he is regarded as one of the best managers in baseball. Roberts will end up in Cooperstown and has already cemented his legacy as the arguably the greatest Dodgers skipper in franchise history.",

    "fullText": "The Steelers will be undergoing several coaching changes this offseason following the resignation of head coach Mike Tomlin. Pittsburgh verbally agreed to hire Mike McCarthy on Saturday as its next head coach, and the Steelers will also be searching for a new offensive coordinator.\n\nSteelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith is expected to take the same role at Ohio State, as reported by ESPN’s Pete Thamel on Saturday.\n\nSmith served as the Steelers offensive coordinator from 2024 to 2025 after the Atlanta Falcons let him go as head coach. Smith began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at North Carolina. He’s only spent two years coaching at the college level, including a season as a defensive intern at Ole Miss in 2010.\n\nOhio State’s offensive coordinator Brian Hartline accepted the head coaching position at South Florida in early December. Now, the Buckeyes have finally found someone to take charge of their offense.\n\nOhio State’s head coach, Ryan Day is known for his offensive-minded approach; however, he allowed Hartline to handle the play-calling throughout last season, only stepping in for the College Football Playoffs. It’s likely that Smith will take over the play-calling duties at Ohio State moving forward.\n\nThe Steelers will now be on the lookout for their next offensive coordinator, and that search is likely to kick off soon.\n\nMore NFL: NFL Writer Identifies College QB Steelers Could Draft To Pair With Mike McCarthy\n\nThe post Ex-Steelers Coach Reportedly Hired By Ohio State appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "Christen Press, who was honored by the U.S. women's soccer team before its win over Paraguay, is determined to be advocate for women's sports in retirement.",
    "fullText": "Christen Press welcomed herself to the U.S. women’s soccer team by scoring twice in her debut in the first game of 2013. The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay.\n\nIn between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in team history.\n\nBut those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for players who followed her to the national team.\n\n“Well, it's sort of the point, right?” she said ahead of Saturday’s farewell ceremony before a crowd of 19,397. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like.\n\n“It's different, and it's going to take different things for people to have success.”\n\nTalk about following in Press’ footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S. goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City’s Ally Sentnor.\n\nAnd that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay’s Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears.\n\nPress scored her final international goal in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October.\n\nThat, Press said, will continue to provide her with a link to the game.\n\n“We're so integrated into the women's sports ecosystem, through podcasts, through merchandise and through the women's soccer community,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it.\n\n“In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.”\n\nPress got her start in soccer in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, about a dozen miles from where her career officially ended Saturday in Carson. As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl.\n\n“I didn’t touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.”\n\nShe went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. With the national team she went to three Olympics, won World Cups and played a key role in the landmark lawsuit against U.S. Soccer that ended with the women earning equal pay with the men’s team.\n\nIt’s a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players.\n\n“I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. “She made a name for herself a little later. You never know when your opportunity will be. So make the most of it when it comes.”\n\nU.S. coach Emma Hayes never had a chance to work directly with Press, though she wanted to bring her overseas to Chelsea FC when Hayes managed there and Press was looking to move to the Women’s Super League.\n\n“I’ve always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. “What she’s achieved, as well-traveled as she is, what an honor to be coaching on the day she gets celebrated in her hometown.”\n\nFor Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of life to the next. And, she acknowledged, there are a few things she’s going to miss.\n\n“I am so sad that I don't play soccer anymore,” she said. “I miss training. I miss being on a team, being around young people. I miss being outside every day. I miss the grass. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.\"\n\n“I like to talk about all the things that I miss, because I think ‘I'm retired. It's easy now.’ No. I had the best job in the world. And it's an irreplaceable job.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "Blades Brown, 18, reaches dream showdown with Scottie Scheffler in final round of The American Express",
    "description": "Teenager Blades Brown shot a strong 68 on Saturday at PGA West to get the chance to battle World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and AmEx champion Si Woo Kim on Sunday for title",
    "fullText": "Have you ever fathomed Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy or Scottie Scheffler playing rock-paper-scissors with a fan at the ropes in the heat of competition? Of course not. Tiger loathed even eye contact, and Rory and Scottie offer fist bumps occasionally, but most of the great players covet trying to stay in some kind of zone.\n\nThen again, none of them had quite the youthful verve of Blades Brown, nor did they have a chance to embrace the moment while being 18 years old and contending into Sunday of a $9.2 million PGA Tour event.\n\nIn the midst of birdieing his final three holes—the last two coming at a combined 72 feet— to finish a round of four-under-par 68 in the third round of The American Express, Brown strode down to the island 17th green at the PGA West Stadium Course. When a boy not much younger than him approached the rope line and gestured to play Rock-Paper-Scissors, Brown took the bait—and kept with it as they walked through five rounds, before Blades won with a “rock.”\n\nOf course he won. That’s the kind of surreal week the recent high school graduate from Nashville is having in California’s Coachella Valley. In only his 10th PGA Tour start after making his debut here a year ago, Brown backed up his course-record 60 on the Nicklaus Course on Friday with strong round in gusty conditions on the hardest course in the three-venue rotation, and he’ll return at the Stadium on Sunday morning to compete in the final threesome with Scheffler, the World No. 1 who is gunning for his 20th career victory, and past AmEx champion Si Woo Kim.\n\nKim leads at 22 under after shooting 66 on Saturday at La Quinta Country Club, while Brown and Scheffler (68) are a shot back after Scheffler needed to make a long par putt on the 18th to reach the anchor group.\n\nAt stake for Brown is his opportunity to become the second-youngest player with an official win on the PGA Tour, while no one ever has pulled off what he could—lifting a trophy after playing eight consecutive days across two tours. Brown flew to Palm Springs on Wednesday after the final round of the Korn Ferry Tour’s event in the Bahamas, where he tied for 17th.\n\n“I’m having fun out there,” Brown said. “I’m 18 years old playing on the PGA Tour. How awesome is that? I finished high school about two weeks ago, so it’s nice to have that burden off my back. But I’m really looking forward to tomorrow.”\n\nIf Brown, who is ranked 485th in the world, is feeling any nerves, he certainly isn’t showing it. He definitely had to practice patience on Pete Dye’s challenging Stadium layout—there wasn’t going to be an eight-under start through seven holes like on Friday on the Nicklaus Course. Brown birdied Nos. 5 and 6 but bogeyed 7 and then parred eight straight holes.\n\nA chip to close range gave him a birdie at the par-5 16th, and then Brown’s putter caught fire. After nearly hitting his tee shot too long into the water at the “Aclatraz” green at 17 and engaging with that kid at the ropes, he rolled in a 25-foot birdie. At 18, Brown piped a 268-yard tee shot into the middle of the fairway and hit his approach to 43 feet. Again, he put a calm and perfect stroke on his ball for birdie. In the round, Brown made 128 feet of putts.\n\n“Hooped two putts coming in, and that was cool,” Brown said with a smile.\n\nWhat makes Brown’s performance this week particularly surprising is that after turning pro at 17 years old in late 2024, he has not been a consistent contender in tournaments. He played 14 times on the KFT last season and had two top-10s—though one of those was a T-2 in April’s Veritex Championship, where he tied for second after opening with a 61.\n\nHe made his PGA Tour debut as a pro in The AmEx last year and missed the cut. There would be four more missed weekends over another seven starts, with a pair of T-34s as Brown’s best results.\n\nAt this point, Brown is still trying to build on all of his experiences.\n\n“I think if I can take every single competitive professional tournament round and learn something from it; you just keep stacking those day after day it's going to be a really cool story,” Brown said. “So that's one thing that I tried to do is I try to learn from every round. And yeah, last year was a little unfortunate, but I learned from it. I think that's what you have to do.”\n\nScheffler, 29. has his own strong motivations to win his first AmEx. If he can snatch his 20th victory, the Texan will be the second-youngest to reach the milestone and in the second-fastest time at 151 starts. Woods tops both categories.\n\nScheffler seemingly could have the lead going into Sunday, given how how many scoring opportnities he gave hiimsel on the Stadium. But down the final stretch alone, he missed a 13-foot birdie putt at 15, an 18-foot eagle attempt at 16 and a 22-footer for birdie at 17.\n\nScheffler was ultimately fortunate to get into Sunday's final group after he missed the green from the middle of the fairway. His difficult sidehill chip motored 25 feet past the hole, but Scheffler drained the putt for par.\n\nIn his post-round interview, Kim asked with interest if he was playing with Scheffler on Sunday, and at the time it was uncertain as Scheffler finished up. It was clear that Kim, a four-time PGA Touur winner who is ranked 42nd in the world, was eager to get that draw.\n\n\"Hopefully playing with Scottie, and we can have some fun,\" Kim said. \"Just not thinking about trying to win or trying to finish, just enjoy the round. That's my goal.\"\n\nKim, 30, became the youngest winner of the Players Championship when he won in 2017, and it would take him another four years for the next victory—a one-shot triumph over Patrick Cantlay in The AmEx. Kim's last win came in the 2023 Sony Open in Hawaii.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe world of college basketball is changing. Through loopholes, players who have gone on to play professional basketball — though not in the NBA — have found ways to return to college and tap into unused eligibility.\n\nOne such player is Alabama’s Charles Bediako. If you recognize the name, it may be because the 7-foot center spent two seasons with the Crimson Tide from 2021 to 2023. After the conclusion of the 2022–23 season, he declared for the NBA Draft.\n\nBediako wasn't selected but has played in three seasons of the G League, with three different teams. He has now cited that he made a career mistake by leaving college, especially given how the NIL landscape has shifted. Bediako pointed toward international players who never made the NBA, being able to use their unused eligibility after playing overseas, and a temporary injunction was submitted, giving him permission to suit up once again for the Crimson Tide on Saturday, January 24.\n\nHere is more on the controversial Bediako, and his return to Alabama after leaving the Crimson Tide for the G League.\n\nSN's NCAAB HQ: Scores | Schedule | Standings | Latest Polls\n\nBediako is a 7-ft. center. He is a solid player, but his college stats from his first stint at Alabama suggest that he is fine, not great. From 2021 to 2023 he averaged 6.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 19.3 minutes per game in 70 games. The Crimson Tide may use him more now if he has developed from his time in the G League, but it isn't like Alabama is getting back a former No. 1 overall pick.\n\nCharles Bediako takes the floor for warmups to a warm welcome from the student section pic.twitter.com/zhrE1DI3ZH\n\n— Katie Windham (@katiewindham_) January 24, 2026\n\nBediako played 46 games in the G League between 2023 and 2025. In that span, he averaged 21.3 minutes per game with 8.4 points and 8.0 rebounds. Bediako played better in the G League than he did at Alabama during his first stint, but it remains to be seen how his game will translate back to college.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game G League stats.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game college stats from his first stint with the Crimson Tide.\n\nNo. Bediako was not drafted. He opted to leave Alabama after the 2022-2023 season, but he went undrafted. Bediako signed with the San Antonio Spurs' G League team.\n\nMORE: Why is Bediako allowed to return to college basketball?\n\nIn the 2021 class, 247Sports had Bediako ranked as the No. 35 player in the nation. He was considered the sixth-best center as well as the seventh-best player from Florida.\n\nAmong centers, he was ranked behind Chet Holmgren, Jalen Duren, Efton Reid, Nate Bittle and Enoch Boakye. In Florida, he was ranked behind Duren, Caleb Houstan, Moussa Diabate, Reid, Bittle, Tamar Bates and Benny Williams.\n\nBediako was born in Ontario, Canada, on March 10, 2002. As college — and potentially professional — basketball became an option, he began to move around.\n\nHe started his high school career at Ridley College in Ontario before transferring to Andrews Osborne Academy in Willoughby, Ohio. Bediako later transferred again, spending the remainder of his high school career at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nBediako was born on March 10, 2002. He is 23 years old, and will turn 24 years old ahead of the 2026 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the slim win over the Washington Wizards, the Charlotte Hornets have now won four of their last six games and only find themselves ten games below .500 at 18-28.\n\nTwo of those wins came against some of the best teams in the NBA, including the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Lakers, on the road as they finally attempt to change the organization's long-term landscape.\n\nThe young talent with star potential that Charlotte possesses is what makes them stand out as a team that could become a solid team in the future, especially with players such as LaMelo Ball, Kon Knueppel, Brandon Miller, etc.\n\nMore: These stats prove why the Charlotte Hornets' success is likely to continue\n\nIn fact. Miller has been a massive reason for the Hornets' recent success, scoring at least 20 points in the last six games and averaging 23.7 points per game with a 65.3 true shooting percentage.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Miller began to take those next steps in his career and prove why the Hornets selected him with their second overall draft pick in 2023. After averaging 21 points last season, Miller is already at 20 points this season, with about two full months of the season remaining.\n\nOn Saturday, Miller nearly recorded a triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists while missing only four shots, and that speaks to the progression Miller has made not only individually but also in his impact on winning and getting his teammates involved.\n\nThe Hornets are 15-14 when Miller is on the court, but only 3-14 when he isn't, and that in itself should serve as the primary indication of just how valuable the young star is to the hive.\n\nWarriors, Bucks among teams interested in Hornets' Miles Bridges\n\nBrandon Miller admits how the Hornets can bridge the gap against the better teams\n\nESPN analyst's top ranked rookie may surprise you\n\nLaMelo Ball gets coach's plaudits for his performances beyond the offensive play\n\nHornets have engaged in trade talks surrounding Karl-Anthony Towns",

    "title": "MLB Insider Predicts Outcome for Tarik Skubal Arbitration Case With Detroit Tigers",
    "description": "ESPN’s Jeff Passan explains why Tarik Skubal could win a record $32 million in arbitration over the Tigers’ $19M offer, citing Cy Young history and elite performance.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers and Tarik Skubal are staring at a number that has never existed in an arbitration hearing before.\n\nSkubal’s side filed at $32 million for the 2026 season. The Tigers countered at $19 million. That $13 million spread is not just large, it’s unprecedented. No arbitration case in MLB history has featured anything close to that kind of gap, and no player has ever been awarded a salary anywhere near $32 million through the process.\n\nYet, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan, history may be about to bend.\n\nPassan’s argument centers on one simple truth: Skubal isn’t just elite, he’s in rare, historic territory.\n\n“Even if the comparables are in Detroit’s favor, even if a $32 million award would smash the previous high awarded in a room by more than $12 million, Skubal is the first American Leaguer to win consecutive Cy Young Awards since Pedro Martinez in 1999-2000.”\n\nThat kind of resume changes how cases are viewed. Passan continued:\n\n“And in a world where lesser pitchers get $30 million-plus a season and Skubal can compare his salary to any in MLB, his performance, the best pitcher in baseball — will be enough to carry the day.”\n\nIn other words, precedent matters, but dominance matters more. Skubal’s back-to-back Cy Youngs place him in a category that very few pitchers in modern history have ever occupied.\n\nEven with logic, numbers, and awards on his side, Passan made it clear that nothing is guaranteed in the arbitration room.\n\n“Arbitration hearing rooms are notorious for their unpredictability,” Passan wrote. “Lawyers who have argued cases have left the room convinced they’d made airtight arguments — and lost. Others were despondent in the aftermath, certain of defeat, and emerged victorious.”\n\n“Which is to say that whatever approach Tarik Skubal’s team takes in trying to convince a three-person panel that he’s worthy of the $32 million he’s seeking instead of the $19 million the Detroit Tigers are offering, the ultimate result is a crapshoot.”\n\nThat uncertainty is what makes this case so fascinating — and potentially historic.\n\nBeyond the legal drama, this standoff sends a message. Skubal is the face of the franchise, the best pitcher in baseball, and the foundation of Detroit’s contention window. Filing at $19 million while he seeks $32 million creates a tension that goes far beyond one season’s paycheck.\n\nWhether the panel sides with Skubal or the Tigers, the outcome will ripple into future extension talks, trade rumors, and how the organization is viewed by its own superstar.\n\nOne way or another, Skubal will take the mound in 2026 as a Cy Young winner. The only question is whether he’ll do it as the most highly paid arbitration player in MLB history.\n\nThe post MLB Insider Predicts Outcome for Tarik Skubal Arbitration Case With Detroit Tigers appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "The University of Utah was a sizable underdog going into its second matchup of the season against rival BYU on Saturday at the Marriott Center, but the Runnin’ Utes made the Cougars work for the win.\n\nFor 25 minutes, Utah bucked those odds and kept things close with BYU — until a decisive second-half run was enough to give the No. 13 Cougars some breathing room in an eventual 91-78 win.\n\nThat makes it five straight losses for the Utes in Provo, with their last win in the series at the Marriott Center coming in 2014.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the loss that dropped Utah to 9-11 overall and 1-5 in Big 12 play.\n\nUtes coach Alex Jensen talks a lot about avoiding 2-3 minute lulls, something that consistently plagues Utah as it goes through a transition year.\n\nOutside of their win over TCU when Jensen said the team didn’t have many peaks and valleys, the Utes are prone to stretches of high and low play.\n\nIn the case of the rivalry game, the most critical lull came in the second half after Utah had climbed to within 55-53.\n\nThe Utes went over three minutes before their next bucket and fell behind eight before Keanu Dawes hit a 3.\n\nFrom there, BYU further extended its lead out to a game-high 13, at 69-56, as part of a 14-3 run over a five and a half-minute stretch.\n\nOne of the reasons Utah was able to stick around for so long Saturday was its ability to connect from 3-point range.\n\nThe Utes made 5 of 11 from 3 in the first half, then hit their first five in the second half.\n\nFor the game, Utah hit 13 of 21 3-pointers and 8 of 10 in the second half.\n\nDawes, who led the Utes with 23 points, made four of those 3-pointers, while Terrence Brown had 22 points and four 3-pointers of his own.\n\nThe Utes “held” BYU’s freshman sensation, AJ Dybantsa, to 23 points in the first game between these two schools two weeks ago.\n\nThis time, though, Dybantsa had a career game.\n\nHe finished with a career-high 43 points, shooting 15 of 24 from the field.\n\nHis back-to-back 3-pointers, the second coming with 3:12 to play, sealed Dybantsa breaking the school freshman record for points in a game.\n\nBehind Dybantsa’s dominance, the Cougars outscored Utah 48-14 in the paint.",

    "title": "If Aaron Rodgers wants to play, Steelers' hire of Mike McCarthy reboots an option for the QB",
    "description": "Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real. But burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "fullText": "The return of World Rally Championship cars tackling Monaco’s famous Grand Prix circuit has proved a hit with drivers who wish the initiative to become a more permanent fixture in the future.\n\nMonaco’s famous circuit echoed to the sound of WRC for the first time since 2008 as a shortened version of the Formula 1 track played host to a 2.65km super special stage for this year’s Monte Carlo Rally.\n\nThe event has previously held a stage utilising the grand prix circuit in the 2007 and 2008 editions of the rally. Subaru’s Chris Atkinson and Ford’s François Duval famously clocked identical fastest times when the Monaco circuit last featured as part of a stage in 2008.\n\nThis year’s edition witnessed crowds flocking to the circuit despite inclement weather to watch the WRC’s elite complete a stage constructed using the start/finish straight and harbour area of the circuit.\n\nRacing Bulls Formula 1 driver Liam Lawson was in attendance, with the Kiwi afforded several runs of the stage driving a Ford Puma Rally1 car before the stage was live. Hyundai’s Adrien Fourmaux won the stage by 0.7s from Toyota’s Takamoto Katsuta.\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg survives with healthy lead intact\n\nThe WRC hosting super special stages in city centres bringing the rally to the fans is nothing new, but holding such a stage in such an iconic venue such as the Monaco Grand Prix circuit is an initiative that many in the severe park feels is important to grow the category.\n\nThe promotion of the WRC has been a hot topic in recent years, with the subject thrust back into the spotlight as the championship welcomes a new commercial rights holder and owner. From a manufacturer’s perspective, the exposure is crucial.\n\n“This is what we need to have in the WRC. Even though the weather is like this, it is full of people and there is a great atmosphere, and this kind of thing we need to have. Bringing it to the people,\" said Toyota team principal Jari-Matti Latvala.\n\nHyundai’s Thierry Neuville echoed Latvala’s sentiment and is hopeful the stage will return at future Monte Carlo WRC rounds.\n\n“It was cool and well done to the organisers and the organisation, and this is what rallying needs as well. The crowds are there, and the show was good despite the disastrous weather conditions. I think it is something they should do again,” Neuville told Motorsport.com.\n\n“I think we need to go to the crowds. This is something I enjoy when it is something nice like a historical circuit. It makes it even more special.”\n\nHis teammate Adrien Fourmaux added: “It was quite cool to drive on the circuit and I think it is a really good initiative to drive in Monaco because I feel for a few years now the fans in Monaco are not following the rally so much because they just have the start and the finish here. Now we can give them a show, the car the noise and the atmosphere.\n\n“I think we should do the whole track — one lap,\" he smiled.\n\nSuper special stages are usually not among drivers favourites when it comes to WRC events, but M-Sport-Ford’s Josh McErlean went as far as saying that the Monaco stage was “massive for the sport.”\n\n“It is quite bananas to think where you are at and what you are doing. The stage was obviously quite difficult for us on slick tyres and the cobbles were extremely slippy,” said McErlean.\n\n“It is a nice way to end the day and for the sport it is massive. It is what it needs and hopefully more cities and towns can do things like this.”\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg survives with healthy lead intact\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg in control, as Elfyn Evans holds off Sebastien Ogier\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg moves clear of rivals after nine stages\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is live TONIGHT (Sat., Jan. 24, 2026) with the first numbered event of the year (not a PPV anymore, remember!). UFC 324 is the first show of the Paramount+ era and the first numbered event that is not a PPV in the United States (you’ve still got to pony up extra for it in Canada, the U.K. and most other places).\n\nUFC 324’s main event is Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett for the interim Lightweight title. The interim 155-pound strap is in play since Ilia Topuria has gone on hiatus to deal with some issues in his personal life.\n\nMuch has been said about the worthiness of these two fighters for this title (like this), especially when Arman Tsarukyan is being left out in the cold. Gaethje is coming off a win over Rafael Fiziev back in March 2025. That was his first fight since his epic UFC 300 knockout loss to Max Holloway in 2024 (relive that here). Pimblett’s last fight was his drubbing of Michael Chandler. Pimblett is on a long win streak in UFC, but his last half-dozen opponents have all been on the wrong side of 35.\n\nThe co-main event was supposed to be Kayla Harrison vs. Amanda Nunes for Harrison’s Bantamweight title, a title Nunes had held for a record time. However, that fight was cancelled after it was revealed that Harrison was requiring neck surgery (details here). That fight has now been shelved, possibly indefinitely.\n\nSean O’Malley vs. Song Yadong has been promoted to the co-main slot. Those two will be hoping to get another fight with Petr Yan, this time with a title on the line.\n\nRounding out the main card is Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis, Arnold Allen vs. Jean Silva and Natalia Silva vs. Rose Namajunas.\n\nUFC 324’s “Prelims” have some interesting match-ups, including super prospect Ateba Gautier taking on Andrey Pulyaev, among others.\n\nWell, this is easy — so long as you are in the United States.\n\nYou can watch all of UFC 324 with Paramount+. The Early Prelims start at 5:30 p.m. ET. The Late Prelims start at 7 p.m. ET. and the Main Card kicks off at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nI will be providing live play-by-play, instant results, highlights and updates for all the fights right here starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.\n\nSee you then! Don’t forget to say “Hi” in the comments, too.\n\n155 lbs.: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett\n\n135 lbs.: Sean O’Malley vs. Song Yadong\n\n265 lbs.: Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis\n\n125 lbs.: Natalia Silva vs. Rose Namajunas\n\n145 lbs.: Arnold Allen vs. Jean Silva\n\n125 lbs.: Umar Nurmagomedov vs. Deiveson Figueiredo\n\n185 lbs.: Ateba Gautier vs. Andrey Pulyaev\n\n205 lbs.: Nikita Krylov def. Modestas Bukauskas by KO (punches), round 3 (4:57)\n\n125 lbs.: Alex Perez def. Charles Johnson by TKO (left hook), round 1 (3:16) — HIGHLIGHTS\n\n155 lbs.: Michael Johnson vs. Alexander Hernandez — CANCELED (details here)\n\n135 lbs.: Ricky Turcios vs. Cameron Smotherman — CANCELED (details here)\n\n265 lbs.: Josh Hokit def. Denzel Freeman by TKO (strikes, I guess), round 1 (4:59)\n\n170 lbs.: Ty Miller def. Adam Fugitt by TKO (punches), round 1 (4:59) — HIGHLIGHTS\n\nNikita Krylov vs. Modestas Bukauskas: Krylov started well, controlling the fight with wrestling and clinch work. He then stung Bukauskas with a little counter shot. From then on, Bukauskas withdrew into his shell and fought with very little confidence. The opposite was true of Krylov. With his confidence boosted, he let his hands go and was able to get the third buzzer beating finish of the night.\n\n\"This is the night of the buzzer beaters.\" – @joerogan @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/7Mb7lcGYfQ\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nAlex Perez vs. Charles Johnson: Johnson looked quick and clean early on, but maybe he was too casual. Perez caught him with a massive left hook and dropped him. Johnson was in survival mode from that moment on. Perez stayed patient and followed up with knees and another big hook to finally bring about the TKO. That’s a massive win for Perez, but also a very big stumble for Johnson.\n\nALEX PEREZ JUST KEPT COMING\n\n📺 @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/pxTZratdzH\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nJosh Hokit vs. Denzel Freeman: Hokit’s levels of athleticism and activity are very rare quantities in Heavyweight MMA. He had all that on display while whooping on Freeman, the best opponent he’s ever faced. He out wrestled him and lit him up on the feet to earn his second first round finish in a row (albeit in strange fashion with referee Mark Smith calling an end to it after he saw Freeman was exhausted and struggling to stay on his feet). Hokit also took the opportunity to taunt Freeman multiple times during the fight.\n\nJosh Hokit stops Denzel Freeman pic.twitter.com/ISC7ircCrO\n\n— MMA Mania (@mmamania) January 24, 2026\n\nAdam Fugitt vs. Ty Miller: This was a competitive striking affair for much of the round until Miller found a way through with some big shots. Fugitt almost made it to the buzzer, but came up just short. The first fight in the Paramount+ era is a first round TKO.\n\nTy Miller knocks Adam Fugitt! pic.twitter.com/CaBz5KL9cM\n\n— MMA Mania (@mmamania) January 24, 2026\n\nLive stream begins at 5:30 p.m. ET. …",

    "fullText": "I recently launched Trivet, and I've enjoyed seeing people install it on websites ranging from personal homepages to business blogs.\n\nBefore AI, Trivet would have taken me a few weeks to build. Now, Codex wrote the first version in 40 minutes.\n\nIn the past, building software was so difficult that launching something was impressive in and of itself. But as things get easier to build, it's harder to stand out. Code has become content - abundant, disposable, something you produce rather than labor over. We've transitioned from \"make something people want\" to \"make anything you want\".\n\nFor example, I'll open-source the theme powering this site. A few years ago, this would have represented a lot of work. There would have been utility for people making their own templates. Instead, today it's a footnote - a curiosity for those who want to \"view source\" on this website and see how it works.\n\nAs a maker, AI enables me to build more and faster than I ever could have dreamed. But projects are no longer the investment they used to be. I find myself with decision fatigue - I ask \"what should I build next?\" every few days, instead of every few months. In the age of AI, it's harder to think of a \"big project\" to work on slowly in my free time.\n\nWith code getting easier, I find myself thinking more about data. My old coworker Jason posted a video about using Claude Code to organize his notes. There's so much useful knowledge spread out across many sources. People know Claude for writing code, but its superpower is searching and understanding thousands of files.\n\nWhen I went to Japan last year, I wanted to ask \"what is every Tokyo coffee shop and jazz kissa mentioned on craigmod.com,\" but I couldn't. That desire led me to build Contraption MCP - so I could have a research agent over my writing. The first time I used it and got a real answer synthesized from years of posts, it felt like a new kind of utility - a digital proprioception enabling me to fluidly navigate and explore my writing.\n\nExploring information is still a hard problem in the age of AI. MCP is useful, but more of a technical protocol. \"RSS for AI,\" as Stan summarized to me.\n\nThe next project I'm contemplating is codenamed \"Bell\" — a search agent for this blog, built on top of the Contraption MCP. I want it to be more accessible than raw MCP: something you can use in a browser, drawing on a variety of sources. It could answer questions like \"which craft-focused books are mentioned on this blog,\" but also \"how does subscriber export work on Postcard.\" Part of the motivation for Bell is building software for myself. But, the other part is continuing to explore the future of digital tools through making projects.\n\nSo, what should I build next? Two things feel true: we should default to building for ourselves, and understanding our own data is where some hard problems now live.\n\nI think the widespread impulse to take a photo of everything is in fact, at root, a creative one. It reflects a desire to not just receive life passively, but to intervene in it creatively: To frame the shot, to find the most compelling angle, to draw out the emotion, to honor the light… to participate.\n\n- This life gives you nothing, Blackbird Spyplane",

    "title": "CIO: Work-from-office mandate? Expect top talent turnover, culture rot",
    "description": "Organizations requiring IT workers to commute to an office need to ground decisions in value creation, focus on data-driven results, and avoid badge-swipe metrics, employment experts say.",
    "fullText": "Work-from-office mandates are accelerating as the world moves further away from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the push toward in-person work environments will make it more difficult for IT leaders to retain and recruit staff, some experts say.\n\nOver the past year, many companies, including IT giants Amazon and Microsoft, have required employees to work from the office, with many other organizations mandating on-site work in previous years.\n\nNearly half of all workers, and nearly two-thirds of IT professionals, were feeling pressure from their employers to work from the office as of early 2025, according to the 2025 Technology at Work Report, released by IT security firm Ivanti.\n\nAdvocates of in-person work expect increased productivity and improved collaboration as employees work from the office, although several studies have suggested that workers can be just as productive when working remotely, and employment experts say collaboration gains can be difficult to measure.\n\nThere is value in cross-functional teams working together in person, says Lawrence Wolfe, CTO at marketing firm Converge. “When teams meet for architecture sessions, design sprints, or incident response, the pace of progress, as well as the level of clarity, may increase simply because being in-person caters to the way most people in the business interact,” he says.\n\nHowever, there are potential downsides for IT leaders, with strict work-from-office policies making it more difficult to attract and retain top IT talent. “In addition to resistance, there would also be the risk of talent turnover,” Wolfe adds. “The truth is, both physical and virtual collaboration provide tremendous value.”\n\nIvanti’s survey suggests that IT workers are skeptical of return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Eighty-three percent of IT workers surveyed say flexible work arrangements are either “high value” or “essential,” compared to 73% of office workers.\n\nMeanwhile, IT workers facing work-from-office mandates are two to three times more likely than their counterparts to look for new jobs, according to Metaintro, a search engine that tracks millions of jobs.\n\nIT leaders hiring new employees may also face significant headwinds, with it taking 40% to 50% longer to fill in-person roles than remote jobs, according to Metaintro.\n\n“Some of the challenges CIOs face include losing top-tier talent, limiting the pool of candidates available for hire, and damaging company culture, with a team filled with resentment,” says Lacey Kaelani, CEO and cofounder at Metaintro.\n\nDespite possible resistance, it makes sense for some IT jobs to be tied to an office, says Lena McDearmid, founder and CEO of culture and leadership advisory firm Wryver. Some IT roles, including device provisioning, network operations, and conference room IT support, are better done in person, she notes.\n\nShe sees some other benefits in specific situations. “In-person work is genuinely valuable for onboarding and mentoring early-career technologists, especially when learning how the organization actually operates, not just how the codebase works,” McDearmid says. “It’s also powerful when teams need to think together in high-bandwidth ways: whiteboards, war rooms, architecture reviews, incident response, or when solving messy, cross-functional problems.”\n\nThere is weaker evidence that blanket in-office mandates improve day-to-day productivity across all IT roles, she adds.\n\n“Many technologists, especially engineers, data scientists, and architects doing deep, complex work, often perform better in controlled environments with fewer interruptions,” McDearmid says. “In those cases, presence alone doesn’t create value. Purpose does.”\n\nEffective collaboration can happen remotely when teams have clear norms, strong documentation, and psychological safety, she adds. “I’ve also seen teams sitting next to each other collaborate poorly because decisions are unclear or leaders equate visibility with progress,” she says. “Collaboration doesn’t automatically improve just because people share a building.”\n\nThere are several downsides for IT leaders to in-person work mandates, McDearmid adds, as orders to commute to an office can feel arbitrary or rooted in control rather than in value creation. “That erodes trust quickly, particularly in IT teams that proved they could deliver remotely for years,” she adds.\n\nThe mandates can also create new friction for IT leaders by requiring them to deal with morale issues, manage exceptions, and spend time enforcing policy instead of leading strategy, she says.\n\n“There’s also a real risk of losing experienced, high-performing talent who have options and are unwilling to trade autonomy for proximity without a clear reason,” McDearmid adds. “When companies mandate daily commutes without a clear rationale, they often narrow their talent pool and increase attrition, particularly among people who know they can work effectively elsewhere.”\n\nInstead of asking how they can get people to work from the office, successful CIOs focus on what types of work are better when employees are together and how to intentionally plan for those scenarios, McDearmid says.\n\n“When return-to-office is aligned to real value creation, teams usually understand it,” she adds. “When it isn’t, it shows up quickly in engagement and retention.”\n\nIT leaders facing commute-to-office mandates should focus on data that measures work outcomes, not badge swipes, adds Rebecca Wettemann, CEO at IT analyst firm Valoir. CIOs can help IT teams by enabling them to automate repetitive works so they can focus on measurable outputs, she adds.\n\nIT leaders enforcing in-person work mandates can also focus on making the workplace a real place to collaborate, she adds. CIOs can align office space, meeting schedules, and in-office days so they reinforce the goals of collaboration and knowledge sharing, Wettemann adds.\n\nCIOs should look for ways to remove friction from the workplace through automation, should allow for flexibility, and should communicate how work-from-office policies are data-driven, she says.\n\n“The real danger is when RTO is a corporate mandate that isn’t aligned with the realities of the workplace, or even worse, when it’s being used as a Band-Aid for poor management,” Wettemann says. “When IT professionals feel they’re being evaluated based on badge swipes, not real accomplishments, they will either act accordingly or look to work elsewhere.”",

There is some new feature work with Wine-Staging... Landing the new patches for enabling the recent Adobe Photoshop versions to successfully install and run under Wine on Linux.\r\nAs covered last week, the latest Adobe Photoshop installer is working and the app running with some new patches against the Wine code for its MSXML3 and MSHTML code. Those patches were cited in Bug 47015 for upstream Wine around the Photoshop Creative Cloud 2019 screen hitting MSXML3 errors.\r\nUpstream Wine Git hasn't yet taken those patches but now they are in Wine-Staging 11.1 for further testing by the community.\r\nHopefully the testing will go well and those patches will get picked up by an upstream Wine 11.x bi-weekly development release in the near future.\r\nBesides those MSHTML/MSXML3 work to benefit Adobe software, there aren't any other new patches in Wine-Staging 11.1. Those looking for new binaries to test it out can find them via WineHQ.org.\n\n Add A Comment",

    "title": "The iOS 26 Adoption Rate Is Not Bizarrely Low Compared to Previous Years",
    "description": "A change to how Safari reports the OS it is running on led many in the media to lose their minds.",
    "fullText": "A few weeks ago there were a rash of stories claiming that iOS 26 is seeing bizarrely low adoption rates from iPhone users. The methodology behind these numbers is broken and the numbers are totally wrong. Those false numbers are so low, so jarringly different from previous years, that it boggles my mind that they didn’t raise a red flag for anyone who took a moment to consider them.\n\nThe ball started rolling with this post from Ed Hardy at Cult of Mac on January 8, “iOS 26 Still Struggles to Gain Traction With iPhone Users”, which began:\n\nOnly a tiny percentage of iPhone users have installed iOS 26,\naccording to data from a web analytics service. The adoption rate\nis far less than previous iOS versions at this same point months\nafter their releases. The data only reveals how few iPhone users\nrun Apple’s latest operating system upgrade, not why they’ve\nchosen to avoid it. But the most likely candidate is the new\nLiquid Glass look of the update. [...]\n\nRoughly four months after launching in mid-September, only about\n15% of iPhone users have some version of the new operating system\ninstalled. That’s according to data for January 2026 from\nStatCounter. Instead, most users hold onto previous versions.\n\nFor comparison, in January 2025, about 63% of iPhone users had\nsome iOS 18 version installed. So after roughly the same\namount of time, the adoption rate of Apple newest OS was about\nfour times higher.\n\nThose links point to Statcounter, a web analytics service. A lot of websites include Statcounter’s analytics tracker, and Statcounter’s tracker attempts to determine the version of the OS each visitor’s device is running. The problem is, starting with Safari 26 — the version that ships with iOS 26 — Safari changed how it reports its user agent string. From the WebKit blog, “WebKit Features in Safari 26.0”:\n\nAlso, now in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS 26 the user agent\nstring no longer lists the current version of the operating\nsystem. Safari 18.6 on iOS has a UA string of:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6 like Mac OS X)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.6\nMobile/15E148 Safari/604.1\n\nAnd Safari 26.0 on iOS has a UA string of:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6 like Mac OS X)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.0\nMobile/15E148 Safari/604.1\n\nThis matches the long-standing behavior on macOS, where the user\nagent string for Safari 26.0 is:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.0\nSafari/605.1.15\n\nIt was back in 2017 when Safari on Mac first started freezing the\nMac OS string. Now the behavior on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS does\nthe same in order to minimize compatibility issues. The WebKit and\nSafari version number portions of the string will continue to\nchange with each release.\n\nIn other words, Safari now reports, in its user agent string, that it’s running on iOS 18.6 when it is running on iOS 18.6, and reports that it’s running on iOS 18.6 when it’s running on iOS 26.0 or later. And it’s going to keep reporting that it’s running on iOS 18.6 forever, just like how Safari 26 on MacOS reports that it’s running on MacOS 10.15 Catalina, from 2019.\n\nStatcounter completely dropped the ball on this change, and it explains the entirety of this false narrative that iOS 26 adoption is incredibly low. (Statcounter has a “detect” page where you can see what browser and OS it thinks you’re using.) The reason they reported that 15 percent of iPhone users were using iOS 26 is probably because that’s the amount of web traffic Statcounter sees from iOS 26 web browsers that aren’t Safari (most of which, I’ll bet, are in-app browser views in social media apps).\n\nNick Heer, at Pixel Envy, wrote a good piece delving into this saga. And then he posted a follow-up item pointing out that (a) Statcounter’s CEO has acknowledged their error and they’re fixing it; and (b) Wikimedia publishes network-wide stats that serve as a good baseline. The audience for Wikipedia is, effectively, the audience for the web itself. And Wikipedia’s stats show that while iOS 26 adoption, in January 2026, isn’t absurdly low (as Statcounter had been suggesting, erroneously, and writers like Ed Hardy at Cult of Mac and David Price at Macworld foolishly regurgitated, no matter how little sense it made that the numbers would be that low), they are in fact lower than those for iOS 18 a year ago and iOS 17 two years ago. Per Wikimedia:\n\nSo, no, iOS 26 adoption isn’t at just 15 percent, which only a dope would believe, but it’s not as high as previous iOS versions in previous years at this point on the calendar. Something, obviously, is going on.\n\nDavid Smith, developer of popular apps like Widgetsmith and Pedometer++, on Mastodon:\n\nI noticed iOS 26 adoption had entered a ‘third wave’ of rapid\nadoption. So I made a graph of the relative adoption versus iOS 18\nat this point in the release cycle.\n\nWhile lower than iOS 18 at this point for my apps (65% vs. 78%),\nthe shape of this graph says to me that Apple is in full control\nof the adoption rate and can tune it to their plans. The\ncoordinated surges are Apple dialing up automatic updates.\n\nIf this surge were as long as previous ones, we’d hit the\nsaturation point very soon.\n\nWhat’s going on, quite obviously, is that Apple itself is slow-rolling the automatic updates to iOS 26. For years now Apple has steered users, via default suggestions during device setup, to adopt settings to allow OS updates to happen automatically, including updates to major new versions. Apple tends not to push these automatic updates to major new versions of iOS until two months after the .0 release in September. This year that second wave was delayed by about two weeks, and there’s now a third wave starting midway through January. It’s a different pattern from previous years — but it’s a pattern Apple controls. A large majority of users of all Apple devices get major OS updates when, and only when, their devices automatically update. Apple has been slower to push those updates to iOS 26 than they have been for previous iOS updates in recent years. With good reason! iOS 26 is a more significant — and buggier — update than iOS 18 and 17 were.\n\nPeople like you, readers of Daring Fireball, may well be hesitant to update to iOS 26, or (like me) to MacOS 26, or to any of the version 26 OS updates, because you are aware of things (like UI changes) that you are loathe to adopt.\n\nBut the overwhelming majority of Apple users — especially iPhone users — just let their devices update automatically. They might like iOS 26’s changes, they might dislike them, or they might not care or even notice. But they just let their software updates happen automatically — and they will form the entirety of their opinions regarding iOS 26 after it’s running on their iPhones.",

    "description": "Daniel Stenberg says the inflow of AI slop has become unsustainable for the curl security team to handle.",
    "fullText": "Last year in May, the cURL project's bug bounty program was inundated with AI slop, where many bogus reports were opened on HackerOne, leaving the cURL maintainers to go through garbage.\n\nThe problem didn't stop even after Daniel Stenberg, the creator of cURL, threatened to ban anyone whose bug report was found to be AI slop. We are now in 2026, and the situation has reached a tipping point.\n\nDaniel has submitted a pull request on GitHub that removes all mentions of the bug bounty program from cURL's documentation and website. Coinciding with that, the project's security.txt file has been updated with some blunt language that makes the new policy crystal clear.\n\nThe cURL team intends to make a proper announcement in the coming days, though many outlets have already covered the news of this happening, so I would say they ought to get on it ASAP! 😆\n\nThe program officially ends in a few days on January 31, 2026. After that, security researchers can still report issues through GitHub or the project's mailing list, but there won't be any cash involved.\n\nWhat pushed them over the edge?, you ask. Well, just weeks into 2026, seven HackerOne reports came in within a 16-hour period in just one week. Some were actual bugs, but none of them were security vulnerabilities. By the time Daniel posted his recent weekly report, they'd already dealt with 20 submissions in 2026.\n\nThe main goal here is said to be stopping the flood of garbage reports. By eliminating the money incentive, they are hoping people (or bots?) will stop wasting the security team's time with half-baked, unresearched submissions.\n\nHe also gives a stern warning to wannabe AI sloppers, saying that:\n\nSo, yeah, that's that. If people still don't understand that AI slop is harmful to such sensitive pieces of software, then sure, they can go ahead and make a fool of themselves.\n\nSuggested Read 📖: Open Source Project LLVM Says Yes to AI-Generated Code",

    "title": "Cow Clicker",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Cow Clicker is an incremental social network game on Facebook developed by video game researcher Ian Bogost. The game serves as a deconstructive satire of social games. The goal of the game is to earn \"clicks\" by clicking on a sprite of a cow every six hours. The addition of friends' cows to the player's pasture allows the user to also receive \"clicks\" whenever the player's cow is clicked. A premium currency known as \"Mooney\" allows the user to purchase different cow designs and skip the six-hour interval between clicks.\n\nIn the wake of a controversial speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.\n\nSome critics praised Cow Clicker for its dissection of the common mechanics of social network games and viewed it as a commentary on how social games affect people.\n\nThe player is initially given a pasture with nine slots and a single plain cow, which the player may click once every six hours. Each time the cow is clicked, a point also known as a \"click\" is awarded; if the player adds friends' cows to their pasture, they also receive clicks added to their scores when the player clicks their own cow. As in other Facebook games, players are encouraged to post announcements to their news feed whenever they click their cow. A virtual currency known as \"Mooney\" can be bought with Facebook Credits; it can be used to purchase special \"premium\" cow designs, and the ability to skip the six-hour time limit that must be waited before the cow can be clicked again.[1][2]\n\nAt the 2010 Game Developers Conference, Zynga's game FarmVille was awarded the \"Best New Social/Online Game\" at its Game Developers Choice Awards. Ian Bogost (who was also in attendance) was critical of Zynga's success, as he felt that its business model was focused on convincing users to pay money to progress further in their \"freemium\" games rather than treating gaming as an artistic experience. He also believed Zynga's vice president Bill Mooney was trying to attack \"artistic\" gaming during his acceptance speech for the award when he personally invited independent game developers to join his company.[3] After the conference, Bogost coined the term \"cow clickers\" to describe games such as FarmVille which only involve performing tasks at certain intervals, since in these games, \"you click on a cow, and that’s all you do.\" Bogost compared the players of Zynga's games to the rats in B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning experiment, often receiving variable reinforcement rather than regular rewards. As one of the most vocal critics of Zynga's practices and business model, Bogost made further appearances at various events and panels to discuss his views on social gaming.[3]\n\nIn July 2010, Bogost was scheduled to make an appearance at a New York University seminar, \"Social Games On Trial\", to discuss the controversial aspects of social network gaming. To clearly demonstrate what he felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of these games, Bogost quickly developed a Facebook game entitled Cow Clicker. The game was designed to be a satire of what Bogost personally believed were the only points of FarmVille: to encourage users to continue playing by inviting other users into the game, and to provide incentives for those who purchase virtual goods.[3] The bulk of the code was written in three days.[4]\n\nUnexpectedly to Bogost, Cow Clicker became a viral phenomenon, amassing over 50,000 players by September 2010. In response to its sudden popularity, he committed to improving the game with new features. Updates to the game added awards for reaching certain milestones (such as the Golden Cowbell for 100,000 clicks), the ability to earn Mooney by clicking on other users' Cow Clicker news feed posts, and the chance to randomly gain or lose Mooney on every click. New cow designs were also introduced, such as an oil-coated cow to commemorate the BP oil spill, and the \"Stargrazer Cow\", which was only a mirror image of the original cow that cost around $20's worth of Mooney.[3][5]\n\nAlthough continually disturbed by its popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming and social networking trends; such as the addition of an API to allow websites to have their own clickable cows (in a process he dubbed \"Cowclickification\"), the spin-off game Cow Clicker Blitz (co-developed with PopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka), \"My First Cow Clicker\" for iOS (a parody of simplistic education apps; designed to \"train\" children on cow clicking and add the resulting clicks to their parent's total), and a \"Cow Clicktivism\" campaign where users could click on an emaciated cow to donate to Oxfam America—with a goal of donating an actual cow to a third world country. The cow, known as the \"Cowclicktivist Cow\", could also be unlocked for the player's pasture with a $110 donation.[1][3][5]\n\nIn 2011, an alternate reality game known as the \"Cow ClickARG\" was held, where a series of clues from the \"bovine gods\" eventually revealed that a \"Cowpocalypse\" would occur on July 21, 2011 (exactly one year since the original release of the game). From then on, every click made by players would deduct thirty seconds from a countdown clock leading to the Cowpocalypse. However, players could extend the countdown clock by paying to supplicate with Facebook Credits: paying 10 credits would extend the countdown by a single hour, while 4,000 would extend the countdown by an entire month.[6] After $700 worth of extensions, the countdown clock expired on the evening of September 7, 2011. At this point, the game remained playable, but all the cows were replaced by blank spaces and said to have been raptured. Bogost intended the Cowpocalypse event to signal the \"end\" of the game to players; when addressing a complaint by a fan who felt the game was no longer fun after the cow rapture, Bogost responded that \"it wasn't very fun before.\"[3][5][7]\n\nIn 2018, Bogost wrote an article for The Atlantic discussing the collection of data by Facebook apps, with reference to Cow Clicker, following a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data. Bogost notes that Facebook apps appear to be part of the website itself, whereas they actually operate with almost no oversight. He claims that \"without even trying\", Cow Clicker stored its users' Facebook ID and any networks (such as workplaces) that the user was a part of, and that this information is still stored on his private server. Bogost notes that he could have used this data for malicious purposes, criticising Facebook's \"move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development\".[4]\n\nCow Clicker received critical attention soon after its release. One early commentator was Alexia Tsotsis of TechCrunch, who acknowledged the game's intent as a commentary on the impact of social network games. In an interview, Bogost foresaw the transformation of the internet into a \"compulsive virtual dystopia\" through Zynga's use of social gaming.[2][3]\n\nNick Yee of the Palo Alto Research Center compared the players of games which do not provide \"meaningful opportunities for achievement, social interaction, and challenge\" to rats in a Skinner box. Accordingly, he compared Cow Clicker to being inside an \"incredibly clear Skinner box\"—acknowledging how little effort the game took in order to keep users playing the game. Jason Tanz of Wired considered Cow Clicker as an example of the growth in the trend of gamification—where developers introduce elements influenced by games into their services without providing the normal \"experience\" a game traditionally incorporates.[3]\n\nPopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka praised Cow Clicker for being the type of \"ironic, satirical, self-referential\" game that Facebook's game ecosystem was lacking, as he felt there were too many commercially driven games on the social network. Playdom's Scott Jon Siegel criticized the game for not going far enough in its satire, and putting too many highlights on the \"absurd monetisation practices and meaningless clicking which social games are all too well known for.\"[1]\n\nThe game Cookie Clicker was developed by Julien Thiennot in 2013. Bogost describes as it as Cow Clicker's \"logical conclusion\".[8]",

    "fullText": "Snowfalls can now beget windfalls.\n\nAs Americans rush to buy essentials ahead of Winter Storm Fern, some are also buying shares on prediction markets, like Kalshi and Polymarket, betting on how much snow will fall in New York City.\n\nTraders on Kalshi have bet almost $900,000 as of Saturday afternoon on whether more than 12 inches of snow will fall in New York City on Saturday and Sunday. Meanwhile, on Polymarket, traders have bet about $210,000 on how much snow New York City will see this weekend. The winning category is now 8 to 10 inches.\n\nThe storm is expected to bring heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain to multiple states in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Northeast this weekend. The National Weather Service says the storm could impact some 180 million Americans. Thousands of flights have already been canceled.\n\nPrediction markets allow users to buy and sell shares in the outcomes of future events, such as sports or elections. Polymarket also provides real-time updates, allowing bets to provide insights into how consumers and investors think.\n\nPolymarket bettors correctly predicted nearly the entire slate of Golden Globe winners last week, prompting a celebration from Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan.\n\n\"We have a long way to go to educate the public on the value of market-based forecasts, but you can't deny its accuracy,\" Coplan wrote. \"People have more clarity about the world because Polymarket exists.\"\n\nThe new markets are not strictly regulated, and some bets have looked a lot like insider trading. A last-minute bet on Polymarket earlier this month that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro would be ousted netted strong returns after the US captured Maduro in a surprise raid hours later.\n\nSnowfall totals, on the other hand, are perhaps less susceptible to market manipulation.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Cunningham-South Cons: Smith\n\nTries: Hamer-Webb, Van Poortvliet, Steward, Blamire, Perese Cons: Searle 3 Pens: Searle\n\nJack van Poortvliet delivered a timely reminder to England coach Steve Borthwick as he finalises Six Nations plans with a stunning solo try as Leicester Tigers cruised past struggling Harlequins.\n\nThe Tigers scrum-half produced a moment of quality at The Stoop in a match that the visitors dominated from start to finish, his solo effort in the first half the pick of the visitors' five tries.\n\nGabriel Hamer-Webb, Freddie Steward, Jamie Blamire and Izaia Perese scored the others as the visitors ran roughshod over a Quins outfit with a bonus point win to move into fourth place in the Prem table.\n\nChandler Cunningham-South ensured that the home side did not suffer a second shutout of the season with a late try to save blushes, but it was nowhere near enough to avoid a fifth straight defeat in the Prem for Jason Gilmore's struggling outfit.\n\nUncapped Sela called up for England Six Nations tilt\n\nBears edge past Chiefs in rainstorm to go third\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nVan Poortvliet was one of the brighter lights in a dominant display and he will be hoping a slight niggle which saw him limp from the field halfway through the second half does not continue his bad luck with England.\n\nThe 24-year-old scored the try which won the series against Argentina last summer only for his chances of a place in Borthwick's autumn squad to be spoiled by a shoulder injury.\n\nHe also missed out on the 2023 World Cup after hurting his ankle in a warm-up game against Wales the month before the tournament.\n\nBorthwick may well be keeping his fingers crossed, too, after a confident display included an early assist with a long pass to Hamer-Webb, who went over unchallenged for a debut Tigers try.\n\nYet it was Van Portvliet's kick and collect after a neatly worked short line-out routine that proved a cut above.\n\nAfter gathering the ball and racing down the right flank he stepped off his right boot to jink inside what was left of the Quins defence before going over.\n\nTop-to-bottom Quins issues 'not a quick fix' - Care\n\nQuins look to be lacking in confidence as much as anything and had their own chance to level at 7-7 after Cadan Murley broke the Tigers defensive line only for Bryn Bradley to fumble the final pass with the line beckoning.\n\nIt appeared to sum up where they are at the moment, certainly on the domestic front where none of their decent European form (they thrashed La Rochelle in the Champions Cup to finish second in their pool) seems to be rubbing off.\n\nFrom Bradley's mistake things only got worse for the home side with Van Poortvliet's effort, a Billy Searle penalty and a penalised high tackle from winger Nick David ensuring Quins went in 17-0 and a man down at the break.\n\nWhile the home side held out while David was in the bin, Steward broke through the dual attentions of Sam Riley and Elliot Williams just after the hour to make it 22-0, Searle's boot adding the extras.\n\nBlamire and Perese came off the bench to add to Quins pain with a short range power and long range speed finishes before Cunningham-South's outstretched arm through a sea of limbs at least got them on the scoreboard at the death.\n\nMore worrying for Quins management was the fact that a significant number of home fans were not there to see it, having already departed after seeing enough of a side who remain second from bottom on just 10 points after 10 games.\n\nHarlequins head coach Jason Gilmore said:\n\n\"Our fans have been brilliant. We had a sold-out Stoop today but I can understand their feelings. They are loyal to the team and club. We need to give them something to enjoy on the field.\n\n\"It's not skillset, it's mindset. We went on the back foot pretty quickly and couldn't turn things around. We must see to what steps we need to put in place to regain that mindset.\n\n\"We need to build a squad which can hold out under fire.\"\n\nLeicester head coach Geoff Parling told BBC Radio Leicester:\n\n\"Twelve of our lads had e.coli when they got back from South Africa last weekend and four of our staff so I didn't let any of those into the training building on Tuesday as we didn't want to infect anybody.\n\n\"But the group has proved to be very adaptable and this was a fine win.\n\n\"I was a bit frustrated at the end that we let them in for that try but that was a great performance overall. The pack worked hard for each other, it was very windy and conditions were quite hard but I am very pleased with what we did.\n\n\"Jack van Poortvliet was excellent today. He's had some injuries which have not helped him at certain times. His speed of delivery is good and he's a top-notch number nine. He showed what he can do with that try, too.\n\n\"He came off [with an injury] but hopefully it is just a dead leg. He is going to get it scanned and hopefully it is not too serious.\n\n\"The league doesn't lie. We are obviously not at the very top and there are things we can improve on to really push on. But we work hard for each other, look organised and are growing our game gradually.\"\n\nHarlequins: Green, David, Northmore, Bradley, Murley, Smith, Friday; Kerrod, Walker, Delgado, Treadwell, Petti, Cunningham-South, Kenningham, Dombrandt\n\nReplacements: Riley, Hobson, E Williams, T Williams, Driscoll, Lawday, Green, Evans\n\nLeicester: Steward, Hamer-Webb, Wand, Bailey, Hassell-Collins, Searle, van Poortvliet; Smith, Clare, Heyes, Henderson, Chessum, Liebenberg, Reffell, Ilione\n\nReplacements: Blamire, van der Flier, Hurd, Moro, Cracknell, Allan, O'Connor, Perese",

    "fullText": "Try: McNally Pens: Sheedy 2, I Lloyd 2\n\nCardiff brushed aside talk of an impending takeover by the Ospreys owners as they defeated Benetton to rise to fourth in United Rugby Championship (URC) table.\n\nLock Josh McNally scored a try, while fly-half Callum Sheedy and replacement Ioan Lloyd kicked four penalties between them at the Arms Park.\n\nBenetton responded with a try from lock Federico Ruzza, with Rhyno Smith adding a penalty.\n\nIt was a scrappy affair, but the hosts will not care as they secured a vital victory in the quest to finish in the top eight and qualify for the play-offs.\n\nThis win was needed with Cardiff facing a difficult remaining fixture list, which includes a two-game trip to South Africa and only three more home games.\n\nCardiff host Leinster on 27 February before a two-month gap between home games when Ospreys arrive for the potential \"Y11 derby\" on 24 April with both sides preparing for the prospect of the two Welsh sides being owned by the same company.\n\nWhile much of the focus has been on the Ospreys this week after the Welsh Rugby Union announced their owners - Y11 Media and Sport - were the preferred option to buy Cardiff, the ramifications have also been felt at the Arms Park.\n\nMany Cardiff supporters are not happy at the decision and followed the lead of their Ospreys' counterparts by lighting up their phones to demonstrate their protest against the WRU and Y11.\n\nSix Cardiff players who had been named in Wales' Six Nations squad started, while the seventh, wing Mason Grady, was a first-half replacement for Iwan Stephens.\n\nMcNally, who had expressed his support for Ospreys players earlier in the week in his role as a Welsh Rugby Players Association (WRPA) representative, spurned an early chance when he lost the ball over the Benetton line.\n\nSheedy opened the scoring with two penalties before flanker Alex Mann was shown a yellow card for a professional foul close to the Cardiff line.\n\nAs conditions deteriorated, the hosts did not concede any points in the 10 minutes they had 14 men as Cardiff led 6-0 at half-time.\n\nMann conceded another penalty early in the second half that resulted in a word from referee Sam Grove-White before Smith kicked Benetton's first points.\n\nCardiff came storming back as the home side scored the game's first try after 49 minutes when McNally was driven over.\n\nLloyd, a half-time replacement for full-back Jacob Beetham, slotted over a penalty to extend the lead to 11 points.\n\nBenetton breached the Cardiff line when Ruzza powered over, but Smith missed an easy conversion.\n\nThe Italian side were inspired and appeared to be on the way to take the lead when Igancio Mendy sprinted over under the posts.\n\nThe try was disallowed because of a forward pass and Lloyd ensured Benetton left Cardiff without a losing bonus-point by kicking a late penalty.\n\nCardiff: Beetham; Adams, Millard, B Thomas, Stephens; Sheedy, Davies; Barratt, Belcher (capt), Assiratti, McNally, Nott, Mann, Botham, Lawrence.\n\nReplacements: E Lloyd, Domachowski, Sebastian, Thornton, D Thomas, Mulder, I Lloyd, Grady.\n\nBenetton: Smith; Mendy, Menoncello, Marin, Odogwu; Farias, Uren (capt); Aminu, Maile, Pasquali, Marini, Ruzza, Favretto, Zuliani, Cannone.\n\nReplacements: Bernasconi, Spagnolo, Gallorini, Scrafton, Fa'aso'o, Kingi, Garbisi,\n\nReferee: Sam Grove-White (Scotland)\n\nAssistants: Ben Connor (Wales), Craig Evans (Wales",

    "fullText": "Bristol Bears leapfrogged Exeter Chiefs to move up to third in the Prem table with a hard-fought 8-3 win in appalling conditions at Sandy Park.\n\nWith the rain teeming down, the first half was largely punctuated by handling errors and referee Karl Dickson's whistle, with neither side able to get points on the board until Henry Slade's penalty just before the half-hour mark.\n\nThe game's only try then came through Noah Heward's sliding effort, after Olly Woodburn was unable to gather the ball as half-time approached.\n\nIn what had looked increasingly like a scoreless second half, James Williams' late penalty condemned Rob Baxter's men to their first home defeat of the season.\n\nIn a match that was meant to herald the long-awaited returns of Bears stalwarts Steven Luatua and Gabriel Ibitoye, all the focus was on the conditions, with neither team able to produce the running rugby so desired by both fan bases.\n\nBarely able to see through the rain, both sides adopted a hard yards and box kicking approach in the first half, one that failed to deliver any real attacking momentum for either until the dying moments of the first half.\n\nIt was Slade who stepped up, converting a penalty, minutes after Tom Jordan had squandered a similar opportunity for Bristol at the other end.\n\nIn a game desperately crying out for points, Slade was then forced to dot the ball down under his own posts after Woodburn's mishandling led to the ball squirming out on the liquid surface.\n\nFrom the ensuing scrum, Bristol eventually capitalised.\n\nSlade was lucky not to be penalised when he knocked on as he attempted to intercept a pass meant for Matias Moroni deep in the Chiefs' 22.\n\nBut Louis Rees-Zammit was able to pick up the ball and find space on the outside to feed Heward, who slid in for what turned out to be the only try of the game.\n\nWith the rain easing as the second half began, Exeter drove up into the Bears' 22, but were unable to break through the impervious Bristol defence, eventually being penalised after Gabriel Oghre had stolen the ball back.\n\nSlade then had the chance to put Exeter ahead for the first time, but his penalty from the halfway line drifted agonisingly wide.\n\nThe Chiefs had the majority of the ball but were unable to capitalise and it was the Bears who looked most like scoring when Rees-Zammit counter-attacked, only for his grubber kick forward to drift long, allowing Woodburn to recover.\n\nThe home side then paid for their profligacy.\n\nSlade's up and under was charged down in midfield, forcing the England centre to dive on the loose ball before being penalised for holding on.\n\nWilliams then made no mistake, slotting the ensuing penalty through the posts as Bristol left Sandy Park sodden, but victorious.\n\nThe result leaves Exeter in fifth on 35 points, following Leicester's 34-7 win over Harlequins.\n\nVan Poortvliet shines as Leicester dominate Quins\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nBristol Bears' director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Radio Bristol:\n\n\"The beauty of the weather is that it was black and white, we had to roll our sleeves up and commit to everything.\n\n\"The physicality, the getting up off the ground, making another tackle, the defensive sets we had were brilliant, not just to defend but also not to give away penalties.\n\n\"We're really showing that we can win in lots of ways - there is more to this team than just throwing the ball around.\n\n\"To win eight games out of the last nine is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.\"\n\nExeter Chiefs' director of rugby Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:\n\n\"We made quite a lot of errors, there's a lot of things for us to look at that we could've done better, but the Bears made a lot of errors as well.\n\n\"In a very tight game, they probably shaded the areas that win and lose games.

    "description": "Final Score EFL pundit Sam Parkin reflects on the highs and lows after Saturday's action.",
    "fullText": "After another dramatic Saturday turned up plenty of action, former Swindon, Ipswich and Luton striker and BBC Final Score pundit Sam Parkin gives his takeaways from what we learned across the Championship and rest of the EFL.\n\nThere were two 4-0 wins in the early games in the Championship on Saturday as Middlesbrough showed their promotion credentials by thumping Preston North End while Millwall swept aside Charlton Athletic at The Den to keep pace at the top.\n\nParkin: \"I thought the Middlesbrough game would be tighter against a Preston team who's had a really good season, but I think the recent form played out really.\n\n\"That's a fourth win in a row for Middlesbrough, and Preston have lost their past four and they're struggling to find the net.\n\n\"I thought if there was a flaw in their set-up in comparison to the other top teams - namely Coventry City and Ipswich Town - it might be the amount of goals that they're likely to score.\n\n\"But it's really timely that Tommy Conway has started scoring and Morgan Whittaker's made an incredible difference as well.\n\n\"They're in a brilliant place at the moment. They're playing some great football and they've come through a tough week with some tough games by winning at Stoke and beating Preston so convincingly, which is not to be sniffed at.\n\n\"For Millwall, I think it's the most depth they've had in recent years with loads of exciting attacking players.\n\n\"They've been able to get Macaulay Langstaff and Josh Coburn in the line-up together, and Aziz has had an incredible season as well and played a part in their first goal.\n\n\"They've got a great opportunity this year, probably the best opportunity they've had in recent times to get in the play-offs and potentially the Premier League.\"\n\nOff the back of Middlesbrough's early win against Preston, Ipswich were stunned by Sheffield United, who were reduced to 10 men late on, as they lost ground on the Championship automatic promotion places.\n\nParkin: \"I think it was always going to be a tough game for Ipswich today at Sheffield United. They've got a few players missing through injury and they've got a massive month ahead.\n\n\"That's the only thing I can see derailing Ipswich - they've got to play seven games in February with the FA Cup and a rearranged game.\n\n\"So the squad will be tested. I think they've probably got the numbers to do it, but when, comparatively, some teams would play five or six games [in February] it does have a little bit of an effect.\n\n\"They're going to have to deal with a fixture pile-up but the way they're going, especially at Portman Road, I don't think today's result will affect them too much.\n\n\"I still have Ipswich probably just slightly out in front of Middlesbrough, which sounds strange speaking after such a convincing Boro win and a disappointing afternoon for Ipswich, but I just think that depth will prevail in the long run.\n\n\"Sheffield United have picked up under Chris Wilder and they'll probably be looking at the table tonight and thinking that potentially they could go on a run and make it in the play-offs themselves with so many games to play for.\"\n\nWrexham moved sixth in the Championship table courtesy of their comeback win at QPR. Phil Parkinson led the Hollywood-owned club to three promotions in a row, and a morale-boosting win in the capital will have their fans dreaming of a remarkable four from four as they barged into the play-off picture.\n\nParkin: \"Wrexham are in great form at the moment. With 10 minutes to go it looked like they were going to leave with nothing from QPR, so to turn it around and sneak into the top six tonight, that'll be a great journey home for the supporters and the players.\n\n\"I think the reality of the situation is, with that cluster of teams that are hoping to get into the play-offs, they've got the financial backing to add a few more players at the end of the window.\n\n\"They've got a quality squad as it is but if they could add a couple of savvy signings then we could be talking about another promotion or at least another play-off campaign, which would be absolutely incredible.\n\n\"I think everyone probably had maybe Birmingham slightly in front of where Wrexham were at the start of the season in terms of their potential in the Championship, so it's flip-flopped a little bit in their favour.\n\n\"But as we see in so many seasons, that final play-off position, even though it seems a long way away, seems open for someone, and why not Wrexham? They've certainly got the squad to do it.\"\n\nWigan certainly needed a boost having strayed close to the League One drop zone after a chastening home loss to Bolton Wanderers last week. Latics boss Ryan Lowe said Saturday's trip to fellow strugglers Doncaster Rovers was not a six-pointer, but his side were forced to come from behind to rescue a 3-3 draw across the Pennines.\n\nParkin: \"Doncaster's home form in particular has been really indifferent, so it was a little bit of a surprise to see them in that lead.\n\n\"I wouldn't have envisaged Wigan getting back into it because they don't strike me as the most free-scoring. I know that they lost narrowly to Bolton in a local derby but it's a position in the league I didn't see them being in.\n\n\"Hopefully, they can use that as a catalyst to rise up the table. They're the afternoons that stick with you as a player. When you come back from 3-0 behind - I think I did it once in my career - the memories in the dressing room are really amazing days.\n\n\"So being in a terrible position, that dressing room would be really elated at full-time.\"\n\nIn League Two, Bromley and Swindon Town - the top two at the start of the day - played out a thriller with the Ravens edging out Ian Holloway's side, while Cambridge United stunned Tranmere Rovers to move up to fourth. Just four points separate second and seventh as the promotion race hots up in the fourth tier.\n\nParkin: \"The top of League Two is one of the most exciting areas of the EFL at the moment. I just think there's so many good teams and so many different teams.\n\n\"You have the underdog story of Bromley, of course, who are out in front and earned a massive victory over Swindon, and I don't think you can underplay that.\n\n\"Nicke Kabamba got the winner and that's nine goals he's scored, with seven as a substitute, which just shows what a brilliant signing he's been.\n\n\"Cambridge, likewise, are on an incredible run with their budget. I'm sure they're operating with one of the lowest in comparison to teams around them like Salford and MK Dons.\n\n\"Karl Robinson has really got Salford going, and then you see Walsall as well who, yes, dropped points this afternoon, but they were play-off finalists last year and have re-built a really competitive squad this year.\n\n\"I just think you literally cannot predict who's going to be in the top three. It's so open, so exciting, and it's set up brilliantly for the last few months of the season.\"\n\nSam Parkin was talking to BBC Sport England's Jay Freeman.",

    "fullText": "Our rising global temperatures aren't just a distant threat to the natural world anymore; they have a very real, palpable impact on personal finances and the greater economy.\n\nA statistical analysis of climate risks in Mongolia over recent years pointed to a correlation between monetary instability — at the individual, local, and national levels — and regional weather patterns and abnormalities.\n\nConducted by the United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the research indicated that Mongolia's financial foundation is facing pressure from two sides. The region's floods, droughts, and extreme winters — or dzuds — often damage homes and infrastructure and leave the agricultural industry floundering, but unfortunately, supporting the burgeoning clean energy industry and taking other climate-forward steps is costly.\n\nPer the ESCAP report, Mongolia suffers an average loss equivalent to more than $425 million each year, owing in particular to drought-driven losses of close to $350 million.\n\nAt a broad level, the high atmospheric temperatures brought on by urban carbon pollution and other environmentally unfriendly practices have begun disrupting our global weather patterns, increasing aridity in many regions and supercharging natural disasters like floods and hurricanes.\n\nFor a country like Mongolia, which relies heavily on its agricultural sector, atypical climate and severe storms and floods can cripple economic development by devastating crop yields.\n\nLikewise, the surge in extreme weather drives up the costs of home ownership, particularly as a result of rising insurance costs.\n\n\"Infrastructure damage from floods can impair businesses and real estate values, undermining mortgage portfolios,\" ESCAP explained. \"These climate stressors can lead to higher loan default rates, market volatility, liquidity strains, and even legal liabilities for financial institutions.\"\n\nMongolia isn't the only part of the world to encounter the financial consequences of extreme weather for homeowners. Experts observed a similar trend in California following the Los Angeles wildfires in early 2025, which hiked up premiums for homeowners in medium- and high- risk areas.\n\nAlthough combating climate pollution may appear to be the obvious solution, Mongolia's experience revealed to ESCAP that transition costs can prove just as precarious. The country's decarbonization goals and attempts to fortify its renewable energy sector come at the expense of the livestock industry — trimmed down to reduce methane-releasing cattle populations — and the mining industry, a cornerstone of Mongolia's foreign trade.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Quirke, Carpenter, O'Flaherty 2 Cons: Ford 3 Pen: Ford\n\nTries: Freeman, Hutchinson, R Smith, Todaro, Kemeny, Coles, Pollock Cons: Belleau 3, Furbank\n\nNorthampton Saints returned to the top of The Prem after coming out on top of a 11-try thriller over Sale Sharks.\n\nHaving lost the lead to Bath following their win over Gloucester on Friday, Saints showed what they are all about with a display full of bold, attacking rugby.\n\nTommy Freeman and Rory Hutchinson scored in the first half, before Robbie Smith, Edoardo Todaro, Josh Kemeny, Alex Coles and Henry Pollock grabbed second-half tries.\n\nThe Sharks scored four tries of their own through Raffi Quirke, Joe Carpenter and two from Tom O'Flaherty and they led 29-26 with less than an quarter of the game to go.\n\nBut Northampton's late burst of three tries proved decisive as they claimed an eighth win from 10 Prem games to move two points clear of Bath, and a first win at this venue since 2017.\n\nDefeat leaves Sale in seventh and with their hopes of a fourth consecutive top-four spot all but over, as they lie 16 points adrift of fourth spot.\n\nBristol edge past Exeter in rainstorm to go third\n\nVan Poortvliet shines as Leicester dominate Quins\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nIn a heavyweight clash involving 11 of England's Six Nations squad, either starting or on the bench, it was Saints who made a blistering start.\n\nFreeman, a likely starter for the opener with Wales at Allianz Stadium on 7 February, touched down inside the first seven minutes after a sharp reverse pass from Alex Mitchell set him up.\n\nNorthampton's slick handling was again in evidence as they spread the ball across the line with Kemeny supplying the pass for centre Hutchinson to score in the left corner.\n\nThere should have been a third score after a brilliant offload from Callum Chick and a reverse pass from Hutchinson, only for Freeman to inexplicably spill it with a try there for the taking.\n\nAnd with that let-off, Quirke, bound for Newcastle Red Bulls next season, spotted a gap in the defence to dive over under the posts.\n\nSale ended the first half with a man less as Tom Curry was yellow carded after being adjudged to have gone high on Kemeny, but remarkably by the time Curry returned, his side were ahead.\n\nGeorge Ford kicked a penalty with the last kick of the first half when Mitchell gave up 10 metres for not handing the ball over to reduce the deficit to three, before Carpenter went over in the corner in the first minute after the restart to make it 15-14.\n\nBut the Saints pack took it upon themselves to restore their advantage with hooker Smith eventually the one adjudged to have got the ball over the line.\n\nThat just started an incredible period of play as the lead changed hands. O'Flaherty's first try and a superb touchline conversion from Ford had Sale back in front.\n\nBut a blistering counter attack involving Mitchell and George Furbank was brilliantly finished in the corner by Italy teenager Todaro, for his seventh Prem try of the season.\n\nHowever, Sale's next attack saw them suck in defenders and Rob du Preez's kick was on the money for O'Flaherty to score again to lead 29-26.\n\nSaints delved into their box of tricks one more time with Chick breaking through and although Mitchell was held up by O'Flaherty, superb support play from Kemeny allowed the Australia flanker to score in the corner.\n\nThis time, there was no letting it slip as Coles finished off after a number of phases near the line, before Pollock rounded things off in the only way he can, running through from halfway before spectacularly diving over.\n\nSo while Saints sit pretty for the next two months as The Prem takes a break for the Six Nations, Sale are left to lick their wounds.\n\nSale Sharks director of rugby Alex Sanderson said:\n\n\"We came up short in quite a few areas – set-piece early on, scrum dominance, collisions around the rucks, things that led into them having momentum and almost being able to score at will.\n\n\"That's where we fell short across the 80 minutes and probably across the season if I'm being honest. Consistent inaccuracies in too many fundamental parts of our game.\n\n\"It probably shows where we're at, at this moment in time. Northampton are a team in form, we're a team trying to find some form.\n\n\"Realistically, that's us done for the play-offs, but not the season. I am not going to give up on a season in January. No, we are going to get better. There is that to play for, and scalps to take.\"\n\nNorthampton Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson said:\n\n\"Alex Sanderson had said it was a huge fixture for them, so we knew there would be an emotional spike from them and we know Sale are a very good side and it would be nip-and-tuck.\n\n\"It was a mad game with the wind, that made it pretty chaotic, but we stuck to our guns enough to get away in the last 10 minutes.\n\n\"We created loads in the first half and didn't convert it and then they come straight out and score and it's game on. But I admire the way we stuck at the plan.\n\n\"It's been a long time here. We felt we've been close the last couple of years. Other sides have struggled to get results up here, so that makes it all the sweeter that we managed to get over the line in the last game in this block.\"\n\nSale: Carpenter; O'Flaherty, R du Preez, Ma'asi-White, Wills; Ford, Quirke; Rodd, Jibulu, Harper, van Rhyn, Bamber, Vermuelen, Dugdale, T Curry.\n\nReplacements: Caine, McIntyre, Bell, Burrow, Gilmore, Warr, Louw, Reed.\n\nNorthampton: Hendy; Freeman, Hutchinson, Dingwall, Todaro; Belleau, Mitchell; Iyogun, R Smith, Davison, Coles, van der Mescht, Kemeny, Pearson, Chick.\n\nReplacements: Wright, Fischetti, Millar Mills, Prowse, Lockett, Pollock, McParland, Furbank.",

Football is played on the pitch - not with the money.\"\n\nIt is worth noting Newcastle's net spend on new signings last summer was £100m-plus, but they sold star striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British transfer record fee of £125m.\n\nTargets such as Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, James Trafford and Benjamin Sesko also opted to join Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United respectively rather than move to St James' Park.\n\nAlthough Newcastle are majority owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia, legacy clubs - also including Arsenal and Tottenham - have the ability to spend more within the rules on account of their superior income streams.\n\nAnalysis from financial firm Deloitte revealed Liverpool generated £367m \n\n\"I know people are bored of us talking about it, but it's factual,\" he added. \"Building our revenues will be so important, and I know there's a lot of work behind the scenes to do that.\n\n\"I have always had the belief that, whatever situation you have, you have to try to outperform your resources. You have to try to overachieve. You have to stretch every ounce of energy and effort from the squad that you have.\n\n\"We believe we can still achieve great things - regardless of what financial restrictions there are on us.\"\n\nOverall squad costs from the 2026-27 league campaign will be limited to 85% of a club's revenue, while teams competing in Europe will have to adhere to Uefa's maximum of 70%.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Olena Janchuk spends another day of freezing isolation in her high-rise apartment.\n\nThe former kindergarten teacher has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and has been trapped for weeks on the 19th floor of her Kyiv tower block, 650 steps from the ground.\n\nLong daily blackouts caused by Russia’s bombardment of power plants and transmission lines have made working elevators a luxury.\n\nWith January temperatures plummeting to minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), there’s a permanent line of frost on the inside of Janchuk’s windows, white patterns creeping across the glass by morning.\n\nThe 53-year-old huddles over a makeshift fireplace of candles arranged beneath stacked bricks, designed to absorb and slowly release heat. USB charging cables snake across the floor from overloaded power strips, while her electric blanket is hooked up to a power bank rationed for the coldest hours.\n\n“When there’s no light and heat for seventeen and a half hours, you have to come up with something,” she said. “The bricks work best in a small room, so we stay in there.”\n\nKyiv, a city of about 3 million people, is dominated by tower blocks, many from the Soviet era, now left without power for most of the day.\n\nIn this fourth winter of war, electricity is a rationed commodity.\n\nResidents plan their lives around electricity schedules: when to cook, shower, charge phones and run washing machines. Food is chosen for shelf life, water filtered into bottles and stored in buckets. Small camping gas burners are used to heat soup or tea when the power is out.\n\nSleep is fractured by air raid sirens and the need to use electricity during off-peak hours.\n\nOutside, across snow-covered Kyiv, diesel generators rumble on commercial streets. Shoppers navigate aisles using phone flashlights, and bars glow by candlelight.\n\nApps notify users of narrowing electricity windows — usually just a few hours — enough for a household reboot.\n\nLife gets harder on the higher floors\n\nJanchuk’s 22-story building is located near a power station and residents can see the missile and drone attacks firsthand, flashes lighting up the horizon at night.\n\nDuring blackouts, they climb the stairs in darkness, phone lights bouncing off concrete steps, often accompanied by the echo of children and barking dogs. People sometimes leave plastic bags with cookies or water inside elevators for those who get stuck when the power cuts midride.\n\nJanchuk’s husband, out working most of the day, brings the groceries in the evening while her mother, 72-year-old Lyudmila Bachurina, is in charge of chores.\n\n“It’s cold, but we manage,” the mother says, holding a square USB-charged flashlight she recently mounted on the wall. “When the lights come on, I start turning on the washing machine, fill up water bottles, cook food, charge power banks, run around the kitchen and run around the house.”\n\nIn upscale neighborhoods, residents pool funds for generators to keep elevators running. But most blocks — home to pensioners, families and people with disabilities — cannot afford them.\n\nDisability advocates, including groups representing wounded war veterans, say staircases have become an invisible social barrier, cutting people off inside their own homes.\n\nThey are urging city officials to fund generators for residential buildings.\n\nUntil then, life bends around the electricity timetable. USB lamps, power banks and inverter batteries have become household staples. Telegram chats help neighbors check on the elderly and swap blackout updates.\n\nFrom upper floors, Kyivans look out over a skyline of high rises and the city’s historic golden-domed churches. At night, flashes of explosions are visible as Russia continues its campaign against Ukraine’s energy system.\n\nRussia has inflicted vast damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure\n\nToo many power stations and transmission lines have been hit to meet demand, even with electricity imports from Europe. To prevent a grid collapse, operators impose rolling blackouts, keeping hospitals and critical services alive while homes go dark.\n\nAt one coal-fired power plant struck repeatedly, shift supervisor Yuriy walks through wreckage of charred machinery, collapsed roofs and control panels melted into useless lumps. Repairs are carried out by torchlight, giant sandbags shielding what still works. Photographs of colleagues killed on the job hang near the entrance.\n\n“After missile and drone attacks, the consequences are terrible — large-scale,” he said.\n\nOfficials asked that the plant’s location and Yuriy’s full name not be disclosed for security reasons.\n\n“Our energy equipment has been destroyed. It is expensive,” Yuriy said. “Right now, we’re restoring what we can.”\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nKyiv has repeatedly updated its austere winter power-saving schedule, dimming or cutting streetlights in low-traffic areas and investing in less centralized power generation.\n\nIn the tower blocks, restoration feels far off.\n\n“I’m tired, really tired, to be honest. When you can’t go outside, when you don’t see the sun, when there’s no light and you can’t even go to the store on your own. … It wears you down,” Bachurina said.\n\n“But the important thing, as all Ukrainians say now, is that we will endure anything until the war ends.”\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "(Corrects typo in first subhead)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - When Fabiola, a single mother and naturalized U.S. citizen from Latin America, first learned of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, she said she was heartbroken and terrified.\n\nThen she joined the thousands of other Minnesotans who have volunteered to track ICE agents since Good was killed - despite her fears for herself and her son ​Asher, who is seven.\n\n“I do feel scared, but at the same time, I know I have to take care of my people too,” she said.\n\nActivists say they have been overwhelmed by new volunteers - despite the potential for violence - ‌since Good was killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.\n\nFederal agents on Saturday shot dead a Minneapolis resident, the second person since the Trump administration surged 3,000 immigration enforcement officials to the city.\n\nFabiola, who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and owns a construction company, never knew Good. The mother of three ‌was fatally shot when she stopped her car during an immigration enforcement action, just blocks from Fabiola's home.\n\nDHS did not respond to requests for comment on the risks to observers in Minnesota, but officials say federal agents respond with gunfire when they fear for their lives. Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary, and other Trump administration officials have described the protesters and observers as \"anti-ICE\" and \"far left\" agitators.\n\nWHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME\n\nFabiola and Asher now blow their whistles when they spot immigration agents on their way to school. She taught Asher how to identify federal agents by their uniforms, and made him memorize his grandparents' phone numbers in case she is detained.\n\nFabiola, who declined to share her last name for fear of retribution, has also started delivering food to people afraid to leave their homes. And she regularly ⁠stops by the makeshift memorial to Good.\n\n“She’s got kids, and her kids don’t have their ‌mom now,\" Fabiola said. \"If something happened to me, where is my boy going to go?”\n\nVice President JD Vance said during a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday that Good was trying to ram Ross with her car. Analyses of bystander video by Reuters and other outlets show Good's wheels were turned away from Ross, and that his legs were clear of the vehicle when he shot her.\n\nAt least five ‍organizations offer training on how to monitor ICE actions, warn immigrants of their presence and document the use of force against detainees and protesters. Online training for one of those groups has been hitting maximum capacity of 1,000 within hours, said Kate Wegener, an immigration attorney who leads the trainings.\n\n“We were fearful that attendance would be lower after her death, but it was the complete opposite,” she said.\n\nThe sessions typically offer safety tips: stay at least eight feet from federal agents; follow orders given by officers and keep one's distance when driving behind convoys of agents.\n\nSome of ​the observers are hyper-aware of the risks. Janet, a resident of a Minneapolis suburb who declined to share her last name out of fear of doxxing, said she has written letters to friends and family to be opened if she's killed.\n\nMinnesota ‌authorities at state and local levels have encouraged the observers. Governor Tim Walz has urged residents to take out their phones and document federal agents.\n\nThe observers, often identified by their fluorescent green vests and whistles looped around their necks, are now an increasingly common sight along busy roads and residential neighborhoods when the heavily armed, masked federal agents dressed in tactical gear are deployed.\n\nThe community pushback has had some effect. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino on Wednesday said the city presented a “difficult operating environment” for enforcement agents.\n\nOrganizers compared the level of engagement to the surge of activism following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nOn a recent day, two new volunteers, a married couple, straddled their bikes next to a busy intersection on the lookout for ICE agents. Snow gathered on their jackets and frost clung to their eyelashes.\n\n“I kind of woke up to what was happening when Renee Good was killed – I knew bad things were happening, but hadn't realized quite how bad it was yet,” ⁠said Aaron, who is 41 and works in marketing. He declined to share his last name out of fear of retribution. “And then when that happened, ​it was like, it's time to start doing something.”\n\nEarlier that day, he said he had adjusted his six-mile run to cover neighborhoods where residents had reported ​ICE sightings near schools.\n\nPushing back against immigration enforcement carries risk. The immigration observers have been teargassed and arrested. State authorities said Friday they were compiling data on arrests but it was not immediately available.\n\nFor Patty O’Keefe, a 36-year-old non-profit worker, those risks underline the importance of the observers.\n\n\"They wouldn't be working so hard to intimidate us and utilizing all those resources if we weren't actually ‍being successful in gumming up the works of their operation or ⁠slowing them down,” O’Keefe said.\n\nEarlier this month, as she was following ICE agents in her car, she said five federal agents shattered her car window, handcuffed her, and put her in an unmarked SUV. She said ICE agents photographed her, insulted her and held her for eight hours in a Minneapolis detention center before she was released without charge.\n\nDHS did not respond to a request for comment on O'Keefe's account of the incident, and Reuters was unable to ⁠determine independently what occurred.\n\nShe said she now struggles with anxiety - but will continue volunteering.\n\n\"I'm just stubborn, and I'm not wanting to give in to the fear.\"\n\nMany residents speak about Good with a sense of reverence, describing her as an inspiration.\n\nOn the street where she was killed, dozens of people defied dangerously ‌cold weather to add to the mounds of bouquets, stuffed animals and electric candles glowing through the snow at a makeshift memorial.\n\n“She gave her life for us,” Fabiola said. “Her soul is in heaven, and she protects ‌us.”",

    "fullText": "Wildlife smuggling cases are often uncovered at borders or ports, but officials say trains are also being used to illegally move live animals. According to the Hindustan Times, passenger routes can make criminal transport easier to hide in plain sight.\n\nOfficials with the Railway Protection Force said they recovered 102 live turtles from the Howrah-Dehradun Doon Express after inspecting five unclaimed bags found beneath seats and berths in a coach.\n\nInspector Banarsi Yadav said the train arrived at Gaya Junction around 10:30 p.m., when a joint patrol was underway as part of Operation Wilep. He said the turtles were protected under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, making the transport a criminal offense. While no one was arrested, the animals were handed over to the forest department, which gave the turtles a health check.\n\n\"After no passenger claimed the bags, they were opened. We found 102 live turtles inside those bags,\" Yadav told the Times.\n\nWildlife trafficking can disrupt ecosystems while harming efforts to conserve them. For example, moving animals from their natural habitats to new territories can weaken vulnerable wildlife populations by introducing the former as invasive species that affect breeding and eating habits. When trafficking routes overlap with human travel and trade ports, however, it may be harder to enforce protections.\n\nIt can also increase the chances that animals get injured or killed as well as increase wildlife-human interactions that can end in disaster. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported that smugglers often transport illegally captured turtles in extremely cramped and inhumane conditions that contribute to deadly disease outbreaks among the animals. In one case, eastern box turtles that were trafficked were infected with ranavirus, which is known to cause hemorrhaging and fluid accumulation. There is no known cure.\n\nPer the Times, Operation Wilep focuses on patrols, inspections, and coordination with other departments to intercept wildlife traffickers on rail routes.\n\nIf you're looking to get involved in raising awareness about the illegal wildlife trade, it's important to note that, like other critical climate issues, public awareness and community engagement are key to addressing the issue. A widespread understanding of how smuggling impacts ecosystems can affect how many people recognize and report suspicious activity.\n\nDo you think America has a plastic waste problem?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Store brands help us save money, but the truth is the product is often made by a brand name producer. If Walmart's butter tastes familiar, here's why.",
    "fullText": "A shopper's pre-dinner surprise highlighted online speculations about manufacturing products and brand packaging. As one TikTok creator opened packages of Land O' Lakes butter, the buyer was faced with butter sticks wrapped in Walmart's Great Value brand labels. On TikTok, several shoppers are convinced that the butter is in fact the same and that brands and packaging simply drives price differences. \"I'm sure Land 'O Lakes makes the Great Value butter and they mixed up the wrappers on the line,\" wrote a TikTokker. \"The amount of people that don't know it all comes from the same factories is INSANE,\" added another. One commenter on Facebook recalled being informed by a worker that machines would be stopped for labels to be switched and packaging to continue.\n\nWalmart customers appreciate the price point of Great Value products. \"Everything is made by some other company and just branded Great Value Sam's choice, etc.,\" wrote a Redditor. \"Never had a problem with Great Value honestly. Especially given the fact that most, if not all Great Value products are made and packaged by their name brand counterparts.\" Sara Lee has been linked to Great Value White Bread, and Peter Pan has been associated with Great Value Peanut Butter, for example, but it can take some detective work to determine concrete answers.\n\nOn Quora, industry insiders revealed that dairy production can change from region to region and which suppliers are available. \"Two companies that I know for sure on the East Coast are Land 'O Lakes and Blue Bonnet,\" the user revealed before adding that brand names would be changed on packaging labels during manufacturing processes. \"Great Value is Walmart's private‑label brand; the butter sold under the Great Value name is produced for Walmart by multiple co‑packers rather than a single manufacturer,\" the user explained. One Facebooker explained that Walmart contracts brands to package Great Value products. \"Land 'O Lakes and Great Value are the exact same butter, made in the same factory on the same line, they just switch the labels and packaging,\" added another. \"I worked in a name brand place that also made a generic product. But we would stop to change labels, while the machine operator changed the recipe,\" chimed in a TikTokker.\n\nTo locate details about a specific manufacturer on a package, the names of makers and co-packers are often listed somewhere near the ingredient and nutrition profile. Product codes can also indicate information about particular facilities. Additionally, customer service departments may provide supplier information that correspond to recorded codes. Since Walmart's supplier network changes, however, information may only refer to a specific code and date of product, making sweeping statements difficult to provide — and contributing to the rumors that continue to swirl online.\n\nWant more food knowledge?
