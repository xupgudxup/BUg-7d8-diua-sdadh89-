    "fullText": "Barcelona reclaimed top spot in La Liga with a 3-0 win over Real Oviedo on Sunday, thanks to goals from Dani Olmo, Raphinha and an acrobatic Lamine Yamal effort.\n\nAfter Real Madrid beat Villarreal on Saturday to take pole position overnight, the Catalans edged a point ahead again.\n\nAlthough Oviedo are bottom of the table with just two victories all season, Barca had to scrap for their victory as the visitors worked hard defensively to keep Hansi Flick's team at bay until the second half.\n\nEventually the hosts' quality told at the partially-reopened Camp Nou and after Olmo opened the scoring Barca never looked back.\n\nThe pick of the goals was Yamal's strike, an impressive volley from Olmo's cross to secure Barca's triumph.\n\n\"I know we didn't play on our highest level in the first half... but the team has done a fantastic job in the last few weeks, months,\" Flick told DAZN.\n\nThe coach praised Yamal for his hard work in terms of pressing and also hailed his fine strike.\n\n\"It was great... I'm happy that he scored such a (good) goal, and the third goal for us was really important,\" added Flick.\n\nBarca struggled to make inroads in a dry first half and their passing was unusually imprecise.\n\nInjured midfield maestro Pedri Gonzalez watched on from the stands with an unimpressed expression.\n\nOviedo sought to attack on the counter and Haissem Hassan drew a save from Joan Garcia from long distance.\n\nAt the other end, Aaron Escandell made a fine stop at his near post to thwart Raphinha before half-time.\n\nBarca came out with renewed energy for the second half and soon took the lead.\n\nAfter Yamal and Raphinha pressed in the box the ball broke loose to Olmo, who steered home.\n\nOviedo gave away a poor second goal after 57 minutes, with Raphinha running on to an undercooked back-pass from David Costas and lofting the ball over Escandell.\n\nBarcelona's third was expertly taken by Yamal, as Olmo's cross was falling behind him he produced an eye-catching sideways scissor-kick to wrap up the victory.\n\nA huge downpour hit the stadium, sending fans scurrying as there is no roof yet, and those who remained saw Escandell deny Robert Lewandowski a potential fourth with a fine save.\n\n\"I think we were not at our best in the first half, (but) in the second we could score the goals and that is the most important thing,\" said Raphinha.",

    "description": "Ryan Clark sees the path to a brighter Ravens future, one led by Lamar Jackson.",
    "fullText": "There's a point there where it felt like the Baltimore Ravens were truly going to turn things around and make a run. They were 1-5. They toppled the Chicago Bears in a Week 8 home game after the bye. That began a streak of five straight wins.\n\nAdversity came again. They lost three of their next five games, setting up a winner-take-all finale vs. the hated Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18.\n\nUltimately, we all know how things ended. The 30th-anniversary season ended with Tyler Loop's go-ahead field goal attempt sailing wide of its target. The Steelers won the AFC North. They earned the playoff berth. That saved Mike Tomlin's job (at the time).\n\nBaltimore was left with more questions than answers. John Harbaugh was fired after a postseason loss, and Mike Tomlin stepped down anyway. That ends a 44-game-long feud between the two.\n\nThe next time the Ravens and Steelers meet, they'll be led by two new head coaches. Baltimore recently announced the hire of Jesse Minter. The Steelers made an uninspiring hire. They'll now be led by Mike McCarthy.\n\nGames aren't won on paper, but it seems, from the outside looking in, that the Ravens already have the advantage on the sideline. With Aaron Rodgers' future decision pending, it's easy to ask a question. Seeing as how Tomlin's presence had a lot to do with Rodgers joining the Steelers in the first place, can we argue that McCarthy's hire is a blatant attempt to try and win him back?\n\nHere's another question. Even if Rodgers does return, don't the Ravens have an advantage at the quarterback position anyway? Some believe Baltimore's decision to move on from Harbaugh suggests that they chose their two-time MVP over their head coach of nearly two decades.\n\nThat brings us to our final questions. Now what? Where do the Ravens go from here? How does this team construct a winner again?\n\nESPN's Ryan Clark shared his theory. A beautiful Ravens future involves a plan to rebuild this team around Lamar Jackson on both sides of the ball, one in which the team's success is tied to that of Jackson.\n\n.@Realrclark25 doesn't believe Lamar Jackson will be leaving Baltimore.\n\n\"Lamar Jackson ain't going nowhere. ... The most important hire to me is ... it's head coach, then offensive coordinator. [What OC] is going to lead Lamar Jackson?\" pic.twitter.com/swqQ0h9Jod\n\n— First Take (@FirstTake) January 23, 2026\n\nWhat do you think? Do you agree? It seems, with a new head coach in place and a new offensive coordinator coming, that this is the only route this team can take, and honestly, that may be the point. There may not be another path. The Ravens, without John Harbaugh at the helm, are in search of a new identity.\n\nOnce known for its defense, the Ravens organization was tied to powerful defenders who were proven leaders. They've shifted and are now led by an offensive star who is far less vocal but among the best of his era.\n\nIn moving on from John Harbaugh, they chose to turn the page on sideline leadership. Players will move on in free agency, but the important cogs will keep the engine running.\n\nThis is Lamar Jackson's team now, in every sense that matters. AS he goes, this team will go. Jesse Minter wasn't hired to maintain the past. He was hired to maximize the present and secure the future. Make no mistake, he's here to win a Super Bowl, not get this team to the playoffs. Let's hope John Harbaugh doesn't win one first. Can you imagine?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ravens Wire: ESPN analyst weighs in on Ravens future led by Lamar Jackson",

    "fullText": "When Buffalo Bills owner Terry Pegula opted to fire veteran head coach Sean McDermott after Buffalo’s latest postseason heartbreak, reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen “had no input” on that decision.\n\nNow, as the Bills sift through the available coaching candidates, Allen’s role has changed, as the 30-year-old face of the franchise will be heavily involved in picking the team’s next head coach.\n\nToday’s edition of Buffalo Rumblinks leads off by exploring how Allen is being counted on as a valuable voice in the head coaching search and discussing whether giving Allen this much influence is a good idea.\n\nJosh Allen is Buffalo’s Superman. Able to make incredible, awe-inspiring moves on the football field with his powerful arm and legs. On the field, Allen’s role makes him partially responsible for the successes and failures of the man hired to replace McDermott. But this offseason, with the Bills at a crossroads, the team took it a step further, placing enormous trust in their dynamic face of the franchise to help identify their next head coach.\n\nAllen has already been involved in the head coach interview process, “sitting in for everything,” according to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini.

    "fullText": "Tennessean: Vanderbilt basketball, Tyler Tanner blow out Mississippi State to end losing streak\n\nVandy247: Vanderbilt answers the bell, wins big at Mississippi State\n\nSports Illustrated: Vanderbilt Uses Fast Start to Propel to Victory over Mississippi State\n\nSports Illustrated: There’s the Vanderbilt basketball team we know. They’re here again.\n\nSports Illustrated: Takeaways from Vanderbilt basketball’s 88-56 win over Mississippi State\n\nVandy247: This is exactly the type of win that Vanderbilt needed\n\nGene’s Page: Vanderbilt blows out Bulldogs 88-56 to extend Mississippi State’s SEC losing streak\n\nSports Illustrated: Tyler Tanner’s big performance helps Vanderbilt get back on track\n\nVandy247: Will Perdue’s “final five thoughts” on the Mississippi State game\n\nThis was a straight domination of the type we saw quite a bit in the nonconference portion of the schedule, but that hadn’t been seen for weeks. Interestingly, Vanderbilt only won two of the four factors: Mississippi State got to the foul line more often and grabbed more of their own misses, but Mississippi State also had a lot more misses and turned the ball over at nearly twice the rate that Vanderbilt did.\n\nInstead, Vanderbilt shot 27-of-40 inside the arc, back to its old ways of scoring at will on two-pointers. Mississippi State isn’t very good, though they did manage to win at Texas (a task that eluded Vanderbilt.) Unlike LSU or South Carolina earlier, though, Vanderbilt treated Mississippi State like a bad team. This was a get-right game and Vanderbilt won easily.\n\nI don’t want to be so reductive as to say that Vanderbilt goes as Tyler Tanner and Duke Miles go, but Tanner was meh at Texas and Arkansas and Miles was dreadful in the latter game. So, here, with those two getting back to normal and you can see how that affected Vanderbilt.\n\nMiles’ 7 steals, by the way, were one shy of the Vanderbilt school record — shared by Frank Seckar, Atiba Prater, and James Strong. Somehow, all three games in which a Vanderbilt player had eight steals (a) occurred when Jan van Breda Kolff was the head coach and (b) came against an OVC team. Weird coincidences all around! Anyway, 7 steals against an SEC team seems like it’s actually probably better than eight against an OVC team.\n\nGoing off Offensive Rating, this was actually Tyler Nickel’s worst game since the Memphis game (when he shot 2-of-10 from three.)\n\nI think Vanderbilt will need Devin McGlockton and AK Okereke to be better than this when we’re playing teams better than Mississippi State.\n\nNice performances from Jalen Washington and Chandler Bing off the bench. It seems like Mike James has taken Tyler Harris’s minutes? Maybe that will switch back after Harris went 3-for-3 from the floor and James… got whistled for four fouls in 12 minutes.\n\nStill no Frankie Collins or Mason Nicholson. Jayden Leverett and Jaylon Dean-Vines made a late appearance, and for Dean-Vines this was only his second appearance in SEC play. I don’t really know what the future holds for either of them.\n\nKentucky comes to Memorial Gym on Tuesday night. As of now the game will be at 8 PM CT on ESPN, though given the winter storm pummeling most of the country right now, who knows if it will stay that way. Kentucky has now won five in a row after beating Ole Miss 72-63 yesterday.\n\nWell, Alabama brought in a ringer from the G-League and lost to Tennessee at home anyway, so there’s that. Overall it was a rough day for ranked SEC teams, with Florida losing to Auburn at home and Georgia losing by 20 at Texas. Hell, Arkansas just barely held off LSU, who’s now 1-6 in the SEC.\n\nTexas A&M is now in sole possession of first place in the league after blowing out South Carolina, and I’d assume they will be entering the Top 25 on Monday. Missouri beat Oklahoma after hitting buzzer-beaters both to send the game to overtime and to win it in the extra session.\n\nAgain, Texas A&M is now in sole possession of first place at 6-1, with Florida, Arkansas, and Kentucky all tied at 5-2. Vanderbilt, along with Auburn, Georgia, and Missouri, is 4-3 in the league with Alabama and Tennessee half a game back at 3-3. Texas and Ole Miss are 3-4, South Carolina and Mississippi State are 2-5, and LSU and Oklahoma are 1-6, but both have been mostly competitive — but it seems like Matt McMahon and Porter Moser are both on track to get fired. I would also assume Lamont Paris’s seat at South Carolina is pretty warm.",

    "description": "The Denver Broncos are in prime shape roster building-wise with the pre-draft circuit already kicking into gear.",
    "fullText": "Later this afternoon, the Denver Broncos will host the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game. The winner will represent the AFC in Super Bowl 60. Without question, it’s the biggest game the Broncos have played in a decade.\n\nAll of us certainly hope that Denver’s magical season continues. The shot at earning the franchise’s fourth Lombardi Trophy is the ultimate goal today. But if things go sideways, the Broncos will head to offseason mode figuring out what needs to be done in order to better prepare themselves next season.\n\nTwo avenues of pursuit will be available for Denver to accomplish that. The first will be free agency. The Broncos are slated to have around $27 million in cap space. However, simple moves and restructures could nearly double that amount if they so choose. I would expect the franchise to find a way to continue to build around Bo Nix and make some big investments, especially since there is no more dead money from Russell Wilson’s contract on the books for next season.\n\nThe next would be the draft. In fact, the pre-draft circuit is already in full swing. The East-West Shrine Bowl will take place on Tuesday with a contingent of Broncos scouts and evaluators present. Thereafter, personnel from across the league will travel to Mobile, Alabama for this year’s Senior Bowl that takes place on January 31st. Before you know it, the NFL Combine will be here in late February with the 2026 NFL Draft capping it all off at the end of April.\n\nNo matter the outcome of today’s game is, Broncos Country should be thrilled with how the team has performed this season. They have proven they are capable of being a Super Bowl contender. But guess what? They are in a great position to solidify their roster and have a chance to do the same in the coming years.\n\nChampionship Sunday. 🤩\n\nIT'S GAMEDAY IN THE MILE HIGH CITY.#ClimbHigher x #NEvsDEN pic.twitter.com/4CYecR3Bkx\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) January 25, 2026\n\nThe Broncos currently have five picks in the first four rounds. That puts them in an addition to address needs on their roster. If Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph is hired away to be a Head Coach elsewhere, Denver would receive an additional third-round selection in both the 2026 and 2027 NFL Draft. There are still multiple coaching positions available. For a while, Joseph was considered the front-runner for the Arizona Cardinals’ opening. Things seem to have quieted on that front, but you never know.\n\nHowever, there is also a possibility that the Broncos consider wheeling and dealing for some extra selections by the time the draft rolls around. Pending the outcome of the games today, the Broncos will be slated to pick no higher than 29th in the ‘26 NFL Draft. While they certainly may love a player who is on the board at that point in time, it would not be a surprise to see them trade out of the first round and acquire more Day 2 selections to address any glaring issues. General Manager George Paton has proven to be a wheeler-and-dealer when it comes to picks.\n\nAs of now, I’d like to see them focus on fortifying their trenches. Both the offensive and defensive lines could use some talent added to them. They have a great group of players already but given the age and contract status of several of their key starters—I believe that should be a priority. Head Coach Sean Payton has always discussed the importance of building from the inside-out. I expect that is something we will see happen again this offseason.\n\nThe Broncos are clearly one of the best franchises in the NFL. They have a storied history and have accomplished a lot of great things. Very few teams across the league can say that much. Over the past several seasons, Denver has got back to their winning ways. There is no doubt players across the league are taking notice.\n\nOn top of that, their new ownership group is proving to be magnificent. They are doing whatever it takes to improve the team’s culture and performance. They are making significant investments across the board that other franchises simply aren’t capable of doing. We have witnessed new ownership and the front office being diligent in rewarding and extending in-house players who have performed at a high level and exemplify what it means to be a Bronco.\n\nThose are just a few reasons I think Denver will be able to make some big splashes during free agency. They have certainly impressed this season. However, there are a few glaring areas [running back, inside linebacker, etc.] that need to be addressed for them to continue to be successful in the coming seasons. And those aforementioned position groups have a lot of talented players hitting the market in March.\n\nWhat do you think, Broncos Country? Do you think Denver is geared up to have an eventful offseason? What are some moves you would like to see happen? Let me know in the comments section. (P.S., expect to see some Senior Bowl related Broncos content over the next week!)",

    "description": "Lobos remain undefeated in the PIT",
    "fullText": "A strong second-half performance helped New Mexico pull away from Nevada, 80–73 at The Pit Saturday night, as the Lobos extended their PIT winning streak against none other than former head Lobo coach Steve Alford’s Wolfpack.\n\nThe Lobos have now secured 23 straight home wins and are in a strong position to compete for the Mountain West Conference Championship.\n\nThey are currently tied for second place with Utah State Aggies at 7-2, trailing the first-place 8-1 San Diego State Aztecs, and ranked 42nd in the NET.\n\nEric Olen’s New Mexico Lobos have, at this point, really overachieved at this point in the season compared to what most media preseason experts predicted about how well the Lobos would fare this year.\n\nNew Mexico’s outside shooting proved decisive when it mattered most. The Lobos made 12 of 28 three-pointers, increasing their lead with a 36–18 advantage from beyond the arc.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mountain West’s leading three-point shooting team in conference play before Saturday’s game struggled to find a rhythm, making only 6 of 23 shots from beyond the arc.\n\nNevada started the second half with a quick 9–0 run, widening their nine-point lead over New Mexico, and the PIT faithful began to get restless.\n\nNevertheless, the Lobos responded confidently, improving both their offense and defense when the game was on the line and when it mattered most to secure a Mountain West Conference win.\n\nThe Lobos shot 50% in the second half and made five of their last six field goals to finish the game, matching Nevada’s efforts with timely shots.\n\nJake Hall, the freshman point guard, once again played well, leading the Lobos with 19 points and five three-pointers.\n\nHe scored his second three-pointer of the game, bringing his total to 59 made threes in 20 games and establishing a new University of New Mexico freshman record.\n\nAlong with Hall’s scoring, Tomislav Buljan contributed a double-double with 11 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nHe was often double-teamed throughout the game. New Mexico head coach Eric Olen commended Buljan for his patience and pointed out that the Lobos’ consistent ability to generate good shots, even when Nevada doubled, played a key role in their success.\n\nBuljan also fouled out eight times, drawing several fouls on Nevada’s big man, Elijah Price, who was limited to only 10 minutes in the first half due to foul trouble.\n\nUriah Tenette scored 13 points, along with five assists and two steals. Additionally, JT Rock provided a strong spark off the bench with 11 points in less than nine minutes of play.\n\nAlthough Nevada outrebounded New Mexico 42–38, the Lobos showed more effort on certain plays, converting 13 of 22 offensive rebounds into a 17–7 advantage in second-chance points and scoring 20 points off Nevada’s 12 turnovers.\n\nCorey Camper Jr. from Nevada (14–6, 6–3 MW) led the team with 20 points. Vaughn Weems and Elijah Price each scored 16 points, and Tayshawn Comer finished with 13.\n\nThis marked Nevada’s fifth straight loss to New Mexico, making it their longest current losing streak against a Mountain West opponent.\n\nWhere the Win Stands in the Mountain West Conference\n\nThis win boosted New Mexico’s record to 16–4 overall and 7–2 in the Mountain West Conference, keeping the Lobos among the top teams in the conference standings.\n\nNew Mexico remains separated from most of the league thanks to its strong home record, and upcoming games will be pivotal as the Lobos travel to UNLV and San Jose State before returning home to face Utah State and Boise State. These four games will greatly influence the race for the Mountain West title.\n\nAt this point in the season, it’s not just about wins for the Lobos – it’s also about how they handle adversity, adjust their play, and finish games, all signs of a team striving for a Mountain West Conference Championship.",

    "description": "Cody Bellinger re-signs, the Hall of Fame class is announced, and more.",
    "fullText": "It’s Sunday, and you know what that means — it’s time for our weekly social media roundup! For the second straight Sunday, New York City is getting hit by a wintry weather, although this time, it’s a storm expected to be so bad that many schools had already cancelled classes on Monday before the weekend even started. Now, the temperature may be chilly, but fortunately for us, the hot stove was piping hot for the Bombers this week. And since I know the anticipation is killing you, let’s get started!\n\nAll winter, the Yankees and Cody Bellinger acted like a pair of high school kids that clearly were interested in each other but were afraid to make the first move. As soon as the offseason began, Bellinger changed his Instagram profile picture, ditching a shot of him in a Yankee jersey in favor of a generic animated shot with a blank hat.\n\nThen, early last week, Bellinger and Austin Wells broke the Yankees portion of the Internet. The outfielder posted pictures of himself working out to prepare for the season, and the catcher posted a sad emoji in response. Immediately, fans began to wonder if he knew something we didn’t.\n\nThen, Wednesday afternoon, the news finally broke: the Yankees and Bellinger had agreed to a five-year deal that kept the popular outfielder in the Bronx. While Belli himself did not post on social media about the deal, he immediately changed his profile picture back to a picture of him in a Yankees uniform. Meanwhile, his wife, Chase, and mother, Jennifer, posted the following:\n\nLast night was the 101st New York Baseball Writers’ Gala, where the winner of the BBWAA’s major awards each officially received their honors. That included Aaron Judge, who took home his third career AL MVP and second in a row. Should be four! But it was a nice moment.\n\nThis week, the Baseball Hall of Fame announced its two newest members, Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones. While the two players are known more for their time with the Mets and Braves, respectively, they both did suit up for the Yankees: Jones donned the pinstripes in 2011 and 2012, while Beltrán was a part of the 2014, 2015, and 2016 teams before he was traded to the Texas Rangers. In addition to a collection of statements from key members of the organization, the Yankees made individuals posts celebrating both players.\n\nCC Sabathia, Robinson Canó, and Derek Jeter also took to social media to celebrate their former teammates, among others.\n\nFormer Yankees center fielder/current professional guitarist performed at Carnegie Hall earlier this month, and unsurprisingly, Suzyn Waldman made sure that she was in attendance.\n\nCC Sabathia posted some photos from “The Player’s Cup” this week. Honestly, I’m not 100% sure what event he is referring to — a quick Google search reveals an MLB Open, but that was an event that was supposed to occur in November — but it still seems like they all had a fun time.\n\nThe last two weeks have seen people posting photos from 2016, as they reminisce about the glory days when the Villanova Wildcats defeated the UNC in the NCAA National Championship (at least, that’s what comes to mind when I think of 2016). And naturally, now that this trend is two weeks old, we’ve got celebrities and corporate accounts joining in. First, we have Anthony Rizzo recalling one of the greatest World Series of all time, as the Cubs finally overcame their curse and proved that nothing is impossible, except maybe a Pope that roots for the Cubs.\n\nThen, the George M. Steinbrenner Field account joined in, which honestly wasn’t nearly as fun as the excitement in Chicago from the historic parade.\n\nJonathan Loáisiga had been part of the Yankees’ organization since joining them as a minor leaguer in February 2016 following a failed stint with the Giants. Injuries ravaged his career, but he was a bullpen staple in 2021 in particular, posting one of the better relief seasons you’ll see in the modern era, recording a 2.17 ERA, a 2.58 FIP, and a 1.019 WHIP across 70.2 innings. Alas, those aforementioned injuries were a constant issue for him, and he and the Yankees finally went their separate ways, making it official when Loáisiga signed a minor-league deal with the Diamondbacks earlier this month.\n\nLoáisiga took to Instagram to thank both the Yankees and their fans, in both Spanish and English. Best of luck to him in Arizona!\n\nAnd so, let’s wrap up this weekend’s social media roundup with a nice shot of last weekend’s snow, courtesy of Suzyn Waldman.",

    "fullText": "In a matter of days, 30 men and 30 women will step into the WWE Royal Rumble matches with the aim of securing themselves a title shot of their choosing at WrestleMania 42. For the past two years, Carmelo Hayes has been amongst the men receiving such an opportunity, with his 2024 Royal Rumble appearance spanning a respectable 17 minutes. During an interview with \"No Holds Barred,\" he reflected on his previous experience in the over-the-top-rope spectacle, while also looking ahead to the upcoming one.\n\n\"The opportunity to be in the Rumble is same as every year,\" he said. \"It's a huge opportunity. I mean, you can make yourself a star. You don't even got to win the Rumble half the time. You can make yourself a star in however long you get that opportunity to be in there. Mix it up with different guys. I think it's a cool opportunity to see guys mixing up with guys that you've never seen before. There's a lot of Raw guys that I've never got to really interact with. Also on top of that, all the surprises that they have, new guys coming in or old guys coming back, whatever it may be. I'm excited for the Royal Rumble.\"\n\nIn the 2025 iteration, Hayes emerged as the first elimination from the Men's Royal Rumble match, courtesy of then-Intercontinental Champion Bron Breakker. On his way to the back, however, Hayes left a lasting impression on the audience by attacking Akira Tozawa, which allowed popular streamer IShowSpeed to fill in as a surprise replacement.\n\nThe 2026 premium live event and its corresponding matches will emanate from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on January 31.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"No Holds Barred\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Today the Colorado Avalanche depart the friendly confines of home and embark on a four-game Canadian road trip during the coldest part of the year — pack your mittens.\n\nA change of scenery is welcome, however, as the Avalanche weren’t as successful as they’d hoped to be in a just concluded seven-game home stand where they went 3-2-2 ending with their ugliest loss dropping 7-3 to the Philadelphia Flyers. Colorado still leads the league by a wide margin, nine points to be exact, but the winning habits are starting to slip as boredom sets in along with some injury absences.\n\nEnter the Toronto Maple Leafs who the Avalanche lost to 4-3 in overtime less than two weeks ago. This matinee matchup sets the perfect stage for revenge as the Avalanche hope to get back on track to close out the month and head into the Olympic break on a high note.\n\nThe Opponent: Toronto Maple Leafs (24-18-9)\n\nListen: Altitude Sports Radio KKSE-FM 92.5 FM\n\nAs several injuries have started to crop up, there’s been some lineup shuffling. Last game Colorado got back Joel Kiviranta but suddenly Ross Colton was day-to-day with a lower-body injury. Devon Toews might return on this road trip but he’s not likely for today, therefore Jack Ahcan is still on the roster. The extra forward merry-go-round still continues as Taylor Makar is still with the team and is expected to play in Toronto.\n\nVictor Olofsson — Nathan MacKinnon — Martin Necas\n\nArtturi Lehkonen — Brock Nelson — Valeri Nichushkin\n\nTaylor Makar — Jack Drury — Gavin Brindley\n\nZakhar Bardakov — Parker Kelly — Joel Kiviranta\n\nAnother team licking their wounds going into this matchup is Toronto as they had an embarrassing outing of their own at home on Friday night. The Mitch Marner homecoming didn’t go as planned in a 6-3 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights. Toronto hopes to stay relevant in the Atlantic division playoff race but are slipping into the abyss. The return of goaltender Anthony Stolarz from injury was supposed to buoy the team, we’ll see if there’s any positive momentum in this contest. William Nylander could return soon as well, the team has kept quiet about their star’s rehab progress.\n\nMatias Maccelli — John Tavares — Matthew Knies\n\nBobby McMann — Auston Matthews — Max Domi\n\nEaston Cowan — Nicolas Roy — Nicholas Robertson\n\nSteven Lorentz — Scott Laughton — Calle Jarnkrok\n\nOliver Ekman-Larsson — Jake McCabe\n\nBoth Scott Wedgewood and Mackenzie Blackwood are back in action after they each suffered minor injuries earlier this month. However, Wedgewood has stayed back in Denver for the time being as his wife delivered a baby a few days ago and Isak Posch was recalled to serve as backup. Blackwood’s last two starts since his return haven’t gone well but he will get a chance at redemption along with the rest of the team in today’s contest. For the Maple Leafs, perhaps the same is true as Stolarz’s return didn’t go so well and it’s Joseph Woll’s turn in net. With no morning skate it will all become clear in warmup.\n\nFollow along in the comments below!",

Smith still stuck around to raise Gautier’s hand after he picked up a unanimous decision victory.\n\nWhite didn’t know how it happened but it was definitely one of the stranger situations he’s seen since he started running the UFC more than 25\n\n“Blew his ACL — I don’t know what the time was but they had to carry him out of there,” White said.\n\nSmith hasn’t addressed the injury directly, although he did post a message of positive affirmation after he was helped out of the arena to seek medical care.\n\nAn Armed Services veteran and pilot, Smith has been one of the most frequently employed referees in Nevada, which is obviously where the UFC calls home. Given the nature of his injury, Smith is likely going to be sidelined for the better part of the next year before he’ll be back officiating in the cage again.",

    "title": "Cowboys 2025 rookie report: Reviewing Phil Mafah",
    "description": "Do you feel optimistic about Phil Mafah next season?",
    "fullText": "All year long we’ve looked at the rookie class and given previews and reviews on each player for every game of the season. Now let’s look back the season in its entirety and breakdown each rookie and how they performed. Let’s continue with seventh-round running back Phil Mafah.\n\nSeason stats- Snaps: 10, Rush Attempts: 5, Rush Yards: 18, YPC: 3.6, TD: 1\n\nMafah’s rookie season was almost entirely in the shadows, but Week 18 at MetLife at least gave him something real to hang his helmet on. He was inactive all year, partly due to injury, until the finale against the Giants. In that game he did exactly what a back in his role is supposed to do, run hard, protect the ball, finish drives. On a small workload he logged five carries for 18 yards and punched in his first NFL touchdown on a short-yardage plunge, plus chipped in as a checkdown option. For a player who spent 17 weeks in sweats on game day, coming out of 2025 with a score on tape still matters.\n\nRookie Phil Mafah introducing himself to the defense 😳\n\nWatch on @NFLNetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/8tZaDT9OVj\n\nThe Giants game looked like a continuation of what he showed at Clemson as a downhill, no-nonsense power back with enough vision to find the crease without dancing. On his touchdown he got in behind his pads, trusted the interior double team and finished through contact at the goal line. On his other carries he squeezed out tough yards without taking losses, which is exactly what coaches want from a third-string back late in games. He didn’t put the ball on the ground, didn’t blow a protection, and didn’t look out of place in a live NFL game after sitting all year. The sample is tiny, but the traits, size, leg drive, and willingness to hit it north–south  all translated.\n\nPhil Mafah has his 1st career touchdown!\n\nDALvsNYG on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVnt pic.twitter.com/QB7jLz08Qy\n\nFor 2026, the plan and expectations should be grounded but optimistic. Mafah shouldn’t be penciled in as part of the rotation yet, one game isn’t enough to demand that. But he has clearly put himself in the mix, especially in short yardage and four-minute situations where Dallas wants a heavier back to close games. Realistically, his first goal is to make himself impossible to cut and win a 53-man spot, earn special-teams work, and carve out a defined offensive role.\n\nJaydon Blue and Phil Mafah looked solid for the Cowboys in their season finale.\n\nRunning back is one of the places where I feel totally fine this offseason.\n\nBring Javonte back, sign a different veteran, idk, obvs do something else.\n\nBut it is good overall imo. pic.twitter.com/dAm3qxzPfW\n\n— RJ Ochoa (@rjochoa) January 5, 2026\n\nThe coming training camp and preseason will tell us almost everything about whether he’s taken the next step. We’ll watch his reps, how many he gets and in what context, with ball security and efficiency being the goal. If he goes through the summer without fumbles and keeps turning modest blocking into positive yards, he’ll make a strong case to be more than a Week 18 try-out. Given his size/power profile, and how he looked in that Giants game, there’s a very reasonable path for Mafah to be a part of the Cowboys’ backfield picture in 2026.\n\nWhere do you stand on Jaydon Blue and Phil Mafah moving into next season? 👑 pic.twitter.com/qPTPJXcSdC\n\n— Crown Global Media (@CrwnGlobalMedia) January 5, 2026",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boosted their Premier League survival hopes by returning to winning ways with a disciplined 2–0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nGoals from Igor Jesus and Taiwo Awoniyi secured three vital away points and restored Forest’s five-point cushion above the relegation zone.\n\nThe result also consigned Brentford to a second consecutive league defeat and ended their seven-match unbeaten home run.\n\nForest arrived under pressure after mixed recent results but produced a composed display that balanced early incision with late control.\n\nThe visitors struck after 12 minutes through Igor Jesus, whose finish set the tone for the evening.\n\nOla Aina’s low cross deflected upwards off Rico Henry, allowing the Brazilian to cushion the ball on his shoulder, spin away from Kristoffer Ajer and drive a powerful shot across goal.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher got a hand to the effort but could not prevent it finding the far corner.\n\nIt was a moment of quality that drained the energy from the home crowd and rewarded Forest’s positive start.\n\nBrentford had threatened early, with Igor Thiago sliding wide inside two minutes after Kevin Schade broke down the left.\n\nThat miss proved costly as the hosts struggled to regain attacking fluency after falling behind.\n\nForest settled into a compact shape, with Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson controlling possession and tempo in midfield.\n\nThe Bees were disrupted further when Ajer and Mikkel Damsgaard were forced off injured before half-time.\n\nA brief spell of pressure followed, but Sepp van den Berg headed narrowly wide from a long throw on the stroke of the interval.\n\nThe second half was attritional, with Brentford enjoying territory but finding little space against a well-organised defence.\n\nMurillo and Nikola Milenkovic dealt calmly with crosses and direct play as Forest remained content to defend deep.\n\nClear chances were scarce, with Igor Thiago firing over from close range during Brentford’s best spell.\n\nAs frustration grew among the hosts, Forest began to sense an opening on the counter-attack.\n\nThat moment arrived with 10 minutes remaining when Gibbs-White released substitute Taiwo Awoniyi down the right.\n\nThe forward outpaced Van den Berg, cut inside and slid a composed finish beneath Kelleher to seal the win.\n\nIt was Awoniyi’s first league goal in a year and a significant milestone following his serious injury late last season.\n\nForest saw out the closing stages comfortably, prioritising shape and discipline as Brentford ran out of ideas.\n\nThe victory extended Forest’s unbeaten league run to three matches and provided a timely lift after midweek European disappointment.",

    "fullText": "Tarik Skubal didn’t just accept the 2025 American League Cy Young Award on Saturday night; he delivered a speech that perfectly captured who he is as a competitor, teammate, husband, father, and face of the Detroit Tigers.\n\nThere was confidence.\nThere was gratitude.\nThere was emotion.\nAnd there was even a little “run it back” energy that should have Tigers fans smiling.\n\nHere is Skubal’s full Cy Young acceptance speech, word for word, via the Detroit Free Press:\n\n“First off, I’d like to express what an incredible privilege it is to share this stage with the caliber of players up here tonight. I’m humbled to be a part of this group and know the greatness from everyone up here is part of what pushes me to be the best version of myself every time I take the mound. I want to thank the baseball writers for selecting me as the winner of this prestigious award. It’s an honor to be back here, and it’s something I’ll never take for granted. After last year’s dinner, I told A.J. [Hinch], ‘Same time next year.’ But I didn’t really know it would become a reality. Skip, for the sake of superstition and a three-peat, let’s go ahead and keep the same plan for a year from now. In all seriousness, I never take moments like these for granted because who knows how many times I’ll be able to share this space with these people.\n\n“The most important person in the room tonight is my wife. Where are you? There you are. Thank you for being who you are – for consistently pushing me to be the man, father and husband that I’m supposed to be. Thank you for setting an example for our two boys and showing them what true unconditional love is. Though we’re here to celebrate what happens on the field, the countless sacrifices you make for our family is what makes it all possible. I love you.\n\n“I want to take a moment to thank some of the people who are responsible for who I am. I’ll start with the Tigers. Chris Ilitch, the Ilitch family, Scott Harris, Jeff Greenberg, A.J., Fett [Chris Fetter], Lundy [Robin Lund], Nae Nae [Juan Nieves], Ryno [Ryne Eubanks], Kelly [Rhoades], C-Mac [Chris MacDonald], Duncan [Evans], Drew [Heithoff], Shane [Wallen], Timmy [Tim Remes], Chi-Chi [Chris Chinea]. Thank you for putting up with me on a daily basis and instilling confidence in me. It doesn’t go unnoticed. To the boys at APEX [Performance Facility], Justin [Wakefield], Wes [Budge], Zinger [John Huizinga], thank you for consistently pushing me year in and year out to levels I didn’t think were possible. To my family, mom, dad, thank you for raising me the right way and instilling a work ethic in me and to never be satisfied. To Scott Boras and the Boras Corp, thank you guys for always having my back. You guys have been there with me throughout my entire career, and I can’t thank you for always taking care of me and my family. Lastly, to my teammates, thank you guys for always demanding me to push the threshold of what I’m capable of. I truly appreciate it. And a special shoutout to the guys behind the plate: Dillon Dingler and Jake Rogers. Not only are you guys incredible at making sure we’re prepared to win every game, but also for the way you hold me accountable. Thank you for that.\n\n“We’re at an incredible point in history of our great sport, and it’s so humbling to stand here taking a moment to recognize my place within it. Thank you again for this honor.”\n\nFrom the three-peat tease, to the heartfelt message to his wife, to the long list of coaches, trainers, teammates, and family members, this was the kind of speech that reminds you why Tarik Skubal isn’t just an ace, he’s a leader and a cornerstone of the Tigers’ future… IF THEY FIND A WAY TO KEEP HIM AROUND!!!\n\nDetroit has waited a long time for a pitcher who combines dominance, humility, and edge.\n\nSaturday night, Skubal showed he has all three.\n\nThe post Tarik Skubal’s Entire Cy Young Speech Will Give Detroit Tigers Fans Chills appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Joe Heyes would relish the chance to test himself against Leicester Tigers teammate Nicky Smith if the pair lock horns when England host Wales in their Six Nations opener.\n\nHeyes and Smith proved a potent combination as they dismantled the Harlequins scrum in a 34-7 Gallagher Prem win on Saturday, but could be on opposite sides when their nations clash at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham on 7 February.\n\nThe England tighthead is close chums with his club-mate, as well as fellow Wales squad member Olly Cracknell, but has put that friendship on hold as he heads into camp with the rest of Steve Borthwick’s squad ahead of the opening round.\n\nLike many within the English game, Heyes considers Smith to be the finest scrummaging loosehead in the Prem, and was given one of his darkest days while the 31-year-old was with the Ospreys.\n\nHeyes was sent to the sin bin for persistent scrum offences during a Champions Cup fixture in December 2022 and therefore knows all too well the threat that Smith poses.\n\n“We just said goodbye in the changing rooms,” Heyes said after the win over Harlequins. “That was a bit awkward. I didn't know whether to hug or strangle him. We know where we're going but we'll keep it professional and try not to have any domestic conflict.\n\n“I had a bad experience against Nicky three or four years ago and I was yellow-carded. I was like, ‘I've got him here’ but he would just pop his way back out of it.\n\n“He has an unbelievable ability to go forward. Around the field as well, people don't see it. He'll chop everything, he'll get over the ball. He's a quality player. I think every prop has a bad day, and I've had a couple, but that was probably one of my bad days.”\n\nSmith will swap Leicester for Sale at the end of the season, and will hope to help earn Wales their first Six Nations victory since 2023 before then.\n\nHeyes, meanwhile, feels a figure of vital importance to Borthwick after injuries to Will Stuart and Asher Opoku-Fordjour, the two other tightheads in England’s squad in November.\n\nWhile the experienced Trevor Davison and young gun Vilikesa Sela offer strong options, Heyes looks set to retain a starting place seized during a breakthrough 2025.\n\n“I'm really excited to get stuck back in,” he said. “Before it probably wasn't as exciting as because I never thought I'd be involved and it felt like a bit of a rinse and repeat cycle.\n\n“It's not only the fact I'm playing now but it's also the group we’ve got.\n\n“If you look around at all positions in England at the moment, the strength and depth is actually incredible, isn't it? Maybe like 10 years ago, you would never have had that.”",

    "fullText": "Barcelona reclaimed their position at the top of the league table thanks to a 3-0 win over Real Oviedo.\n\nIt was a dominant performance from the Catalans, who were up against an Oviedo side which tried to defend with grit, even managing to keep things goalless in the first half.\n\nHowever, an improved second-half display from Barça and goals from Raphinha, Dani Olmo and Lamine Yamal ensured three points for the home side.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the game, Raphinha talked about the win over Oviedo and what it means for his team.\n\nRaphinha admitted it wasn’t an easy game for Barcelona, and the team struggled, especially in the first half.\n\n“We knew it would be a tough match, a team trying to play and press you as well, even when playing away from home.\n\n“We weren’t at our best moments in the first half, but in the second half I think we found ourselves and managed to score the goals, and I think that’s the most important thing, and that’s what we were looking for,” he said after the game.\n\nThe Brazilian international was asked about the things that went wrong in the first half, when the team failed to find the back of the net.\n\n“Well, I think I’d say patience, our team’s patience. Because we knew that in the end, their team would try to play and would try to press. We knew that we had to be patient to try to make them run after the ball to tire them out, especially in the second half.\n\n“I think we did that well. We weren’t at our best in the first half, but in the second half, we came back a bit better, and we were happy to score the goals,” he explained.\n\nTalking about Barcelona’s pressing, especially in the second half, Raphinha pointed out that the team did extremely well.\n\n“In the end, we have to press up front because that also makes our defensive work easier. Doing a good job with the press up front gives us goals, and many times it gives us the chance to intercept the ball more easily at the back and create more chances.\n\n“So I think we’ve done that well, and that’s our idea in playing, sort of,” he added.\n\nThe former Leeds United star was particularly happy about the press and his subsequent goals.\n\n“Our idea was to press up front and try to steal as many balls as possible. I tried to press there. Sorry about what happened to the centre-back, but that’s what I was supposed to do, so I was very happy and managed to score the goal,” he stated.\n\nRaphinha’s top form at Barcelona continues. (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking of his goal, Raphinha has now scored eight goals in 13 matches. But when asked about his performances compared to last season, the Brazilian looked a bit frustrated.\n\nRaphinha notably had an entertaining one-on-one with a reporter, who compared this season’s performance with the last.\n\n“From 13 matches, 8 goals—do you think something has changed compared to last season?” he asked the reporter, who replied, “I’m asking you.”\n\nIn response, Raphinha said, “No, you all… You all are the ones who can watch the matches more times. I’m doing my job and I think I’m doing the same thing as last season.”\n\nThe report eased the tension by asking him if he feels in his best form right now, but the Brazilian once again had a cold answer.\n\n“No, I’ll always tell you that I’m looking for my best moments; I’ll never tell you that I’m at my best moments. I’m someone who always seeks growth, so… I’ll never tell you that these are my best moments,” he said.\n\nTalking about the goal he scored and how it did not originate from a powerful effort, the attacker stated, “Yes, well.. You have to try some different things, otherwise it will become too easy for the goalkeepers to wait for it.“\n\nFinally, Raphinha heaped praise on Lamine Yamal’s wonder goal towards the end.\n\n“A legendary goal, amazing. We on the bench were stunned, it was an amazing goal. The most important thing is that we won the match and got the three points to take back home,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL playoffs are upon us, with the NFC and AFC title games on tap, and as the stakes change so do the overtime rules. Let's dive into exactly how before the final two pre-Super Bowl games get going.\n\nBoth teams get at least one possession in overtime, a rule change made after the controversial 2022 AFC Championship game. The Buffalo Bills lost that one to the Kansas City Chiefs after failing to get a possession in overtime, as you might recall.\n\nA playoff game also cannot end in a tie, so if the score is even after the first overtime period, the teams will play as many are needed for a winner to emerge. Between each overtime period a two-minute intermission will take place. Additionally, the second and fourth overtime periods are subject to the same timing rules as the second and fourth regulation periods.\n\nLike the regular season, overtime will not feature any instant replay coach's challenges as all reviews are initiated by the replay official.\n\nNo playoff games went to overtime last season, so perhaps we're due for some this year. There's nothing better than some extra football, especially in the playoffs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Overtime rules for NFL playoffs in NFC, AFC conference championships",

    "fullText": "One of Auburn softball's top hitters from the 2025 season is catching the eyes of national publications ahead of the new season.\n\nAnnaLea Adams led the Tigers in several categories as a freshman last season and is poised for another great season in 2026. She will begin the season ranked No. 9 in D1Softball's Designated Player/Utility Preseason Power Rankings, a year removed from earning a spot on the All-SEC First Team.\n\nAdams led the team in batting average (.390) and slugging percentage (.658). She was also in the top-five in other categories, including No. 2 in hits (57), No. 3 in home runs (10), and No. 2 in RBI (41). She was also included in another preseason ranking from D1Softball earlier this month, where the publication placed her at No. 83 in its top 100.\n\nAdams is set to be the anchor of the Auburn defense that will need to replace many players including Nelia Peralta, Anna Wohlers, KK McCrary, and Rose Roach. Adams is set to take over the first base position this season after the departure of Amelia Lech. Last season, Adams earned 43 starts and appeared in 50 games, splitting time between first base and designated player.\n\nAuburn softball opens the 2026 season on Thursday, Feb. 5, in Jacksonville, Florida, with a single game against North Florida. The next day, Auburn will travel to Clearwater, Florida, to compete in the NFCA Leadoff Classic. Auburn will face Notre Dame, Clemson, Michigan State, Penn State, and Pittsburgh during the three-day event.\n\nContact/Follow us @TheAuburnWire on  X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "The agreement reflects a shared commitment to ensure that anyone who wishes to train, compete, or pursue a sporting dream is able to do so.\n\nMaccabi World Union and the TOM – Tikkun Olam Makers – initiative signed a new strategic partnership last week aimed at advancing inclusive and accessible sport for people with disabilities, with a particular focus on IDF disabled veterans, ahead of the Maccabiah Games in the summer of 2026.\n\nThe agreement reflects a shared commitment to ensure that anyone who wishes to train, compete, or pursue a sporting dream is able to do so through practical, affordable, and accessible solutions. The partnership is expected to extend beyond the 2026 Maccabiah and continue toward the Paralympic Games in 2028.\n\nMaccabi World Union, the largest Jewish sports organization in the world and the organizer of the Maccabiah, will work alongside TOM, an Israeli–international initiative dedicated to developing low-cost solutions for people with disabilities. Together, the organizations will develop tools and technologies that enable participation in sport, particularly for IDF disabled veterans. These solutions will be made freely available worldwide through TOM’s platform.\n\nThe collection of solutions will be named after Professor Sir Ludwig Guttmann, a Holocaust survivor and widely regarded as the father of the Paralympic Games, and will be presented during the Maccabiah. An international innovation conference on inclusive sports is also planned ahead of the opening of the Games.\n\nAs part of the initiative, TOM and Maccabi World Union will collaborate with the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization, Beit Halochem rehabilitation centers, the Paralympic Association and Committee, and additional bodies to identify barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in sport and to map needs directly from the field.\n\nThe development of solutions for the wounded is part of a joint initiative with the Rehabilitation Division and MAFAT at the Ministry of Defense, and the Casualties and Disabled Soldiers Department of the IDF (Personnel Directorate).\n\nThe partnership also includes plans to establish an innovation complex in “Maccabiah City” ahead of the 2026 Games, featuring a “Master Workshop” where athletes and visitors will be able to observe the development of Paralympic equipment and new technological solutions.\n\nMaccabi World Union CEO Roy Hessing said the Maccabiah represents more than competition.\n\n“The Maccabiah is far more than a sporting event – it is a declaration of unity and the triumph of the Jewish spirit before the entire world,” he said. “This year, with delegations from more than 50 countries, we have an opportunity to show how Israel turns the challenges of injury into extraordinary achievements. The partnership with TOM and the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization is designed to ensure that no physical barrier prevents our heroes – men and women alike – from returning to the field. We are building a pathway that begins with rehabilitation and ends on the Maccabiah podium, rooted in a deep belief in the power of sport to build both body and soul.”\n\nTOM founder Gidi Grinstein said the collaboration would have a global impact.\n\n“This collaboration with Maccabi World Union will create the largest portfolio of solutions in the world for participation in sport by people with disabilities,” he said. “It is a true breakthrough for IDF disabled veterans and for people with disabilities in Israel and around the world. Israel is among the global leaders in rehabilitation, and we are proud to contribute to that leadership together with Maccabi World Union and Jewish communities worldwide. For us, this is a mission and a partnership with one of the most significant Jewish organizations in the world.”",

    "fullText": "It was reported in December that Chelsea had included an option in Aaron Anselmino’s loan to recall him in January if they so desired, and today, five days before the transfer deadline, they have opted to do so.\n\n🚨 EXCL: Chelsea trigger clause to recall Aaron Anselmino from Borussia Dortmund loan. #CFC evaluating CB market + want 20yo back from #BVB to consider next steps. Same option on Sarr but Acheampong likely to stay – sale viewed as impossible @TheAthleticFC https://t.co/B7gqHU51OC\n\n— David Ornstein (@David_Ornstein) January 25, 2026\n\nThis is a pretty significant blow to BVB, who have had success with Anselmino on the field. That said, he has struggled for fitness, and has had limited minutes, but in his time on the pitch he has shown himself to be a mature-beyond-his-years, impactful central defender. There have been growing calls from within the BVB fanbase to explore an option to make permanent Anselmino’s loan, despite there being no buy option for BVB at the end of the term. That term has come to a premature end, however, and any deal for Anselmino in the summer will be based on a much more limited pool of data in Black and Yellow.\n\nWhy are Chelsea recalling Anselmino? I dunno. What, do you come to this sports blog for sports information?\n\nI would suspect Chelsea’s new head coach, Liam Rosenior, is either dissatisfied with his current defensive core, or feels the line is too thin with current injuries. Since taking over, he has rotated Benoit Badiashile, Trevoh Chalobah, and Wesley Fofana in a four-man chain. Levi Colwill is out with an ACL tear, and Tosin Adarabioyo has a thigh problem, but looks on track to return in a couple weeks. To be fair, Wesley Fofana is always moments away from his next injury, so I could see making the case that the defensive cover is not watertight. Still, Chelsea have been pretty stable at the back since Rosenior took over (despite shipping three goals to Arsenal).\n\nUltimately, this is another blow against Sebastian Kehl, who has come under increasing scrutiny this season for the quality of the squad. BVB are now short a defender, and will need to act quickly if they intend to replace him. Niki Süle has been reliable since returning from injury, as has Emre Can, but both are out of contract in the summer. Anselmino’s loan seemed a good way to test trial a significant future replacement, but that opportunity is now ended.\n\nDo BVB need to sign cover at center-back before the winter window ends? Let us know in the comments.",

    "fullText": "Now that the Vegas Golden Knights have had the opportunity to decompress, they can finally put all of their focus on the task in front of them.\n\nOn Sunday, the Golden Knights will hope to keep the good vibes around the team continue when they face the Ottawa Senators.\n\nVenue: Canadian Tire Centre, Kanata, ON, Canada\n\nThe previous game carried severe emotional weight, with Mitch Marner returning to face the Toronto Maple Leafs and being chastised by his hometown fans. However, the team rallied behind their new star and put together a convincing effort in arguably the biggest win of their season so far. All of that is now in the past, and Marner and the Golden Knights can now look to keep their status atop the Pacific Division intact.\n\nHere is how they can continue their march to the postseason in Canada’s capital.\n\nDespite recent struggles, the Senators are still clicking offensively.\n\nBefore Sunday’s slate, the Senators sit in 12th in goals per game with a 3.22 clip. They have a top-ten power play (22.9% success rate) and have a number of stars who can make magic happen in the offensive zone. The Golden Knights will have to hone in on these threats and play a responsible defensive game any time the Senators have their best players on the ice.\n\nSimilar to the Golden Knights, the Senators have not exactly had the best of luck in the goaltending department this season.\n\nWith Linus Ullmark currently out on a personal leave of absence and Leevi Merilainen’s season-long struggles, the goaltending duo that was in Vegas back in November is out. In their place are James Reimer and recently recalled Mads Sogaard, neither of whom inspire much confidence. The Golden Knights took advantage of a shaky goaltender situation in Toronto last time out, and keeping the offense rolling is paramount if they want to do it again.\n\nOn paper, everything seems to be trending in favor of the Golden Knights.\n\nThe Golden Knights have won eight of their last ten games, while the Senators have lost seven of their last ten. However, one of those losses for Vegas came at the hands of the Philadelphia Flyers, who entered the game in the exact same situation. This could easily devolve into a trap game for the Golden Knights, so they need everyone on top of their game to get a much better result this time out.",

    "description": "So long and thanks for all the wins.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s tailgating or homegating, fans of the Buffalo Bills are known to be elite tier when it comes to food. Wingin’ It returns for it’s eighth season of Mad Hatter-esque recipes, taking inspiration from the Buffalo Bills and their opponents.\n\nThe departure of Sean McDermott brought a lot of mixed emotions. Interestingly, the vast majority of those mixed emotions stem from the football side of things. I know it’s not universal, but the vast majority of Bills fans have nothing against Sean McDermott the person, and most of folks have a lot of gratitude for the things he did accomplish in his time here. He didn’t win the big one, but he sure as heck won a lot of the littler ones and gave Bills Mafia a whole lotta fun along the way.\n\nI wanted to post a thank you for all the great times he helped bring to us as fans and what better “Skarekrow way” to do that than a special edition Wingin’ It? So what exactly do we have here?\n\nI did a little digging and the Buffalo Bills had posted a little information on getting to know Sean McDermott early on in his tenure here. Apparently, his favorite food is brownies and ice cream. I can do that. Wouldn’t it be great to go a step beyond though? McDermott grew up in the shadow of Philadelphia, and the research began. A candy called “Irish potatoes” was new to me, and I felt it would be just the right thing to add to my sundae.\n\nIrish footballs. One sundae in exchange for many Sundays. Thank you Sean, best wishes unless you’re playing against Buffalo.\n\nMakes: Between 40-50 candies\nActive Time: 20 min\nTotal Time: About 60 min\n\n5 oz mascarpone cheese\n4 Tbsp softened butter, unsalted\n1/4 tsp salt\n1 tsp vanilla\n4 cups confectioners sugar\n2 cups toasted coconut\n\n2 tbsp ground cinnamon\n2 tsp ground red pepper (optional)\n\nCream mascarpone and butter together with salt and vanilla.\n\nAdd confectioners sugar and thoroughly mix in (if using a stand mixer, feel free to go big on this step, a little air whipped in won’t hurt anything).\n\nScrape mixture into large bowl and chill for about 30 min.\n\nCombine cinnamon and red pepper in the smaller of two bowls.\n\nRemove mixture from fridge; roll into little football shapes (see below for one tip).\n\nRoll in cinnamon/pepper mixture until fully coated.\n\nRepeat steps 6 and 7 about 40 -50 more times.\n\nFeel free to enjoy immediately, but make sure to refrigerate leftovers.\n\nThe original candy, Irish potatoes, uses cream cheese, rather than mascarpone, and shredded coconut that has not been toasted. I went with the flavors I prefer. The toasted coconut also has a little more crunch than chew. The red pepper zing is of course the Buffalo twist.\n\nAs for tips, I have one big one if you’re worried about shape. I have two pictures of the same two footballs. In the first, it’s before it’s coated with cinnamon/pepper. Notice how the shape is a little more elongated than it needs to be. I rolled them by using the bowl and shaking it. That compacts the tips and that initial elongation helps get things closer to “right” during this step. You can make subtle adjustments after rolling and get them even closer.\n\nThey’re probably still going to look a little like potatoes, which is why the candy is called that, but that’s okay too.",

He doesn’t look out of place at all among the regulars.\n\nThe final round will see him tee it up alongside Scottie Scheffler and Si Woo Kim—a massive opportunity for the teenager to test himself against established names.\n\nHe’s also shown plenty of composure throughout the week, playing smart and staying patient when things weren’t falling his way early on. That kind of maturity is rare for someone so new to this level.\n\nIf he can pull it off, he’ll become the youngest PGA Tour winner since Charles Kocsis won the 1931 Michigan Open—a remarkable feat for any player, let alone one still new to life on tour.\n\nJustin Rose has had a remarkable career, and his list of achievements speaks for itself.\n\nHis US Open title, Olympic gold medal, 26 professional wins, and seven Ryder Cup appearances highlight an impressive resume.\n\nThe 45-year-old has managed to stay relevant at the top level of the game for a long time, which is no small feat.\n\nBut his early days in professional golf were far from easy.\n\nAfter turning pro in 1998, he missed 21 straight cuts and struggled to find his footing on tour.\n\nRose made the leap into the pro ranks right after finishing T-4 at The Open Championship at Royal Birkdale in 1998.\n\nThat memorable hole-out on the final green is still fresh in many minds.\n\nRose began that Sunday fifth on the leaderboard and climbed to fourth with a strong round of 69 in very tough conditions.\n\nAfter shooting a 68 in Saturday’s third round of the American Express, Blades Brown finished the day tied for second and matched a 28-year PGA Tour record originally set by Justin Rose.\n\nHe’s now the first player aged 18 or younger to be inside the top five after three rounds of a PGA Tour event since Rose did it at The Open in 1998.\n\nJustin Ray, who is known for his detailed golf stats, shared this information on his official X account:\n\nBrown’s run at the American Express has been nothing short of remarkable.\n\nMatching a record that Justin Rose set nearly three decades ago really shows how well he’s played this week.",

    "fullText": "It’s a scary thought for the NFL that Drake Maye hasn’t necessarily reached his full potential.\n\nMaye can conclude his second season with a Super Bowl appearance if the New England Patriots defeat the Denver Broncos on Sunday. The 23-year-old quarterback is also an MVP finalist after completing 72 percent of his passes for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns.\n\nCapturing a Lombardi Trophy could help establish Maye as one of the league’s premier signal-callers. When asked how good he could become during CBS’s pre-game coverage of the AFC Championship Game, former Pro Bowl offensive lineman Kyle Long declared that the sky is the limit.\n\n“There is no ceiling,” Long said. “From a physical standpoint, from a personality standpoint, from a toughness standpoint, he checks all the boxes.”\n\nMaye endured an uneven rookie campaign for the 4-13 Patriots, but they’ve reversed that record behind an improved roster. Long celebrated Maye’s maturation alongside a bolstered supporting cast and praised the North Carolina native’s humility.\n\n“He’s proved it all season long,” Long added. “He’s unbelievably accurate, but I think the thing that stands out the most … his personality. He’s got an ‘Aw shucks’ about him.”\n\nMaye has been far from perfect this postseason, losing three of six fumbles and throwing an interception in each game. However, he also averaged 9.2 yards per pass attempt in a 16-3 win over the Los Angeles Chargers and tossed three touchdowns against the Houston Texans’ No. 1-ranked defense in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nSurviving another stout Broncos defense could help Maye quickly stamp his place in Patriots lore and continue his ascension to superstardom.\n\nHow Patriots Would Make NFL History With AFC Championship Game Win Vs.

    "description": "Postgame press video after Purdue falls to Illinois.",
    "fullText": "It was the Keaton Wegler show in Mackey Arena.\n\nThis is one that stings because Purdue’s defense was completely out of sorts, but the Boilers were still in control up 4 at the final media timeout. For the second straight game an individual player completely disrupted anything Purdue tried to do defensveily and he either scored or dished off at key moments into wide open threes. The consecutive threes from Tomislav Ivisic, Jake Davis, and David Mirkovic quickly erased the lead Purdue had and proved to be the difference in the end.\n\nSome thoughts before postgame video.\n\nKeaton Wegler absolutely dogwalked Purdue.\n\nJust atrocious defense all day. All the switches were off and Illinois was shooting practice threes because there was zero effort to deny Wegler the ball if he had it. Purdue could not defend him straight up with anyone and by the end they were so scared of him Illinois was able to get whatever it wanted on switches.\n\nFletcher Loyer and Trey Kaufman-Renn are officially slumping. There is no doubt about it. TKR had just two rebounds today and Loyer is so shaken offensivel yhe has become a true liability.\n\nGood minutes for Omer Mayer today. I like what I saw off the bench from him.\n\n33-19 on rebounds. At home in Mackey. Second chance points were 18-2. Yuck.\n\nIt is very concerning that this was the second straight game where Purdue tightened up and lacked that killer instinct when it mattered most.\n\nI’ll say it: The season is in danger of slipping away. Purdue will make the tourney, but the Nebraska, Michigan, and Michigan State games are basically must wins now and we need some help. We also have to go into the lion’s den of Assembly Hall on Tuesday while they celebrate their football title. The Big Ten isn’t lost yet, but the vibes are WAY off.\n\nBraden was Braden, but he is getting no help right now. We start three All-Americans, but Loyer and TKR are shadows of themslves.\n\nThat said, slumps happen. Iowa State is really, really good and htey dropped two in a row. There is time to right things and the weapons are there, but they have got to figure it out. That’s what Painter gets paid a lot of money for.\n\nI don’t have much else to say. We were never going undefeated in the league and the top 5 teams are so good that getting through all four unscathed was unlikely, but this was the first of those four and at home. With 11 games left you’re looking at probably 9-2 down the stretch to win the Big Ten and get a 1 Seed. Right now we’re probably a three. I’d rather have our slump now than in six weeks, but Purdue has to play better. We know it can.\n\nOscar Cluff, Braden Smith, & Trey Kaufman-Renn",

    "description": "All the latest news regarding the Philadelphia Eagles’ search for a new OC.",
    "fullText": "Now that the Eagles have closed the book on the 2025 NFL season, they have turned their full attention to filling their vacant offensive coordinator position.\n\nThe Eagles have reportedly given some OC candidates certain assurances that they would have autonomy over the offense, and Howie Roseman and Nick Sirianni confirmed as much in their end-of-season news conference. Sirianni said it was too early to know exactly how things would be structured because there’s a variety of candidates they’ll consider, but said there wouldn’t be any interference.\n\nHere’s everything we’re hearing regarding their search and who they are bringing in for interviews.\n\nJan. 23: The Eagles have completed an interview with Dolphins senior passing game coordinator Bobby Slowik for the OC job, per report.\n\nJan. 21: The Eagles reportedly completed an interview with Matt Nagy on Wednesday — the former Chiefs OC and Andy Reid’s former intern/assistant in Philly from 2008-2012 hadn’t been linked to the Eagles OC job yet, but it’s encouraging that the team is exploring all options.\n\nJan. 21: Mike McDaniel is officially off the board after agreeing to move forward as the Chargers OC, but reports confirmed on Wednesday that the Eagles did have a lengthy virtual interview with McDaniel before he took the other job.\n\nJan. 20: Considered one of their top targets, Brian Daboll is set to formally interview with the Eagles on Tuesday, according to reports.\n\nJan. 19: The Eagles are expected to interview former Bucs OC Josh Grizzard on Monday, according to Jordan Schultz.\n\nJan. 18: The Eagles completed an interview with Jim Bob Cooter on Saturday, per reports. Colts head coach Shane Steichen has been open to consider letting Cooter go elsewhere for a play-calling opportunity.\n\nJan. 17: Jeremy Fowler of ESPN reported that the Eagles completed an interview with Giants interim head coach/OC Mike Kafka. The former NFL quarterback played for Philadelphia in 2011 and played in four games, but injuries and an impressive Mike Vick derailed his career.\n\nJan. 16: The Eagles first OC interview was with Falcons OC Zac Robinson.\n\nJan. 24: There hadn’t been any connection publicly, but reports on Saturday indicated the Eagles had interest in Steelers OC Arthur Smith, but he’s choosing to leave the NFL and move into the same role at Ohio State, instead.\n\nJan. 24: Just a day after interviewing with the Eagles, it was reported that the Dolphins are instead promoting passing game coordinator Bobby Slowik to their vacant OC position.\n\nJan. 22: The Buccaneers are set to hire Zac Robinson for their OC job — he was the first formal interview the Eagles had during their search, but has a connection to Tampa Bay QB Baker Mayfield.\n\nJan. 21: Just a day after interviewing with the Eagles, the latest report claims Brian Daboll would prefer the Bills head coaching job, and if that doesn’t work out, he’d prioritize the Titans OC job over the role in Philly.\n\nJan. 20: Jeff Darlington reaffirmed that the Eagles pursued Mike McDaniel as a top OC candidate, but ultimately he is choosing to stay in Los Angeles after his interview on Tuesday and become the Chargers new offensive coordinator.\n\nJan. 19: The Lions are hiring Cardinals OC Drew Petzing — he wasn’t connected with the Eagles job, but Mike McDaniel was an option for Detroit, so Miami’s former head coach could still be a candidate for Philly.\n\nJan. 17: Early in the Eagles OC search, reports surfaced that former Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski would be someone the team considers, but he’s headed to Atlanta to be the new Falcons’ head coach instead.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nJan. 25: The Eagles reportedly requested to interview Cowboys OC Klayton Adams, but Dallas blocked the request.\n\nJan 22: With many candidates already off the board, the Eagles asked permission to bring in Bears OC Declan Doyle for an interview, per reports.\n\nJan. 20: Mike McDaniel has removed his name from consideration for the Browns head coach job, but is still a candidate for the head coaching role for the Ravens and Raiders. He also still plans to interview for the Chargers OC job, and is also considered the lead option for the Bucs OC job. None of this means McDaniel doesn’t end up in Philly, but he’s taken a lot of interviews, and none of them have been with the Eagles.\n\nJan. 18: The Eagles have requested to interview Dolphins passing game coordinator Bobby Slowik for the OC job, per Adam Schefter.\n\nJan. 18: Multiple reports confirmed that Brian Daboll will interview with the Eagles.\n\nJan. 17: Jeff Darlington reported on Saturday that Mike McDaniel will interview with the Eagles for the OC job at some point.\n\nJan. 17: The Eagles are giving an extended look at Brian Daboll for the position, according to Connor Hughes of SNYtv.\n\nJan. 17: The team requested to interview Colts OC Jim Bob Cooter, former Eagles consultant from 2021. Cooter has worked with Doug Pederson in Jacksonville, and Shane Steichen in Indianapolis since helping Nick Sirianni’s staff in Philly.\n\nJan. 16: Sources told Bleeding Green Nation that the Eagles will be interviewing former Ole Miss OC Charlie Weis Jr. and have been interested in meeting with him since before the end of the season.",

It is found on recently solidified lava flows produced by Kīlauea and Mauna Loa.[1]\n\nCaconemobius fori is a small cricket, approximately 9 mm (0.35 in) in length.[2] It lacks wings but is capable of jumping significant distances when disturbed. This species is darkly colored with an overall shiny quality, causing them to blend in extremely well with the freshly solidified lava that makes up their habitat. They have been noted to look very similar to the volcanic glass ejecta Pele's tears which occur in their habitat.[3]\n\nCaconemobius fori is endemic to recently cooled (on the order of decades) lava flows on the big island of Hawai'i. It is one of the first species to colonize a lava field after its formation, arriving even before any significant plant life can take hold. It is unknown where the crickets occur once a lava field has been colonized by plant life.[4]\n\nOnce enough time has passed for any significant plant life to colonize a lava flow, C. fori disappears from the habitat.[3] This species has never been recorded as occurring within 15 m of any established vegetation. In contrast, it has been found as close as 100 m from an active volcanic vent.[3]\n\nCaconemobius fori is a strictly nocturnal species.[3]\n\nAs C. fori is one of the first arrivals after a lava flow is formed, the species relies entirely on windblown debris for food, including plant material and sea foam.[3] Nearly constant winds over fresh lava fields can carry debris multiple kilometers from its source, providing a source of nutrition for these crickets.[3]\n\nWhile C. fori can be found at night on lava fields without any equipment, it is apparently especially attracted to cheese, which is used by researchers to bait pitfall traps in order to study this species.[2][3][4]",

    "title": "Interest in Law School Is Surging. A.I. Makes the Payoff Less Certain",
    "description": "The number of applicants has risen more than 40 percent over the last two years, despite new limits on student loans and uncertainty over how artificial intelligence will affect legal work.",
    "fullText": "For decades, the American law school has served as a popular hedge against a cooling economy. When the “Help Wanted” signs disappear, the “J.D.” applications surge.\n\nThat’s what is happening now. The number of U.S. law school applicants for the 2026 cycle is up an estimated 17 percent from last year, according to data from the American Bar Association compiled by the Law School Admission Council. That figure is a staggering 44 percent increase from just two years ago.\n\nBut for this new wave of aspiring lawyers, the safety of the ivory tower comes with a steep entry fee and a shifting floor. Between new federal loan caps and the looming shadow of generative artificial intelligence, the legal profession’s newest recruits are walking into a high-stakes gamble that looks very different from the one their predecessors lost after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEnrollment rose to 52,404 by 2010, a 7 percent jump from three years earlier. Many of those students didn’t enter the legal careers they may have envisioned; about half of 2011 law school graduates were not working in full-time jobs that required a law degree within a year of graduation.\n\nThe job prospects for lawyers have since greatly improved, with more than 80 percent of students who graduated in 2023 and 2024 working in jobs that require their legal credentials within a year, according to the American Bar Association.\n\nBut the flocks of people applying to law school face new risks.\n\nNew limits on student loans that go into effect this year could make financing a degree more expensive. And artificial intelligence threatens to bring major changes to the industry, affecting which jobs are available and how much they pay.\n\n“It’s too early to know how things will change,” said Kellye Testy, the executive director of the Association of American Law Schools, which has more than 170 members.\n\n“Some worry that A.I. will decrease demand for lawyers,” she said, adding that eventually the technology could have a more direct role in legal work. “That could matter in three years,” she said.\n\nIn 1985, going to law school at a private university cost on average about $8,000 a year, according to the Law School Admission Council. Now the average cost is about $60,000 a year at private universities — and a still hefty $32,000 a year at public ones. At some law schools, tuition and annual living expenses exceed $110,000.\n\nFinancing that big bill is about to get more expensive. Stricter limits on student loans, which were passed as part of President Trump’s tax and spending law last year, go into effect in July. They impose a yearly limit of $50,000 for students seeking professional degrees, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.\n\nAlternative financing options like private loans can have higher interest rates and more restrictions than federal direct loans, said Susan Bogart, director of financial aid for Penn State Dickinson Law, where the cost of attendance will be about $90,000, according to its website.\n\nDuring a surge of applications, law schools may also pull back on the discounts they offered to entice promising students when applicants were scarce.\n\nIt can be difficult to estimate how well the investment in a law degree will pay off.\n\nLaw students often anticipate landing high-paying legal jobs in private law firms or corporations, where the entry-level salary can be around $225,000, according to the National Association for Law Placement. But the median starting salary for public service lawyers, for example, is around $65,000 — which can make monthly student loan payments more of a stretch.\n\nIn 2023, Stanford researchers, in collaboration with a legal technology company, announced that ChatGPT had passed the bar exam, scoring in the 90th percentile.\n\nThat claim, which other researchers later challenged, set off a wave of speculation about how A.I. would affect lawyers. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimated that year that the technology could automate 44 percent of legal work.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how new A.I. tools for lawyers, including Thomson Reuters’s CoCounsel and the A.I. legal assistant Harvey, will affect the availability of legal jobs or how much they pay.\n\nThe tools can make routine legal tasks, including document review and case research, faster. (Lawyers who have tried to use A.I. for more than that have sometimes been embarrassed by A.I.-generated briefs that cite made-up court cases.)\n\n“It’s really good at sifting through massive amounts of information and trying to pare that down a little bit,” Michael Kohagen, a lawyer in the mergers-and-acquisitions practice at WyrickRobbins, a law firm in Raleigh, N.C., told the “I Am the Law” podcast.\n\nSo far, more efficient grunt work hasn’t stopped firms from hiring new lawyers: Law students who graduated in 2024 had the highest employment rate ever, according to the National Association for Law Placement. More than 90 percent found jobs.\n\nThings could get dicier: The association also reported that law firms had hired fewer summer associates in 2024 and 2025, which it said suggested “that there will be fewer graduates employed by large firms over the next few years.”\n\nTesty said that it was possible A.I. could shrink job openings, but that it was also possible it could expand what lawyers do. “It could be used to streamline small disputes in court, for example,” she said.\n\nNeither the growing expense nor potential changes to the industry are deterring students like London Cooper, who is a political science major in her final year at Dillard University in New Orleans and plans to pursue a law degree.\n\nCooper has applied to five law schools, after carefully checking into how to afford the cost of the degree.\n\n“I factored so many things in, even looking at projected salaries for starting lawyers,” she said. But A.I. wasn’t part of her calculations. Instead, she’s banking on the more timeless appeal of a legal education.\n\n“I feel like law is one area where you can see how society really runs,” she said.\n\nIt was a different kind of Davos. At the opening ceremony, Larry Fink, an interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, took aim at the institution itself, saying it “can’t remain an echo chamber.” Climate change, once a central topic of discussion of the annual gathering, retreated to the sidelines, and where there was once talk of a shared political and economic future, President Trump instead made a laundry list of threats against other nations. Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada received a standing ovation after describing the end of Pax Americana.\n\nThe future of Greenland remains uncertain. Trump has walked back threats to use military force or tariffs to acquire Greenland and said Wednesday that he had reached a deal with NATO over the autonomous Danish territory. Proposals under discussion are said to include giving the United States a sovereign claim to its bases in Greenland and checking Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic.\n\nTikTok struck a deal for a U.S. entity. Its U.S. operations will be managed by a group of non-Chinese investors — including Oracle, the Emirati investment firm MGX and Silver Lake — which will own 80 percent of the new venture. The announcement ends a legal saga over the app’s future in the United States after a 2024 law required it to be separated from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, but some experts say the deal does not resolve concerns that China could still influence the new entity.\n\nTrump sued JPMorgan Chase over “debanking” claims. The $5 billion lawsuit, which also names Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s C.E.O., as a defendant, contends that the bank stopped doing business with Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nOther big deals: Netflix converted its $83 billion bid for large parts of Warner Bros. Discovery into an all-cash offer. Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of Trump’s effort to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed. And natural gas prices spiked ahead of a powerful winter storm.\n\nOver the next few days, early-action applicants to Virginia Tech will find out whether they’ve been admitted to the school. That’s more than a month sooner than last year — and the university says A.I. is to thank.\n\nVirginia Tech is among the first schools to use A.I. to assess college applications, of which it received 58,000 for the 2026-27 school year.\n\nPreviously, essays were reviewed by two human readers, plus a third if the scores differed significantly. This year, each essay got one initial score from an A.I. tool and one from a human, then a third read from a human as needed. The school made the change after three years of testing.\n\nJuan Espinoza, the vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech, estimates it saved his department more than 8,000 hours of work. DealBook’s Sarah Kessler talked with him about the process. The interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nHow did you make the decision to incorporate A.I. into admissions?\n\nWe were getting our decision back to students much later than other colleges and universities. So we knew we needed to accelerate the review process, but we didn’t want to get rid of the essay.\n\nLouis Hickman, an assistant professor who studies the intersection of technology and work, reached out and said: “Hey, I’ve done a lot of research on artificial intelligence, and I feel like we can help. Would you be willing to partner, just for research purposes?”\n\nAfter a third year of running it in the background, he was able to show with high confidence that the A.I. tool was operating just as strongly as our human readers.\n\nWe agreed that if we’re going to do this, we’re going to tell the world. We’re going to tell our applicants — students. Because I truly believe there’s a level of trust they’re giving us that their applications will be handled with care.\n\nOn the other side, can you tell when students are using A.I. to write their responses to their essays?\n\nWhen you feel like you’ve got something that can detect it, it’s almost immediately out of date. So I actually have very little confidence in anyone who states that they have something that can detect A.I. use. Are we even attempting to do that? No, we’re not.\n\nI tell students: “If you feel you can use A.I. as a brainstorming tool, use it. I do not think it’s in your best interest to use it to write the essays completely — it may not best represent who you are, and that would be a disadvantage in our process.”\n\nSo at some point you might have an A.I.-generated essay being read by your A.I. assessor?\n\nDo you think at any point the ability of A.I. to generate responses to questions will change the application process itself? For example, maybe essays become obsolete?\n\nAbsolutely. We don’t use recommendation letters in our process. But for some schools who continue to utilize them, I’m hearing of counselors using A.I. to write those letters.\n\nOn the surface that might bring some level of concern. But I would argue if the counselor is still able to represent that student well by using that tool, the result is going to be less time writing letters and more time talking to students.\n\nI think some people fear A.I. admissions tools will create a black box that filters you out in a way that you don’t understand and might be a mistake.\n\nThat’s where safeguards are so important. If we were solely using A.I. to evaluate the essays, not having a human read, I think we’d see a very different reception to this change.\n\nOne week each year, the world’s elite descend on Davos, a Swiss mountain town that has a residential population of about 10,000. Businesses there adjust prices accordingly.\n\nSnagging a table for two in the lobby restaurant of the Hilton Garden Inn — which is within the security zone of the World Economic Forum — cost about how much per hour this week, according to The Wall Street Journal?\n\nFind the answer at the bottom of this newsletter.\n\nThanks for reading! We’ll see you Monday.\n\nWe’d like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.",

    "description": "Remote college in 2020 didn't work for Jacob Palmer. “It felt very intangible, is the best way that I have found to say it ... It didn’t work for me. I hated it.”",
    "fullText": "Growing up in Concord, North Carolina, just outside Charlotte, Jacob Palmer was a classic academic achiever. “I was a good student,” he said in an interview with Fortune. “In high school, I participated in all types of extracurriculars, student leadership, I did a lot of public speaking. I had all sorts of friends.” But he said something changed during the pandemic. “School looked drastically different doing online classes and Zoom calls. It felt very intangible.” He said he figured out pretty quickly that online college “didn’t work for me. I hated it.”\n\nPalmer said that instead of sticking with college, he tried things out, including a stint at a FedEx warehouse for several months, and a change of scenery at his grandparents in rural Virginia, where he worked at a factory for a few months.\n\nWhen he returned home, in need of a job, his mom was putting in a hot tub and she mentioned the electrician working on it was “super passionate and loved his job.” Palmer said he sounded him out, estimating that the electrician was about 29 at the time, and Palmer liked that he worked for himself.\n\n“I had a general interest in working with my hands, fixing and making things, as well as a basic understanding of electrical theory from my time in AP Physics class,” he said. Soon afterward, he started as a full-time apprentice at a small, Charlotte-based contracting firm, earning $15 an hour at first and working his way up the ladder.\n\nHe was far from alone. Palmer’s micro-generation abandoned college in droves during the pandemic, driving 42% of an overall 15% decline in undergraduate enrollment between fall 2010 and fall 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Overall, college may have peaked, as experts have predicted a “demographic cliff” ever since 2007, when Americans started having fewer children with the coming of the Great Recession, and birthrates have not recovered since, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Palmer was part of a movement deciding to try something else instead of college.\n\n“I spent a few years just untangling the extension cords and doing the grunt work,” he said, earning hours en route to sitting for an electrical license. But even though he didn’t become a college student, he still found himself studying hard, because he had to pass his licensing exam, in January 2024. Just a month later, at 21, he opened his own business, Palmer Electrical. By the end of that year, according to profit and loss statements reviewed by Fortune, he grossed nearly $90,000. This nearly doubled to $175,000 in 2025 and he said he was “thinking $250,000 is a good goal for 2026, but my main focus is still to continue learning and make new opportunities.”",

    "description": "\"Shows our commitment.\"",
    "fullText": "Officials in the United Kingdom have escalated a crackdown on illegal car exhaust modifications, issuing steep fines and setting a new legal precedent aimed at curbing excessively loud, polluting vehicles.\n\nAccording to Car Magazine, the latest case centers on so-called \"pop and bang\" exhaust systems. These are engine-tuning modifications designed to create explosive cracking noises that have become a frequent source of complaints in residential neighborhoods.\n\nThe ruling follows enforcement action by the U.K.'s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which secured a conviction against a car tuning company for fitting an illegal exhaust and engine control unit remap.\n\nThe shop was fined about £5,800 ($7,790) after investigators found that the modified vehicle exceeded legal noise limits and failed basic roadworthiness standards.\n\nJudges ruled that tuning companies now carry a \"heavy burden\" to ensure vehicles modified for off-road use are not driven on public streets. That means cars made illegal by exhaust or emissions changes must leave a shop on a trailer and cannot be driven home.\n\nWhile the noises such engines make are annoying, that's not the only reason for this ruling. Excessive exhaust noise often goes hand in hand with increased air pollution, especially when catalytic converters or mufflers are removed.\n\n\"Everyone knows that horrific sound, when exhausts go pop and bang in the street, and cracking down on companies that fit these modifications shows our commitment to ensuring that Britain's roads remain among the safest in the world,\" U.K. Roads Minister Guy Opperman said after the ruling.\n\nDrivers themselves could also feel the impact. Authorities are testing roadside \"noise cameras\" that automatically flag vehicles exceeding legal sound limits. Police already have the power to issue on-the-spot fines, and officials say broader rollout is likely if trials prove effective.\n\nSimilar enforcement actions have taken place in the United States. In one high-profile case, COBB Tuning was hit with nearly $3 million in penalties by the Environmental Protection Agency for selling tens of thousands of illegal exhaust \"defeat devices.\"\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, those devices disabled emissions controls and caused dangerous levels of smog-forming pollution.\n\nTaken together, these crackdowns signal growing momentum to protect communities from unnecessary noise and dirty air.\n\nWould you buy a $10K car from China?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "Here’s why most US retirees with less than $2,000,000 should avoid Roth conversions",
    "description": "Roth conversions may not be right for everyone.",
    "fullText": "Roth conversions are widely considered financially advantageous. Financial advisors often recommend them, and online calculators frequently frame them as a tax-saving strategy.\n\nThe idea behind it is simple: pay taxes now to move savings from pre-tax retirement accounts into a Roth account, where funds can grow tax-free and be withdrawn later.\n\nHowever, these calculations only tell part of the story. Roth conversions are not just a tax strategy — they’re also a bet on longevity, market performance, and long-term tax rates. In other words, the strategy works best if you’re in a low tax bracket today, higher tax bracket later and live long enough to recoup the upfront taxes.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nFor many people, especially those retiring later with less than $2 million in savings, the odds of a net benefit are lower. Here’s a closer look at the risks of converting to a Roth.\n\nIf you pay taxes upfront to convert assets from a 401(k) or traditional IRA to a Roth account, the assets must grow enough to offset the taxes paid.\n\nFor example, if you convert $100,000 and pay $20,000 in taxes, it may take several years before the remaining $80,000 grows past $100,000 to recoup the tax cost.\n\nIn general, the lower the upfront tax and the longer the investment horizon, the greater the potential payoff, according to a study published by the Financial Planning Association. (1)\n\nMany financial advisors and online calculators assume a 30-year retirement, giving ample time for the conversion strategy to pay off.\n\nBut actual retirement lengths are often shorter. If you retire at age 62, your life expectancy may be about 19.6 years; if you retire at 67, it may be just over 16 years, according to the Social Security Administration’s actuarial tables. (2)\n\nDepending on the taxes paid to convert, this may not leave enough time for a substantial payoff.\n\nThe core assumption of a Roth conversion is that you’re paying taxes now to avoid taxes in retirement. But if your current tax bracket is high, the trade-off may not be beneficial.",

    "description": "According to scientists at the National Ice Center, Lake Erie is around 80% frozen over. The remaining percentage should be covered in upcoming storm.",
    "fullText": "In late January, Lake Erie has the most ice coverage out of all the Great Lakes.\n\nThe U.S. National Ice Center, which provides mariners and naval forces operating in polar, subpolar and Great Lakes regions with snow, lake-ice products and forecasts, reported a recent and rapid ice growth covering Lake Erie.\n\nLake Erie is near 80% coverage as of Jan. 23, according to the National Ice Center, and coverage is expected to increase over the coming days with the upcoming forecast. Lake Erie has greater ice coverage than the other four Great Lakes.\n\nHowever, the National Ice Center says that Lake Erie usually has the greatest maximum coverage each year since it’s shallow compared to the other Great Lakes.\n\nWeather calculations: So you're freezing? Forgive the Pa. explorer who invented wind chill\n\nOn the Erie side of Lake Erie, employees at East End Angler Bait Shop at 4702 East Lake Road report that the ice on Misery Bay and Horseshoe Pond is 7 to 9 inches thick.\n\nAccording to the National Ice Center, the thickest ice is in the western basin, west of Point Pelee near Canada.\n\nIce in this region is consistently 4 to 6 inches thick, with some areas of greater thickness.\n\nThe ice near the east basin in Cleveland is newer and thinner, with a thickness of 2 inches or less.\n\nRecently, cold temperatures have allowed for some new ice formation.\n\nThe 80% coverage was a large uptick in the month of January. Around Jan. 13, the ice coverage was only reported as a few percent with a little ice located near Point Pelee.\n\nScientists with the National Ice Center say that just select portions of the Lake Erie are left unfrozen.\n\n“Just portions of the southeastern shore and a couple areas toward the west of Long Point,” said Jonathan Edwards-Opperman, physical scientist with the U.S. National Ice Center. “However, these should freeze over in the next few days.”\n\nThere is a silver lining in the upcoming cold temperatures and snow storm. Once Lake Erie fully freezes over, the lake effect snow stops.\n\n“The ice acts as a lid, cutting off the moisture source for the lake-effect snow,” Edwards-Opperman said.\n\nA graphic provided by weather.gov shows the following:\n\nLess than 2 inches of ice is never safe to walk on;\n\n4 inches of ice can support ice fishing and walking;\n\n5 inches of ice can support small groups ice skating;\n\n6 inches of ice can support snow mobiles and ATVs;\n\n9 inches of ice can support cars;\n\nand 12 inches or more of ice can support medium size trucks.\n\nIt’s important to note that ice on the lake is never 100% safe.\n\nBelow zero: Bundle up when revisiting the coldest days in Erie County history\n\n“In addition to the information on the graphic, I would add that whenever there are strong winds, especially when blowing offshore onto the lake, there is an enhanced risk for breakup of shore fast ice under the wind stress,” Edwards-Opperman said.\n\nNicholas Sorensen can be contacted at Nsorensen@usatodayco.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Erie Times-News: Lake Erie is nearly frozen over.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump shared two screenshots of text exchanges with NATO Secretary General and the French President.\n\nThe posts show that even top-level diplomacy can become social media fodder.\n\nEnd-to-end apps can encrypt messages, but experts say technology can't protect against betrayal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has spent years using social media to bypass diplomatic norms.\n\nNow he's going a step further: posting screenshots of seemingly private messages from world leaders for millions to see.\n\nIn two posts on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump published what appear to be private messages from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nOne message, attributed to Rutte, praised Trump's actions in Syria.\n\n\"What you accomplished in Syria today is incredible,\" the message read. It also said that Rutte planned to use media engagements at the World Economic Forum in Davos to highlight Trump's work in Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine, before turning to Greenland: \"I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified his push for the US to acquire Greenland.\n\nA NATO official confirmed the authenticity of the exchange to Business Insider.\n\nAnother screenshot showed a message from Macron addressed to Trump. In it, the French president says the two leaders are \"totally in line on Syria,\" adding, \"We can do great things on Iran.\"\n\nHowever, he questioned Trump's actions on Greenland, telling him, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.\"\n\nThe French president's inner circle confirmed the authenticity of the message to Business Insider.\n\nTrump's decision to publish the texts underscores how even private exchanges between close allies — once assumed to be off-limits — can now become social media content, blurring the line between diplomacy and public performance, former political advisors and academics told Business Insider.\n\nJohn McTernan, who served as UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's director of political operations from 2005 to 2007, said Trump's decision to publish private messages fits a broader pattern of norm-breaking communication designed to project power and unpredictability.\n\nTrump, he said, has mastered social media as a political tool and uses it to bypass diplomatic protocol, signaling that he does not see diplomacy as a negotiation so much as an assertion of will.\n\n\"This is a man with no sense of protocol, which I think is part of the attraction to his supporters,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nJanice Stein, the Belzberg professor of Conflict Management and founding director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said publicly sharing private messages comes at a steep cost to trust.\n\nWhile such posts may deliver short-term gains with an audience, she said they encourage leaders to self-censor and erode confidence among counterparts.\n\nRichard Stengel, who served as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs under Democratic President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2016, took a stronger view.\n\nHe said diplomacy depends on privacy and secrecy to allow leaders to test ideas and speak candidly, and that exposing private exchanges publicly risks turning diplomacy into impulsive, performative behavior with little follow-through.\n\n\"Trump's violation of that presumption of trust and secrecy is like exploding a bomb at the negotiating table,\" he said.\n\nSome messaging apps can encrypt messages end-to-end, so only the sender and recipient can read them. This protects messages from third parties like hackers, but it can't prevent the sender or recipient from sharing, screenshotting, or publishing them.\n\nRebecca Slayton, associate professor at Cornell University's department of Science and Technology Studies, said: \"The publishing of these messages is a reminder of the limits of technology for securing communications.\"\n\nThese chats offer \"very secure communications if the sender and the recipient choose to keep their communications private,\" she said, \"but the human element is always the weakest link in security.\"",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — No more fawning praise. No more polite workarounds and old-style diplomacy. And no one is calling Donald Trump “daddy” now.\n\nEuropean leaders who scrambled for a year to figure out how to deal with an emboldened American president in his second term edged closer to saying “no,” or something diplomatically like it, to his disregard for international law and his demands for their territory. Trump's vow to take over Greenland and punish any country that resists, seems to have been the crucible.\n\n\"Red lines\" were deemed to have been crossed this year when Trump abruptly revived his demand that the United States “absolutely” must rule Greenland, the semiautonomous region that is part of NATO ally Denmark. That pushed even the most mild-mannered diplomats to issue sharp warnings against Trump, whom they had flattered withroyal treatment and fawning praise.\n\n“Britain will not yield\" its support for Greenland's sovereignty, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Several of the continent's leaders said “Europe will not be blackmailed” over Greenland.\n\n“Threats have no place among allies,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.\n\nThe tough diplomatic talk around the showdown last week in Davos, Switzerland, was not the only factor pressuring Trump. U.S. congressional elections are approaching in November amid a sinking stock market and wilting approval ratings. European leaders also are not the first to stand in Trump's way during his second term — see Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nBut the dramatic turnabout among Europe's elite, from “appeasing” Trump to defying him, offers clues in the ongoing effort among some nations of how to say “no” to a president who hates hearing it and is known to retaliate.\n\n“We want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won’t give it,” Trump told his audience at the World Economic Forum. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.”\n\nIn recent days, Europe offered abundant refusals to go along with Trump, from his Greenland demand and joining his new Board of Peace and even to what Canada's Mark Carney called the “fiction” that the alliance functions for the benefit of any country more than the most powerful. The moment marked a unity among European leaders that they had struggled to achieve for a year.\n\n“When Europe is not divided, when we stand together and when we are clear and strong also in our willingness to stand up for ourselves, then the results will show,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. “I think we have learned something.”\n\nFederiksen herself exemplified the learning curve. A year ago, she and other leaders were on their heels and mostly responding to the Trump administration. She found it necessary to tell reporters in February 2025, “We are not a bad ally,” after Vice President JD Vance had said Denmark was “not being a good ally.”\n\nTrump is transactional. He has little use for diplomacy and no “need (for) international law,” he told The New York Times this month. Therein lay the disconnect between typically collaborative European leaders and the Republican president when he blazed back into the White House saying he wanted the U.S. to take over Greenland, Panama and perhaps even Canada.\n\n“In Trump's first term, Europe didn't know what to expect and tried to deal with him by using the old rules of diplomacy, with the expectation that, if they kept talking to him in measured terms, that he would change his behavior and move into the club,” said Mark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the University of Surrey,.\n\n“It's very hard for other leaders who deal with each other through the niceties of a rules-based system and diplomatic conversation,\" Shanahan said. \"It is hard for them to change.”\n\nFive months after Trump's inauguration last year, with his Greenland threat in the air, European leaders had gotten their heads around Trump management enough to pull off a meeting of NATO nations in the Netherlands. NATO members agreed to contribute more and widely gave Trump credit for forcing them to modernize.\n\nSecretary-General Mark Rutte, known as the coalition's “Trump whisperer,\" likened the president's role quieting the Iran-Israel war to a “daddy” intervening in a schoolyard brawl.\n\nLesson 2: Consider saying no — and make choices accordingly\n\nTraditional diplomacy exists to preserve possibilities of working together. That often means avoiding saying a flat “no” if possible. But Trump's Greenland gambit was so stark a threat from one NATO member to another that Greenland's prime minister actually said the word.\n\n“Enough,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a statement shortly after Trump's remarks Jan. 5. “No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation.”\n\nThat played a part in setting the tone. Denmark's leader said any such invasion of Greenland would mark the end of NATO and urged alliance members to take the threat seriously.\n\nThey did, issuing statement after statement rejecting the renewed threat. Trump responded last weekend from his golf course in Florida with a threat to charge a 10% import tax within a month on goods from eight European nations — Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland. The rate, he wrote, would climb to 25% on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States.\n\nLesson 3: Reject Trump's big-power paradigm\n\nTrump's fighting words lit a fire among leaders arriving in Davos. But they seemed to recognize, too, that the wider Trump world left him vulnerable.\n\n“Trump was in a fairly weak position because he has a lot of other looming problems going on,” domestically, including an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision on his tariffs and a backlash to immigration raids in Minnesota, said Duncan Snidal, professor emeritus of international relations at Oxford University and the University of Chicago.\n\nCanada's Carney said no by reframing the question not as being about Greenland, but about whether it was time for European countries to build power together against a “bully\" — and his answer was yes.\n\nWithout naming the U.S. or Trump, Carney spoke bluntly: Europe, he said, should reject the big power's “coercion” and “exploitation.\" It was time to accept, he said, that a “rupture” in the alliance, not a transition, had occurred.\n\nUnsaid, Snidel pointed out, was that the rupture was very new, and though it might be difficult to repair in the future, doing so under adjusted rules remains in U.S. and European interests beyond Trump's presidency. “It's too good a deal for all of them not to,” Snidel said.\n\nBefore Trump stepped away from the podium in Davos, he had begun to back down.\n\nHe canceled his threat to use “force” to take over Greenland. Not long after, he reversed himself fully, announcing “the framework\" for a deal that would make his tariff threat unnecessary.\n\nTrump told Fox Business that “we’re going to have total access to Greenland,” under the “framework,\" without divulging what that might mean.\n\nFrederiksen hit the warning button again. In a statement, she said, “We cannot negotiate on our sovereignty.\"",

    "fullText": "The escape of thousands of salmon from an open-pen fish farm has endangered the wild salmon population in Iceland. If the escaped fish breeds with the native species, it could irreparably damage future generations of the latter.\n\nOn Aug. 20, approximately 3,500 farm-raised salmon escaped from an open-pen fish farm in Icelandic waters, per the Guardian. The farm is off the coast of Patreksfjörður, a village on Iceland's northwest coast. Arctic Fish, an Icelandic fish-farming company owned by Norwegian seafood giant Mowi, operates the facility.\n\nUnconfirmed social media posts have reported that the farm-raised salmon, identifiable by their rounded tails and torn fins, have been found in at least 32 rivers across northwest Iceland, per the Guardian.\n\nAccording to scientists, many of the escapees have reached sexual maturity. This is bad news for Iceland's wild salmon population, as interbreeding between them and farm-raised salmon results in offspring that reach sexual maturity much faster than their wild counterparts.\n\nThe accelerated rate of maturation makes it more challenging for the species to reproduce while increasing their boldness and aggression, making them more likely to die as juveniles.\n\nThe escaped fish have reached many Icelandic waterways, endangering much of Iceland's wild salmon population.\n\n\"This is an environmental catastrophe,\" Guðmundur Hauker Jakobsson, vice-chair of the Blanda and Svartá fishing club, told the Guardian. \"If they breed, the salmon will lose their ability to survive.\"\n\nAside from the threats posed by the fugitive fish, waste from open-pen fish farms pollutes surrounding waters, according to Living Oceans. Furthermore, diseases spread from fish farms can threaten wild fish populations, per Wild First.\n\nOne of the posts from the unverified social media reports even showed several fish carrying sea lice, which can be deadly to wild salmon.\n\nEnvironmentalists, hobby fishers, and politicians have once again begun to call for an end to open-pen fish farming in response to yet another incident of escaped fish in Iceland.\n\nLast year, Icelandic fish farming company Arnarlax was fined the equivalent of around $800,000 for failing to report the escape of more than 81,000 fish in 2021, per the Fish Farmer.\n\nAnd while Arctic Fish has enlisted the help of specialist divers to track down the farm-raised salmon, the company's CEO, Stein Ove Tveiten, and other board members will face up to two years in prison if they are found guilty of negligence, according to the Guardian.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "description": "Every Sunday night, my family came together for dinner. But now that both of my sons are in college and I'm an empty nester, I bring dinner to them.",
    "fullText": "In my family, Sunday was always family dinner night. Whether the Packers earned another triumphant win, a swim meet went late, or a last-minute homework assignment loomed on Monday morning, that time to eat and enjoy each other's company was an appointment that could not be canceled.\n\nWhen my two boys headed off to college, Sundays became more subdued. Yes, my husband and I opened a bottle of wine and enjoyed our dinner leisurely, but I craved more. The meal needed something; it needed that seasoning from my sons' snarky retort, a roaring laugh, and even that persistent eye roll.\n\nSince I missed our weekly family dinners, I started a monthly family pizza night across the miles.\n\nThe idea is simple: I pick a day and time, compile the orders, and everyone gets a pizza delivery at the same time. Whether it is my oldest, who wants copious amounts of meat on that slice, or the younger one, who prefers variety, I order enough for everyone — including all the roommates and friends. Then we jump on video calls and chat while we eat.\n\nThe phrase \"everyone is family at the table\" is cliché, but everyone is welcome to join. No, I do not force friends to chat, but they must appreciate my \"rules.\" It is not rapid-fire Socratic questioning, but people cannot just devour food and disappear.\n\nEveryone sends pizza photos, curious comments, and FaceTimes while we are eating. Yes, it sounds like the dinner parties people hosted in 2020, but it works. We catch up, laugh, and just have a collective moment.\n\nSure, I cannot cajole the boys as easily through a screen, but I can get a response that is more than just a one-word text reply.\n\nOf course, some people will say I'm bribing my kids to interact with me, but it doesn't matter to me. The reality is that family traditions are not just holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions. Making time for each other is vital, and food can be the catalyst.\n\nAt, around, and by the table, I have learned much about my sons over the years. It was more than excitement over a good grade or disappointment about a lost swim race. I have seen their better understanding of personal relationships, their appreciation for culture, and their interest in family history.\n\nListening to their word choices and argument construction, and even just watching them sit quietly, is far more telling than another call or text when they are away from home. I might have nurtured them with food, but they grew into the men that they are today because of our family connection.\n\nThis current pizza dinner might be a slice of what we had, but it is one that I crave even more.\n\nWhile my pizza night family dinner solution works with college kids, I look forward to keeping this tradition going long after they graduate. Whether one is in Florida and the other is halfway around the world, we can and should make our family a priority. Every overlooked opportunity is a missed one.\n\nSince pizza, or some version of flatbread, can be found anywhere in the world, there are no excuses for skipping this dinner. Even on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean, family pizza night is on the schedule. No matter how I slice it, the concept works.\n\nFor any parent looking to keep family bonds strong, creative solutions are all around. Whether it is a pizza, grandma's cookies, or a Big Mac, food is a form of communication. My family tradition tells my boys that the time we spend together nourishes me far beyond the food served on the plate.",

    "description": "If you have six or seven figures saved up for retirement, RMDs can be a real headache.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve spent decades saving for retirement, your IRA and 401(k) balances probably feel like a financial safety net. Watching those accounts grow can be reassuring. But without careful planning, even healthy retirement savings can morph into a ticking tax bomb.\n\nThat’s because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mandates withdrawals from these retirement accounts once you turn 73 (1). If you have six- or seven-figure balances, these required minimum distributions, or RMDs, can have a noticeable impact on your tax bill every year.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nHere’s why this tax bomb matters andwhat you can do to diffuse it before it’s too late.\n\nWhat makes RMDs so frustrating is that they force you to reverse decades of good financial habits. After an entire career of saving, investing and deferring taxes, it can be difficult to switch gears and start selling assets, making withdrawals and triggering tax liabilities.\n\nFailing to plan for RMDs can be expensive, especially if your retirement accounts have grown substantially.\n\nRMDs are calculated using your age and your account balance as of December 31 of the previous year. According to Fidelity, the IRS applies a life expectancy factor to determine how much you must withdraw in a year (2).\n\nFor example, if your account balance is $100,000 the year before you turn 73, the IRS uses a life expectancy factor of 26.5. That results in a required withdrawal of about $3,773.60. With a $500,000 balance, the RMD jumps to roughly $18,867.90.\n\nHigher balances trigger larger withdrawals, which can easily push you into a higher tax bracket. That extra income, combined with other sources, can increase the taxation of Social Security benefits or raise Medicare premiums through income-related monthly adjustment amounts (3).\n\nIf you fail to withdraw the required amount by the deadline, the penalty is steep. The IRS can charge 25% of the amount you should have withdrawn. Many investment platforms now offer tools that automate RMDs, helping retirees avoid missed deadlines and complicated calculations (4).",

    "fullText": "The US is experiencing a potentially historic winter storm.\n\nAs Winter Storm Fern sweeps across the country this weekend and into the start of the week, more than half of the US states are expected to be impacted by severe wintry weather, including ice, heavy snow, and dangerously cold wind chills.\n\nThe worst snowstorms in the US since the 1920s have killed hundreds of people, caused billions of dollars worth of damage, and, for many who lived through them, been impossible to forget.\n\nMany of them have been blizzards. Meteorologist David Stark told The New York Times that means winds are at least 35 mph and visibility is less than 1/4 mile.\n\nAs we wait to see the impact of this weekend's monster snowstorm, here are some of the worst snowstorms in recent US history.\n\nFrom January 27 to January 29, this blizzard, which traveled up from the southeast US and centered on Washington, DC, dropped 24 inches of snow.\n\nResidents had no warning of the storm. On January 26, the Washington Times had predicted fair weather with slowly rising temperatures, per the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nThe snowstorm was named Knickerbocker after the Knickerbocker Theatre in Washington, which collapsed because of the snow's weight on the theater's roof. The collapse killed 98 people who were inside watching a silent film called \"Get Rich Quick, Wallingford,\" and left another 133 injured.\n\nAfterward, building codes were updated to require stronger roof support structures.\n\nOn November 11, a fierce winter storm battered the Upper Midwest. Without much warning, temperatures suddenly dropped, snow began to fall, and the \"winds of hell\" — as reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel — began to blow.\n\nAs much as 26.6 inches of snowfall were recorded, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAccording to a hunter who was stranded during the storm, only the tops of telephone poles could be seen above the snow, the St. Cloud Times reported.\n\nIt came suddenly, catching people unaware, killing 49 people in Minnesota, per the Minnesota Star Tribune, and 150 in total. It also killed 1.6 million turkeys.\n\nThe storm had lasting repercussions. To help with accuracy, local weather forecasting moved out of cities like Chicago to be more local so they could provide better predictions.\n\nStarting November 24, 22 states felt the wrath of this slow-moving blizzard that the Washington Post called a \"meteorological powerhouse.\" It's also been called the Great Thanksgiving Storm.\n\nThe snowstorm covered an area from West Virginia to Pennsylvania and buried parts of it under as much as 62 inches of snow, per the National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nHigh winds with gusts of up to 160 mph knocked over trees and caused almost 1 million power outages.\n\nIt killed at least 383 people, caused hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of damage (in today's money), and became a weather prediction case study. Two cyclone researchers said it was the \"benchmark\" storm against which all other major 20th-century storms could be compared.\n\nBeginning on February 13, and going for six days, 189 inches (about 16 feet) of snow fell on Mount Shasta, California.\n\nIt holds the world record for the most snow falling in a single snowstorm, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nSince it fell on an uninhabited mountain, no deaths occurred.\n\nOn January 26 and 27, Chicago saw its highest snowfall on record, with 23 inches, along with 53 mph wind gusts.\n\nThe storm caught the city off guard, as it had experienced warm temperatures only two days earlier.\n\nThe sudden, heavy fall left 50,000 cars abandoned, shops looted, and 650 students sleeping at school because buses couldn't get through the snow. Twenty-six people died, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nFrom February 24 to February 27, snow fell in the northeast for 100 hours — or four days — straight, as reported by WBUR.\n\nOn the first day, 4 feet of snow fell on Mt. Washington, New Hampshire. Another 4 feet fell over the next few days. Boston was hit with 26.3 inches, and Portland, Maine, had 26.9.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rated this the worst snowstorm of the century based on factors including the amount of snow, the area affected, and the number of people affected. But the most important factor was its size — the storm was 4.5 times larger than the 1993 \"storm of the century.\"\n\nHowever, it's a relatively unknown storm, since much of it was outside the northeast corridor.\n\nOn January 28, a massive blizzard hit the US. Along with heavy snowfall, there were 70 mph winds.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the storm was \"a so-called perfect storm, a once-in-a-generation weather system combining an unlikely compilation of high winds, avalanches of snow and frigid temperatures.\"\n\nThis storm was brutal in Buffalo, New York, because snow had fallen for 28 days before the storm, piling up on Lake Erie, perfectly placed to be blown about. The storm remained in the region for three days, per WGRZ.\n\nSo many people abandoned their cars that one in five vehicles was illegally parked or abandoned across Buffalo. The storm killed 29 people, and six of them died in their cars, The New York Times reported.\n\nOn January 26 and 27, Ohio and the Great Lakes faced one of the worst snowstorms of the century.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, \"This once-in-a-lifetime storm will always be the standard by which the severities of all future winter storms to hit this region are judged.\"\n\nIt was a \"bomb cyclone,\" which means it developed very quickly. To get the name, atmospheric pressure has to fall by 24 millibars within 24 hours.\n\nDuring this storm, wind chills plunged to -50 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nEven though only 7 inches of snow fell in Cincinnati, it was hit hard because there were already 14 inches on the ground, and 60 mph winds channeled it into snowdrifts that towered up to 25 feet high, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported.\n\nAcross the region, motorways closed, and roofs and telephone lines collapsed. The snowstorm killed 70 people and caused about $2 billion worth of damage.\n\nFrom February 10 to 12, this snowstorm hit a wide area from Virginia to New England. In Washington, three airports, bus stations, and the subway system all had to close.\n\nIt was particularly memorable since, along with a heavy blanketing of snow, there was thunder, too.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the \"thundersnow along the Eastern Shore produced extremely strong winds and whiteout conditions.\"\n\nIt caused 25-foot waves in the Atlantic Ocean and 55 mph winds that capsized a coal-carrying boat, killing 34 people.\n\nBeginning on March 12, the US had what is commonly referred to as the worst snowstorm of the 20th century.\n\nSnow covered areas from Florida to Maine, affecting more than 100 million people. Winds reached 100 mph.\n\nThe New York Times described it as \"a monster with the heart of a blizzard and the soul of a hurricane.\"\n\nPower cuts plunged 2.5 million homes into darkness and cold. The storm killed 300 people and caused at least $2 billion worth of damage.\n\nNOAA classed it as a Category 5 storm. It was the second-highest rated snowstorm (despite its name) after the 100-hour snowstorm in 1969.\n\nIn Syracuse, New York, just under 43 inches of snow fell, while 20 inches fell through much of the northeast. It caused swells that a Coast Guard official told the Washington Post looked like \"a big washing machine.\"\n\nFrom January 6 to 10, this vicious storm forced then-President Bill Clinton to shut down the government and declare nine states and DC as disaster areas.\n\nHeavy snowfall blanketed much of the Eastern Seaboard. In one day, Virginia had 20 inches of snow, while Newark had 28 inches fall over several days, and Philadelphia had 30 inches.\n\nThe storm caught some people off guard, the Washington Post reported, since snow stopped long enough that some forecasters said it was over, only for 40 mph winds and more snow to return.\n\nBuildings, including barns and a church in Harlem, New York, collapsed. Four people died from heart attacks while clearing snow, according to The New York Times. In total, 154 people died.\n\nFor three days in February, including Presidents Day, a snowstorm caused delays and deaths across much of the Northeast.\n\nIt began as a rainstorm, before the wet weather met arctic cold air and turned to snow … a lot of snow. In Maryland, a state highway supervisor told Fox News, \"It's no man's land out there. It looks more like Siberia than Maryland.\"\n\nNew York got 19.8 inches of snow, while a lucky ski resort in Pennsylvania got 40 inches of snow. In Boston, 27.5 inches of snow fell in 24 hours, which broke the city's record for snowfall in a single day, per the National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nThe storm caused 28 deaths, and at least 2,000 flights were canceled.\n\nOn February 11 and 12, a massive snowstorm 1,200 miles long and 500 miles wide blanketed much of the country, from North Carolina to Maine, The New York Times reported.\n\nWinds reached 60 mph, up to 27 inches of snow fell, and more than 220,000 homes lost power. The storm brought thunder and lightning, too, which is known as \"thundersnow.\"\n\nHundreds of flights were canceled, and thousands were delayed.\n\nOn February 5 and 6, Washington, DC, turned white as snow fell uninterrupted for 30 hours, the Washington Post reported.\n\nJust over 32 inches of wet, heavy snow were recorded. The snow's weight caused power outages for 200,000 properties, as well as the collapse of several churches and an airport hangar.\n\nVirginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania all declared a state of emergency.\n\nIt was named \"Snowmageddon\" by a group called Capital Weather Gang, because Washington wasn't equipped to deal with so much snow. The name was solidified when former President Barack Obama repeated it.\n\nOn December 26 and 27, a blizzard blanketed New York City in up to 29 inches of snow, the New York Daily News reported at the time.\n\nWinds reached 60 mph, causing whiteout conditions, while tens of thousands of people lost power.\n\nThen-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters, \"It's hard to stand up in a 55-mile-an-hour wind, and particularly when the ground under your feet is slippery, so this really is dangerous.\"\n\nWhile it wasn't as savage as some of the other snowstorms on this list, it hit just after Christmas, causing travel chaos.\n\nBeginning on November 17 and lasting 5 days, a snowstorm battered Buffalo, New York, burying it under more than 7 feet of snow, the Weather Channel reported.\n\nHighways closed, 14 people died, and former President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration to provide federal aid.\n\nThis snowstorm was particularly cruel to Buffalo because of Lake Erie. At the time, the water was still reasonably mild. This warm water met incoming arctic air, the coldest it had been for that time of the year since 1986, and the mixture caused an extreme amount of snow to fall.\n\nIt wasn't just Buffalo, though. Temperatures in every US state fell below freezing.\n\nThis January winter storm, also known as Snowzilla, as reported by the Washington Post, affected over 102 million people and killed 52.\n\nA massive amount of snow fell: 24 million people were estimated to have come in contact with over 20 inches. Glengary, West Virginia, had the most snowfall, with 42 inches.\n\nIn North Carolina, the storm's ice and wind knocked out the power at 150,000 homes. In Delaware, wind gusts were recorded at 75 mph. New Jersey faced intense flooding, with water surging higher than it did during Hurricane Sandy.\n\nAccording to the NOAA, it was one of the most powerful snowstorms in the northeast in 60 years.\n\nThis was a rapidly developing storm in January that covered more than 2,500 miles across the US, affecting 60 million people, the BBC reported.\n\nAlong with heavy snowfall and 50 mph winds, the coast was rocked by swells, made even worse by unusually high tides. In Boston, a 3-foot storm surge smashed against the city.\n\nThe storm caused more than 1 million children to miss school, and 4,000 flights to be canceled, per The New York Times.\n\nIn late January, cold air from the Arctic descended onto North America, killing 21 people. Almost 2,000 flights were canceled, hundreds of schools were closed, and hundreds of cases of frostbite and hypothermia were reported, per The Guardian.\n\nAcross the Midwest, more than 30 cold temperature records were broken. Illinois got hit particularly hard, with the city of Rockford recording -31 degrees Fahrenheit. Wind chills in Minneapolis-St. Paul plunged to -65 degrees Fahrenheit.",

    "title": "The US military's drone-defense confusion is leaving its bases vulnerable, Pentagon watchdog finds",
    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog found confusing counter-drone policies are leaving some US military bases vulnerable to drone incursions.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon watchdog report is warning that gaps in Pentagon policy are leaving some US military bases vulnerable to drone threats.\n\nThe report, released Tuesday by the Pentagon's Inspector General, said that the military lacks consistent guidance for defending sensitive \"covered assets\" — US-based sites legally authorized to use certain counter-drone defenses — against offensive uncrewed aircraft, a problem exacerbated by jumbled, contradictory policies across the services.\n\nWhile the Defense Department has issued multiple counter-UAS policies — rules governing how the military can detect, disrupt, or disable uncrewed aerial systems — those directives are not standardized, leaving some base leaders unaware that their installations qualify as \"covered assets.\" The term refers to locations within the US that deal with sensitive missions like nuclear deterrence, missile defense, presidential protection, air defense, and \"high yield\" explosives.\n\nThat lack of awareness derived from confusing policy risks leaving bases exposed to uncrewed threats, a growing concern.\n\nThe Inspector General report examines 10 military installations where drone incursions have occurred. The watchdog assessment found multiple examples of \"covered assets\" left uncovered due to unclear policies.\n\nThe Air Force base in Arizona where most F-35 pilots are trained, for instance, is not authorized to defend against UAS incursions because pilot training does not qualify as a \"covered\" activity under Pentagon policy, despite the Air Force describing the F-35 as \"an indispensable tool in future homeland defense.\"\n\nAnother Air Force facility in California that manufactures aircraft repair parts, conducts aircraft maintenance, and makes the Global Hawk, an ultra-advanced large surveillance drone that costs more than the F-35A, has also been left vulnerable, and the site experienced a series of drone incursions in 2024, the report said.\n\n\"Air Force officials told us that the government-owned, contractor-operated facility was denied coverage during the active incursions,\" in 2024, the IG report says.\n\nThe problem extends beyond determining whether a site is covered. The process for obtaining counter-drone systems — and securing rapid legal approval to use them when needed — is complex and slow, reflecting legal restrictions on using electronic jamming or force inside the US, the report found.\n\nConcerns about drone threats to military installations have grown in recent years as small, inexpensive commercial drones have become dramatically more popular and easy to use. Such systems lower the barrier to entry on surveillance and precision strike from the state level to non-state actors and can create challenges for security personnel who are often constrained in their response options, or improperly trained and equipped to react.\n\nIn 2024, multiple bases within the US and abroad experienced strings of drone incursions, events that can involve one or more unmanned aircraft entering restricted airspace or operating close enough to installations to trigger alarms, even when the drones are not linked to foreign adversaries.\n\n\"In recent years, adversary unmanned systems have evolved rapidly,\" a Department of Defense counter-drone strategy released in the final months of the Biden administration said. \"These cheap systems are increasingly changing the battlefield, threatening US installations, and wounding or killing our troops.\"\n\nEfforts to address the drone problem have been in the works for years, though a Center for New American Security report released last September said the military's efforts were \"hindered by insufficient scale and urgency.\"\n\nSome units have received counter-drone tools such as portable \"flyaway kits\" — deployable systems meant to be moved quickly between sites — and the \"Dronebuster,\" a handheld electronic-warfare device that emits a signal to disrupt or disable an offending drone. The Army secretary recently questioned the latter system's effectiveness, underscoring broader uncertainty about how best to defend US bases from the growing drone threat.\n\nThe US military is trying to catch up with the threat, to develop defenses as fast or faster than drone technology is currently developing, driven in large part by the drone-dominant Ukraine war. As he announced the creation of Joint Interagency Task Force 401 last August, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said \"there's no doubt that the threats we face today from hostile drones grow by the day.\"\n\n\"The challenge for airspace management is how to deter or defeat such incursions without endangering the surrounding civilian communities or legitimate air traffic. That rules out everything kinetic,\" Mark Cancian, a defense expert and retired US Marine Corps colonel, told Business Insider in late 2024 during a series of incursions.\n\n\"This has become a huge problem for both military and civilian airfields and will get worse and drone usage proliferates further,\" he said.",

    "title": "Everything a heart health dietitian eats in a week, including plant-based protein sources and 'joy foods'",
    "description": "Lena Beal, a cardiovascular dietitian, eats mostly whole, plant-based foods throughout the week. Sundays are for treats like sweet and alcohol.",
    "fullText": "As a registered dietitian, Lena Beal first learned about nutrition from her own family.\n\n\"My great-grandparents were farmers, so they grew nearly everything they ate, made their own preserves, the whole thing,\" Beal, a cardiovascular dietitian at Piedmont Atlanta Hospital and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Business Insider.\n\nHer roots inspired her profession. \"It was generational wisdom,\" she said. \"The foods that give us the most nutrients, the most pleasure, they're the most sustainable and practical.\" In her own life, she focuses on a minimally processed, plant-packed diet, incorporating chicken, fish and eggs on occasion.\n\nStill, it doesn't mean there isn't room for flexibility.\n\nOnce a week, Beal eats what she calls \"joy foods\": things she enjoys, like sweets and alcohol, which are best consumed in moderation. A Christian, Beal links joy foods to her Sabbath, or day of rest.\n\nEating her joy foods on Sundays is her version of the 80/20 diet, helping her stay on track with eating mostly heart-healthy foods — with the occasional treats. \"That way, I can enjoy them intentionally, but without feeling like I'm constantly negotiating with myself,\" she said.\n\nBeal shared what she eats in a week to get enough protein — and what a typical Sunday of fun looks like.\n\nGiven her focus on cardiovascular health, Beal said she has always focused on heart-healthy foods to keep her fueled throughout the day.\n\n\"It's subliminal,\" she said. \"Those things are extremely important to me: making sure I have hearty, fiber-rich, high-omega-3 foods with those macronutrients.\"\n\nOn a typical day, her meals look like this:\n\nShe focuses a lot on protein because she works out at least 3 to 4 days a week, including resistance training, brisk walking, and yoga. She said her target is reaching 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week, the recommended goal for most people.\n\nHer diet helps her stay on track. \"Because my eating pattern is relatively consistent, it supports strength, energy, and flexibility,\" she said.\n\nBeal was never interested in intentionally following a strict vegan or vegetarian diet. Instead, her diet evolved over the past eight years to naturally involve less red meat.\n\n\"I wasn't a heavy red meat-eater in the first place.\" she said. \"I no longer enjoyed it. It was heavy for me.\" Having it once a week was easier for her because it didn't feel like much of a sacrifice.\n\nOn occasion, she'll eat leaner animal-based protein sources like chicken or turkey during the week, which have less saturated fat.\n\nWhen Sunday rolls around, she doesn't exactly go all out on sugar or cocktails, either. She still aims to stick to her normal habits, like eating a light dinner, because it ties into better sleep.\n\n\"I don't go too far out of bounds,\" she said. Treating herself might look like French toast, a mimosa, or fish in a richer cream sauce than she would pick during the week.\n\nIt's been the easiest way to keep a balance in her life. Beal, who's taught weight management classes in the past, said that words like \"diet\" or \"cheat foods\" can bring up a lot of negative feelings for people.\n\n\"I shy away from that language,\" she said. \"I call them 'joy foods' because they absolutely fit if you leave room for them intentionally.\"\n\nBeal takes a few supplements — vitamin D and iron — based on recommendations her doctor made, given her age and medical history.\n\nOtherwise, she gets all her nutrients from her diet, which she feels is easy to maintain because she eats whole foods she loves during the week, while being flexible enough to enjoy a sweet treat or glass of wine, too.\n\n\"Healthy eating works best when it leaves room for living,\" Beal said. \"It ought to feel like when you get up from a meal that you have good feelings, whether it's nostalgic, whether it satiates you. That's what food is.\"",

    "title": "I got laid off from my tech job and retired in France at 69. Starting over is hard, but I love my life here.",
    "description": "Sandy Adams has always loved France. But it wasn't until she was laid off from her tech job at 69 that she decided to move there and retire.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sandy Adam, 69, who moved from Pittsburgh to Chatou, a suburb of Paris, in 2025. The essay, which also incorporates quotes from emails between Adam and Business Insider, has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy connection to Europe developed over a lifetime. Like many Americans, it began by studying French in high school. I had pen pals in both France and England, and later, when my children were young, we hosted a French student in our home for six weeks. Europe always felt familiar and aspirational.\n\nProfessionally, I spent most of my career working for global companies. But in 2013, I took my first personal trip to Paris and fell completely in love with its architecture and art. While I was there, I took a cooking class to learn how to make macarons and visited Giverny and Versailles.\n\nThat experience reshaped how I imagined my future.\n\nI was kind of forced into retirement in 2025. I was laid off from my tech job and started looking around to see what I should do next. But it's hard to get a job in the US when you're over 50 — much less at my age — so I decided to retire.\n\nAround that time, moving to Europe started to feel more practical. I was living just outside Pittsburgh in a wealthy tax district, and my property taxes kept rising. I owned a 1,700-square-foot, three-bedroom colonial on about a quarter-acre lot that I bought for about $224,500 in 2017. In 2025, my property taxes were about $6,900.\n\nI asked myself: If I tried to live off Social Security, could I afford to stay in that house? I probably could, but it would be really tight. Long-term, though, the financial predictability felt increasingly uncertain — my everyday living expenses, like groceries, were going up too. I wanted to simplify my life, with fewer fixed costs and fewer surprises.\n\nI also wanted a more purposeful life. To me, moving to France meant being able to do more and learn more about history, architecture, and how people live differently from the way we're raised in the US.\n\nI wasn't looking for luxury or escape in France, but for a more grounded and intentional life, one that was rich in experience rather than centered on consumption.\n\nI was also drawn to the European model of daily life: walking as a default, using trains to explore, and having easy access to multiple countries and cultures.\n\nBefore I moved to Europe, I sold my home for $365,000. I used some of the equity from the sale to help fund the move. I'm also on Social Security right now, and when I moved, my monthly benefit was $3,608.\n\nI came to this realization not too long ago: not having a paycheck is a big deal. It took me a while to fully accept that Social Security is my paycheck now, and that my 401(k) and investment portfolio stabilize everything.\n\nI landed in Paris with my dog Phoenix in September and live in the western suburbs, in a town called Chatou.\n\nChatou feels like something out of a Hallmark movie. It's a cute, charming town with beautiful cobblestone streets. You can walk beneath tall trees that form a canopy of leaves overhead, and I can hop on a train and be in central Paris in about 20 minutes.\n\nThe community is a mix of young and older residents, though I'm noticing it skews a bit older. It's also a very wealthy area; the homes here are stunning, at least from the outside.\n\nThe apartment I live in is about 548 square feet. It's a one-bedroom, and it's plenty of room for my dog and me. I pay $1,679 a month, and while it's a little expensive for me, it gives me a soft landing while I figure out where I ultimately want to settle down.\n\nBefore moving to France, I was taking French classes through Carnegie Mellon's online program. I also attended tons of webinars to help establish myself. But I will say this: even if you're prepared, unexpected things still happen.\n\nWhen I got here, my first experience was finding a doctor to refill a prescription. I signed up for Doctolib, got a referral from the local pharmacy, and booked an appointment. The people at the pharmacy didn't speak any English, but fortunately, my French was barely good enough to get by.\n\nThe first few months living in a new country can be exhausting. There's always something new you have to do, another form to file, or another process to start.\n\nFor example, I applied to exchange my driver's license because Pennsylvania has an agreement with France that allows you to do that, but it required a lot of paperwork, like birth certificates, and there were a lot of forms, and I needed translations.\n\nThere's just a lot that keeps you very busy when you move.\n\nStill, I guess I'm lucky that it's just my dog and me. If I had a family and children, I could only imagine how much more overwhelming it would be.\n\nI wondered how I was going to make friends in France.\n\nI told myself I'd join organizations, but I didn't do that right away. One day, I was in the grocery store and overheard two women speaking English. I said out loud, \"Oh, I hear English, it's music to my ears.\" They came over, and it turned out they were au pairs here in Chatou.\n\nOne of them and I became friends; she's 22, and we do a lot together, like running errands and shopping. She has her own social life with other young people, but we still try to get together about once a week.\n\nI also posted in a local Facebook group looking for people to do dog playdates, because I think the move was harder on my dog than it was on me. Through that, I met a nice couple from the UK who are here for three years, and now we hang out and do things together.\n\nI'm also teaching myself urban sketching. I recently found out there's an Urban Sketchers group that meets in Versailles once a month, and I'm planning to go. I'm sure I'll meet more people that way.\n\nIn the US, I felt resolved, though not necessarily excited, about what I thought my life would be.\n\nMy lifestyle was about putting money into things. I'd think, \"Oh, I'll buy a new TV,\" or \"Oh, I'll buy a new couch.\" Here, I'm using my money differently: I bought an annual pass to the Louvre, I'm buying art supplies as I learn to paint, and I just bought a new guitar.\n\nIn France, I wake up happy every day. Retiring abroad feels like a natural extension of the interests and values I have been forming for decades, and is exactly how I want to spend this next chapter of my life.\n\nSometimes, I wonder how long I can afford to live in France. I also imagine what it would be like to move back to the US. I have a son there, and I'm thinking about how to leave him an inheritance.\n\nBut honestly, I don't really see myself moving back. In the US, my life just felt more reactive. It happened around work and obligations. While I still value my ties to the country and its people, I don't feel the same pull to return to that default rhythm.",

    "description": "These systems could still be effective in the right hands or situation. At the same time, the US and allies have a history of success against them.",
    "fullText": "US forces that executed a raid in Venezuela to capture its now-former leader walked away with no aircraft lost to the country's Russian-made air-defense systems and Chinese-made radars.\n\nIn the aftermath, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that it \"seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\" He didn't elaborate any further, but in briefings, the top US general spoke about how US forces dismantled and destroyed enemy air defenses.\n\nWhile the US can draw a certain degree of confidence in its capabilities from the success of the mission, there's a risk of reading too much into that success, especially when it comes to weapons made by American rivals in the hands of other militaries.\n\nSome of the failures of the Venezuelan-operated foreign air defenses, for example, have been attributed to issues like inactivity, incompetence, and a dearth of functional cohesion between different systems.\n\nWins in Venezuela during Operation Absolute Resolve or in operations against Iranian-operated Russian-made air defenses may not translate the same in fight with Russia or China.\n\nThe US operation in Venezuela to capture former president Nicolás Maduro and his wife earlier this month was a large, complex undertaking involving over 150 aircraft, including a mix of F-35 and F-22 stealth fighters, F/A-18 jets, EA-18 electronic attack jets, E-2 airborne early warning planes, bombers, and other aircraft, including drones.\n\nAs the apprehension forces approached the fortified target facility at Fuerte Tiuna, a military installation in the capital Caracas, US aircraft began striking Venezuelan air defenses to open a corridor for helicopters flying at low altitudes along a preset path. Planners expected significant resistance, but the air defense network capitulated under overwhelming US pressure.\n\nThe US used a mix of tools to knock out the air defenses, including AGM-88 anti-radiation missiles that home in on radar systems and electronic jamming. Victory may not have come solely from American combat power though.\n\n\"The Venezuelan crews were apparently unprepared as they located many air defense positions in the middle of fields rather than under camouflage,\" Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider. Those systems were vulnerable to US forces.\n\nThere were other problems, as well. After Operation Absolute Resolve, some reports suggested Venezuela didn't have some systems connected to radars when US air power arrived for the operation. \"That's stunning fecklessness,\" Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said.\n\nLong-standing issues within Venezuela's air defense network, particularly regarding maintenance and sustainment of its Russian air defenses and Chinese radars, has been noted by experts and analysts, revealing serious shortcomings with regard to the condition of its defense technologies.\n\nSo what exactly can Western militaries discern from the performance of Russian and Chinese systems in Venezuela? It is difficult to say with certainty, at least with the information presently available in the public discourse.\n\nBefore the US assault operation, the Venezuelan military was assessed to have Russian S-300VM batteries, Buk-M2 systems, S-125 Pechora-2M launchers, and Chinese YJ-27 radars. Last November, a Russian lawmaker said that Moscow had delivered new Pantsir-S1 and Buk-M2E systems to Venezuela. It's unclear which systems were operational at the time of the US raid.\n\nVenezuela also possessed Chinese-made YJ-27 radars, which are used to detect and determine engagement procedures for hostile air targets. Beijing has touted these systems as state-of-the-art, asserting that they can detect stealth assets like the F-22 and F-35 from over 150 miles away and are resistant to jamming.\n\nSobolik told Business Insider that what matters more than these claims is how systems perform in a real conflict. The radars, like the Russian-made defenses, appear to have been of little use.\n\nThe US and its partners have thwarted Russian-made air defense systems in other conflicts as well. Israeli airpower, for instance, defeated Russian air defenses in Iran. The US did the same when it launched Operation Midnight Hammer and struck Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nLike the Venezuela mission, these were extensively planned operations involving significant force against weaker export variants operated by potentially insufficiently trained operators. Russian air defenses have been more effective in Ukraine, though there have still been combat losses, even for advanced systems like the S-400.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that these systems can handle low and medium threats but not the most challenging attacks represented by the United States and Israel,\" Cancian said. That said, US and allied airpower have not been tested against the full capabilities of Russian and Chinese integrated air defense networks.\n\nFacing these considerations, Houston Cantwell, a retired US Air Force brigadier general and expert at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, told Business Insider that maintaining the technological advantage and preserving combat readiness are essential to securing the upper hand.\n\nA key example, he said, is the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, which \"has proven time and time again that it gives its warfighters an advantage in the air\" and \"lowers the risk to the warfighter while providing more options to the political decision makers.\"\n\nContinued proficiency in maintaining and operating advanced aircraft like the F-35 is expected to give the US an airpower advantage over adversary air defenses. To what extent the Venezuela mission reflects that edge, though, is unclear.",

    "fullText": "Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo pushed back on the narrative being advanced by FBI Director Kash Patel about Saturday’s shooting death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti at the hands of a border patrol agent in Minneapolis.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday Morning Futures, Patel defended the border patrol’s tactics and questioned Pretti’s motives.\n\n“Secretary [Kristi] Noem stated perfectly, you do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions,” Patel said. “You do get to do that in Minnesota, L.A., or anywhere else.”\n\nPatel added, “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines. That is not a peaceful protest, and you do not get to touch law enforcement. You do that anywhere, this FBI is going to be following — leading the charge to arrest those.”\n\nBartiromo, though, was skeptical of Patel’s argument.\n\n“But how was he threatening Border Patrol?!” Bartiromo asked. “You’ve collected the evidence, you said, right? You have the handgun in your possession. And how was he using that handgun in terms of threatening Border Patrol? What was the threat? He had his camera, right? He was filming it.”\n\nPatel — following the pushback — grew much more cautious in his assessment.\n\n“That’s something that I let the DHS and the prosecutors — because they are the ones investigating that case, I don’t want to stylize that evidence,” Patel said. “But I trust the men and women on the ground who are trained professionals to only use it when it’s absolutely necessary. And I trust Secretary Noem’s leadership and DHS, and HSI to do the right thing, as they’ve always done in these scenarios.”\n\nBartiromo then questioned when Border Patrol agents spotted a weapon on Pretti.\n\n“Kristi Noem said that the individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun,” Bartiromo said. “Was the gun visible, or did Border Patrol see the gun after they shot him?”\n\n“Again, all those pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS and HSI, and I don’t wanna comment on their ongoing investigation,” Patel said, demurring.\n\n“I understand,” Bartiromo replied. “But you have the evidence. What can you tell us about the evidence you collected?”\n\nThe answer, it turned out, was precious little.\n\n“It’s sent to our FBI laboratory, where it’ll be finger-pristed,” Patel said. “We’ll use ballistics examination toolkits to see if any casings were fired. And we’ll examine all the casings that were found on the scene.”\n\nThe post ‘How Was He Threatening Border Patrol?!’ Fox’s Maria Bartiromo Pushes Back On FBI Director Kash Patel’s Claims About Shooting of Alex Pretti first appeared on Mediaite.",

Ice accumulations of a few tenths of an inch can make roads slick, and local power outages are possible where ice burdens trees and lines. If accumulations are lower, an icy glaze would be the main issue.\n\nHouston TranStar is reporting the following icy roadway locations:\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation has a map that shows icy road locations and other hazards.\n\nMonitor local weather broadcasts and check the latest conditions from the National Weather Service before hitting the road. To monitor real-time road conditions in your area, visit Drive Texas or check specific traffic updates for Houston (or via Houston TranStar), or call (800) 452-9292.\n\nIf you must drive in inclement weather, allow additional time to reach your destination and share your travel plans with a friend or family member, so someone knows the route you’re taking.\n\nWhen driving on icy roads, drive slowly and increase the distance between your vehicle and others when stopping. Do not use cruise control during poor driving conditions and ensure your vehicle has a full tank of gas before you head out.\n\nSafety officials tell Texans to be aware and approach bridges and overpasses slowly as ice can accumulate before drivers are able to see it on the roads. Drivers should also watch for downed trees and power lines. If a stoplight is out, treat the intersection as a four-way stop.\n\nSafety officials ask Texans to keep a well-stocked emergency kit with warm clothes, food, water, cell phone battery/charger and first aid items.\n\nFind more tips in this driving safety guide.\n\nWith severe winter weather on the way this weekend, you should have a way to get important updates if the power goes out.\n\nThe FOX LOCAL app will allow you to stay up to date with livestreams, the latest forecasts, news stories and weather alerts in real time, all from your mobile phone or tablet.\n\nYou can also \n\nSeveral Houston-area school districts have opted to stay closed on Monday.

    "description": "The killing of Alex Pretti, a US citizen, by ICE in Minneapolis on Saturday has drawn sharp responses from many Americans, including business leaders.",
    "fullText": "Federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a US citizen in Minneapolis — the second fatal shooting involving ICE officers this month — adding more fuel to an already explosive national debate over immigration enforcement.\n\nThe killing sparked an outcry on Minneapolis streets, as well as online, eliciting sharp responses from all sides, including leaders in the business and tech communities.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, for instance, wrote in a post on X that it was \"time to take the temperature down before more lives are lost.\"\n\nMinnesota officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, criticized the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for what they said were overly aggressive tactics. The DHS, meanwhile, defended its agents, arguing that they are being provoked by unruly protesters and an uncooperative city government and police.\n\nThousands of ICE officers began descending on Minnesota on December 1 as part of Operation Metro Surge. The DHS says it is targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state and has deployed over 2,000 ICE agents across Minnesota.\n\nResidents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been protesting since the federal immigration agents arrived. Those demonstrations grew more intense after the first fatal shooting on January 7. In that incident, ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good, 37, as she tried to drive away in a car.\n\nHere's how business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest violence.\n\nThe hedge-fund billionaire called for calm in an X post on Saturday, lamenting that the United States had reached a point where \"there are only two sides to every issue and every incident.\"\n\n\"Individuals are 'convicted' of serious crimes in the headlines, by politicians appealing to their base, and ultimately in the minds of the public, or they are exonerated, before all of the facts are in and a detailed investigation has been completed,\" He wrote. \"This is not good for America.\"\n\nJust two hours later, in another post on X, Ackman laid the blame on Minnesota's state government.\n\n\"It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protesters to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner,\" he said, tagging Walz. \"Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences.\"\n\nLike Ackman, billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman is perpetually online, posting frequently on social media. He has been largely quiet this weekend, though he has reposted comments from other people, including one that called ICE \"out of control.\"\n\nIn another post that Hoffman amplified, an X user called out \"chronically online tech leaders\" for suddenly falling quiet. Another X user called on business and tech leaders to use their platform to stand up to the Trump administration and its immigration enforcement tactics, to which Hoffman replied, \"It's time for all Americans to do so.\"\n\nJeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, wrote in response to a video of the shooting circulating on X: \"This is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nMinneapolis police confirmed that Pretti, who was filming ICE agents when they wrestled him to the ground, was legally carrying a gun.\n\nBorder Patrol officials said Pretti had threatened them with the gun, but multiple videos of the incident show that agents had already disarmed and subdued Pretti when he was shot.\n\nJason Calacanis, a prominent investor and entrepreneur who is these days perhaps most known as one of the hosts of the popular \"All-In\" podcast, blamed the country's political leaders in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\"Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us,\" he wrote. \"True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents.\"\n\nHe later posted that \"all of this violence\" could be avoided by fining businesses that hire immigrants who are not in the country legally.\n\nCristina Cordova, the chief operating officer at Linear, a product management software company, called the incident \"indefensible\" in a post on X.\n\n\"The victim's legally owned handgun was removed from the scene, and then ICE agents shot him multiple times. It's far from law enforcement — it's just murder,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Those who defend this don't care about law or order. It's about money, power, and protecting an executive branch that's already been bought and paid for.\"",

Now, even more studies suggest it has benefits beyond the gym, helping bolster the brain to support mental and cognitive health.\n\nFor less than 50 cents a serving, it's the gold standard of evidence-based health hacks, with an impressive resume of potential perks.\n\nWant to start taking creatine? Here's how it works, and the best way to use it for peak performance, according to top researchers.\n\nLong a staple of the sports world and bodybuilding community alike, creatine has been extensively studied as a fitness supplement for decades. It first caught on in the '90s thanks to Olympians who swore by it for elite athletic competition.\n\nSince then, researchers have consistently found that it's safe to use and offers a small but significant boost to performance.\n\nIt works by providing extra fuel in the body's energy cycle. That translates to better gains or faster fat burning if you're working out, since you can power through more work that you might otherwise.\n\nThat makes it a standout performer in the supplement aisle. Creatine has much stronger evidence and broader benefits than products like pre-workouts, which can vary in ingredients and often don't disclose what's actually included.\n\nIt's also distinct from protein shakes and powders, which offer the same nutritional benefits as food, but in a more convenient format. There is some creatine in foods like meat and fish, but it's much harder to get than protein — you'd have to eat more than two pounds of steak to get the amount of creatine in a single scoop of supplement powder.\n\nOther supplements are less evidence-based, less reliable, and can have more risks, particularly when bought online via grey-market websites.\n\nThe only supplement that comes close to challenging creatine in terms of wide-ranging benefit and extensive research is caffeine. While caffeine can boost workouts and is relatively safe in moderate doses, it can have serious side effects in large amounts, so you're better off having a coffee than a concentrated supplement.\n\nCreatine can have side effects like digestive upset, which is typically mild, temporary, and linked to higher doses.\n\nIt's also safe for your wallet. Even with past shortages, creatine monohydrate tends to be the cheapest form, especially if you buy it pure instead of mixed into complicated pre- or post-workout blends.\n\nTo take creatine, researchers typically recommend a dose of between 3 to 5 grams a day (people with larger bodies need more). However, emerging studies suggest the brain can benefit from higher doses. Scott Forbes, a sports science researcher and professor at Brandon University, said he recommends around 10 grams a day for cognitive health.\n\nStill, despite all the potential benefits of creatine, it's not a panacea. No supplement, no matter how well-researched, can match the benefits of healthy lifestyle factors such as nutrition, sleep, and consistent exercise. Trainers recommend starting with high-value habits such as these first before trying supplements.\n\nOnce you're nailing your workouts, diet, and recovery, creatine may be just the thing to give your routine an extra edge.",

    "description": "Ina Garten's healthy and hearty winter minestrone soup is packed with colorful vegetables. It's easy to make and perfect for a chilly day.",
    "fullText": "To make 6-8 servings of Garten's soup, you'll need:\n\nGarten's recipe requires a lot of prep, but it makes a lot of soup. And all those veggies make the broth so hearty and comforting.\n\nIf you can, recruit a loved one or friend to help you chop everything — just bribe them with leftovers.\n\nI added 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the pot, which was placed over medium heat.\n\nThen I added the pancetta, cooking it over medium-low heat for about six minutes until it had lightly browned.\n\nI threw my chopped onions, carrots, celery, squash, garlic, and thyme into the pot.\n\nGarten says it's best to use fresh thyme if you can because it \"really makes a difference.\"\n\nGarten says you should cook the mixture for eight to 10 minutes, until the vegetables begin to soften.\n\nGarten recommends using her homemade chicken stock, which I didn't have time to whip up for this dish.\n\nI will confess that the soup's broth wasn't very exciting or rich with store-bought stock. You could add some chicken bouillon to amp up its flavor, but nothing will taste as good as the homemade stock. It's worth the extra effort!\n\nI added 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 ½ teaspoons of freshly ground black pepper to the pot.\n\nGarten says you should allow the mixture to simmer until the vegetables are tender, so I let my soup simmer for an additional 15 minutes.\n\nGarten says you can use a fresh or dry bay leaf for this recipe.\n\nMake sure you drain and rinse the cannellini beans before adding them to the broth.\n\nGarten recommends adding two more cups of chicken stock if you're unhappy with the consistency.\n\nGarten recommends tossing the spinach with two big spoons to help cook the leaves until they've wilted in the broth.\n\nGarten says you should select a nice white wine that you'd want to drink for this recipe.\n\nThis is also where you should add the pesto if you're using it. (I skipped it because my sister is allergic to pine nuts.)\n\nI was happy with the saltiness of my soup, but Garten recommends adding another teaspoon or two if you feel the broth needs more.\n\nGarten's winter minestrone soup is a much-needed burst of color on a cold and dreary day. I loved seeing the rainbow of hues from all the vegetables — the soup couldn't have looked more inviting.\n\nI'm a huge soup fan. I love soup so much that I'm even in a group chat dedicated to sharing photos, recipes, and daily appreciation for soup and its various forms (shout-out to my soup girlz). But minestrone has never been my favorite.\n\nGarten finds a way to infuse this often lackluster soup with flavor. The taste of the tomato shines through, adding a richness to the broth that's amplified by the final touch of Parmesan and olive oil on top. All the veggies tasted delicious and maintained their texture, even when I ate leftovers a few days later. I also enjoyed the burst of freshness from the spinach and thyme, and how the soup still tasted healthy and light.\n\nWinter is a tough season for everyone. So, if you're under the weather or just feeling blue, I recommend a bowl of Garten's colorful winter minestrone soup.",

    "fullText": "Men's Big Bash League 2025-26 final, Optus Stadium, Perth\n\nSydney Sixers 132 (20 overs): Payne 3-18, Richardson 3-32\n\nPerth Scorchers 133-4 (17.3 overs): Marsh 44 (43), Allen 36 (22); Abbott 2-19\n\nPerth Scorchers won by six wickets\n\nPerth Scorchers secured a record-extending sixth men's Big Bash League title with a dominant six-wicket win over Sydney Sixers in the 2025-26 final.\n\nAfter being put into bat, the Sixers were dismissed for 132 off the final ball of their 20 overs, with former England seam bowler David Payne taking an impressive 3-18.\n\nChasing 133 to win, Scorchers openers Mitchell Marsh and Finn Allen put on 80 in 8.2 overs to set the hosts on course for victory at Perth's Optus Stadium.\n\nThe Sixers slightly checked their progress on a tricky pitch, made tougher for batting by rain earlier in the day, but a mighty six by Josh Inglis down the ground sealed an emphatic title win in front of a raucous crowd of 55,000.\n\nThe Scorchers had finished top of the group stage with the Sixers second, meaning they faced other in the Qualifer, with Perth comfortably winning that game to guarantee a home final.\n\n\"A great tournament, to win the first one to set up a home final was the best we played,\" said Australia all-rounder Marsh.\n\n\"We're really fortunate to have a group that have pretty much grown up together, we pride ourselves on our cohesion and we've won a lot of close games. It is an incredible franchise.\"\n\nPerth have now won six of the 15 editions of the BBL, claiming their first title in the 2013-14 season.\n\nThe Sixers are the second most successful BBL franchise, with three titles, and crushed defending champions Hobart Hurricanes in the Challenger to reach this final.\n\nBut losing the bat flip proved vital, with the pitch particularly tough to score on at the start, which was delayed by five minutes because of rain.\n\nAfter Daniel Hughes fell for seven at the end of the second over, fellow opener Steve Smith tried to counter, but was dismissed for 24 off 13 balls when he was trapped lbw by Aaron Hardie.\n\nGloucestershire left-armer Payne, who was named player of the final, then ripped through the middle order, removing Josh Philippe, Lachlan Shaw and captain Moises Henriques to leave the Sixers 95-5 in the 15th over.\n\nAustralia fast bowler Jhye Richardson's 3-32 and 2-29 from Mahli Beardman ensured there was no late onslaught, with Ben Dwarshuis run out attempting two off the final ball.\n\nMarsh compiled 44 off 43 deliveries and Allen struck 36 off 22 to set the Scorchers on their way, with the four wickets they lost - Sean Abbott claiming 2-19 - proving mere consolation for the visitors.\n\nWith the run-rate not an issue, Australia wicketkeeper Inglis' composed 29 not out off 26 led Perth to their target with 15 balls to spare.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "The most popular posts on r/animalid are exotic lizards and rare birds – but it’s the haziest trail cam screenshots that feel the most dangerous, the most spectacular\n\nRead \n\nI spent the first decade of my life in Vancouver Island, Canada, in an area rich with parks, lakes and forests. Deer would occasionally wander into our neighbourhood and nibble on the blossoms in our front yard. In that neck of the (literal) woods, mountains and deer also mean cougars.\n\nMy sister and I would play at a local park, then walk home along a track parallel to a dense forest. My older sister, being three and a half years ahead of me in life and therefore lightyears ahead of me in wisdom, would helpfully declare that if we encountered a cougar it would attack me, not her, as I’m the smaller prey.\n\nOlder siblings are nothing if not educational, so frequent park outings meant frequent reminders of my potential death. The butterflies in my stomach would whirlpool then drop to a flutter each time we neared the top of the street away from the woods. Was it fear? Yes. Excitement? That too. Disappointment? Strangely, also yes. We never once spotted a cougar.\n\nThere’s a subreddit that fosters this particular combination of excitement and fear, r/animalid, where users share photos of unfamiliar wildlife for others to identify. The most popular posts are colourful lizards and rare birds: YAWN. SNOOZEFEST. For me, the top-tier posts have little engagement at all: I’m looking for poor-quality photos with a handful of comments. I’m talking trailcam snapshots with captions like “this wolf has been stalking my family” accompanied by several comments of “that is a coyote with mange”. And, reader, it’s always a coyote with mange.\n\nWe’ll see a blurry photo of a rat which the poster insists is not a rat, actually, despite its size, shape, colour and rat-like behaviour. Another post depicts a small generic turd with fervent requests for identification of the creature it escaped from. Or perhaps a doorbell camera catching a cougar walking past someone’s house at night. A cougar?! Those ones make me bolt upright in bed, phone screen pressed against my eyeball. A real-life cougar?! Those lucky bastards. Except … it never is a cougar, merely a fat tabby. Or a coyote with mange.\n\nFew people in this sub are clout-chasers; they are simply hopeful and curious. There is a distinct earnestness that comes with posting a photo of a blurry blob with helpfully added scribbles pointing at said blob. We squint and wonder if that blob is dangerous. Or even an animal.\n\nExtreme sports, illicit drug taking, dating emotionally unavailable and annoying artists: humans long for thrill, even if – or because – it’s dangerous. This subreddit allows us to microdose that adrenalin rush in everyday encounters, turning them into Rorschach tests. Every print in the snow becomes a potential bear. We’re reminded that, in those rare places humans haven’t destroyed, we are not the apex predators – nature is. Maybe something greater and more powerful than us was here, mere moments ago.\n\n“That is very clearly a human footprint,” people might rush to comment. But still the original poster remains hopeful.\n\nEveryday life can be very ordinary and this subreddit exemplifies our desire for some extraordinary spectacle. What if that pigeon actually was a hawk? What if, today, the rat in my bathroom wasn’t a rat, but something more exotic, or even sinister? I’m thrown back to childhood: what if just once – only one single time – a mountain lion actually did emerge from the forest and attack me? Not fatally, but enough for me to be The Girl Who Survived A Cougar Attack. God, what a rush.",

    "fullText": "The 37-year-old ICU nurse was killed helping another ICE victim. We must honor his sacrifice.\n\nOn Saturday morning in Minneapolis, federal agents murdered 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an Intensive Care Unit nurse at a local Veterans Authority hospital. Pretti was trying to help a woman whom federal agents shoved violently to the ground. A fellow ICE observer, the woman flew a few feet through the air and landed hard; it had to hurt. “Are you OK?” Pretti asked her, according to bystanders. Those were his last known words. He kept trying to help the woman, and the agents kept trying to stop him, finally shooting him in the head at close range, execution style, and then at least nine more times. (You can see videos, and a still photo of his execution I wish I hadn’t seen, all over social media.) Pretti died on the scene.\n\nThe last Minnesotan murdered in the federal occupation of Minneapolis, just more than two weeks ago, was Renee Good, a mother, a poet, and a lesbian, whose last words to her murderer Jonathan Ross were, “I’m not mad at you, dude,” as she smiled at him. According to his own phone video recording, Ross’s first words after he shot Good were “fucking bitch.”\n\nMuch has been written about the misogyny behind the murder of Good, as well as the defamation of her wife, Becca. The Department of Justice is investigating Becca Good, not Ross, for her alleged activist ties. Renee seemed to die for the crime of being a happy lesbian with a spunky wife who was confronting ICE, respectfully, and with humor. In Becca’s last words before her wife’s murder, she told Ross to take a lunch break.\n\nFederal law enforcement officials are smearing Pretti, just like they did Good, claiming he was “brandishing” a weapon. (He was legally carrying a holstered pistol.) Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called him a “domestic terrorist,” and Border Control commander at large Greg Bovino, the mini-Nazi, said he tried to “massacre law enforcement.” Multiple videos from multiple angles showed their claims to be slanderous lies.\n\nHow do we make sense of Pretti being murdered for coming to the aid of another female ICE victim? We don’t. Maybe it’s a coincidence, maybe it’s related. We know the fascists don’t want white people standing up for immigrants and other people of color, who are the main victims of Operation Metro Surge (and all the other perversely named federal invasions, including Maine’s revolting “Catch of the Day,” as though immigrants are fish to be caught and killed.) And apparently, they don’t want men coming to the aid of the women they assault.\n\nBut it was not lost on Pretti’s devastated parents that he died “while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper-sprayed,” they said in a statement. They wanted us to know that fact. “Please get the truth out about our son,” they added. “He was a good man.”\n\nAlex Pretti was a good man at a time when very bad men are running our country.\n\nRight-wingers from Nazi Stephen Miller to the former Project Veritas fraud James O’Keefe keep insisting that Minneapolis ICE observers like Pretti and the Goods are being paid. You know why? Because the right wing has an infrastructure of billions of dollars available to fund lying scum like “videographer” O’Keefe to malign liberals and the left. They cannot conceive of the genuine, spontaneous mutual aid and support we see in Minneapolis, and in other American cities, like Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, and most recently, Portland, Maine. Neighbors are coming to the aid of neighbors—many of them white people coming to the aid of Black and brown people, immigrants and citizens alike, who are being snatched off the streets, mostly illegally, by masked invaders sent by Trump. They do their laundry, they bring them food, they walk their children to and from school so they can stay at home and try to stay safe (although that strategy is failing as ICE agents increasingly hunt their prey door to door).\n\nTrump, an adjudicated rapist, has declared, “I cherish women.” The entire right-wing project to strip women of their rights, to thwart their progress in the workplace, to keep them out of combat, is often defended as an effort to protect women, when of course it’s intended to restore women to their “rightful” place as breeders and tenders of children and helpmates to men.\n\nPretti is being remembered on social media as a dedicated VA nurse who always spoke up if he thought his female colleagues on the wards were being disrespected. He was chosen to honor a veteran he tended after the man died. (The veteran’s grateful son posted the tribute to Facebook.)\n\n“Today we remember that freedom is not free, that we have to work at it, nurture it and protect it, and even sacrifice for it,” he read to a small memorial in the hospital ward. Pretti did that work, and he sacrificed for our freedom. Let’s honor his sacrifice by stepping up our efforts to stop this lawless assault on immigrants, people of color, and democracy itself.",

    "fullText": "UFC 324 went down last night (Sat., Jan 24, 2026) inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, ushering a new pay-per-view (PPV)-less era for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), which also signaled the beginning of its partnership with Paramount+. In the main event of the evening, Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett put on a show for 25 minutes, which ultimately resulted in a unanimous decision win for “The Highlight,” giving him the interim Lightweight title in the process (highlights here). In the co-headlining act Sean O’ Malley got back to his winning ways by defeating Song Yadong via unanimous decision (see it again here).\n\nIt was far from a walk in the park but Gaethje did enough to win the interim strap by defeating a tough foe in Pimblett after five rounds of back-and-forth action. For 25 minutes, Gaethje came out like a bat out of hell throwing big bombs every chance he got trying to put “The Baddy” away. To his credit, Pimblett took a lot of big shots and still stayed in the pocket and delivered some of his own. But it was Gaethje who got the better of the exchanges throughout the fight, dropping “The Baddy” a few times and busting up his face all night. With the win, the power-punching Lightweight wins his second interim belt and locked down a title unification bout against division king, Ilia Topuria, later this year.\n\n“Suga” needed a win in a bad way coming into his fight against Song Yadong because he was on a two-fight skid — both defeats against Merab Dvalishvili — and a third straight loss would have meant a title fight would be hard to come by. But O’ Malley looked rejuvenated after his time off, sticking to what brought him to the big show by using his reach, footwork and striking to get in and out while getting his licks in. Yadong did have a few good moments but once “Suga” found his groove it was all downhill for the Chinese-born contender. With the win O’ Malley has a glimmer of hope to get back into the championship picture, though he will likely need one more win to get there.\n\nHonorable Mention: Waldo Cortes-Acosta\n\nThe UFC’s Heavyweight division has a new threat to the throne on its hands after “Salsa Boy” secured one of the, if not the, biggest fight of his UFC career after knocking out Derrick Lewis in the second round (highlights). Cortes-Acosta pretty much pitched a shutout, proving to be too quick for “Black Beast,” showing off his speed to evade his foe’s big bombs. He was light on his feet all night and used it to get in and out, dropping the big man and then eventually finishing him off with some vicious ground-and-pound. He is currently ranked No. 5 in the division, so we can expect him to move up a spot or two following his latest conquest.\n\nLewis put on one of his most dreadful performances against Cortes-Acosta, failing to put up any offense in what truly was a puzzling showing for one of the most dangerous and entertaining fighters in the history of the sport. He could not find his range all night, though that was in large part to “Salsa Boy’s” quickness and footwork. Lewis kept overextending on his shots and all he caught was air for the most part. In the second round, Cortes-Acosta tagged Lewis with a soft jab that may or may not have been the reason he fell to the canvas, as the broadcast team was adamant he slipped. Once there, Lewis was like a fish out of water because his foe started unloading on him until the referee stepped in to put an end to a dreadful fight. The loss snaps Lewis’ two-fight win streak and has many wondering if his heart is in it anymore.\n\nFor more UFC 324: “Gaethje vs. Pimblett” news and notes be sure to hit up our comprehensive event archive right here.",

    "title": "From Rams star to sommelier: Vince Ferragamo turned football lessons into life achievements",
    "description": "Vince Ferragamo was the first quarterback to lead the Rams to the Super Bowl, a feat that continues to be a source of pride and motivation for the longtime SoCal resident.",
    "fullText": "The sixth in an occasional series of profiles on Southern California athletes who have flourished in their post-playing careers.\n\nIt’s been nearly four decades since Vince Ferragamo took his last NFL snap and most of his football exploits have been eclipsed by the passage of time.\n\nThe 509 passing yards he had in a 1982 loss to the Chicago Bears, most in an NFL game in 31 years? It’s been bettered 14 times. The club-record 30 passing touchdowns in 1980? That’s now seventh on the team’s single-season list.\n\nBut there’s one milestone no man, not even Father Time, can ever take away from Ferragamo. At the end of the 1979 season, he became the first quarterback to take the Rams to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe team has returned to the NFL championship game four times since then. A Rams’ win over the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday's conference title game will keep alive Matthew Stafford’s chance to become the first quarterback in franchise history to win the Super Bowl twice.\n\nFerragamo, however, got them there first.\n\n“There was just something so mystical about the whole thing,” says Ferragamo, who made his first NFL start that season.\n\nHe competes in a different arena now, managing a mortgage company and an eponymous real estate firm. He and his wife, Jodi, have helped raise millions for a variety of local charities and they also grow the grapes for their boutique wine label on 230 vines next to their home in central Orange County. The transition from the gridiron to the regular grind has been seamless.\n\n“Football prepares you for life beyond football,” he said. “More than anything it adds credibility to my work. They have to trust you. We’ve built our whole company around that.”\n\nFerragamo’s football career also depended on earning trust. Although he was tall and blessed with a strong right arm, Ferragamo had to win over critics everywhere he played, beginning in high school where he had to convince his brother, the coach, he should start.\n\nAfter two years at Cal, where he had to share playing time, Ferragamo transferred to Nebraska and became an All-American. Yet the Rams waited five picks and four rounds before selecting him in the 1977 draft, then handed him a clipboard and told him to find a spot on the bench.\n\n“There was a lot of trials and tribulations. A lot of ups and downs,” Ferragamo said. “But I think it teaches how to live life that way. Because every day you wake up with struggle.”\n\nYet for one glorious two-month stretch in the winter of 1979-80, the struggle was over and Ferragamo was arguably the best quarterback in the NFL, engineering one of the most improbable playoff runs in Rams history.\n\nAfter starter Pat Haden was injured and rookie backup Jeff Rutledge proved ineffective, Ferragamo took over a team with a losing record. He was supposed to just finish out the season; instead, he carried the Rams to four consecutive victories.\n\nHe led the Rams to road playoff wins over Dallas and Tampa Bay, the first time in franchise history the Rams had won two playoff games in the same season.\n\n“He began to show us that he had the arm to make the plays,” said Hall of Fame offensive tackle Jackie Slater, Ferragamo’s longtime teammate. “That’s when everybody began to rally to give the young guy as much support as we possibly could.\n\n“Everybody kicked it up a notch. And that’s what makes a good quarterback right? His leadership brings that out of you, makes you all a little bit better than you might have been without him.”\n\nIn the Super Bowl, played before nearly 104,000 people at the Rose Bowl — still the largest crowd to attend a Super Bowl — Ferragamo had the Rams leading heading into the fourth quarter before the Pittsburgh Steelers rallied to claim their fourth championship.\n\nHe won just one more playoff game, retiring seven years later following a career that took him to four cities and two countries — but just one Super Bowl.\n\n“I don’t really have any regrets when I look back on my career,” Ferragamo, 71, said earlier this month, surrounded by football memorabilia in his second-floor corner office in Anaheim Hills. “If everything was just carte blanche and just easy for you, it wouldn’t be worth living. So there’s always a challenge.\n\n“The ups and downs, maybe that’s what kept me going.”\n\nFerragamo, the youngest of four children, grew up in Wilmington, which was a gritty, working-class city in the 1960s, much as it is today. His father, Vince Sr., a World War II veteran who dropped out of the school in the eighth grade, was street smart and tough, working his way up to union president of UAW local 923 at Ford’s sprawling Pico Rivera plant.\n\n“He was a great role model for me,” Ferragamo remembered. “We were the only Italian family in the neighborhood. It was, you know, tough, tough beginnings. It makes you desire and appreciate things and help others.”\n\n“That’s what football is,” he added. “If I can help my receiver look good, we all look good.”\n\nAnd Ferragamo certainly looked good when he threw a football.\n\n“When he was about 14 years old, he’d go out in the front of the house and he’d throw the ball from one light pole to another. It’s a long way,” said Chris Ferragamo, Vince’s eldest brother and his coach and Banning High.\n\n“He loved doing that kind of stuff. That’s how he started his throwing ability.”\n\nStill, Chris, who would go on to win eight City Section titles at Banning, already had a quarterback when Vince joined the team as a sophomore, so he wasn’t about to hand him the starting job just because they were brothers.\n\n“People thought it was a cake walk. And it wasn’t,” Vince said.\n\n“He never wanted to play me. The other coaches said, ‘Hey, you’re crazy. You’ve got to play him. He’s better than the other guys.'\"\n\nSo Chris Ferragamo said he talked his returning quarterback into moving to wide receiver and Vince went on to become a high school all-American and the City Section player of the year, eventually earning induction into the California High School Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThat earned him a scholarship to Cal, where he played 22 games in two seasons, throwing nearly twice as many interceptions as touchdown passes. The Bears were placed on NCAA probation shortly after Ferragamo enrolled and when he found himself sharing time with Steve Bartkowski at quarterback, Ferragamo transferred to Nebraska and proved himself again, leading the Cornhuskers to a 10-2 record in 1975 and the No. 1 spot in the AP preseason poll a year later.\n\nThe critics weren’t convinced, so Ferragamo fell to the fourth round of the NFL draft where he was the 91st player — and fourth quarterback — selected.\n\n“Basically he had to prove himself every place he went,” Chris Ferragamo said. “He always did.”\n\nPlaying behind Haden and an aging Joe Namath, Ferragamo threw just 15 times as a rookie for a team that lost in the first round of the playoffs. A year later, as Haden's backup, he threw just a few more passes, the last in a one-sided loss to the Cowboys in the NFC championship game.\n\nFerragamo finally got his chance late in 1979. With the Rams struggling at 5-6 and Haden out because of an injured finger on his throwing hand, coach Ray Malavasi turned to Ferragamo, who lost just one of seven starts to get the Rams to their first Super Bowl.\n\n“We knew Vince had a good, strong arm. And we knew he hadn’t played a lot of NFL games,” Slater said. “So I think that everybody just kind of relaxed and said that we’ve got to help this young guy be successful. Let’s just make sure we do our jobs and then hopefully our quarterback position won’t be a liability.\n\n“And that’s kind of the way it worked out.”\n\nThe play that sealed Ferragamo’s status as the team’s new leader came with just over two minutes remaining in a first-round playoff game in Dallas. With the Rams trailing 19-14, Ferragamo threaded a pass to Billy Waddy, who was surrounded by six Cowboys. Waddy escaped the pack to score on the 50-yard play, Ferragamo’s third touchdown of the game and one he described as “a spiritual pass, one that was guided from up above.”\n\nThe almighty apparently abandoned the Rams three weeks later when they twice blew leads in a 31-19 loss to Pittsburgh in the Super Bowl. Ferragamo had played well, throwing for 212 yards, although a late interception set up the Steelers’ final touchdown.\n\nStill, the Rams had established themselves as one of the top teams in the NFL. They had made seven consecutive playoff appearances and just two of their starters were over 30. With the 26-year-old Ferragamo taking over at quarterback, the team looked primed to become a perennial Super Bowl contender.\n\n“We felt like it was going to be a good team for a long time,” Slater said.\n\nInstead, the Rams won just five playoff games over the next 19 years and didn't return to the Super Bowl until the 1999 season, their fifth year in St. Louis.\n\n“They dismantled the team after our Super Bowl run, which was unfortunate for the L.A. fans,” Ferragamo said. “They had something in place that could have really been great.”\n\nFerragamo’s honeymoon was even shorter. After a spectacular post-Super Bowl season in which he set franchise records by throwing for 3,199 yards and 30 touchdowns, Ferragamo sought a raise from the $52,000 he earned in 1980, the lowest pay for a starting quarterback in the NFL. The Rams reportedly countered with a $250,000 offer during the season, then sweetened that by another $75,000 afterward.\n\nBut Ferragamo, angry that the team hadn’t given him a new deal after the Super Bowl, turned them down and jumped to the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League, who offered a four-year deal worth about $2 million. That’s when things started to go off the rails.\n\nA classic drop-back passer, Ferragamo wasn’t suited to the Canadian game, which put a premium on quarterback mobility. As a result, he threw just seven touchdown passes and was intercepted a league-high 25 times, eventually losing the starting job as Montreal stumbled to a 3-13 season.\n\nTeam owner Nelson Skalbania, an engineer and businessman from Vancouver, had an even worse year, first dissolving his company, then declaring bankruptcy, which forced him to return the team to league after one season. Ferragamo, whose contract was not guaranteed, was suddenly unemployed.\n\n“I went from the Super Bowl back to the bottom,” he said.\n\nHe also went back to the Rams, who signed him to a series of one-year contracts valued at approximately $300,000. Over the next three seasons he lost more games than he won and threw more interceptions than touchdown passes before moving on to Buffalo, which had the worst record in the NFL in his only season there.\n\nHis final three games came in a mop-up role for a Green Bay team that went 4-12 in 1986. At 32, his football career was over. But his second act was just beginning.\n\nJodi Scarpello was a freshman journalism major at Nebraska when a high school friend introduced her to a transfer student from California. The introduction wasn’t necessary since football was a religion in Lincoln and everyone knew about the handsome quarterback who had come over from Berkeley.\n\n“I knew what he was doing there,” Scarpello said. “I knew football when I met him.”\n\nThree years later, after Ferragamo had graduated to the NFL, the couple married and a passion for football became something they shared.\n\n“I used to watch game film. We just watched at home on a reel-to-reel projector,” Jodi said. “I used to sit at games and call plays and people would think ‘how do you know that?’ I’m a good student.”\n\nBeing the wife of a Super Bowl quarterback had other perks as well.\n\n“I met, at a charity banquet in Washington D.C., and had a conversation with Coretta Scott King,” she said. “We just talked about our children. But in my head I was thinking ‘Oh my God, that is really cool!’\n\n“We got to do a lot of traveling and that kind of stuff. It’s pretty amazing, some of the things we were able to do.”\n\nThere were also drawbacks. Unlike today, when wives and children are invited on to the field and sometimes into the locker room, in Ferragamo’s day teams maintained a distance between players and their families.\n\n“When Vince was playing, he left on Friday and I didn’t talk to him until he got back on Sunday night,” Jodi said. “He got hurt one time in Buffalo and he’s rolling around on the ground. He keeps holding his arm. Maybe it’s his hand. I’m thinking, I’m not going to know.”\n\nWhen it all came to an end after that dismal season in Green Bay, the Ferragamos still had more than half their lives ahead of them — yet they were facing a life without football for the first time. Vince had never done anything but play football. Now he would have to learn to live without it.\n\nSo he called an audible and less than a year after retiring, he had a real estate license; eight years later he had his own real estate company. He would later add a mortgage fund.\n\n“When I retired, I said ‘what am I going to do’,” remembered Ferragamo. “A lot of guys, when they get out of football they fall on hard times. But I was able to transfer into another field. I also did some investing while I was playing, which was smart. I had some money that could help get me through the transition.”\n\nThe couple, married 47 years, also had three children — all daughters, Cara, Venessa and Jenna, which proved to be a blessing, their mother said, since none would feel pressured to follow their father into football.\n\n“If they were playing now they could probably go play flag football,” Jodi Ferragamo said. “I think it was probably better not to have those kind of comparisons. And they’re all successful in their own way.”\n\nBut if selling real estate paid the bills, wine would become Ferragamo’s new passion.\n\nWith his football money he had purchased an acre lot in a largely equestrian community in central Orange Park Acres converted a horse corral on the property into a vineyard and became a self-taught winemaker, producing award-winning Italian Super Tuscan-style blends. He also became a certified sommelier and lecturer who teaches a community education course on the art and science of winemaking.\n\n“I’m Italian,” he said. “I love all wines.”\n\nThe Ferragamos also created a foundation and have supported multiple causes, ranging from the Special Olympics, Boys & Girls Club and the Alzheimer’s Assn., to the Ronald McDonald House and the Orange Coast Medical Center, where a wing has been named in recognition of the Ferragamo Foundation’s contributions to the fight against breast cancer.\n\nBut football isn’t totally in the rear-view mirror. Ferragamo still attends a couple of Rams games each season, runs a flag football league for grade-school kids and co-hosts the weekly sports-talk show “On Point Live” with Slater.\n\n“He hasn’t changed. He’s still Vince,” said Slater, who has known Ferragamo since his rookie season. “He’s a confident guy, smart guy. And he’s very competitive. So he’s the same guy.\n\n“Kind of laid back. Family guy. Just loves the game of football.”\n\nThe ex-teammates remain close even though Slater says he almost got Ferragamo killed in the quarterback’s penultimate season with the Rams.\n\n“I got beat clean,” the hulking right tackle said. “My old high school nemesis, Ben Williams from the Buffalo Bills, beat me and Vince was standing there about to throw and he just put his helmet right in the middle of his back. Oh, it was an ugly thing to see.\n\n“Blood comes flying out of his mouth. I don’t how he bloodied his mouth when he got hit in the back.”\n\nThat, Ferragamo admits, wasn’t exactly the most memorable moment of his career. Asked to chose the highlight of those 10 years, he leans back in his chair, folds him arms across his chest and thinks for a moment before settling on the obvious answer.\n\n“It’s probably the Super Bowl,” he says, “and leading up to the Super Bowl.”\n\nAfter all he was the first Rams quarterback to get that far, a distinction he’ll own forever.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Khephren Thuram has moved decisively to shut down speculation linking him with Inter Milan, making his stance clear during a wide-ranging interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nThe Juventus midfielder, brother of Inter striker Marcus Thuram, insisted he is settled in Turin and has no intention of crossing the rivalry divide.\n\n“I’m happy at Juventus and I would never go to Inter,” he said, with quotes via FCInterNews.\n\nIndeed responding directly to recent market rumours about a possible reunion with his brother in Milan.\n\nReflecting on his upbringing, Thuram spoke warmly about his childhood experiences around elite football.\n\n“When my dad moved from Juventus to Barcelona, we often went with him to training,” he recalled.\n\n“Messi was already very strong as a kid and once gave Marcus a pair of football boots. Ronaldinho, as well as being phenomenal with the ball, was kind and always smiling. My brother and I took a bit of that smile from him. Life is beautiful and you have to laugh.”\n\nTURIN, ITALY – AUGUST 24: Khephren Thuram of Juventus in action during the Serie A match between Juventus FC and Parma Calcio 1913 at Allianz Stadium on August 24, 2025 in Turin, Italy. (Photo by Valerio Pennicino/Getty Images)\n\nAsked about growing up with a famous father, Thuram downplayed material privilege. “I honestly can’t think of a best gift,” he said.\n\n“Our parents gave Marcus and me a lot of love, but without spoiling us. I never felt recommended, only lucky. The privilege isn’t being Lilian Thuram’s son, but having a father who loves me so much.”\n\nTurning to the Serie A title race, Thuram refused to narrow it to Inter and Milan.\n\n“Never say never,” he said. “At Juventus you always play to win, and then we’ll see at the end.”\n\nOn the idea of playing alongside Marcus at club level, he was equally firm.\n\n“At Juve, no. Marcus has his own team. We play together with France, and that’s enough.”\n\nFinally, asked again about Inter’s reported interest earlier this month, Thuram dismissed it without hesitation.\n\n“You can’t follow every rumour. I’m happy at Juve and I would never go to Inter.”",

    "description": "Your Sunday morning Cowboys news.",
    "fullText": "After a year out of football, former Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy lands on his feet in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have reached an agreement to hire Mike McCarthy as their next coach, the team announced. McCarthy is set to succeed Mike Tomlin while becoming only the team’s fourth head coach since Chuck Noll was hired way back in 1969. A Pittsburgh native, the 62-year-old McCarthy took the 2025 season off after spending the previous five seasons as the Dallas Cowboys‘ coach. Before that, he enjoyed a 13-year run as the Green Bay Packers‘ coach that was highlighted by Green Bay’s victory over the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV.\n\nIn 18 seasons as a head coach, McCarthy has compiled a 174-112-2 regular season record and an 11-11 record in the postseason. He’s coached in the playoffs 12 times, including in eight straight years from 2009-16. A former offensive coordinator, McCarthy helped develop quarterbacks Aaron Rodgersand Dak Prescott. Rodgers won a Super Bowl MVP and two league MVPs with McCarthy. In 2023, Prescott enjoyed arguably his best season as he led the NFL with 36 touchdown passes.\n\nSpeaking of Rodgers, the 42-year-old future Hall of Famer spent the 2025 season with the Steelers and played a key role in helping Pittsburgh record its record 22nd straight non-losing season. Pittsburgh would reportedly welcome Rodgers back if he decides to come back for a 22nd season. McCarthy is a departure from the Steelers’ usual hiring practices as Tomlin, Bill Cowher and Noll were all young, first-time head coaches with a defensive background. And in Tomlin, McCarthy is following some pretty big footsteps.\n\nTomlin, who stepped down a day after Pittsburgh’s loss to the Houston Texansin the AFC wild card round, won a Super Bowl and coached in another during his 19-year run in Pittsburgh. He led the Steelers to the playoffs 13 times (winning the AFC North eight times) and never had a losing season. The Steelers are coming off a third consecutive 10-7 season and their first division title since 2020. Pittsburgh also continued its nine-year drought without a playoff win following its 30-6 loss to Houston.\n\nAfter hiring Christian Parker as defensive coordinator, the Cowboys aren’t done with talking with Philadelphia Eagles coaches.\n\nFRISCO, Texas — With change atop the defensive totem pole in Dallas comes the likelihood of a shakeup beneath it, and the Cowboys are already preparing for a round of potential changes as they welcome Christian Parker to the organization as the team’s newest defensive coordinator. Also interviewing for that position, prior to Parker’s hiring, was incumbent defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, but there’s a chance he still lands the role, but for a different team — the Tennessee Titans requesting an interview with him following the naming of Robert Saleh as head coach.\n\n“I’m just trying to live in the present,” Whitecotton said, speaking as a defensive coordinator of the East-West Shrine Bowl. “I’m so busy with this East-West game and what we’ve got going here in Dallas. I haven’t [interviewed with the Titans yet], so I haven’t really had a chance to go through that in my mind. The game has been an incredibly good distraction. “I don’t have to sit there and think about this or think about this, I’m working my butt off trying to get these boys ready to play. I think that’s kind of where my mind’s at right now.”\n\nHis mind will, of course, shift gears quickly in the next few days, and the Cowboys are looking into potential replacements, should Whitecotton accept a promotion elsewhere to become an NFL defensive coordinator for the first time in his coaching career.The organization has requested to interview Marcus Dixon, defensive line coach of the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nDixon, 41, has spent the last two seasons helping Brian Flores to elevate the defense in Minneapolis and who also spent time in the same role for the Denver Broncos, when Parker was the team’s defensive backs coach, and that relationship has swiftly led to the Cowboys’ new defensive coordinator seeking him out. It is key to note that it would be a lateral move for Dixon, and that would normally give Flores the right to block the request, but it’s reported Dixon’s contract expired at the end of the season and, if true, he’s a free agent able to interview with whomever he so chooses.\n\nHow Parker’s hiring could have a much deeper impact.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys have seemingly changed their ways. In their hunt for a new defensive coordinator, the club didn’t do what they normally do, allow Jerry Jones to override his head coach’s preference. New coordinator Christian Parker, former assistant with the Denver Broncos and the Philadelphia Eagles, is exactly what head coach Brian Schottenheimer described he was looking for in the team’s season-ending press conference.\n\nParker, 34, is Dallas’ first top defensive coach under the age of 49 since 1996. This club has always operated under the edict that the tried and true methodologies are more important than innovation on that side of the ball, so a shift after 30-plus years has to be the work of the head coach. And if Schottenheimer is right about Parker being able to revolutionize this moribund unit, the Cowboys can reap rewards for years to come.\n\nParker is regarded as a top tutor and elite tactician. If he’s able to elevate the play of the troops in Dallas, the results should be immediate. With the high-octane offense placed in the hands of a healthy Dak Prescott, there isn’t much concern for that side of the ball. Adding a strong defensive compliment should result in a return to the playoff picture.\n\nThe long-range concern, for a few, is that success will eventually lead to Parker being poached. For those who want to poopoo the idea, it’s part of the mentality the Jonese themselves have. Hire retread coaches who have failed as head coaches so that they won’t be attractive even if they find success back at the DC level in Dallas.\n\nMany in the league feel like Parker’s meteoric rise is only taking a pit stop as a defensive coordinator. He’s seen as head coach material by many in the league circles, literally being on NFL.com’s future head coach watch list for the past couple of seasons. So if he turns around Dallas’ defense, the calls will come from a team that is looking for a new, young, innovative leader. And that’s a bonus (but not the impetus) of the Parker hire. The NFL’s 2020 expansion of the Rooney Rule will compensate the Cowboys if such a situation arises. The league, frustrated in the 32 teams unwillingness to escape from antiquated ways of hiring based on familiarity and nepotism, has enticed teams to hire more minority coordinators.\n\nSafety first: What would the Cowboys be getting with Caleb Downs.\n\nWe continue our 2026 NFL Draft preview of draft prospects that could interest the Dallas Cowboys. Today we are looking at safety Caleb Downs from Ohio State.\n\nSFY\nOhio State\nJunior\n5-star recruit\n6’0”\n205 lbs\n\nCaleb Downs grew up in Hoschton, Georgia and became the do-everything star at Mill Creek High School, lining up all over the field and making plays as a tackler and ballhawk. He comes from a real football family and he’s the son of former NFL running back Gary Downs, and his older brother is NFL wide receiver Josh Downs. The brothers have a podcast called “Downs 2 Business”.\n\nAs a recruit, Downs was viewed as a rare clean safety prospect who looked smart, athletic, and already polished. He was awarded a five-star recruit rating and was ranked the number one safety in the 2023 class. He committed to Alabama in July 2022 and joined the team in 2023.\n\nHis freshman season at Alabama was impressive and he instantly played like an upperclassman. He notched 107 tackles, three tackles for loss, two interceptions, four pass breakups, plus a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. He also added value as a returner which includes a punt-return touchdown.\n\nIn his second season Downs transferred to Ohio State and the production stayed elite while the role got even more versatile. He finished with 82 tackles, 7.5 TFL, one sack, two interceptions, and six PBUs, plus he was a weapon on punt returns with six returns for 98 yards and one touchdown. During the team’s playoff run Downs was instrumental in helping the team win a National Championship. Across the four playoff games he racked up 20 total tackles, two tackles for loss, three PBU’s, and one interception.\n\nHis third season at Ohio State turned into the full trophy run. He made 68 tackles, five TFL, one sack, two interceptions, two PBUs, and two forced fumbles in 14 games. The accolades at the end of year came like a waterfall and Downs won every defensive and position award that year as well as All-America and first-team honours. During the three years playing college football, Downs never missed a single game due to injury.",

    "description": "Polar Bear said, “You’ll find out” about the New Oriole Way.",
    "fullText": "There are now 60 days remaining until Orioles Opening Day. WBC-participating pitchers and catchers report to Sarasota in just 15 days. I don’t normally derive much excitement out of spring training is approaching milestones but in the midst of the current snow/ice and with the possibility of not seeing above-freezing temperatures for several days, the idea of approaching baseball does bring a certain mental warmth, if not physical warmth. I hope that if you are in the path of this weather, that it goes by with minimal inconvenience and no harm.\n\nThe aforementioned snow has deprived us of the chance to have any kind of fresh Birdland Caravan-related stuff to talk about today. The team acted with perhaps an excessive amount of caution in canceling the entire Saturday lineup of activities. It seems like at least the first wave of planned things could have gone off. I figure that was driven as much by the players wanting to get out of the area ahead of the arrival of the weather as it was by any safety concerns about having local fans on the road. I can’t really blame them if that’s the case, but anyone who is disappointed to miss out on unique opportunities to see the players outside their uniforms and open to fans is totally fair to feel that way.\n\nWhat we’ve got instead is the same leftover stuff that came out at Friday’s round of events, where Pete Alonso talked about setting a “New Oriole Way” and where Gunnar Henderson said he’s healed from the recently-revealed shoulder impingement he was going through last season and is looking forward to a healthy season.\n\nHenderson further explained that this happened at some point early in the season when diving for a ball and it also caused inflammation, which caused him to use a sub-optimal swing plane for driving the ball. This all remains a plausible story for why Henderson only hit 17 homers last year and why he could be poised for a monster bounce-back. I got burned believing in a coming Adley Rutschman revival this time a year ago. We’ve heard more specifics from Henderson himself than we ever did about Rutschman, so it’s probably not as crazy to believe in that one, but still… I’ve heard all this before and sometimes it amounted to nothing.\n\nOn Friday night, another one of the big top prospect lists released its preseason top 100 for the year. That was MLB Pipeline, freshly updated for 2026 with three Orioles on its top 100. They’ve got Samuel Basallo high on the list at #8, Dylan Beavers at #69, and last year’s breakout outfielder Nate George at #93. Those three were also on the recent Baseball America top 100 prospects list, with BA also ranking two pitching prospects, Trey Gibson and Luis De León, who were left off the Pipeline list.\n\nPete Alonso says there’s a ‘New Oriole Way.’ What might that be? (The Baltimore Banner)\nBeat writer Andy Kostka digs into Alonso’s remark. The slugger did not offer any specifics so we are left to guess.\n\nOrioles players have been getting to know the new skipper, and they also know that it’s time to win (Steve On Baseball)\nSteve Melewski observes that the Birdland Caravan events offered some players the chance for face-to-face interaction with new manager Craig Albernaz and what seemed to come out of some of that.\n\nAlbernaz on 2026 Orioles: ‘I feel good about this club’ (Baltimore Baseball)\nIt might not end up meaning anything that he says this, but I’m reminded again that if Albernaz got a bad vibe about the Orioles, he could have told them to take a hike and that he’d look for open manager’s jobs next year.\n\nWhy Basallo, Beavers being ranked top 100 prospects again matters (The Baltimore Sun)\nThe Sun reminds us of the Prospect Promotion Incentive draft pick potential, for which Basallo and Beavers are now officially qualified after being on both the BA and Pipeline lists.\n\nNothing of particular note in Orioles history is recorded for this day. I don’t imagine Mike Elias, trapped by the snow, is going to change that in 2026.\n\nThere are a few former Orioles who were born on this day. They are: 1998 two-game pitcher Richie Lewis, 1989 infielder Francisco Meléndez, and 1963-68 pitcher Wally Bunker. Today is Bunker’s 81st birthday, so an extra happy birthday to him.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736), author Virginia Woolf (1882), President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy (1978), musician Alicia Keys (1981), and actress/musician Ariana DeBose (1991).\n\nIn 750, rebels fought against the reigning Umayyad Caliphate in the Battle of the Zab in modern-day Iraq. The victory by these rebels led to the overthrow of the Umayyad, which was replaced with the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids ruled in Baghdad until the Mongols arrived close to 500 years later.\n\nIn 1858, at a wedding between Princess Victoria of England and Friedrich of Prussia, Felix Mendelssohn’s Wedding March was played; this piece remains a recognizable staple at weddings to this day.\n\nIn 1945, during World War II, the Battle of the Bulge came to an end about a month after the surprise German attack on Allied lines, with the German offensive being repelled and turned back.\n\nIn 1971, Charles Manson as well as four members of his so-called “Family” were found guilty of a series of eight murders across two nights in August 1969.\n\nI received a little book of Orioles trivia questions for Christmas. I’ll ask one question in this space each time it’s my turn until I run out of questions or forget. The book is multiple choice but I’m not providing the choices because it would be too easy.\n\nWho led the Orioles in home runs during the 1970 season?\n\nAnd that’s the way it is in Birdland on January 25. Have a safe Sunday.",

After that there are only two home games (against the New York Rangers and Ottawa Senators) and two road games (at the New York Islanders and Buffalo Sabres) before the Olympic break.\n\nOpponent Track: The Canucks have been spiraling down the NHL standings pretty much ever since trading star defenseman Quinn Hughes to the Minnesota Wild on Dec. 13. Vancouver won a Wednesday matchup with the Washington Capitals, but that’s the team’s only victory in their last 12 games.\n\nSeason Series: Conor Garland was the only player who scored for the Canucks in a 5-1 loss to the Pens back at PPG Paints Arena in October.\n\nEvander Kane – Elias Pettersson – Jake DeBrusk\n\nDrew O’Connor – Filip Chytil – Brock Boeser\n\nLiam Ohgren – Teddy Blueger – Conor Garland\n\nNils Hoglander – Max Sasson – Linus Karlsson\n\nElias Nils Pettersson / Filip Hronek\n\nMarcus Pettersson / Tom Willander\n\nGoalies: Kevin Lankinen, Nikita Tolopilo\n\nPotential Scratches: Pierre-Olivier Joseph, Aatu Raty\n\nIR: Thatcher Demko, Marco Rossi, Derek Forbor\n\nThatcher Demko hasn’t played since Jan. 10, and it’s unclear whether he’ll be able to return for the Canucks this season, Patrick Johnston reported Saturday for The Province. General manager Patrick Allvin has said Demko is receiving opinions from medical professionals regarding his injury. The Canucks are expecting an update on his status within the next few days, per Johnston.\n\nThe Canucks recalled AHL goaltender Nikita Tolopilo on an emergency basis Saturday while sending down backup Jiri Patera. Tolopilo has made six appearances for the Canucks this season, most recently taking a shelling in a 6-0 loss to the Edmonton Oilers on Jan. 17, while Lankinen has made a team-high 27 appearances.\n\nGeneral Manager Patrik Allvin announced today that G Jiri Patera has been assigned to Abbotsford (AHL) and G Nikita Tolopilo has been recalled from Abbotsford under emergency conditions.\n\n— Vancouver Canucks (@Canucks) January 24, 2026\n\nThe Canucks are a team stacked with former Penguins including Drew O’Connor, Teddy Blueger and Marcus Pettersson. (P.O. Joseph will likely be scratched from the lineup).\n\nO’Connor has been one of the most productive Canucks as of late.

Given their spot in the standings, it seems likely the team would like to sell off a few more players down the stretch. Per PuckPedia, Evander Kane, Blueger and David Kampf are all pending free agents this season.\n\nGetting decent return value for that trio could be difficult, for a variety of reasons. The Athletic’s Thomas Drance reported earlier this month that Kane’s trade market is “lukewarm.” Blueger has missed almost the entirety of the season amid a three-month absence with a lower-body injury, and Kampf struggled this fall. If they can pick up play heading into the Olympic break, however, the Canucks could look to move them both to get some draft capital and clear roster spaces for young players down the stretch.\n\nSpeaking of young players getting more playing time down the stretch in Vancouver: rookie defenseman Zeev Buium played almost 24 minutes during Friday’s loss to the Devils, one of his highest ice times of the season, and he’s been bumped up to the Canucks top power play unit.\n\nRickard Rakell – Sidney Crosby – Bryan Rust\n\nEgor Chinakhov – Tommy Novak – Evgeni Malkin\n\nAnthony Mantha – Ben Kindel – Justin Brazeau\n\nConnor Dewar – Blake Lizotte – Noel Acciari\n\nParker Wotherspoon / Erik Karlsson\n\nGoalies: Arturs Silovs and Stuart Skinner\n\nPotential Scratches: Kevin Hayes, Ilya Solovyov, Connor Clifton\n\nIR: Filip Hallander, Caleb Jones\n\nThe Penguins could potentially have both Erik Karlsson and Kris Letang back for this one after Letang joined Saturday’s practice as a full participant, although coach Dan Muse stopped short Saturday of committing to Letang’s availability.\n\nDan Muse said Kris Letang \"was obviously a full participant today in practice, which was great. Still have to have some conversations (regarding his status for Sunday versus Vancouver).\" https://t.co/ALeTF1D8N9\n\n— Pens Inside Scoop (@PensInsideScoop) January 24, 2026\n\nIf Letang is able to return, it looks like Connor Clifton could be headed back to the bench after a seven-game stretch in the lineup.\n\nPairings during rushes:\n\nWotherspoon-Karlsson\nKulak-Letang\nShea-St. Ivany\nSolovyov-Clifton\n\nLooks like Letang could make his return tomorrow\n\n— Josh Getzoff (@JG_PxP) January 24, 2026\n\nThis will mark Arturs Silovs’ Vancouver homecoming for the first time since his trade to the Pens last summer.

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

    "fullText": "Destiny has always had a clever way of finding its way, and Barcelona defender Eric Garcia is the perfect example of that.\n\nJust 12 months ago, the former Manchester City defender was quietly weighing up one of the most difficult decisions of his career.\n\nHis future at Barcelona looked uncertain, his role unclear, and his minutes limited.\n\nFor a defender entering his prime years, the situation felt unsustainable, and leaving was no longer a distant idea – it was a real possibility.\n\nAt that stage of the season, Garcia was struggling to break into the starting line-up under Hansi Flick.\n\nThe German coach had barely used him during the opening months, and competition for places at the back was fierce.\n\nMeanwhile, Girona, a club where Garcia had already rebuilt confidence during a previous loan spell, were eager to bring him back permanently.\n\nThe offer appealed to the defender, not just emotionally but professionally, as regular football, a clear role, and trust from the coaching staff were all on the table.\n\nWhat followed, however, completely changed the direction of his Barcelona career.\n\nEric Garcia could have left Barcelona last year. (Photo by Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)\n\nThe turning point came during a high-pressure match against Benfica. Garcia was given an opportunity and made sure it did not go unnoticed.\n\nCalm in possession, sharp in positioning, and vocal throughout the game, he delivered a performance that reminded everyone why Barcelona had brought him back in the first place.\n\nIt was not just about defending well; it was about control, leadership, and understanding the club’s footballing DNA.\n\nAfter that match, Flick held a private conversation with the defender where the manager assured Garcia that he was part of the plan and that the club did not want him to leave. That conversation proved decisive.\n\nInstead of accepting Girona’s proposal, Garcia chose to stay and fight. From that moment on, his status within the squad changed dramatically.\n\nThe defender did not simply return to the rotation, he became essential.\n\nWeek after week, Flick relied on him, and Garcia responded with consistency and maturity.\n\nToday, he is one of Barcelona’s most dependable players and a guaranteed starter. His current run of 50 consecutive appearances for the club tells its own story.\n\nThe last match he missed was, fittingly, another clash with Benfica on March 5. Since then, he has featured in every single game.\n\nThe statistics underline his importance even more clearly. Last season, Garcia played the final 19 matches, starting nine of them.\n\nThis campaign has taken his influence to another level. Barcelona have played 31 matches across all competitions so far, and Garcia has appeared in every one.\n\nMore importantly, he has started 27 of those games, coming off the bench just four times. These are not squad-player numbers. These are cornerstone numbers.\n\nAs such, Flick’s belief in Garcia was formally sealed in December when the defender signed a contract extension running until 2031.\n\nEric Garcia has played 50 consecutive matches for Barcelona. (Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images)\n\nBeyond numbers and praise, Garcia’s biggest value lies in his versatility.\n\nNaturally a centre-back, he has shown he can adapt to multiple roles without compromising performance.\n\nFlick has frequently used him in the double pivot, trusting his intelligence, positioning, and ability to read the game.\n\nIn that role, Garcia offers control and balance, and many observers believe he provides a different, sometimes even more stable, option than Frenkie de Jong in specific tactical setups.\n\nDefensively, his flexibility continues to give Barcelona an edge, as Garcia has filled in on the right side of defence when Jules Kounde has been unavailable, while also proving reliable on the left.\n\nWherever he plays, the level remains high. That reliability has turned him into one of Flick’s most trusted solutions, a player who quietly solves problems without headlines.",

    "description": "The minimum weight of a Formula 1 car for 2026 has been reduced by 32kg",
    "fullText": "The FIA will not comply with the demands of Formula 1 teams to increase the minimum car weight for 2026 - stressing that the championship needs a “diet”.\n\nF1 will introduce a new set of regulations for the forthcoming campaign and one area of change is the car chassis, with the minimum weight reducing from 800kg to 768kg.\n\nIt is a drastic change and thus expected to be an early development battlefield, particularly because there are concerns that many teams will not meet the requirement in early 2026 - per Williams boss James Vowles.\n\n\"Most will be overweight\" - Why drastic 2026 F1 targets still weigh on teams\n\nBut the FIA is adamant it will stick to its principles to combat years of bloat for F1 cars, as teams would search for increased performance and safety. Since 2010, for example, the minimum weight has increased by 180kg.\n\nSo, speaking to Motorsport at the Autosport Business Exchange: London, FIA single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis said: “We would like to put Formula 1 on a diet. It's going from obese to overweight and we need to push a bit more for the future.\n\n“We were quite adamant that we are not going to be tweaking the weight on team demand, we feel there's a bit of - like a diet - it needs a bit of discipline and a bit of pressure to achieve.\n\n“What has happened in previous pre-regulation cycles is that teams design systems on the car that of course improve performance - not essential for the functioning of the car, but are systems that just make the car incrementally better and there's a lot of systems.\n\n“If you look at the Formula 1 car, there's a massive plethora of such devices or designs that make a current car sort of 50 times more complicated than 20 years ago.\n\n“So, a lot of these systems crop up on the car, and then teams then say, ‘well, our car is five kilograms overweight, should we increase the weight?’\n\n“We've in the past been a bit more flexible on that and tried to comply. This year we said, ‘no, this is the limit, that's what you need to work to’ and to the best of our knowledge, there are teams who are slightly underweight, so it is entirely feasible.\n\n“Teams need to be very careful when they design a system, they need to say, ‘that system is going to gain us X amount of lap time’, it's going to weigh an extra kilo and a half, is it worth it? They need to make this decision a bit more consciously.”\n\nThe FIA is, in fact, so committed to overcoming the modern bulkiness of F1 cars that the governing body does not plan on stopping at 768kg, regardless of the challenge it presents.\n\n“Weight does contribute to the nimble car concept, we would love it to go down further in the future and I'm confident we will go a lot further,” added Tombazis.\n\n“It's been going up in the last 20 years or so, mainly because of a combination of factors: one is safety, the cars are a lot safer of course, and we certainly would never compromise and go back on that, but many kilos of the car are safe.\n\n“Then, of course all the sustainable power units, batteries and turbos, these also contribute and car dimensions contribute as well - so broadly these three factors.”\n\nWhat to expect from F1's Barcelona test – and why the first 2026 shakedown is being held in secret\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The Ohio State women’s basketball team is steadily proving itself on the Big Ten and national landscapes. The only two losses that Kevin McGuff’s squad has suffered this season have been to No. 1 UConn and No. 4 UCLA. They have also notched wins against No. 21 West Virginia, No. 8 Maryland, and No. 10 TCU. The team will be back on the road to face another ranked opponent on Sunday afternoon as they will head to Iowa City, to face the No. 10 Hawkeyes. While, fortunately, the game is not on the Big Ten+ streaming service — which practically no one has — this ranked-vs.-ranked matchup is a streaming exclusive as it will be on Peacock when it tips off at 2p.m. ET.\n\nAs cord-cutting has become far more the norm than the exception across the United States, it would not be a surprise if you gave up your cable or a live-streaming service following last season, only to realize that it’s the day of the game and you have no way to watch it.\n\nAnd I know it can be incredibly confusing to find the best way to watch a game in today’s entertainment landscape. Fortunately for you, I am something of a streaming expert… no really, I write about streaming services for a living. So, I am going to walk you through the best — and cheapest — ways for you to stream today’s game.\n\nGame Date/Time: Sunday, Jan. 25 at 5 p.m. ET\nTV: Peacock\n\nBest (and only) way to watch Ohio State vs. Iowa\nPeacock | $10.99 per month\n\nThis is one of those annoying situations where the Buckeyes are playing a streaming-exclusive game. Not only does that mean you have to \n\nNonetheless, other than opting for a shady pirate broadcast, Peacock is the only way that you will be able to watch this game. The NBCUniversal streaming service has three different subscription plans, but only the higher two come with access to live sports.\n\nSo, if you exclude the $7.99 per month Select plan, your options are the $10.99 monthly Peacock Premium plan and the $16.99 Peacock Premium Plus plan. Straight up Premium is an ad-supported plan, while Premium Plus is ad-free. But keep in mind that this only applies to on-demand viewing. So, there will still be commercials during all sports broadcasts, including the Buckeyes’ game.\n\nPremium Plus also allows you to download content to watch offline, which is a nice feature for when you are traveling.\n\nBelow is your Ohio State vs. Iowa game thread. Be respectful, be kind, and — as always — keep it classy, BuckeyeNation. If you like GIFs, lay ‘em on us. In all, be good fans, cheer for your teams, be cool to each other (even if somebody else isn’t), and everyone wins. Let’s finish the season strong!",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills made headlines on Friday when news broke that they were interviewing former NFL quarterback and current high school football coach Philip Rivers for their head coach opening.\n\nRivers, 44, has coached at the high school level since 2021, but never at the pro level. It would be an amazing story if he went from retired QB to HS coach to unretired QB to NFL coach.\n\nAnother intriguing name to watch is Denver Broncos quarterbacks coach Davis Webb. The 31-year-old coach was a backup QB in the NFL from 2017-2022, including a stint with the Bills from 2019-2021. Webb will be available for head coach interviews this week (even if the Broncos advance to the Super Bowl), and Buffalo could be a team to watch.\n\nFollowing the 2021 season, the Bills wanted Webb to retire as a player and transition to coaching. Buffalo apparently liked how he helped support quarterback Josh Allen, but Webb was not yet ready to hang up his cleats.\n\nInstead, Webb spent one more season as a backup (with the New York Giants), then Sean Payton convinced him to retire and join Denver's staff as a quarterbacks coach in 2023. Three seasons later, Webb is drawing head coach interest, and the Bills could end up being among his suitors.

Smit becomes their second loan signing of the season following the arrival of goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu from Southampton, who was injured on his debut.\n\n\"We were tracking Milan's progress going into the summer, and with his continued form in the Dutch Eredivisie and the Europa League, the interest in him has always remained,\" Stoke sporting director Jonathan Walters said.\n\n\"Knowing the challenges of the January transfer market, we didn't initially feel it would be realistic to recruit him.\n\n\"[Head of recruitment] Ian Torrance and his recruitment team always have an awareness of the market across all positions and thankfully, down to a lot of hard work, we were able to act to add to the squad in a difficult situation.\"\n\nLatest Stoke City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Stoke City content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "Seattle acquired the Pro Bowl return man at the trade deadline, and he's been a game-changing special teams addition.",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks' move to acquire receiver and return specialist Rashid Shaheed at the trade deadline has paid dividends.\n\nThe fourth-year former undrafted prospect out of Weber State had 499 receiving yards in nine games with the New Orleans Saints this season, who shipped him off to Seattle for a couple of Day 3 picks. That move proved to be an impactful one as Shaheed has played a sizable role in helping the Seahawks reach the NFC Championship Game.\n\nThough Shaheed's receiving production has been limited in his time with Seattle — he has just 188 yards and is yet to record a catch in the postseason — his main impact has come on special teams, where he's demonstrated once again that he's among the league's best returners.\n\nA First-Team All-Pro punt returner in 2023, Shaheed was named to his second Pro Bowl this season. He had 418 yards on kick returns and 210 yards on punt returns, recording a touchdown in each category.\n\nHis presence was felt in the Seahawks' first playoff win over the San Francisco 49ers, as he returned the opening kickoff for six and set the tone for what turned into a 41-6 blowout win. On his two kick returns in that game, he totaled 126 yards.\n\nWith the NFL's new kickoff rules, an elite returner can be a potential game-changer. If Seattle is ultimately able to cap this run off with a Super Bowl, trading for Shaheed could ultimately be viewed as an X-factor decision.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Rashid Shaheed trade paying off for Seahawks in playoffs",

    "title": "Report Card: Grading Pat Fitzgerald's first two months on the job at Michigan State",
    "description": "It's report card time! Assessing the first two months of the Pat Fitzgerald era at Michigan State",
    "fullText": "The Pat Fitzgerald era at Michigan State is just under two months old, so, of course, we need to pull out our magnified glass and grade his first few months on the job.\n\nFormer Michigan State head coach Jonathan Smith was fired just under two months ago, and quickly afterwards Fitzgerald was named as the next Spartans head coach. In his short time with the Spartans, Fitzgerald has made numerous moves and decisions that will not only impact Michigan State this upcoming season but long term moving forward.\n\nFrom coaching staff construction to transfer portal moves, I have taken a look at the first two months of the Fitzgerald era at Michigan State and provided my letter grades of how he's done. Let's take a look at four key categories and my overall grade assessment of him thus far on the job.\n\nIt was a mix of coaching staff retention, combined with bringing in some new faces for Fitzgerald -- and I believe he did a great job of walking that line.\n\nRetention of impactful coaches from the previous staff such as defensive coordinator Joe Rossi and wide receivers coach Courtney Hawkins were positives to see. Combine that with poaching high-level guys from Notre Dame (Max Bullough as co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach), Iowa (Levar Woods as assistant head coach and special teams coordinator) and Alabama (Nick Sheridan as offensive coordinator), and I really like what Fitzgerald has done in building out his staff.\n\nThere were some gripes from the fanbase on a few of the position coach hires, but overall, this feels like an improved staff from last year and one that should be able to be successful in East Lansing.\n\nThis is the lowest grade of the four categories I reviewed on Fitzgerald, but I also think this grade needs to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThe Spartans lost a number of high-level players from this past year's team, and those key players landed on their feet at big-time programs. Wide receiver Nick Marsh went to Indiana, leading rusher Makhi Frazier flirted with numerous big-time schools before committing to Ole Miss, starting defensive lineman Alex VanSumeren decided last minute to hit the portal and found a new home at USC, and top returning tight end Michael Masunas will be on a preseason top five team in Texas next year. So clearly those are the type of players you would have loved to retain, but it's also not that easy to assess as money and contracts came into play with all of the high-level players that left for other schools. I'm sure some of these guys who left could have been kept for the right dollar amount, and I'm sure the new coaching staff made the tough decision of using their budget elsewhere.\n\nAs far as guys retained, there were some key pieces kept on both sides of the ball. Getting starting quarterback Alessio Milivojevic, team captain and starting linebacker Jordan Hall, starting offensive lineman Conner Moore and explosive wide receiver Chrishon McCray to come back for another year gives a solid base for next year's team. There are a number of other young players retained that will mesh well with the portal additions to hopefully buildout a roster that can reach a bowl game next year.\n\nThere was a ton of turnover (as expected with the coaching change), and there were a number of high-level players that left for blue blood programs. So, if we are being fair, I have to give retention a lower grade. But it's not as concerning, in my opinion, as you would think on the grade alone.\n\nFor the most part, I like what the Spartans did through the portal and actually could be persuaded to give them a higher grade here. Michigan State added around 30 players via the portal so I'm not going to name all of their additions by name, but some of the more notable adds were: UConn offensive lineman Ben Murawski, Iowa State cornerback Tre Bell, UConn running back Cam Edwards, Notre Dame wide receiver KK Smith, NC State linebacker Kenny Soares Jr. and North Dakota State offensive lineman Trent Fraley.\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways for the Spartans out of the portal movement that I have is the reconstruction of the offensive line. Typically, you aren't able to rebuild an entire offensive line via the portal based on the scarcity of top tier offensive lineman in the portal. But, Michigan State certainly feels otherwise and prioritized utilizing their budget on offensive linemen -- hence why someone like Marsh or Masunas was not retained. This risk and current unknown on whether it'll work or not is why I have the Spartans as a B grade in this category. But, if the offensive line ends up hitting and being a strength for Michigan State, then this grade instantly jumps up to an A.\n\nSo the recruiting ranking itself isn't anything special for Michigan State -- they ranking No. 12 in the Big Ten and No. 48 in the country, according to 247Sports. But, I gave Fitzgerald a high grade in this category because he was able to retrain so much of this class and not let it bottom out after the firing of the previous staff. While it was a different situation and circumstances, that's not something Smith was able to do when he came in two years ago.\n\nThe Spartans being able to keep commitments from four-star offensive tackle Collin Campbell and four-star quarterback Kayd Coffman was huge for the future of the program. And, now, we wait to see if four-star wide receiver Samson Gash will also sign with the Spartans. He is still verbally committed to Michigan State but elected to not sign during the early signing period, with Penn State, Georgia and Alabama still in pursuit for a flip. If Fitzgerald and his staff can get Gash to sign next month, that'll only raise this grade higher for me.\n\nWhere Michigan State football is right now compared to two months ago is a night-and-day difference. A lot of that is credit to Fitzgerald and the instant impact he has had on the program -- both literally and figuratively via vibes / momentum. So, with that being said, it's easy to give him a solid grade through the first two months.\n\nSure, there are areas that could be better, but overall, I'm finding myself more and more by the day bought in to what he can build at Michigan State. We are still months away from the start of the season, but there is plenty to be excited about right now around Michigan State -- which is not something we could have said two months ago.\n\nFor me, the expectation for Michigan State is to reach a bowl game as a floor next year, with a realistic expectation of winning eight games. A lot can change from now to opening kickoff in September, but the start of the Fitzgerald era has raised my expectations for the 2026 season. As Fitzgerald said himself, this is not a rebuild but a rebirth at Michigan State, and I'm here to drink the kool-aid.\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "This afternoon we welcome Unai Emery and his Aston Villa squad to St. James’ Park. Villa are enjoying an excellent season in the Premier League and in Europe, and Unai’s teams are consistently well organised and full of quality. We know from previous matches what a tough test this will be, but it’s one we relish.\n\nWe approach this match off the back of an excellent night in the UEFA Champions League a few days ago, when we hosted PSV Eindhoven. We knew the importance of the game in the build-up, and we made a really fast start when Yoane Wissa put us ahead after eight minutes, his first European goal for the club.\n\nThis gave the players a platform to push on, and we continued to create a series of chances in a very dominant first half. Our reward came on the half hour when Anthony Gordon doubled our lead, which we took into the break. We also know that 2-0 can be a risky scoreline, and it was important to attack the second half with the same momentum, which we did.\n\nWe felt a third goal would put the game beyond PSV’s reach and Harvey Barnes provided this midway through the second half. We managed the remainder of the game and had opportunities to score even more. When PSV threw everything into finding a way back into the match, we showed the other side of our game and defended really well as a collective unit.\n\nThe players deserve huge credit for how they handled a game which we knew we needed to win as we aim to qualify to the next stage of the competition. Not only the eleven players who started the game, but the five substitutes almost played their part in an excellent team performance against a side who top their domestic league in Holland.\n\nDespite there being big matches in the Champions League and Carabao Cup on the horizon, our sole focus is always on the immediate challenge ahead, and today we return to Premier League action and a really important game as we continue to work hard to climb the table.\n\nThe atmosphere on Wednesday evening was really special and it inspired the players from the moment they walked onto the pitch. That is why we love playing at St James Park so much, and it was great to be able to celebrate the victory with everyone at the full-time whistle.\n\nWe never take this for granted and will need just as much support today, so please stay with us and in return we will give everything to rewarding your incredible loyalty.",

    "description": "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk says he wants Andy Robertson, who is a target for Tottenham, to stay at the club as he remains a \"very important\" member of the squad.",
    "fullText": "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk says he wants Andy Robertson to stay at the club as he remains a \"very important\" member of the squad.\n\nEarlier this week, Tottenham opened talks with Liverpool in an effort to sign the left-back, who is out of contract in the summer.\n\n\"He's my vice-captain,\" said Van Dijk.\n\n\"Robbo is a very important member of our team and I want him to stay but whatever happens, let's see.\"\n\nSpurs open talks to sign Liverpool's Robertson\n\n'Liverpool's struggles can no longer be hidden by long unbeaten run'\n\nLiverpool signed Robertson from Hull City for £8m in 2017 during Jurgen Klopp's reign and he has made 364 appearances for the Reds.\n\nThe 31-year-old has won nine trophies during his time at the Anfield club, including two Premier League titles and the Champions League.\n\nRobertson is no longer the first-choice left-back at Liverpool but is keen to play regularly again and is considering options that allow him to do that.\n\nThe Scotland international came off the bench to replace Milos Kerkez at half-time in Saturday's defeat at Bournemouth but he has started just four times in the Premier League this season.\n\nPushed on whether he expected Robertson to be at Anfield for Liverpool's Champions League game against Qarabag on Wednesday, Van Dijk said: \"That's not on me, is it?\"\n\nThe Liverpool skipper was then asked about his best memories of Robertson but insisted he would only \"speak about that\" if the move happened.\n\nMeanwhile, Liverpool boss Arne Slot refused to discuss the prospect of allowing his vice-captain to leave when he was asked whether he felt Robertson would still be a Liverpool player by the end of January.\n\n\"What do you think my answer is going to be? Have I ever said anything about transfers in front of these microphones,\" said Slot.\n\n\"My answer is always the same and it's quite boring to always give the same answer - we don't talk about transfers in public.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of their defeat at Bournemouth, Arne Slot spoke about the tiredness of his players following their midweek win in Marseille.\n\nJoe Gomez went off injured in the first half, while left-back Kerkez was removed at half-time for Robertson and right-back Jeremie Frimpong made way just before the hour mark.\n\nAs Liverpool chased the game, they did so with a back four of two midfielders in Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch, alongside Van Dijk and Robertson. This is a side that lacks serious depth.\n\nYes, Robertson is considering his options before the World Cup this summer, but with Liverpool still in the Champions League and now well and truly in the thick of the race to qualify for the Champions League next season, it would be a baffling decision if they did allow one of their most experienced players to leave in January.\n\nFor Richard Hughes, the sporting director, the question is whether it is really worth losing one of the most important members in the dressing room for a small fee.\n\nThere is a likelihood that Kostas Tsimikas will return from his loan spell at AS Roma if Robertson departed, but that would simply be papering over the cracks.\n\n\"I need all my players,\" said Slot. Perhaps bringing Robertson on at half-time on Saturday was the biggest indication of that.\n\nRobertson ultimately wants to play football regularly and the understanding is that any decision will be made with the best interests of both club and player.\n\nThere will be more midweek games to come with Liverpool still in Europe and the FA Cup, and with that more chances for rotation. The reality right now is that it is not in the best interests of Liverpool to allow Robertson to leave this month.",

    "fullText": "Any doubts over Ethan Nwaneri’s ability to get minutes on loan with Olympique de Marseille were immediately curtailed as the Arsenal youngster was thrown straight into the starting lineup against RC Lens on Saturday.\n\nLens had gone into the weekend in first place in Ligue 1, but Roberto De Zerbi didn’t hesitate to give Nwaneri his full debut at a raucous Stade Velodrome.\n\nFar from wilting under the pressure, Nwaneri had an instant impact. Just 13 minutes into the game, he had his first goal.\n\nReceiving the ball on the halfway line, Nwaneri charged towards the box before cutting inside a recovering defender and curling an effort from the edge of the ‘D’ into the far corner.\n\nIt was a typical Nwaneri finish, and a great time to get it. Marseille ended up winning the match 3-1, dropping Lens down to second and cutting the gap to their opponents to just five points.\n\nNwaneri played 58 minutes before being substituted, taking one further shot and completing all three of his attempted dribbles. Manager De Zerbi was clearly impressed with what he’d seen.\n\n“Ethan will become a top player, I’m sure about that,” De Zerbi said. “You can see the quality, the impact… he’s so good.”\n\nMarseille’s next task is to secure progression to the knockout stages of the Champions League in midweek. The French side have already failed to make the top-eight, but they currently sit 19th, with positions nine to 24 getting you into the knockout play-off round.\n\nThe table is very tight, with Marseille just one point ahead of the team in 25th. So they need a result away to Club Brugge on Wednesday, and they need a win to guarantee themselves their highest-possible finish and an easier knockout pathway.\n\nAssuming Marseille are involved in the Champions League knockouts, with the team also in the last-16 of the French Cup, there should be plenty of games on the fixture list for the next couple of months.",

    "fullText": "This Monday, January 26 at 9 p.m., Girona returns to Montilivi to host Getafe in the match of the 21st round of the EA Sports League. The team has started the second half of the season in the best possible way with an away victory against Espanyol. This result means that Michel's team has achieved three consecutive victories - the best streak of the season - against Espanyol, Osasuna, and Mallorca. This places them in eleventh place with 24 points. At the moment, the standings are very tight with three other teams having the same points: Elche, Real Sociedad, and Athletic Club; two with 22, Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, and three with 21, Sevilla, Mallorca, and Getafe.\n\nGetafe CF, on the other hand, arrives at Montilivi with a trajectory marked by rather negative results in the last league matches. In the most recent games, the Madrid team recorded a 1-0 loss to Valencia and a 2-1 defeat against Real Sociedad, and drew 1-1 with Rayo Vallecano. Additionally, before the Christmas break, Getafe suffered a 4-0 loss to Betis and a 3-1 defeat against Burgos in the Copa del Rey.\n\nAs for the head-to-head history between Girona and Getafe, the record shows a closely contested rivalry in recent history. In the first meeting of this same season, Getafe won 2-1 at the Coliseum, a match in which the Madrid team took the lead with goals from Mario Martín and Borja Mayoral, while Cristhian Stuani reduced the deficit from the penalty spot at the end of the game. Looking at a broader perspective, in a total of 17 historical encounters between both teams, Girona has achieved 6 victories, Getafe 7, and 4 matches have ended in a draw, reflecting the competitive balance that these matches usually display.",

    "fullText": "She’s no stranger to the bright lights of this tournament, having already lifted the trophy twice, in 2023 and 2024. And there’s plenty of talk that she could do it again.\n\nNow ranked number one in the world, Sabalenka has added a US Open crown to her resume since then and seems hungry for more.\n\nVictoria Mboko gave Sabalenka a real test, especially in that second set. But when it mattered most, Sabalenka found another gear and pulled through 6-1, 7-6(7-1).\n\nWorld number 16 Mboko, who captured the Canadian Open title last season, has shared her thoughts following her exit from the tournament.\n\n“It was a pretty nice experience being it my first time on the center court playing against world number one,” she said. “Yeah, I think at the end of the day it really came down to experience.\n\n“She played really great tennis. I of course had my chances. But I’m glad to have played her today and just seeing how she can play and what to expect. So just a learning curve from now on.”\n\nMboko was also asked about her tendency to rally back after dropping the first set against top players, and whether there was anything different about Sabalenka’s approach that prevented it this time.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve been in so many situations where sometimes I’ll have a slower start,” she said. “She played really great tennis in the first set, serving well, great ball striking. I think I started to get used to her I’d say pattern of play in a way or like her pace of the ball and just tried to run with it.\n\n“Trying to find my rhythm as the match went on also was important for me. Yeah, I was pretty close in the second set.”\n\nThe Canadian had some thoughts on what made Sabalenka such a tough opponent: “She was serving really well. It was difficult to return her balls. And yeah, I mean, she upped her level at the end of the day.”\n\nWhen asked if she had another tactical plan when things weren’t going as hoped against Sabalenka, Mboko replied: “Yeah, I mean, she’s a very aggressive player. I think she’s known for that.\n\n“So I guess I wouldn’t say there’s a Plan B for me because if I was more defensive and tried to put balls on the court, I don’t think that was also an option because she likes to step in and take control.\n\nSabalenka will now face another young talent in 18-year-old Jovic in the quarterfinals. Interestingly enough they share some similarities.",

    "fullText": "Speaking to Welt am Sonntag, Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen has spoken on the club’s dominance over the years.\n\nSince 2010, Bayern have won all but three of the league titles on offer, with Borussia Dortmund and, more recently, Bayer Leverkusen being able to break their monopoly. However, their dominance is also an issue when it comes to promoting the league abroad.\n\nOn whether their dominance affects the league,  Dreesen said:\n\n“I completely disagree. FC Bayern is not the problem – we are part of the solution! Through our success domestically and especially internationally, with our appeal to foreign stars like Harry Kane or Michael Olise, we are the driving force of the Bundesliga. We go abroad, play summer tours, or the Club World Cup. We have worked hard for all of this for decades. FC Bayern generates more than 30% of the Bundesliga’s reach abroad, but receives significantly less than half of that in distributions. We stand by the principle of solidarity; we are team players. But those who then blame us for shortcomings in international marketing should complain less and instead do everything they can to make their own clubs and their own players more visible internationally. They should have more ambitions in international competitions. It would be very valuable for the Bundesliga if more clubs competed in Europe with the clear ambition of reaching at least the quarter-finals – not just in the Champions League. Frankfurt’s victory in the Europa League in 2022 was certainly just as valuable for the attractiveness of the league as Dortmund’s reaching the Champions League final in 2024″\n\nWhile this season, there has been an increase in talk about Bayern’s dominance, especially as they were unbeaten until yesterday’s 2-1 loss to Augsburg.\n\nEarlier this week, there was also talk about a salary cap being implemented in the Bundesliga as a way to try to stop the current Bundesliga leaders from running away with the title.\n\nHowever, when it comes to competing in Europe, a salary cap would be more detrimental to the league than beneficial.",

    "title": "Trump's surprising new source for 'affordability' ideas",
    "description": "Trump is rolling out a slew of new ideas focused on \"affordability.\" A lot of them sound like proposals from Zohran Mamdani or Bernie Sanders.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump seems to have realized the American public is not picking up what he's putting down on the economy, so he's borrowing a fresh set of ideas from an unlikely place — the other side of the aisle.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the White House has rolled out a blitz of proposals that sound more like something out of Bernie Sanders', Elizabeth Warren's, or Zohran Mamdani's offices than a Republican administration. Trump has called for institutional investors to be banned from buying single-family homes, and he's sought to block military contractors from undertaking stock buybacks and issuing dividends unless they step it up on production. He's also revived a pledge from the campaign trail to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. These moves follow a proposal late last year for what the White House dubbed \"Trump accounts,\" a small-scale version of baby bonds that would allot $1,000 to children born from 2025 through 2028.\n\nStock buyback bans, credit card interest rate caps, baby bonds: These are all ideas progressives have been kicking around for years.\n\nTrump has tended to take a heterodox approach to the economy that diverges from the more typical Republican \"let the chips fall where they may\" stance on markets. He's used his bully pulpit to stop companies from shipping jobs overseas and weighed in on mergers from the Oval Office. During his second term, the federal government has taken equity stakes in multiple American companies, marking a shift toward a more heavy-handed, interventionist approach to private industry. Now, Trump's original messaging on how to reshape the economy has faltered — it turns out Americans really love cheap stuff — so he's pivoting in what he hopes will be a more popular direction.\n\nIt's not clear how much of this is serious or achievable. And some items on Trump's agenda — namely, tariffs — stand to undercut any affordability-related measures. A cost-alleviating campaign also requires focus, and the president is prone to distraction, whether it be his recent push to acquire Greenland or his tendency to pick small fights with allies. However, the blitz of announcements is a sign that Trump recognizes his playbook wasn't appeasing the financially frustrated masses. And the ongoing shift toward more populist economic policies — wherever the ideas come from — is evidence of a broader shift away from market-first thinking that's dominated both the Republican and Democratic parties for decades.\n\nTrump's second administration came into power with a fairly cohesive theory of how to better the economy and improve Americans' poor perceptions of it. Through a combination of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts, and overhauling the federal government via DOGE, the Trump team anticipated an investment boom, particularly in manufacturing, that would lead to a significant boost to the economy. Things haven't really panned out as anticipated: The US lost manufacturing jobs in 2025, tariffs were mainly a headache for businesses and consumers, and while hard economic data shows solid growth, people's views on how things are going are much more dour.\n\nAmericans remain frustrated by high prices and a job market that's mediocre at best. They weren't sold on White House's initial message telling them to just buy less stuff, and the more recent line that concerns around affordability are a \"hoax\" didn't play great either. Which brings us to the White House's plan C: scrounging through various bags of tricks to see if there's anything good in there.\n\n\"They're scrambling to find things to do,\" says Mike Konczal, senior director of policy and research at the Economic Security Project.\n\nMany of these new policy proposals have been percolating in Democratic offices for a while. Sanders has a bill to limit credit card interest rates, and he's said in the past that he'd work with Trump on the issue. Sen. Cory Booker is a longtime proponent of baby bonds, Warren has criticized buybacks as a \"sugar high\" for corporations, and kicking private equity funds out of the housing market is a lively debate on the left.\n\nTrump's maneuvers aren't out of nowhere. He's never been a straight Reaganite, free-market-above-all Republican on the economy. Some of the issues he's targeting are ones that have garnered GOP support in the past. It's also clear that Mamdani's victory in New York City's mayoral race, thanks in large part to his affordability message, caught the president's attention. The horseshoe theory of politics suggests that the left and right are bound to intersect on certain issues, especially with a right-leaning president who is open to meddling directly into all kinds of matters. The president himself has acknowledged the atypical nature of his proposals — in an interview with CNBC, he joked that the credit card interest rate cap \"sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that.\"\n\n\"Right-wing populists and left-wing progressives are both populists of a sort,\" says James Pethokoukis, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. They tend to frame things as \"the people vs. the elite,\" though their exact targets may differ. They don't worry about economic overreach or accept constraints that political moderates might take as a given.\n\n\"When someone says, 'Oh, we can't afford it,' or, 'Well, the rules don't really allow it,' Or, 'Oh, we can't do this because the markets won't like it,' I mean, those are not answers that populists and progressives like Elizabeth Warren will readily accept,\" Pethokoukis says.\n\nIn an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me that President Trump was given a \"resounding mandate by the American people to smash Washington, DC's obsession with consensus orthodoxy that has let Americans down.\" He said Trump is turning the page on the Biden administration's \"economic disaster\" by implementing traditional free market policies such as deregulation and tax cuts, while rectifying the America Last policies that have Americans behind.\" In other words, they appear to be willing to get down and dirty on some issues.\n\nIf you're skeptical that Trump's embrace of these ideas will lead to a big bipartisan kumbaya moment, you would be correct. For one thing, the president tends to toss out declarations that aren't always straightforward or within his power to accomplish.\n\nThere are practical concerns about the feasibility and effectiveness of these plans. As it stands, there does not appear to be a political consensus on these ideas to bring them to fruition. A credit card interest rate cap, for example, would likely need congressional buy-in to implement. Historically, there has been little interest among legislators beyond progressives such as Warren, Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Members of Trump's own party have pushed back, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who suggested the president \"probably has not thought through\" the cap. The president may be able to leverage government contracts to influence defense companies, such as Raytheon, but there aren't always obvious, immediate alternative suppliers for certain products. Companies also can't shift gears overnight.\n\n\"A lot of these things they seem to be trying to do on the cheap,\" says Brad Lipton, the director of corporate power and financial regulation at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank. \"It's not serious industrial policy to just kind of do these one-off things.\"\n\nThen there are the questions of effectiveness. Take the idea of banning large institutional investors from purchasing single-family homes. Entities such as Blackstone have become a \"useful scapegoat\" for rising housing costs in the US, says Jenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, a policy advocacy group, but they're not the root of the problem. There are some 85 million single-family homes in the US; large institutions own about half a million of them, less than 1%.\n\nThere are some places where institutional investment ownership is concentrated, including Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, and Phoenix. While many Americans may instinctively balk at the idea of a private equity fund owning a cluster of homes, it's not unequivocally a bad thing. Having a group of houses together may help them keep down maintenance and amenities costs, and it opens up the door for renters to get into areas — and school districts — they might not be able to access if they had to buy.\n\n\"These institutional investors now operating as landlords are reallocating a very scarce good,\" says Caitlin Gorback, a microeconomist and assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs School of Business. \"When you're reallocating a scarce good, there are winners and losers. I think we've really been concerned about the losers.\"\n\nThere's only so much the federal government can do on housing at all, since most of what's needed to address the issue is on the state and local level. At the federal level, the president has also said he wants the government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds in order to bring down mortgage rates and floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage. Some economists note that those moves could actually worsen the situation by juicing demand without increasing supply.\n\n\"Huge monetary stimulus for mortgages is not really what the housing market needs right now,\" Konczal says. \"What it really needs is more housing.\"\n\nFinally, the president's own record has led many economists and policy experts to question his commitment to these causes. Trump isn't wrong to think that credit cards and debt are dogging many Americans. Credit card debt in the US is near record highs, and the average credit card interest rate is 23.79%, according to LendingTree, which is approximately 10 percentage points higher than it was a decade ago. Despite the president's rhetoric on the issue, however, his administration has actually exacerbated the problem. Last year, the president signed a resolution nullifying a Biden-era rule that would have limited overdraft fees to $5, and under his watch, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau tabled a rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8.\n\nIn December, the president signed a required annual defense bill that was stripped of a bipartisan housing measure aimed at increasing the housing supply and therefore bringing down costs.\n\n\"They just weren't interested,\" Lipton says.\n\nIn mid-January, Sen. Warren said in a statement she had a call with the president in which they discussed credit card interest rate limits and the housing bill.\n\n\"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it. I also urged him to get House Republicans to pass the bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support and would build more housing and lower costs,\" she said. \"No more delays. It's time to deliver relief for American families.\"\n\nThe president seems to be clear on his desire to take more direct action on the economy, though the why behind it is a separate story.\n\nOn both the right and the left, there's been a creep toward the government taking a more hands-on approach toward industry and the economy over the past decade. The Biden administration embraced industrial policy through legislation, such as the CHIPS Act, and sought to lower consumer costs by cracking down on junk fees. The Trump administration is taking stakes in companies such as Intel and MP Materials, and it's cut profit-sharing deals tied to AI chip exports. History doesn't move backward — these types of actions under both political parties are likely to continue to ramp up.\n\nWhat sets Trump's latest interventions apart is not that they borrow from progressive proposals; it's that they lack a clear thesis about the problems they're meant to solve. These policies appear reactive, shaped more by political pressure and public anger than by a coherent economic framework. They've also been presented alongside a fresh set of tariff threats on Europe that would likely push prices up. Even though those tariffs have since been abandoned, they could come back. There's an understanding from the White House that Americans are dissatisfied with the country's financial state of affairs, they increasingly blame Trump for it. Therefore, the president needs to appear like he's doing something. That something, however, is all over the place.\n\n\"A lot of policy is downstream of how you diagnose the problem, and I think their diagnosis is wrong, which is why the policies don't fit really well,\" Konczal says. \"They're doing a lot of victory laps on, 'Aha, the economy didn't collapse!' And it's like, yes, it did not. But what are we excited about? What's going to be on the other side of this?\"\n\nThat's an open question. Trump can't do a lot of this on his own, and congressional Republicans aren't exactly lining up to cap credit card interest rates or clamp down on stock buybacks and executive pay. But as the White House works to shape its affordability narrative, we might expect more Sanders-esque proposals.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Robotaxi operators will need more real estate to charge and maintain their vehicles. Voltera, a Waymo partner, is one such company.",
    "fullText": "The robotaxi takeover — assuming they take over — will also be a real estate story.\n\nAs Waymo, Uber, Tesla, and other competitors race to flood the streets with fully autonomous cars, robotaxi operators will need to find places to park, charge, and maintain their vehicles.\n\nVoltera, a charging infrastructure company based in Palo Alto that has partnered with Alphabet-backed Waymo, is buying up real estate now to prep for the AV boom.\n\n\"We need to get shovel-ready assets in the ground,\" Brett Hauser, CEO of Voltera, told Business Insider in an interview. \"You need to buy property in advance of customers.\"\n\nThe hard part isn't finding an empty parcel of land. Robotaxis serve dense, highly populated regions and are all-electric, which means depots need to be close to customers and near a power grid.\n\nOnce the depots are running, there's no guarantee they'll peacefully co-exist with their neighbors.\n\nSan Francisco residents previously reported Waymo's incessant nighttime honking at a charging depot, which the robotaxi company had to fix. In December, the city of Santa Monica filed a lawsuit demanding Waymo halt nighttime charging operations after residents complained about the noise and light pollution. Voltera, which manages Waymo's Santa Monica depot, was also included in the suit.\n\n\"I fully believe that's going to have a favorable outcome,\" Hauser said of the legal battle.\n\nA spokesperson for Waymo did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHauser spoke to Business Insider on how his company is preparing for a rapid influx of robotaxi operations, the challenges behind getting a depot ready for service, and whether the United States' infrastructure is ready for the robotaxi revolution.\n\nThe interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nTell the readers a little bit about Voltera\n\nVoltera is a developer and operator of charging depots for electric fleets. We've been focusing on the light-duty segment and AVs in particular for the last 12 to 14 months. To date, we have 10 sites operational, mostly geared toward robotaxis — about 400 charging stalls and about 37 megawatts of power. We've got about double that in development right now.\n\nOur approach is to go in and, first of all, buy the real estate. If you control the real estate, you control the timelines. Owning it — and getting the power in a timeline with certainty — is what our customers and the industry need.\n\nI think that is kind of the trickiest part of this.\n\nYou've said building charging depots can feel like \"hand-to-hand combat.\" Why is that?\n\nIt'd be great if there were a national framework for identifying a site, ensuring the zoning is correct, ensuring power is available, and then bringing your construction team in behind it. But every city has its own zoning codes, and what's permissible is going to be different. Every utility has its own process for figuring out where power is available, and what the timeline is to get power, and who pays for it is very different.\n\nIt's not only different city to city, but within a city, it can be very different. In Los Angeles, for example, one side of a street could be Department of Water and Power territory, and the other could be Southern California Edison.\n\nThe other piece of this is we don't have the luxury of always going to where the power is. Data centers can generally look to where power is available and build there. We have to be in and around urban infill areas because you don't want \"deadhead miles,\" where vehicles aren't carrying a passenger and have to go back to base to charge. The depots need to be in and around where the drop-offs and pickups are happening, and that is not easy to find at the right price point.\n\nSo it's really about the orchestration. Any one of those things — finding the real estate, dealing with utility companies — can cause you a problem, so you have to be good at all of it. What works in Los Angeles may not work in Phoenix or Atlanta. The biggest risk is the timeline for getting the power. That's the biggest risk factor in getting these sites out and running.\n\nIf we're talking about hundreds of thousands of robotaxis in the next five years, is the US ready for that?\n\nI don't know that we have that capacity today. If companies like Voltera are out there buying properties and entitling them now — and can give a customer a site within 12 months — then it becomes possible. But for a lot of people, perfecting the ability to find sites and bring power takes much longer. Some people can take 36 to 48 months, but depending on power availability and whether substation upgrades are needed, it can take longer.\n\nSo I think it's aspirational. We can knock a big piece of that out, but I don't know that you can have purpose-built depots at that scale in that timeframe.\n\nSanta Monica has become a high-profile example of community friction with robotaxi and robotaxi depots. Was that something Voltera anticipated? And does it change Voltera's definition of the right location?\n\nI think that's a very fair question. Let me start by saying that everything was done properly — zoning, permitting, above board, and by the book at this site. A couple of neighbors are frustrated and might remain so, no matter what gets done. I can't get into their head and discuss that.\n\nCommunity outreach and engagement are important, and we did do that in this case. I think people are, for the first time, experiencing robotaxis: the joys, the benefits, and sometimes some of the challenges.\n\nWith Santa Monica, I think we've built a very good site — to code and to spec —and you've got partners willing to do the right things on behalf of the city and residents. I fully believe that's going to have a favorable outcome.",

    "title": "5 acquisitions, winning over skeptical engineers, and spending tens of millions: Inside a public company's 'AI native' push",
    "description": "Amplitude gave Business Insider the inside look at its AI overhaul, from acquisitions to efforts to increase staff adoption of AI coding assistants.",
    "fullText": "There's a long banner hanging in Amplitude's San Francisco office. It reads: \"NO MAGICAL THINKING.\"\n\nNo, it's not some rag on Joan Didion. It's a reminder, CEO Spenser Skates told Business Insider, that technology can never replace deep thinking and hard work. In the AI age, that reminder is more important than ever — so much so that employees must look up at it every day.\n\nAmplitude, an 800-person, publicly traded analytics company, is undergoing an AI transformation — with the goal of reinvigorating its business.\n\nAmplitude went public in September 2021 at the height of the pandemic, climbing to an all-time closing high of $84.80 per share several weeks later before dropping significantly and largely plateauing in in recent years around $10. It closed at $10.25 on Friday.\n\nSince October 2024, the company has acquired five AI startups. Amplitude hired an AI-savvy engineering head and appointed one of its acquired founders to a new AI leadership position. It got Cursor and GitHub Copilot licenses for employees, and ran a heads-down AI week.\n\nIt's a change many companies are making: Rapidly moving from little-to-no AI to trying to become \"AI native,\" a term that's curiously hard to pin down. Large language models are popping up everywhere in white-collar work as companies chase the promise of efficiency gains.\n\nAmplitude's case may be especially informative, given just how skeptical of AI its CEO was. In 2023 and some of 2024, Skates said he viewed the AI industry as full of \"grifters,\" the visionaries promising to end world hunger and salesmen promising to automate everything.\n\n\"It had all sorts of problems,\" Skates said. By mid-2024, he realized \"there's probably going to be a breakthrough in the analytics space in the next two or three years.\"\n\n\"We've got to go make that ourselves,\" he said. \"So, we went all in.\"\n\nSkates had two opening moves for his AI overhaul.\n\nThe first: hiring a new chief engineering officer with a history in AI. Wade Chambers had advised the company since 2016, while holding leadership roles at Twitter and Included Health.\n\nWhen Chambers joined in October 2024, only 1% of the engineering, product, and design teams at Amplitude were using AI.\n\nThe second was the acquisition of Command AI, a chatbot startup. It was the first of a string of acquisitions, including June, Kraftful, and Inari. Amplitude announced its most recent acquisition, InfiniGrow, on January 14.\n\nYana Welinder was CEO of Kraftful, one of Amplitude's acquisition targets. Kraftful could spot power users of its product, one of whom was Amplitude's then-CPO. She reached out, and they chatted in February. The deal closed in July, and Welinder was named Amplitude's head of AI. A company blog post with an introductory Q&A referred to her as \"AI maven.\"\n\nWelinder's first order of business: speeding the company up. Kraftful shipped new product every week. Amplitude was shipping less than monthly.\n\n\"If you have this cadence of shipping infrequently, then the team slows down, which isn't appropriate in the age of AI,\" she said.\n\n\"Analytics will look very different 6 months from now,\" Skates wrote in his email. \"We have the opportunity to be the AI native company in Analytics and we are going to pull every piece of firepower we have.\"\n\nHe also asked employees to share a coming launch on X, as opposed to LinkedIn, because that's \"where the AI natives are.\"\n\nHow much has Amplitude spent on AI, from tools to acquisitions? \"Tens of millions, for sure,\" Skates said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it got past $100 million.\"\n\nThen comes the harder part: convincing employees to really use the tools.\n\nWhile some engineers are excited about AI's promise, others are skeptical about its helpfulness, or worried about possible job losses. Not every engineer is as gung ho about AI as their management is.\n\nSkates said that engineers were especially sensitive to the \"grifting\" that went on in AI, making many of them skeptical. With a bottoms-up approach, that skepticism dissipates, he said.\n\nSoon after joining, Chambers began planning an \"AI week\" for the first week of June. It took six months of prep and borrowed heavily from Facebook's mobile push. He took the entire engineering, product, and design team offline for the week. To kick off, Chambers required that leaders get onstage and vibe-code something in front of the entire company.\n\n\"It didn't go well,\" Chambers said of the live vibe-coding demonstration. \"They had to work through it. They had to re-prompt a couple of different ways.\"\n\nBut the message stuck, he said. Leaders who weren't coding all day were able to build something \"pretty cool\" within the hourlong session, save a few hiccups.\n\nAdditional momentum came from the \"zealots,\" engineers passionate about exploring the new tech (some of whom Chambers brought over from his prior job). These engineers lead by example, he said.\n\nAmplitude shared its internal data tracking how many employees use its AI tools. In the final week of March, 14 employees were actively using Cursor. That figure peaked in the first week of December — after AI week but before the holiday vacation cycle — at 174 employees.\n\nAnd what of the thorny question about AI implementation in the enterprise: ROI? After all, a 2025 MIT study indicated 95% of firms publicly disclosing use of AI pilots reported no measurable ROI.\n\nAfter implementing these tools, developer productivity shot up 40% and stayed there, Chambers said. On some specific engineering teams, those gains looks more like 300-400%, he said.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of people who are thinking they're the world's best expert at something,\" Chambers said. \"Increasingly, even the most cynical team members have come around.\"",

    "description": "A millionaire in California shares why he supports the state's proposed billionaire wealth tax — and why he doesn't plan to move away.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Ellis, a 55-year-old millionaire who lives in Silicon Valley, about California's proposed 5% billionaire wealth tax. Ellis is a member of Patriotic Millionaires, a collection of wealthy Americans who advocate for a fair tax system, a livable wage, and equal access to political power. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI never thought I'd live in California. I grew up in Colorado, went to college in Boston, and lived in Texas. I came out here for business school because I wanted to be at Stanford, and because you could play golf during the winter.\n\nNow I love it here. It has nothing to do with taxes; taxes have never been anywhere on our list of criteria for deciding where to live. I want to live where my family is and love the weather, the jobs, and the dynamism.\n\nTaxes are the price that we pay to live in a civil society. We have to do this together. There are examples all around the world of the power of effective government, and just like anything else, government needs to be funded. We should make it effective and efficient.\n\nI'm proud to pay the taxes I pay. I should pay taxes that are higher than other people because I have more wealth than other people — that makes sense.\n\nA lot of our financial success has been due to my wife's success, as well as mine at the beginning of our careers.\n\nI went to Harvard undergrad, worked at McKinsey for three years, and then went to Stanford. I then worked at Hewlett-Packard for almost eight years.\n\nIn 2007, my wife was a VP at Yahoo and we had two small kids. I looked at my boss's job, and at the CEO's job, and decided I didn't ever want those roles. I thought, \"Uh-oh, I'm on this ladder, and it's not really where I want to go.\"\n\nUltimately, my wife and I decided that I would step back and be the stay-at-home parent. My wife continued her career, and she's been very successful in consumer internet at Yahoo, Google, and Pinterest.\n\nI studied poverty, urban America, housing, transportation, and sociology in college, and started thinking more about questions like: What does fairness look like? What does justice look like? What would it look like to build a great society?\n\nI got busy pursuing my career, meeting my wife, and raising our kids, but as time passed and we progressed in our careers, I got back into thinking about how we help others around us. I did a bunch of volunteer work in different contexts, eventually becoming the COO and then the CSO of a nonprofit called New Teacher Center, which does intensive mentoring programs for new teachers.\n\nSince 2012, I've started and run several nonprofits in the education space, and advised almost 200 individuals and organizations on things like strategy, finance, operations, and culture.\n\nI'm also really focused on addressing excessive wealth and its impact on society and thinking about a future vision for American democracy, which is how I came to Patriotic Millionaires, an organization of wealthy Americans who advocate for higher taxes on wealthy people like ourselves, a higher minimum wage, and a broader distribution of political power across our society.\n\nIn recent years, I've been struck by the massive accumulation of wealth enabled by the consumer internet space, globalization, and the structure of the finance industry. It's different from what it used to be in the '80s and '90s; this is a whole new ballgame.\n\nMore recently, I've been looking around Silicon Valley at all these people who are so incredibly wealthy, talented, and successful, and realizing how few of them are thinking about choosing to build a better society together.\n\nThey're excited about starting new companies and raising new funds, but these are all people who have more money than they could ever spend, and their next goal is to generate even more money, mainly for people who already have more money than they could ever spend.\n\nMeanwhile, 10% of our society is in poverty. It really feels unfair and wrong, and we can do better.\n\nThe proposed billionaire wealth tax in California doesn't impact me and my family directly. People may think, \"You're happy to raise taxes on other people.\"\n\nBut we need to start with a different conversation, about how much wealth is enough, how much wealth is too much, and what is financial success?\n\nI believe that if you have $30 million in wealth, congratulations, you won capitalism. If you do the analysis of reasonable investment returns and inflation, you can buy a really nice first house, a nice second house, your kids' college is paid for, your end-of-life expenses are covered, and you have a very, very luxurious ongoing existence.\n\nSo much of success in life is luck. Yes, people absolutely get educated and work hard. But it's been found that the wealthier people are, the more they tend to attribute their wealth to how good they are and how hard they worked.\n\nI look at single moms working three jobs, working the night shift — a heck of a lot of people who have less than $190,000 [the median household wealth] in wealth are working very hard.\n\nOnce you get beyond $30 million — and almost no one ever gets there — you get to a point where your life is so good, you really can't materially improve your life anymore. We should implement a very aggressive annual 50% tax on all household wealth over $30 million. Excessive wealth turns into excessive power through huge campaign donations, which threatens and undermines democracy and capitalism.\n\nI'm absolutely delighted that we're moving in this direction, but I believe changes to wealth taxes need to happen at the federal level.\n\nWhen wealthy folks bring up moving out of California, it's a distraction. All of a sudden, instead of us talking about the fact that millions of people are going to be either losing healthcare or paying much more for healthcare, we're worried about the 200 really rich people who might move.\n\nPeople move all the time. Companies move all the time for all kinds of reasons — it's just part of business. These conversations happen all the time — like, \"Oh my gosh, there won't be any more companies in Silicon Valley.\" Well, 20 years later, look around. There are still some companies here; it's just fine.\n\nIt's 65 degrees and sunny here. The CEO of Nvidia recently said they'll be staying in California because that's where the talent is. We've got the Golden Gate Bridge, Hollywood, Tahoe, the Redwoods, the beach, and great weather. I'm really not worried that people aren't going to want to live in California.\n\nI love it here. My wife and I are thinking about living in different cities for maybe a month at a time, but I have no plans to go anywhere else. Although I definitely love Colorado — I still have my Denver Broncos coasters and will be cheering for my Broncos — I'm from Silicon Valley now, and that's where I'm going to stay.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jim Rowley, CEO of Crunch Fitness and United States Marine Corps. veteran. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat's interesting about my day is that it's never really routine.\n\nIt's highly dependent on where I'm working from, so if I'm in my main office in Manhattan, the day is quite different than if I'm at home in Lake Tahoe. It's fulfilling to not have the same routine over and over again.\n\nI've been doing this for 34 years, so monotony is a killer for me.\n\nWhere my job gets fun is if I'm on the road, I'm in gyms. My team and get to go to our more than 500 gyms, and I love meeting the members.\n\nLately, we've been spending a lot of time on understanding where AI is going to integrate perfectly with the member experience and the team member experience. We're testing some ideas out in the field.\n\nWhen I'm feeling like I'm in a rut from a strategy standpoint, creatively, I go to the gyms. I think all the answers are in the gyms. So I talk to my teams about what's working, what's not.\n\nPeople think I'm kind of a hard guy, but I think I'm pretty relaxed, especially on the road. There are just a few non-negotiables I have in my regular cadence to stay on track.\n\nTypically, I get up at 5:45 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., depending on the day. My morning is like an old grandpa's. I watch the business news, see how the markets are trending. I usually have my one cup of coffee for the day.\n\nRight now, my morning is special — I had a granddaughter born last June, so she's up really early, my daughter's up really early, so I usually get to chat with them via text or FaceTime before everything has started. Once that's done, I start my emails. The majority of my day is set up around Zoom rodeos, performance updates, executive leadership team meetings, or huddles.\n\nThis may be funny, but when I'm on the road, I need to have a desk or a sitting area so I have space to think and stretch my legs. I can't just be checking emails from bed.\n\nI also need to get a protein shake in the morning, especially when I'm on the road. I'm not going to sit down and have a hotel breakfast or stop anywhere.\n\nI believe fitness is medicine. I'm 58 now, and I'm chasing being happy, healthy, and mobile in my eighties and nineties, so it's really about staying active, keeping moving.\n\nWhen I was in the Marine Corps., I worked out in the morning. Prior to 2020, I worked out at the end of my day.\n\nI'm finding that the midday routine is best for me now, to block out some time.\n\nAt lunchtime, around 1 p.m., I break for exercise. So about 12:45, I wind down my meetings, and I'm either headed to Pilates or the gym.\n\nI can walk to our gym, which is great. It's about a 20-minute walk there and back, so you get 40 minutes of cardio with your weightlifting.\n\nI don't lift for ego anymore. I rarely bench. I used to bench press all the time, and I was very proud of what I could bench press. Now, I don't bench press at all because it's so hard on my shoulders. I do a lot more dumbbell workouts now, a lot more machine lifting.\n\nHaving lifted weights since I was 14, I felt like Pilates was an opportunity for me to try to lengthen, strengthen, and activate some of the smaller muscles.\n\nIt changed my life, to be honest with you. I became much more limber, a lot less tight. At first, I was the only man in the Pilates class, but I've been telling my neighbors and building a little army of Pilates guys.\n\nI've done both yoga and Pilates, and prefer Pilates because there is a little bit of strength with mobility and balance.\n\nAfter the gym, I'll have lunch, and then I'm back at the office for more calls, meetings, and so forth. It's problem-solving, it's answering questions, and then I wrap up my day.\n\nI like to get out of here by 5:30 p.m. to get a walk in, especially this time of year, because it's cold and it's just refreshing.\n\nWe eat dinner around 6:30 or 7 p.m.\n\nMy wife and I aren't big on sitcom television, but we do like series. She likes anything out of England, the BBC. I'm more into military history, US history, or westerns. We settled in the middle with dramatic crime whodunnit type of series.\n\nI do have a passion for \"Survivor\" and \"The Amazing Race.\" People laugh at me, but I just love competition.\n\nThen I read a little bit, and I'm in bed usually by 11.",

    "title": "Two brothers skipped college to start a pickleball company before the game was cool. They cashed in on the pandemic boom and expect 9 figures in revenue in 2026.",
    "description": "Brothers Rob and Mike Barnes started Selkirk Sport in 2014, when they were just 19 and 22 — and when pickleball was considered \"a senior sport.\"",
    "fullText": "If you play pickleball, you've probably seen a Selkirk paddle on the court. You might even use one yourself.\n\nThe Idaho-based, family-run company Selkirk Sport has become practically synonymous with pickleball. It makes premium paddles, shoes, apparel, balls, and nets — \"everything except the court surface,\" said Tom Barnes, the youngest of the three brothers who co-own the company.\n\nThere's just one nonnegotiable: Whatever they produce has to stay in the pickleball lane.\n\n\"We will only ever do pickleball. This was intentional from day one,\" Tom, the director of R&D, told Business Insider during a tour of the company's innovation lab in Coeur d'Alene, where paddles are put through rigorous stress testing using cannons and CT scanners. \"It's called Selkirk Sport. It's not called Selkirk Sports.\"\n\nTom joined the company after his older brothers, Mike and Rob, who started Selkirk alongside their father, Jim, in 2014. At the time, Mike and Rob were just 19 and 22, but it wasn't their first venture.\n\nA few years prior, they'd started a company selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement. It was part of a homeschool project. Jim, a retired fireman, saw value in teaching his kids entrepreneurial skills. The company quickly outgrew the basement and took over their childhood home. By 2013, they had leased a small building.\n\nFor a short time, they ran both companies simultaneously, but eventually sold the airsoft business and chose to skip college to go all-in on Selkirk.\n\nIt was a risk. Back then, pickleball had a very different reputation. It was considered \"a senior sport,\" said Rob. He and Mike, who first discovered the game at a local rec center in 2009 and were immediately hooked, were convinced it would take off beyond the retirement community.\n\nThey were right, but it took years — and a global pandemic that encouraged socially distant activities — before the rest of the country caught on.\n\nThe Barnes brothers saw a lot of opportunity in the pickleball space, as there was virtually zero competition.\n\nThe paddle market was wide open, said Mike: \"Everyone had basically the same paddle. There wasn't innovation. There wasn't anything new.\"\n\nThey set out to change that. Their first year in business, 2014, was pure trial and error. They sourced materials, assembled paddles themselves, and tested and tweaked them until they were satisfied.\n\n\"It was definitely more of an art form than a science back then,\" Rob said.\n\nToday, Selkirk has invested millions into an in-house innovation lab dedicated to understanding the physics of pickleball and building high-performance equipment. But, for years, the company broke even, and the brothers barely paid themselves, despite working 100-hour weeks.\n\n\"I calculated it once,\" Mike said. \"When you factor in the hours we worked versus what we paid ourselves, we probably made less than minimum wage for the first eight years.\"\n\nThey never felt discouraged. Pickleball continued gaining traction, and the company grew every year. They said Selkirk has posted double-digit annual growth over the past decade.\n\nThen, the pandemic hit. After a brief shutdown during which public parks and courts were closed, pickleball emerged as a safe, socially distanced activity.\n\n\"And then it just kind of never stopped.\"\n\nAs pickleball has continued to win over Americans — it's been deemed the fastest-growing sport in the US three years in a row by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) — the market has become increasingly competitive.\n\nIn the early years, the brothers were competing with five to 10 brands. Now, it's closer to 600, said Mike: \"After the pandemic, interest rates were low. Lots of easy money and investment flowed into the sport, and so the number of brands exploded.\"\n\nConcentrating on one sport, Mike said, is their edge.\n\n\"We think our ability to focus is one of our secret weapons. You've seen major brands like Head and Adidas try to enter the pickleball market, but they've been really struggling to make an impact. We see pickleball more like golf, where you need to be an endemic brand that's really focused.\"\n\nIt's worked so far. Selkirk went from 16 employees in January 2019 to 230 by January 2026, and said revenue has increased by 1,900% since 2019. The company fulfills roughly 1,000 orders a day and up to 2,500 during the holiday season. They also have more than 1,400 retail partners, including Dick's Sporting Goods and Target, as well as an exclusive partnership with Costco.\n\nThe brothers plan to stay ahead by continuing to invest in R&D to deliver premium products.\n\nOutside capital will help with that.\n\nEarlier this year, Selkirk took its first-ever institutional funding: a $30 million growth equity investment from Bluestone Equity Partners, Forbes reported. It also reported that Selkirk expects to generate at least $100 million in revenue in 2026.\n\nThose are big numbers, but it's been more than a decade in the making, Mike pointed out: \"It's a lot of work. I think there's a lot of glamour nowadays — a lot of hype about what it means to be an entrepreneur — and, at the end of the day, it is about doing the boring things and just waking up and being consistent every day.\"\n\nTaking a chance on a game they believed had potential before most everyone else did helped, added Rob: \"We got into pickleball before it was cool. If you're waiting to jump into the latest trend, you're probably too late.\"",

    "description": "Trump posted screenshots of messages from Macron and NATO's chief, highlighting how private diplomacy — and work chats — can quickly become public.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has spent years using social media to bypass diplomatic norms.\n\nNow he's going a step further: posting screenshots of seemingly private messages from world leaders for millions to see.\n\nIn two posts on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump published what appear to be private messages from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nOne message, attributed to Rutte, praised Trump's actions in Syria.\n\n\"What you accomplished in Syria today is incredible,\" the message read. It also said that Rutte planned to use media engagements at the World Economic Forum in Davos to highlight Trump's work in Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine, before turning to Greenland: \"I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified his push for the US to acquire Greenland.\n\nA NATO official confirmed the authenticity of the exchange to Business Insider.\n\nAnother screenshot showed a message from Macron addressed to Trump. In it, the French president says the two leaders are \"totally in line on Syria,\" adding, \"We can do great things on Iran.\"\n\nHowever, he questioned Trump's actions on Greenland, telling him, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.\"\n\nThe French president's inner circle confirmed the authenticity of the message to Business Insider.\n\nTrump's decision to publish the texts underscores how even private exchanges between close allies — once assumed to be off-limits — can now become social media content, blurring the line between diplomacy and public performance, former political advisors and academics told Business Insider.\n\nJohn McTernan, who served as UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's director of political operations from 2005 to 2007, said Trump's decision to publish private messages fits a broader pattern of norm-breaking communication designed to project power and unpredictability.\n\nTrump, he said, has mastered social media as a political tool and uses it to bypass diplomatic protocol, signaling that he does not see diplomacy as a negotiation so much as an assertion of will.\n\n\"This is a man with no sense of protocol, which I think is part of the attraction to his supporters,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nJanice Stein, the Belzberg professor of Conflict Management and founding director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said publicly sharing private messages comes at a steep cost to trust.\n\nWhile such posts may deliver short-term gains with an audience, she said they encourage leaders to self-censor and erode confidence among counterparts.\n\nRichard Stengel, who served as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs under Democratic President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2016, took a stronger view.\n\nHe said diplomacy depends on privacy and secrecy to allow leaders to test ideas and speak candidly, and that exposing private exchanges publicly risks turning diplomacy into impulsive, performative behavior with little follow-through.\n\n\"Trump's violation of that presumption of trust and secrecy is like exploding a bomb at the negotiating table,\" he said.\n\nSome messaging apps can encrypt messages end-to-end, so only the sender and recipient can read them. This protects messages from third parties like hackers, but it can't prevent the sender or recipient from sharing, screenshotting, or publishing them.\n\nRebecca Slayton, associate professor at Cornell University's department of Science and Technology Studies, said: \"The publishing of these messages is a reminder of the limits of technology for securing communications.\"\n\nThese chats offer \"very secure communications if the sender and the recipient choose to keep their communications private,\" she said, \"but the human element is always the weakest link in security.\"",

    "description": "Online resale market expands as eBay users Sydney Frost and Jessamine Black detail their strategies for finding affordable vintage fashion.",
    "fullText": "Sydney Frost and Jessamine Black spend their days painstakingly combing through eBay's virtual racks for the perfect clothing finds.\n\nThey've been shopping on the online marketplace for years and say it's usually their first choice when hunting for new pieces to expand their wardrobes.\n\nIt may not be as convenient as shopping firsthand — you can't try on the clothes before you buy, and shipping and return policies vary by seller — but it's a sacrifice they say they're willing to make for the right threads.\n\n\"I feel like you can find really unique items on eBay that not a lot of other people will have,\" Frost, who's been shopping on eBay for over three years, told Business Insider.\n\nHowever, shopping resale on eBay comes with a learning curve that took time to overcome. Frost and Black have had to get creative with their searches, planning accordingly, and practicing patience while shopping.\n\nWith the online resale market growing rapidly, Frost and Black shared the hacks they've picked up to find their holy grail items on eBay. They've each built a following on TikTok, where they share thrifting tips.\n\nPinterest is Frost and Black's best friend for online shopping. Making a board of outfit inspiration is Frost's starting point for figuring out what she wants to find on eBay.\n\n\"I'll head to Pinterest or TikTok, and I'll find some inspo for a certain piece,\" Black, a 30-year-old social media manager, said.\n\nThey tend to stick to their favorite brands, such as Ralph Lauren, Save The Queen, and Miss Sixty. If you know what brand you're looking for, it's a good starting point for finding items you like, they said.\n\nFrost said she goes down rabbit holes on eBay, making lowball offers on several items she's interested in. From there, it's a waiting game to see if the seller accepts.\n\n\"It was like Christmas morning when everything came in,\" Frost said of a recent haul.\n\nShopping on eBay isn't as simple as typing in the phrase \"Y2K skirt\" into the search bar.\n\nThe search bar works best when you use keywords like brand names and specific styles — be sure to include \"vintage\" to avoid fast-fashion listings — Frost told Business Insider.\n\nThe search feature is Black's favorite part about eBay. It sets it apart from other secondhand sites because they can be tougher to find specific items based on keywords, she said. Keyword searches are the jumping-off point for finding the best items on eBay if you're prepared to sift through pages of listings.\n\n\"Anything that you can think of in your brain, you can type it into eBay, and I just scroll,\" Black said.\n\nShe can scroll for hours to identify clothes she's interested in purchasing. It's how she spends part of her day as a break from social media.\n\n\"You can type in vintage 'Ralph Lauren women,' 'vintage Ralph Lauren men.' You can type in 'vintage Ralph Lauren small,' and every single time it will populate a different list for you,\" Black said.\n\nYou'll likely find marked-up pieces from professional resellers if you don't know what to look for, 26-year-old Frost said.\n\nIt's easier to find deals on listings from regular people who are clearing out their old wardrobes. They're less likely to know the value of what they have, both women said. You can usually tell from a seller's profile or a listing's wording whether it's a business or an individual.\n\nProfessional sellers tend to use trendy buzzwords to attract buyers, while regular people keep it simple with their listing titles and descriptions.\n\nOne of Black's not-so-secret hacks is adding items to her eBay wish list. It's not just for keeping an eye on items you like. Sellers know when you've added an item to your wish list, and it could work in your favor as a buyer.\n\nAfter Black likes or saves an item to her wish list, she said it typically won't be long before the seller offers a deal on it. It's how she gets items at a good price, like a pair of vintage Ralph Lauren pants for $30.\n\n\"Save it to your wish list, give it a minute, and the seller — I'm saying 99.9% of the time — they'll throw you a lower offer,\" Black said.\n\nShopping on eBay may require patience, diligence, and savvy, but it's worth it for the thrill of finding a holy grail item, Frost and Black said.",

    "fullText": "Warren Buffett warned about the perils of personal debt in a rare interview last May that aired last week.\n\nThe famed investor, 95, also offered timeless advice about parenting, moving on from mistakes, choosing a job, and living a full life during the two-hour CNBC special titled: \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy.\"\n\nMany people \"love spending beyond their income\" by racking up credit-card debt, but that's a path to ruin, Buffett said. \"The rest of your life, you're underwater, and why in the hell do you want to be underwater?\"\n\nThe self-made billionaire said that people who aren't worried about money tend to be \"quite a bit happier\" than those who are. There's \"nothing magic\" about managing your finances, he added. \"You just have to think a little and use a little discipline.\"\n\nBuffett acknowledged that teenagers and college students aren't \"inclined to use a lot of discipline,\" but he still gives them the same advice: \"Don't get in debt.\"\n\n\"And beyond a certain point, if you get in a hole or anything, it is difficult to dig out, isn't it?\" he said. \"It's impossible, and I give credit to people who do it. But do it the easy way.\"\n\nOne exception is taking a mortgage out on a house, but even then you \"have to be careful,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"My dad was always very forgiving of my misbehavior,\" Buffett said about Howard Buffett Sr., an Omaha stockbroker and four-term Republican congressman. \"He'd just say, 'I know you can do better.'\"\n\nBuffett said that was \"very powerful stuff\" because his father was right, and the young Buffett knew it. He recalled \"behaving like a jerk for a long time,\" and said it was \"nice to have somebody have faith in you.\"\n\nThe legendary stock-picker, who recently stepped down as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO after more than 50 years in charge, praised his three children, whom he's tasked with disbursing virtually all of his vast fortune to good causes.\n\n\"If you want to have good children, be a good parent,\" Buffett said. \"You don't give them lectures about doing bad things when you're doing the bad things, and they're actually just acting like teenagers.\"\n\nBuffett said his kids — Susan, Howard Jr., and Peter — \"didn't have to watch hypocrisy\" growing up, as he and their mother largely lived up to the values they taught them.\n\n\"They never saw us behave like we were extremely rich or anything, although they saw us fly off to New York and do different things, and we had plenty of fun,\" he said.\n\nThe trio witnessed Buffett's intensity at work and pride in his investment returns, but they \"didn't see us craving money just to say to other people: 'Look, I've got money, and you don't, ha ha ha,'\" he said.\n\nBuffett said his children \"did a lot of crazy things, but of course I did too.\" He said that people should be \"very forgiving\" to themselves and not dwell on their past missteps, as they can't be changed and \"nobody cares.\"\n\nHe said they should focus instead on improving their behavior going forward, as the \"second half of your life should be better than your first half\" as you grow wiser with age.\n\nBuffett, who's joked that he \"tap dances to work\" because he enjoys his job so much, repeated his trademark advice to pursue a career in what you love.\n\n\"Look for the job you'd take if you didn't need a job,\" he said, where the \"fact you get a paycheck is incidental to what you're doing.\"\n\nBuffett, famously a voracious reader, said that one can \"learn a lot of things out of a book,\" but real-life experience is crucial too.\n\n\"You can't have your heart broken by reading a book when you're three or four years old, or having it read to you,\" he said. Nor can you experience the \"thrill\" and \"exhilaration\" that come with \"accomplishing something until you actually do it,\" he added.\n\nReflecting on his own life, Buffett said he was lucky to be born in the US, live into his 90s, stay generally healthy, and have \"all kinds of interesting experiences.\"\n\n\"I mean, you won the lottery,\" he said.",

    "description": "80-year-old Robin Blair runs his family's greengrocer's, founded in 1875. He started helping in the business at age 5 and says he will never retire.",
    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with greengrocer Robin Blair, 80, the owner of JJ Blair & Sons in Darlington, in the North-East of England. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWe have an old saying in our family: \"There are two chairs that will kill you in life — the electric chair and the armchair.\"\n\nCapital punishment won't apply to me, or at least I hope not! And there's no way I'll retire to put my feet up and sit in front of the TV.\n\nIt's not in my nature, or my blood. My father, Joe, worked in our greengrocery, founded in 1875, until he was in his nineties.\n\nYou could say I joined the trade when I was a few months old in 1940. We're based at an indoor market, and my mother would tuck me under the counter while she served the customers.\n\nYou were expected to help at the nursery almost as soon as you could walk. By the time I was 5, I'd be sowing seeds, planting cabbage, and looking after tomatoes.\n\nMy siblings and I — including my younger brother, Keith, my business partner until he died in 2013 — were given our own plot of land to work.\n\nWe were allowed to keep the proceeds. I used to grow vegetables with an easy return, like lettuce, because they matured quickly. There was a friendly rivalry among us kids over who made the biggest profit.\n\nI couldn't wait to leave school at 15 and work full-time, even though it was physically demanding at times. We grew everything ourselves until we began moving toward wholesale.\n\nYou spent the morning harvesting and washing the produce. Then you'd load up the wooden cart and our trusty horse, Bobby, would pull it three-and-a-half miles to the market.\n\nMy grandfather, Jack, who established JJ Blair & Sons 150 years ago, was a proud man and wouldn't let Bobby leave without polishing his harness. Neither he nor my dad would dream of having a mechanical vehicle. Everything was horse-drawn.\n\nBack then, the market ran from 3 p.m. to midnight. The manager would ring a bell at 9 p.m., signaling that you could start auctioning the stuff you had left over.\n\nIt was fun shouting out your wares to attract the highest bidder. There was no refrigeration in those days, and you'd take the leftovers back to the nursery to compost.\n\nOur motto was \"More flash, more cash,\" meaning that the better the produce appeared, the more money you made. I still live by that rule.\n\nThe apples gleam on our stand, and the bananas are at the right stage of ripeness. We grow our own soft fruits in our greenhouses, including strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. They always look delicious.\n\nI also pride myself on writing the signs that show the prices, both in pounds, ounces, and kilograms. The letters are spelled out nicely. It's a bit like doing calligraphy.\n\nThe glory days were the 1960s, 70s, and much of the 80s. The indoor and outdoor markets were bustling with nearly 200 stands. They were right in the center of town, a hub of activity.\n\nThen the big supermarkets came along. It changed everything. They're fighting among themselves over pricing, undercutting us, and it's hard to compete. People like the ease of going to them, especially with the free parking.\n\nStill, we have many loyal customers. Sadly, we're the only greengrocers left in the market today. Shoppers come for the fresh produce, the personal service, and the lively conversation.\n\nA strong work ethic was instilled in me as a child, and I have no problem getting up at 4:30 a.m. daily to prepare for the market, which opens at 8 a.m.\n\nI usually get back to the nursery around 3 p.m., where we also grow bedding plants. My working day can last until 8 or even 10 p.m. in the summer, to take advantage of the lighter nights.\n\nThis trade has given me a better life than I could have hoped for. I wish Keith were still here, but I'm delighted to be running the business at 80.\n\nIt makes me sad to think what might happen after I'm gone. When I ask my daughter, Alyson, if she'll continue in the family tradition, she'll laugh and say, \"Never say never.\"\n\nMeanwhile, my long-suffering wife, Alwyn, keeps me happy and healthy, and I keep a positive outlook. It's my 81st birthday in May, and I plan to keep going for years after then.\n\nDo you have a story about working a job longer than most? Please email Jane Ridley at jridley@businessinsider.com",

    "description": "Kyle Elliott, a career coach for tech employees, told Business Insider clients can vent to the wrong people when they're dealing with a difficult boss.",
    "fullText": "Kyle Elliott, who's been a full-time career coach since 2017, spends his days helping tech employees solve their most challenging work issues.\n\nHe's noticed a common problem among clients: difficult bosses, including micromanagers.\n\nOne key mistake employees make when they're trying to fix a problem, Elliot told Business Insider, is venting to the wrong person — particularly your boss.\n\nIt makes sense to push back against a difficult boss when their behaviour or expectations are disrupting your work, said Elliot, who is based in California. But venting to them will rarely make the situation better, but nearly always damage trust, he added.\n\nEven if you have a good relationship, it would be more appropriate to vent to a friend, family member, or career coach. They can also help you brainstorm solutions.\n\n\"Your boss is not your therapist. You want to come to them with solutions, or at least a clear sense of how they can help you improve the situation or the working relationship,\" he said. \"If you want a promotion, you want your boss to view you as someone who is thoughtful and solution-oriented, not someone who complains.\"\n\nWhen you organize the feedback session with a difficult boss, choose a private setting, such as in a 1-1 meeting, and interlace constructive feedback with positive remarks about things they do that you like.\n\nAnother common issue Elliott encounters is clients misusing their time with him by ranting about their struggles with their boss and what's frustrating them, he said.\n\n\"They often believe they must provide extensive context in order to receive effective coaching, but this isn't true,\" he said.\n\n\"You can vent,\" Elliot added, but \"it's a very expensive venting session.\" While it may feel cathartic, you're better off airing your frustrations to a friend and using your paid coaching session to outline what you can change, such as what battles with your boss to choose, or how to communicate better with them.\n\n\"Coaching is about empowering you, not venting about your manager. Your boss isn't in the coaching session. You are,\" he said.\n\nRead more of Elliott's tips for dealing with a difficult boss.",

    "description": "EY's global chief innovation officer, Joe Depa, said he advises his teams to write their own content first and then ask AI to refine it.",
    "fullText": "AI is getting better every day — but EY's global chief innovation officer told Business Insider there are still signs that reveal an AI-generated response.\n\nDepa leads the Big Four firm's global AI, data, and innovation strategy, and part of his job involves overseeing how employees integrate AI.\n\nThat vantage point has given Depa what he calls a \"high sensitivity\" for detecting AI-generated work. While he's all in on the technology and doesn't have set limits on how often employees should use it, he said AI should be used to amplify human creativity, not replace it. He said there are situations where \"it's too much AI,\" and the person hasn't \"infused any of their own original thoughts.\"\n\nIn that case, \"there does become a point of AI becoming a little bit less efficient or effective,\" Depa said. The executive added that it's important to maintain a sense of individuality and style so that everyone doesn't sound the same.\n\nAs companies urge employees to adopt AI, Depa's comments underscore the fine line employees walk between using the technology as a tool and depending on it too heavily.\n\nEven if workers want their bosses to know they're keeping up with the latest tech, they may not want them to know just how much they're relying on it. In a Business Insider survey with 220 respondents, 40% said \"yes\" or \"sometimes\" when asked whether they hide or downplay their AI use at work.\n\nDepa said he notices a few signs that point to AI-generated responses, including mistakes. While AI tools have improved significantly, they can still hallucinate. Here are a few other writing- and presentation-specific examples that point to AI, according to Depa:\n\nWhen it comes to written communication, Depa said there are a few signals that indicate it was generated by AI with minimal human oversight or input. \n\nOne of the most common is neutral and overly formal writing. He added that AI-generated writing may lack personal aspects, emotion, and humor.\n\nThe writing may also be too polished, with no shifts in pattern, structure, or flow. He said AI-generated writing tends to be generic or corporate-sounding, sometimes relying too heavily on buzzwords and descriptors.\n\nAnother red flag is repetitive language, such as relying on the same phrases or sentence structures to open multiple sentences or paragraphs.\n\nIn general, Depa advises his teams to write their own content with the bullets and messaging they want to convey, and then ask an AI tool to refine it. If used correctly, Depa said AI tools can challenge your thinking.\n\n\"If you write it yourself first and then ask for the enhancement using AI, I feel like that's much more productive,\" Depa said.\n\nIn presentations, Depa said an over-reliance on AI results in surface-level insights that lack specific examples. Another giveaway is when topics are addressed too broadly, with little consideration for the audience.\n\nHe also flagged \"hedging,\" which he said AI does by design. He said AI often steers away from clear recommendations and presents alternatives.\n\n\"Anytime you see vagueness or general statements that don't really tell you anything, I would often say that's AI,\" Depa said.",

    "fullText": "The global elite of Davos probably isn't what you think of when you think about spunky Business Insider. But we sent a small editorial team to bring you the best of it — BI-style — and I want to tell you about it.\n\nAki Ito is our chief correspondent on careers, a huge topic for Davos — and for us. She asked people across business tough questions about the future of work (believe me, I was in the room) to help bring insights for your success. She also moderated a conversation with chief people officers from companies across the business world. You'll see her takeaways from that soon.\n\nBen Bergman on tech, same thing. Ben is a leading scoop-getter and thinker on our crackerjack tech team. We know you care about tech from every angle — innovation, work, investments, culture, productivity hacks, fun. Ben was all over town meeting with people and moderating panels so that we can be in-the-know on what's in and what's out for you. You might have caught Ben on CNN twice last week!\n\nDan DeFrancesco is the lead writer on this newsletter every weekday. As you know, it's a smart, witty read across tech, markets, and business — the opposite of aggregation that's common in newsletters. So it's important for us to make sure Dan has the widest view of what's going on in the world. As he hustled around, Dan also wrote our new pop-up Davos Diary newsletter every day last week. We hope to do more special editions to meet these moments!\n\nKim Last leads our live journalism — events like panels and conferences IRL, and live conversations online. We put on three events at Davos, convening some of the most interesting and in-the-flow people on the mountain. We'll keep you informed of what's on our calendar, as conversing with the audience we're serving is a top priority at BI right now. (Kim also got a now-famous hair blowout at the start of the week — Davos hack!)\n\nWe know not everyone can make it across the world. That's why, in addition to the special newsletter, we did a daily live blog, bringing you everything from the serious to the wacky. Across last week, we did 180 posts, not just from the five of us, but from reporters and editors who did an excellent job following the chatter from around the world. Those blogs, and our wrap post, are available here.\n\nWhat about me? I was there doing the Davos thing — meetings, moderations. But I also made a point to snap some photos of the fabulous fashion. You can find all that we gathered on that fun front here.\n\nAll of which is to say, we dive into the biggest things happening in the world, in our style, for you.\n\nPlease stay in touch at eic@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "I'm a co-creator of Alexa. Writing a 6-page memo helped me decide to quit Amazon and launch my own AI startup.",
    "description": "William Tunstall-Pedoe co-founded Evi, which became Amazon Alexa. Here's why he decided to leave the tech giant and launch a startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, a founder and CEO. Amazon's acquisition of his startup and his role at Unlikely AI have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI helped create Alexa, a product that everyone has heard of and most people have used. I'm proud of what we built.\n\nBut by 2016, it was clear that leaving Amazon, which I joined after the company acquired my startup, was the right decision. Continuing to work on Alexa would have been a very different job from building and launching startups, which I love to do.\n\nWhen I was 13, I would go to a college next to my school to use their mainframe, and since then I've been excited by computers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with software.\n\nI studied computer science at the University of Cambridge and taught there after graduating in 1991, but I felt better suited to entrepreneurship than to academia. If you create something genuinely new in software, it can be on a billion smartphones in six months and truly change the world. That's impact.\n\nI set out to solve what I saw as a big problem. Internet search relied on users guessing keywords to get results, rather than asking natural questions like we learn to do as children. I imagined a world where you could have that same kind of conversation with computers, which led me to found True Knowledge in 2006.\n\nInitially, we tried to build a search engine that would compete with Google, which didn't work. Then, we enabled other companies to integrate our search engine into their own products — but the larger companies didn't. For a time, we focused on SEO.\n\nThe final pivot was building a voice assistant. We created an application called Evi, which launched in the UK in 2012, a year after Apple introduced Siri. We renamed the company from True Knowledge to Evi to match our product.\n\nAs a 30-person startup, we suddenly found ourselves competing with the world's most valuable company. We spent much of that year talking to major players in tech about being acquired. Later in 2012, Amazon bought our company.\n\nJoining Amazon was the right decision. The company invested heavily in the city of Cambridge, where Evi was based, and turned our startup into a major Amazon office. Our voice assistant became one of the company's biggest and most exciting secrets.\n\nMoving from running a small startup to working inside a business with hundreds of thousands of employees, with Jeff Bezos at the top, was a big change, but I loved working there. I split my time between Amazon's offices in Seattle and Cambridge, and enjoyed going back and forth, making things happen.\n\nWhen we launched Alexa, we were taken aback by the response. It was instantly successful. Today, Alexa is a household name. I'm immensely proud of the Evi team.\n\nAmazon is known for using six-page memos instead of PowerPoint presentations to promote clarity of thought. In 2016, I wrote one to help me decide if I should leave Amazon. In the memo, I laid out these facts: I'd delivered everything I could, the acquisition had been an unambiguous success, and so too had the product. At the time, thousands of people were working on Alexa.\n\nAfter about three and a half years at Amazon, in 2016, it was time to go. I wanted to re-enter the startup world.\n\nIt's certainly possible to launch something new within a big organization, and there are real advantages to doing so. When we launched Alexa, it immediately appeared on the front page of Amazon.com, a level of exposure that most startups could only dream of. I expect I'll work at a big company again at some point in my career.\n\nBut if you're trying to do something novel or contrarian, a startup is often better suited. Within a large company, all it takes is one manager deciding that resources are better spent elsewhere for a project to die. At a startup, it's the opposite. Even if 99 venture capitalists say no, you only need one investor to say yes to keep the project alive.\n\nAfter Amazon, I spent time mentoring at startup incubators such as Creative Destruction Lab. Through that, I became an active angel investor, which gave me a broad perspective of the many ways startups succeed and fail.\n\nIn 2019, I launched Unlikely AI, a deeptech startup focused on building neurosymbolic AI. The goal is to combine the powerful but sometimes incorrect machine-learning models with the world of algorithms, where computers are almost always right. The mission of the business is about making AI trustworthy and reliable.\n\nAs CEO, I'm constantly swamped. Running a startup can be stressful, but working on something truly big and ambitious is incredibly exciting.\n\nI sometimes feel nostalgic about working inside a big organization, but I love being in the startup world. For me, leaving Amazon was the right decision. I don't regret it.",

    "description": "Car companies signaled they were discontinuing V8 engines a few years ago. Now, they're making a big U-turn — and Detroit is leading the way.",
    "fullText": "The growl of a V8 engine — a deep, throaty roar that swells when a driver stomps the gas pedal — had for years been fading from auto assembly floors.\n\nThe American automotive landscape is changing after a period that saw tighter emissions rules push automakers toward more efficient, quieter powertrains and prompted shifts away from big V8 engines.\n\nBut many of those regulations, including the federal EV incentives, have fallen away, leading automakers that once promised to discontinue the gas-hungry engines to reinvest in V8 offerings — especially in full-size trucks and performance cars.\n\nThe shift isn't a wholesale retreat from electrification, but it is a clear signal that legacy engines still matter, especially when profits are on the line.\n\nMany auto enthusiasts are applauding the V8 revival.\n\n\"What makes V8s superior is the instant response when you hit the gas pedal,\" Justin Goldsberry, an enthusiast and author of the Automobile Innovations newsletter, told Business Insider. \"Everything is immediate and highly responsive.\"\n\nOver the past year, nearly every major American automaker has announced new investments or product updates tied to V8 engines. The industry's biggest bets centered on trucks and high-performance vehicles.\n\nBig, powerful cars and trucks have long been Detroit's best profit-makers. Many are now seeing a resurgence thanks to the renewed investments.\n\nRam Trucks brought back its Hemi V8 engine in August after pulling it from parts of its lineup just last year. This month, it relaunched the TRX, a V8-powered sport-oriented pickup the company markets as an automotive \"apex predator.\"\n\nLast May, General Motors stopped producing electric-vehicle batteries at its Western New York propulsion plant and restarted V8 engine production for trucks instead — a shift that required an $888 million investment.\n\nFord is also leaning into performance. The company told Business Insider it plans to add a new, faster trim to its V8-powered Mustang Dark Horse lineup, called the SC.\n\n\"You're starting to see some more performance V8s come back,\" Kevin Roberts, the director of market intelligence at CarGurus, told Business Insider. \"Consumers wanted these cars. It was just a challenging economic choice because of the regulations that previously existed. But there are different rules now.\"\n\nData suggests demand for big, gas-powered vehicles — particularly trucks — remains strong. According to Cox Automotive, US consumers spent about $15 billion on full-size pickup trucks in December alone.\n\nTo Roberts, that appetite reflects a long-running truth about the American auto market: even as efficiency improves and electrification expands, the industry continues to rely on high-margin vehicles with internal-combustion engines to bankroll its transition.\n\nV8s are essential to American car-making culture.\n\nFirst developed for US consumers in the early 1900s by Cadillac, V8s became synonymous with postwar expansion, cheap gasoline, and a domestic auto industry built around size and power. Ford helped popularize the engine in the 1930s, offering dramatic horsepower gains over smaller powertrains.\n\nThat popularity launched generations of American nostalgia.\n\n\"What customers actually want is more horsepower and more torque,\" said Dave Mann, a classic Ford Bronco owner and the president of motor oil company Performance Oil Technology. \"That's where the money is, and that's the bread and butter for American automakers.\"\n\nBut the sales dominance didn't last forever.\n\nAs fuel prices surged and emissions rules tightened in the 1970s and 1980s, consumer preferences shifted. Smaller, more efficient vehicles — many built by Japanese automakers like Toyota and Honda — surged in popularity. By the early 2000s, V8 engines, which had once powered more than half of all American vehicle sales, accounted for less than 20%.\n\nBut the engine never disappeared. They just powered the auto industry's full-size and heavy duty trucks and hyper-powered racers.\n\nBig trucks — including the best-selling Ford F-150 and second-best-selling Chevy Silverado — still remain wildly popular.\n\nAnd while the V8 is getting newfound attention from automakers, it's not the only shift happening in the industry.\n\nA new wave of sub-$50,000 EVs are on the horizon, which will test Americans' appetite for EVs now that the $7,500 EV incentive is no more.\n\nMeanwhile, gas-saving mild-hybrids are gaining popularity. The system pairs an electric motor with a standard gas-burning engine to reduce the amount of fuel needed on a trip.\n\nThat set-up is gaining more popularity, too. According to CarGurus data shared with Business Insider, hybrid sales jumped more than 41% in December compared to the same month the year before. Gas-only car sales rose a modest 1.4%.\n\n\"We've seen a large increase in hybrids,\" he said. \"The US is starting to shake some of its gas-guzzler mindset.\"",

    "title": "State Terror Has Arrived",
    "description": "Minneapolis has made it plain.",
    "fullText": "After the past three weeks of brutality in Minneapolis, it should no longer be possible to say that the Trump administration seeks merely to govern this nation. It seeks to reduce us all to a state of constant fear — a fear of violence from which some people may at a given moment be spared, but from which no one will ever be truly safe. That is our new national reality. State terror has arrived.\n\nPlease look at this list with me. Since early January, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement expanded its operation in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., federal officers have: killed Renee Good, a white middle-class mother; menaced a pregnant immigration lawyer in her firm’s parking lot; detained numerous U.S. citizens, including one who was dragged out of his house in his underwear; smashed in the windows of cars and detained their occupants, including a U.S. citizen who was on her way to a medical appointment at a traumatic brain injury center; set off crowd-control grenades and a tear gas container next to a car that contained six children, including a 6-month-old; swept an airport, demanding to see people’s papers and arresting more than a dozen people who were working there; detained a 5-year-old. And now they have killed another U.S. citizen, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an I.C.U. nurse with no criminal record. It seems he was white. The agents had him down on the ground, subdued, before they apparently fired at least 10 shots at point-blank range.\n\nConfronted with a list like this — a deluge like this — we look for details that might explain why these people were subjected to this treatment, details that might reassure us that we, by contrast, are not in danger. Good was in a relationship with a woman, and her partner, who is butch, spoke impertinently to an ICE officer, so there, Good wasn’t your average white mother after all. ChongLy Thao, the man who was dragged out of his house in his underwear, is an immigrant from Laos; he is not white, and presumably he speaks with an accent. The woman on her way to the medical appointment and the family with six kids drove through areas where anti-ICE protests were taking place. The 5-year-old child’s family doesn’t have permanent status. Little is known about Pretti at this writing, but his father said he did participate in protests and he might have been carrying a gun (legally).\n\nWe don’t focus on these details in order to justify the federal agents’ actions, which are plainly brutal and unjustifiable; we do it to force the world to make sense, and to calm our nerves. If we don’t talk back, if we alter our routes to avoid protests, if we are lucky enough to be white, straight, natural-born Americans — or, if we are not, but we lie low, stay quiet — we will be safe. Conversely, we can choose to speak up, to go to protests, to take a risk. Either way, we tell ourselves, if we can predict the consequences, we have agency.\n\nBut that’s not how state terror works.\n\nIn the 1990s, when I talked to people in the former Soviet Union about their families’ experiences of Stalinist terror, I was repeatedly struck by how much people seemed to know about their circumstances. Time and time again, people would tell me exactly what had led to their family members’ arrests or executions. Jealous neighbors had reported them to the authorities, or colleagues who had been arrested named them under duress. These stories had been passed on from generation to generation. How could they come to know so much, I wondered. They couldn’t. People crafted narratives out of suspicions, rumors and hints, to fill a desperate need for an explanation.\n\nMy favorite book about state terror is Lydia Chukovskaya’s “Sofia Petrovna,” a short Russian novel that has been translated into English. The protagonist, a middle-aged woman loyal to Stalin’s Communist Party, loses her mind trying to make sense of her son’s arrest. My own family history contains a corollary. After the secret police arrested most of the senior staff at the newspaper where my grandfather was a deputy editor, he waited for the knock on his door. When the secret police failed to show up night after night, week after week, he became so distressed that he checked himself into a mental institution. It could be that was how he avoided arrest. Or it could be that the secret police had filled their quota of arrests for that month.\n\nFor this was the secret about the secret police that became clear when the K.G.B. archives were opened (briefly) in the 1990s: They were ruled by quotas. Local squadrons had to arrest a certain number of citizens so they could be designated enemies of the people. That the officers often swept up groups of colleagues, friends and family members was probably a matter of convenience more than anything else. Fundamentally, the terror was random. That is, in fact, how state terror works.\n\nThe randomness is the difference between a regime based on terror and a regime that is plainly repressive. Even in brutally repressive regimes, including those of the Soviet colonies in Eastern Europe, one knew where the boundaries of acceptable behavior lay. Open protest would get one arrested; kitchen conversation would not. Writing subversive essays or novels or editing underground journals would get one arrested; reading these banned works and quietly passing them on to friends probably would not. A regime based on terror, on the other hand, deploys violence precisely to reinforce the message that anyone can be subjected to it.\n\nWhen we think of the terror regimes of the past, it is tempting to superimpose a logical narrative on them, as though totalitarian leaders had an extermination to-do list and worked their way through it methodically. This, I think, is how most people understand Martin Niemöller’s classic poem “First They Came.” In reality, though, the people living under those regimes never knew which group of people would be designated an enemy of the state next.\n\nIn Niemöller’s day, terror was carried out by the secret police and the paramilitary forces — especially the SA, more commonly known as the Brownshirts — whose job it was to instill fear in the population. In 1934, Adolf Hitler had an estimated 150 to 200 members of the SA’s own leadership arrested and its top generals executed in the ultimate demonstration that no one was immune from the state’s deadly violence. Stalin regularly carried out similar purges. Terror itself was not the end goal of those regimes, but nothing that followed would have been possible without it.\n\nThe toolbox isn’t particularly varied. President Trump is using all the instruments: the reported quotas for ICE arrests; the paramilitary force made up of thugs drunk on their own brutality; the spectacle of random violence, particularly in city streets; the postmortem vilification of the victims. It’s only natural that our brains struggle to find logic in what we are seeing. There is a logic, and this logic has a name. It’s called state terror.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

    "description": "The avatar, created to deter young people from extremism, has been subverted and is breaking out of niche online silos",
    "fullText": "The avatar, created to deter young people from extremism, has been subverted and is breaking out of niche online silos\n\nIn certain corners of the internet, on niche news feeds and algorithms, an AI-generated British schoolgirl has emerged as something of a phenomenon.\n\nHer name is Amelia, a purple-haired “goth girl” who proudly carries a mini union flag and appears to have a penchant for racism.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Amelia, the chances are you will soon encounter one viral meme or another inspired by her on Facebook or X, where her reputation is growing.\n\nVideos of Amelia typically feature her walking through London, or the House of Commons, declaring her love for England and warning of the dangers of “militant Muslims” or “third-world migrants”. In one clip she is harangued by bearded man in Islamic attire for eating a pork sausage.\n\nThe message is one well rehearsed on far-right social media, but it is the AI invention of Amelia that has made her endlessly adaptable, creating a viral internet trend that anyone with access to a mainstream chatbot can take part in. Users of X have turned to its Grok AI tool to create so many Amelia memes, she is now breaking out of niche online silos.\n\nThe origins of the character are ironic, to say they least. An early iteration of Amelia began life in a counter-extremism video game funded by the UK Home Office and created to deter young people aged 13-18 from being attracted to far right extremism in Yorkshire.\n\nPathways: Navigating the Internet and Extremism is a simple multiple choice format game with basic animation. Its players are taken on a journey as characters at a college. They are invited to make decisions in scenarios including whether or download potentially extremist content or join an Amelia character on a rally organised by “a small political group” protesting against changes in society and the “erosion in British values”.\n\nCertain scenarios simulated in the game result in a referral under the British government’s Prevent counter-terrorism programme.\n\nHowever, it is a subversion of the Amelia character that has exploded across social media channels in a way that has astonished even the creators of the original game.\n\nAmong the plethora of increasingly sophisticated AI-generated iterations are a Manga-style Amelia, a Wallace and Gromit version and AI-generated “real life” encounters between her and the characters of Father Ted or Harry Potter, accompanied by racist language and far-right messaging.\n\nAnalysis provided to the Guardian by Logically, a UK company that monitors disinformation, indicated that an anonymous account known for skilfully disseminating far-right messaging started the Amelia meme on X on 9 January with a post that has since been viewed 1.4m times.\n\nThe volume of “Ameliaposting” has since gone from an average of 500 a day when that account first introduced it to the world to roughly 10,000, starting on 15 January as it hit international audiences. On Wednesday, it hit 11,137 posts on X alone.\n\nIn one of the most surreal twists, an Amelia cryptocurrency has emerged, with social media users seeking to leverage its value on the meme’s rising profile. On Wednesday, Elon Musk retweeted an X account promoting an Amelia cryptocurrency token.\n\n“What we’re seeing is the monetisation of hate,” said Matteo Bergamini, the founder and CEO of Shout Out UK, a political and media literacy training company that created the original game.\n\n“We’ve seen Telegram groups all messaging each other in Chinese about the meme coin and talking about how to artificially inflate its value, so a lot of money is being made.”\n\nThe company itself has been the target of a deluge of hate mail, including threats that have now been reported to the police.\n\nBergamini points out that the original initiative was never meant to be a stand-alone game. Rather, it was intended to be used in the classrooms alongside a suite of teaching resources, a fact he says coverage and commentary has ignored.\n\n“There has been a lot of misrepresentation unfortunately,” he said. “The game does not state, for example, that questioning mass migration is inherently wrong.”\n\nOthers have suggested the initiative had backfired, not least by casting a “cute goth girl” as a negative character, leading to her inadvertently becoming a focus of admiration. But Bergamini said the game – which used feedback from focus groups with young people and was developed with a specific local threat picture in mind – continued to be used and feedback from schools and others was positive.\n\nNevertheless, the speed and sophistication surrounding the creation of supposedly subversive Amelia memes online has taken him by surprise.\n\n“This experience has shown us why this work is so immensely important, but also gives us pause for thought about our safety in conducting this work due to the highly sophisticated coordination of those who profit from hate,” he said.\n\nSiddharth Venkataramakrishnan, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said: “We have seen the meme having a remarkable spread and proliferating among the far right and beyond, but what’s also been of note is how it is now international.\n\n“In a way it gets to the heart of what we might term the ‘dissident’ far-right – individuals who position themselves outside of the mainstream political scene – whether that’s ‘shitposters’ who are just into provoking, others who are in twee memes. A whole ecosystem has embraced it. Clearly, the sexualised imagery is also key to this. The target audience is almost exclusively young men.”\n\nThe Home Office said Prevent had diverted nearly 6,000 people away from violent ideologies. It added that projects such as the Pathways game were designed to target local radicalisation risks and were created and delivered independently of government.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "Go 1.26 doesn’t introduce dramatic syntax changes or paradigm shifts — and that’s intentional. Instead, it focuses on the kinds of refinements that matter when you’re running long-lived backend services, high-throughput APIs, or performance-sensitive systems: reducing boilerplate, tightening runtime behavior, and improving tooling where engineers actually feel pain.\n\nThis release is less about learning new tricks and more about removing friction you’ve quietly accepted over the years. From cleaner pointer initialization to a garbage collector tuned for modern workloads, Go 1.26 quietly raises the bar for production Go.\n\nThis article walks through what’s new in Go 1.26, why these changes were introduced, and how they solve real problems, all based strictly on the official Go 1.26 release notes.\n\nGo’s evolution has always favored predictability over novelty. That philosophy is especially visible in Go 1.26.\n\nNone of the changes here force rewrites. None break existing code. But together, they address problems teams hit at scale:\n\nGo 1.26 is about making day-to-day engineering easier, in ways that quietly add up over the years.\n\nGo 1.26 allows new to accept an expression instead of just a type. This removes the need for temporary variables when initializing pointer fields, especially common in API models and configuration structs. It makes intent clearer and code easier to read.\n\nBefore Go 1.26, new could only accept a type. Now it can accept an expression.\n\nIn real systems, pointers are often used to represent optional values, not mutability. This shows up everywhere: JSON APIs,config structs,protobufs.\n\nBefore Go 1.26, initializing pointer fields meant awkward patterns:\n\nThe go fix command is now built on Go’s analysis framework, the same foundation used by go vet. This enables smarter, analyzer-driven code fixes that align with current best practices, making large codebase upgrades safer and more predictable.\n\ngo fix has been rebuilt using the same analysis framework that powers go vet. Old fixers are removed; new ones are analyzer-driven and future-proof.\n\nUpgrading Go versions in large codebases is rarely trivial. Teams want:\n\nThe new go fix is designed for real upgrade workflows, not toy examples.\n\nMultiple documentation commands have been removed in favor of a single go doc entry point. This simplifies documentation access, reduces cognitive overhead, and makes it easier for developers—especially newcomers—to find what they need quickly.\n\nGo 1.26 removes cmd/doc and go tool doc. Everything is consolidated under\n\nThis is a classic example of Go reducing cognitive overhead. Multiple commands existed for historical reasons, not because developers needed them.\n\nSmall change, real usability win.\n\nThe pprof web UI now opens with flame graphs by default. Flame graphs make it immediately clear where CPU time is spent, helping engineers identify bottlenecks faster during performance tuning or incident response.\n\nWhen you open the pprof web UI, it now defaults to flame graphs.\n\nFlame graphs answer the first question engineers ask during performance issues:\n\n“Where is my time actually going?”\n\nThis is tooling evolving to match real-world usage.\n\nLighter, cleaner, and easier on the system — like green tea compared to heavy coffee.\n\nWhat the name implies (but does not technically define)\n\nGreen → better locality, efficiency, and less waste\n\nTea → smooth, steady behavior instead of sharp spikes\n\nThe Green Tea garbage collector, previously experimental, is now the default in Go 1.26. It improves scalability and efficiency for programs that allocate many small objects, which is common in high-throughput backend services\n\nModern Go services allocate lots of small objects and run on multi-core machines. Green Tea improves locality and scalability for these workloads.\n\nOpt-out remains available, preserving control for sensitive systems.\n\nGo 1.26 reduces the baseline overhead of cgo calls by about 30%. This directly benefits systems that interact with native libraries, system APIs, or telecom and cryptography stacks — without requiring any code changes.\n\nIf your system integrates with:\n\ncgo overhead becomes visible. Go 1.26 reduces baseline cgo call overhead by about 30% — with no code changes.\n\nThe compiler now uses specialized allocation paths for small objects under 512 bytes. Since most real-world Go programs allocate many small objects, this change improves performance in critical paths like request handling and serialization.\n\nSmall allocations dominate real Go programs:\n\nThis change improves hot paths silently — exactly how performance improvements should work.\n\nThe new crypto/hpke package implements Hybrid Public Key Encryption (RFC 9180). It enables modern, standardized encryption workflows directly in the Go standard library, reducing reliance on third-party crypto implementations.\n\nThis experimental package provides architecture-specific SIMD helpers.

It focuses on the realities of production systems: performance under load, maintainability over time, and tooling that helps rather than distracts. These changes don’t demand attention, but they reward it. For teams building serious, long-lived systems, Go 1.26 quietly reinforces why Go remains one of the most dependable choices in backend engineering.\n\nThis article is published in collaboration with Sadanand Dodawadakar",

    "description": "A research paper suggests AI agents are mathematically doomed to fail. The industry doesn’t agree.",
    "fullText": "companies promised us that 2025 would be “the year of the AI agents.” It turned out to be the year of talking about AI agents, and kicking the can for that transformational moment to 2026 or maybe later. But what if the answer to the question “When will our lives be fully automated by generative AI robots that perform our tasks for us and basically run the world?” is, like that New Yorker cartoon, “How about never?”\n\nThat was basically the message of a paper published without much fanfare some months ago, smack in the middle of the overhyped year of “agentic AI.” Entitled “Hallucination Stations: On Some Basic Limitations of Transformer-Based Language Models,” it purports to mathematically show that “LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity.” Though the science is beyond me, the authors—a former SAP CTO who studied AI under one of the field’s founding intellects, John McCarthy, and his teenage prodigy son—punctured the vision of agentic paradise with the certainty of mathematics. Even reasoning models that go beyond the pure word-prediction process of LLMs, they say, won’t fix the problem.\n\n“There is no way they can be reliable,” Vishal Sikka, the dad, tells me. After a career that, in addition to SAP, included a stint as Infosys CEO and an Oracle board member, he currently heads an AI services startup called Vianai. “So we should forget about AI agents running nuclear power plants?” I ask. “Exactly,” he says. Maybe you can get it to file some papers or something to save time, but you might have to resign yourself to some mistakes.\n\nThe AI industry begs to differ. For one thing, a big success in agent AI has been coding, which took off last year. Just this week at Davos, Google’s Nobel-winning head of AI, Demis Hassabis, reported breakthroughs in minimizing hallucinations, and hyperscalers and startups alike are pushing the agent narrative. Now they have some backup. A startup called Harmonic is reporting a breakthrough in AI coding that also hinges on mathematics—and tops benchmarks on reliability.\n\nHarmonic, which was cofounded by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Tudor Achim, a Stanford-trained mathematician, claims this recent improvement to its product called Aristotle (no hubris there!) is an indication that there are ways to guarantee the trustworthiness of AI systems. “Are we doomed to be in a world where AI just generates slop and humans can't really check it? That would be a crazy world,” says Achim. Harmonic’s solution is to use formal methods of mathematical reasoning to verify an LLM’s output. Specifically, it encodes outputs in the Lean programming language, which is known for its ability to verify the coding. To be sure, Harmonic’s focus to date has been narrow—its key mission is the pursuit of “mathematical superintelligence,” and coding is a somewhat organic extension. Things like history essays—which can’t be mathematically verified—are beyond its boundaries. For now.\n\nNonetheless, Achim doesn’t seem to think that reliable agentic behavior is as much an issue as some critics believe. “I would say that most models at this point have the level of pure intelligence required to reason through booking a travel itinerary,” he says.\n\nBoth sides are right—or maybe even on the same side. On one hand, everyone agrees that hallucinations will continue to be a vexing reality. In a paper published last September, OpenAI scientists wrote, “Despite significant progress, hallucinations continue to plague the field, and are still present in the latest models.” They proved that unhappy claim by asking three models, including ChatGPT, to provide the title of the lead author’s dissertation. All three made up fake titles and all misreported the year of publication. In a blog about the paper, OpenAI glumly stated that in AI models, “accuracy will never reach 100 percent.”",

Essentially, whoever creates the software (bootloader, kernel) generates a pair of public and private keys.\nThe creator uses the private key (which remains private to them) to sign the software and distributes the public key to say: “Hey, you can verify that this software was created by me using this public key”\n\nUsually, UEFI has a very limited set of public keys that it trusts (Microsoft, for instance), so if the software is signed by Microsoft, it can use the public key available in its super small “database” to verify the origin of the bootloader.\nBut what should be done in the case of Linux? UEFI is firmware that resides on a small chip on the motherboard, and it would not be feasible to add public keys for all the different Linux distributions.\nEssentially, there is a trust gap between motherboard manufacturers and Linux organizations.\n\nHow was this solved? They all agreed to trust one universal key: the Microsoft UEFI CA key.\nLinux distributions create a file called SHIM that contains their public key. They send this file to Microsoft only once, which signs it, and the Linux distribution integrates this file into the bootloader.\nAt this point, UEFI checks this file. It can trust it because it recognizes the Microsoft public key and obtains the bootloader’s public key from SHIM.\nIt can then verify the bootloader code signed by the Linux distribution.\n\nThis describes how it works a simple but powerful chain of trust that works regardless of all technical and organizational limitations.",

    "fullText": "There has been open criticism of Michael Carrick's backroom staff appointments at Manchester United, which is one of the most important issues any manager has to address when joining a new club.\n\nUsing my experience of that situation, I want to try to explain his thinking with the people he has brought in since he was named interim head coach, and how I believe what he has done can only be viewed as sensible. It's certainly a long way removed from the accusation that he has just brought in a bunch of his mates.\n\nMichael's aim at United is the same as every manager when you first arrive in a job. You want to establish quickly a clear and defined alignment between yourself and the different football departments within the organisation that you have just inherited.\n\nYou have to be clear on your objectives and set certain principles in the first few days - like a work ethic, for example - that are non-negotiable and must be made absolutely clear to players and staff members who have not worked with you before.\n\nBuilding a strong base with everyone pulling in the same direction takes time and, initially, it can lead to some forms of confrontation with existing members of the playing and coaching staff.\n\nTo be absolutely clear in communicating your intended direction for the club, I believe the manager has to appoint his own members of staff. I always wanted to bring in people I could trust and who were competent in the responsibilities I would delegate to them.\n\nA manager's job is fraught with pressures and if the most important aspects are not prioritised, the amount of work needed in other areas of the club can become a drain on his ability to perform, on game days or away from those match situations.\n\nThis is where your backroom staff is all-important, and it is the same at every club.\n\nI am sure Michael understands that winning games is the be-all and end-all of what supporters want but, behind the scenes, work has to be performed to generate a togetherness and belief in a way that will produce those winning performances.",

    "fullText": "Novak Djokovic's hopes of a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title have been boosted after his fourth-round opponent Jakub Mensik withdrew from the Australian Open with an abdominal injury.\n\nDjokovic was scheduled to face the 20-year-old Czech during Monday's evening session in Melbourne but he will now progress straight through to the quarter-finals.\n\nHe will face either fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti of Italy or American ninth seed Taylor Fritz in the last eight.\n\nThe news follows the withdrawal of two-time champion Naomi Osaka on Saturday, while others - such as 2025 winner Jannik Sinner - have struggled in the heat, which is forecast to rise as high as 42C on Tuesday.\n\nShould the remainder of the draw go with seedings, 38-year-old Serb Djokovic could then come up against Sinner in the semi-finals and world number one Carlos Alcaraz in the final.\n\nHis most recent Grand Slam success came at the 2023 US Open and he is currently level with Margaret Court on 24 major titles.\n\nDjokovic, who is yet to drop a set at this year's Australian Open, went out in the semi-finals of all four Grand Slams in 2025.\n\nSpeaking after his third-round win over Botic van de Zandschulp on Saturday, he said: \"[I feel] really good. It's been a great start to the tournament.\n\n\"Obviously things can change. I'm not getting ahead of myself because last year I learned a lesson.\n\n\"I got too excited too early in some of the Grand Slams, playing really well and getting to the quarters and semis, and then getting injured in pretty much three out of four last year.\"",

    "title": "How buying a private jet cost Scottie and Larsa Pippen millions: \"We should have never bought this plane\"",
    "description": "Buying a jet cost Pippen a fortune.",
    "fullText": "Scottie Pippen finally got the money he felt he always deserved when he signed a $67 million deal with the Chicago Bulls before he was traded to the Houston Rockets in 1999. Armed with a new contract, Pippen's lifestyle changed as well.\n\nPippen bought a $10 million yacht, named it Lady Larsa and then built a huge house in Fort Lauderdale. But there was one luxury that he always wanted that some of his more well-endowed friends had — a private jet.\n\nBecause he did not own a plane, Scottie flew on charter flights. In one of his trips, he met a Florida charter operator named Craig Frost, who piloted his own jet. In early 2002, Frost convinced Pippen that instead of spending a lot of money on chartered flights, he might as well buy his own plane.\n\nAnd because Frost was in the charter business, he offered Pippen a deal to make him a co-owner of a Grumman Gulfstream II jet that he flew and that Scottie had flown and liked. Under the agreement, Pippen would pay him $4.375 million as his share of the plane's cost. In return, he could use it as needed, and if he did not have a trip, they could rent the jet and share in the profits.\n\nTo finance the cost, Pippen and his then-wife, Larsa, established \"Air Pip\" LLC and loaned the $4.375 million from JODA LLC, an aircraft finance company based in Chesterfield, St. Louis. But by September 2002, Larsa called Scottie's investment advisor, Bob Lunna, and told him they believed Frost wasn't maintaining the plane properly and that she no longer felt safe flying in their own aircraft.\n\n\"We should have never bought this plane,\" Larsa said, according to Lunn. \"We hired you to prevent us from making decisions like this. You're supposed to protect us from ourselves.\"\n\nPippen stopped making payments on the loan in 2003, citing that he was duped by Frost and Lunn. The following year, the lender sold Scottie's promissory note to a bank, which then sued the company for non-payment of the debt.\n\nThrough his lawyers, Pippen argued that he was a victim of a conspiracy plotted by people he trusted to do the deal — meaning Frost and Lunn. He lost the case and a succeeding appeal was made to pay $5 million.\n\nAfter losing the appeal in 2007, Pippen sued Frost and won a $2.37 million judgment against Frost and his company, CF Air. In 2010, Scottie also filed a case against the Chicago Law Firm Pedersen & Houpt for failing to closely monitor the purchase of the plane. Pippen sought $8 million from that malpractice case and was awarded $2 million instead.\n\nLooking back, Scottie essentially recouped the $4.3 million through the two court cases he won. But it came after years of litigation and legal expenses.\n\nAlthough Scottie made over $109 million during his 18-year NBA career, he would have spared himself unnecessary spending of millions if only he had listened to Lunn, who claimed that in 1999 he had advised Pip against buying a jet because of maintenance expenses. But Scottie did not listen.\n\n\"He's a big dog,\" Lunn said. \"His buddies are flying around in private jets; he wants to fly around in a private jet. It was an ego thing…He kept pounding me. He had a serious ambition to own his own airplane.\"\n\nWell, the \"big dog\" learned his lesson the hard way.",

    "description": "China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing",
    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing modernises its forces and tries to further project its might.\n\nZhang Youxia serves as second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central ​Military Commission - the supreme command body - and has long been seen as Xi's closest military ally.\n\nThe ministry said Zhang and Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the ‌CMC's Joint Staff Department, were under investigation for suspected serious violations of discipline and law.\n\nZhang is also a member of the elite Politburo of the ruling Communist Party and is one of just a few leading officers with ‌combat experience.\n\nSWEEPING CRACKDOWN TARGETS MILITARY\n\nThe military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi in 2012. That drive reached the upper echelons of the People's Liberation Army in 2023 when the elite Rocket Force was targeted.\n\nZhang's removal is the second of a sitting general on the Central Military Commission since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He has not been seen in public since November 20, when he held talks with Russia's defence minister in Moscow.\n\nForeign diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, given Zhang's closeness to Xi and the importance of the commission's work ⁠in terms of command as well as the PLA's ongoing ‌military modernisation and posture.\n\nWhile China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly muscular line in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Beijing staged the ‍largest military exercises to date around Taiwan late last year.\n\nSingapore-based China security scholar James Char said the military's daily operations could carry on as normal despite the purges but the targeting of Zhang showed Xi was reacting to criticism that the crackdown had been too selective.\n\n\"Xi has been tapping on second-line PLA officers to fill those roles vacated by their predecessors – on an interim basis in most cases,\" said Char, ​a scholar at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"China’s military modernizers will continue to push for the two goals Xi has set for the PLA – namely, 2035 to basically complete ‌its modernisation and 2049 to become a world-class armed forces.\"\n\nZhang is the second vice chair of the CMC to fall from grace in recent months. Former CMC vice chair He Weidong was expelled from the party and PLA in October last year for corruption. He was replaced by Zhang Shengmin.\n\nEight top generals were expelled from the Communist Party on graft charges in October 2025, including He Weidong.\n\nTwo former defence ministers were also purged from the ruling party in recent years for corruption. The crackdown is slowing procurement of advanced weaponry and hitting the revenues of some of China's biggest defence firms.\n\nBoth Xi and Zhang are from the northwestern province of Shaanxi and are the children of former senior officials who fought together ⁠in the 1940s civil war.\n\nBorn in Beijing, Zhang joined the army in 1968, rising through the ranks ​and joining the military commission in late 2012 as the PLA's modernisation drive gathered pace.\n\nA Pentagon profile of Zhang ​in late 2023 noted that Zhang had been expected to retire in 2022, aged 72, given usual military practice.\n\n\"However, Zhang's retention on the CMC for a third term probably reflects Xi's desire to keep a close and experienced ally as his top military adviser,\" the profile said, contained within the ‍Pentagon's annual report on China's military that year.\n\nHe ⁠fought Vietnam in a brief but bloody border war in 1979 that China launched in punishment for Vietnam invading Cambodia the previous year and ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge.\n\nZhang was 26 when he was sent to the front lines to fight the Vietnamese and was quickly promoted, according to state media. He also fought in another border ⁠clash with Vietnam in 1984 as the conflict rumbled on.\n\n\"During the battle, whether attacking or defending, Zhang Youxia performed excellently,\" the official China Youth Daily wrote in a 2017 piece entitled, \"These Chinese generals have killed the enemy ‌on the battlefield\".\n\nSome China scholars have noted that Zhang emerged from the conflict an avowed moderniser in terms of military tactics, weapons and the need for ‌a better trained force.",

So, if you're concerned that Social Security might not replace your income and fully support the retirement you want, it could pay to speak to a qualified financial advisor to ensure you’re maximizing your retirement contributions and creating a stronger bankroll for your golden years.\n\nHiring an advisor can be a lifelong commitment, which might make or break your retirement. That’s why finding reliable advisors is crucial.\n\nFortunately, finding the right advisor is simple with Advisor.com. Their platform connects you with licensed financial professionals in your area who can provide personalized guidance.\n\nA professional advisor can also help you determine how many years you have left to invest before retirement and assess your comfort level with market fluctuations — two key factors in building the right asset mix for your portfolio.\n\nThrough Advisor.com, you can schedule a free, no-obligation consultation to discuss your retirement goals and start building a long-term financial plan beyond Social Security.",

    "description": "Jerry Clark says he's transformed his tastebuds, changed his portion sizes, and made fitness a non-negotiable.",
    "fullText": "A man gained 50 pounds after he quit the army and started driving — and sitting — for a living.\n\nA fitness and nutrition program designed to reverse diabetes has helped him lose 75 pounds.\n\nHe still sits for long hours, but packs his own lunch and makes sure to exercise 6 days a week.\n\nWhen Jerry Clark decided to quit the Army, hit the road, and start driving long-haul truck routes 34 years ago, he had no idea what a dramatic impact the career change would have on his body.\n\n\"A truck driver is the worst job in the world for health,\" Clark told Business Insider.\n\nArguably, no one is required to sit more on the job than a truck driver. And we all know sitting is the new smoking.\n\nClark spent years tag-teaming across the country with his wife on trucker routes. At one point, before she retired, they were logging 8,000 miles together every workweek. The pair would drive almost three full lengths across the continent each week, eating whatever they could find to sustain them along the way.\n\n\"We eat at the greasy spoons,\" Clark said, explaining the average truck driver's meal plan. \"Everything is grease, or fried.\"\n\nAll that sitting and eating greasy food can lead to long-term health issues and body imbalances. Clark developed a stronger left leg from operating his clutch and a stronger right arm from being at the wheel for half of the day. He also gained over 50 pounds over the course of three decades.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, when he heard his employer was offering free nutrition coaching for people with diabetes through Virta Health, he wondered if he might be eligible to join the low-carb program, even though he has normal blood sugar and doesn't need to \"reverse type 2 diabetes,\" as the company promises. Sure enough, his employer allowed him to try it out.\n\nClark has lost over 75 pounds in the program and has discovered he has renewed energy for both work and hobbies, including wood carving. He says he's trimmer now than he was when he left the Army in his mid-20s. He's spent the past several months maintaining his weight and working on muscle building.\n\n\"I look pretty dang-on good right now for a 58-year-old guy,\" he said. \"Almost getting a six pack back.\"\n\nHe has also helped his son lose over 100 pounds using the nutrition techniques he's learned, which are in line with some of the recent federal nutrition guidelines, released in January.\n\nThis is no coincidence: Virta co-founder Jeff Volek helped draft the Trump Administration's new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourage people to skip ultra-processed foods and added sugar, prioritizing animal protein and \"healthy\" fats.\n\nNow Clark eats more whole foods than he used to, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. He doesn't fuss too much about fat, especially the kind of fats in nuts, fish, and lean proteins like chicken.\n\n\"My journey's not over, but I am getting there,\" he said.\n\nMany nutrition experts say low-carb ketogenic diet plans like the one he's following are not right for everyone. Generally speaking, people without diabetes could benefit from more fiber and whole grains than this style of eating typically provides. Still, there are a few nutrition basics that just about every \"healthy\" diet plan agrees upon. Virta's low-carb strategy is no exception. Plants like fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds are good. Extra sugar and empty calories from white bread, cakes, and sodas? Not so much.\n\n\"There's this base of knowledge which is pretty translatable between different diet camps,\" nutrition scientist and ultra-processed food researcher Kevin Hall, co-author of the book \"Food Intelligence,\" previously told Business Insider. \"All of the camps can sort of agree on non-starchy vegetables and lowering added sugar.\"\n\nHall has performed studies showing that low-carb diets are not any better than low-fat diets, when it comes to how much fat people lose. Low-carb diets can be helpful for stabilizing blood sugar in patients with diabetes, but it's the quality of a person's diet that matters most.\n\n\"For the vast majority of people, it's really the processed and refined carbohydrates that they should avoid,\" Hall said. Carb-forward beans and strawberries, loaded with fiber and antioxidants, are great choices for most people.\n\nAnother big reason for the success of Virta patients like Clark, according to former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. David Kessler, is the \"built-in accountability\" that patients get from Virta's intensive, personalized coaching model, as he explains in his new book \"Diet, Drugs, and Dopamine: the New Science of Achieving a Healthy Weight.\"\n\nAs for Clark, he has a few evidence-based nutrition moves he credits with helping him make the lasting diet changes that he plans to stick to for the long haul.\n\nWhen Clark drives his 600-mile route from North Carolina to West Virginia and back overnight, he brings his own \"lunch,\" or gets a few essentials from the supermarket. No more greasy spoons. Broccoli, leafy lettuces, and cucumbers are now staple foods at his house for lunch and dinner.\n\n\"I'll pack a chicken breast and some broccoli, and then at around midnight when I get to a truck stop, I'll pull in and pop it in a microwave, and I'm pretty happy,\" he said.\n\nWith the help of his nutrition coach, Clark started meal prepping and shopping around the perimeter of the grocery store, a classic pro-nutrition move.\n\n\"Most of the crap is in the middle,\" he said.\n\nClark has found that over time, he is craving less sugar. It helps that he doesn't keep junk food in the house, since it's typically loaded with sugar, saturated fat, and refined flour. Now, he finds he wants veggies and other whole foods, including deer and rabbit for dinner, and blueberries as a sweet treat.\n\n\"Food itself tastes good as long as you change your taste buds,\" he said. \"It's going to take you a month for your taste buds to change.\"\n\nStudies suggest that most of our taste buds regenerate about every 10 days, but some take longer to turn over, around three weeks or so.\n\nClark said he still enjoys many of the same foods he used to eat, he just prepares them differently now.\n\n\"You can have the same stuff,\" he said. \"You can't have all the added crap that America puts on it.\"\n\nFor him, that means rotisserie chicken instead of fried chicken and homemade ice cream made from whipping cream and eggs, with far less sugar than store-bought tubs.\n\nThough the Clark house generally stays away from fast food and ultra-processed groceries now, there is some occasional wiggle room from time to time for a low-calorie, low-carb, ultra-processed dessert like Cool Whip with Jell-O. Even that's pretty rare these days, Clark said.\n\nClark says one of his biggest challenges in the program has been learning not to overeat. It's something he's talked over with his coach.\n\n\"I am an over eater — that's my biggest problem,\" he said. \"I like mass quantities of food.\"\n\nObesity medicine doctors say that's likely because Clark's \"enough\" point became dysregulated: as he gained weight, his brain sent signals to his body to eat more and store more fat, in protection mode against starvation.\n\nWith guidance tailored to his body size and a kitchen scale, Clark started measuring out a recommended 7 ounces of protein for lunch and dinner. But his coach also gave him a quick shortcut for thinking about his portion sizes.\n\n\"Your hand is your best tool,\" he said. \"The palm of your hand without your fingers is approximately 7 ounces, that's a portion of meat.\"\n\nWhen Clark started adding regular weightlifting into his workout routine, the number on his bathroom scale stagnated. His coach encouraged him to focus on other metrics instead.\n\n\"My muscles are getting bigger, and my waist is getting smaller,\" he said. \"My coach said, 'If you're happy with what you see in the mirror, be happy.'\"\n\nClark has been openly sharing his nutrition strategy with family and friends. His son has lost over 100 pounds using his techniques, and one of his long-haul trucking buddies has lost over 80 pounds.\n\n\"We talk every night: 'Hey man, what'd you eat today? Did you work out?'\" Clark said. It's another time-tested strategy: couples, friends, and families who lose weight together tend to have better long-term success.\n\nNow, Clark's wife is getting interested in the program.\n\n\"She sees me, and she's like, 'Man, you're doing really good. I want to try that.'\"\n\nFinally, Clark has developed a new routine of working out 6 days a week, alternating heart-healthy cardio (like a run) with weightlifting every other day. Building muscle mass is a great way to maintain the right kind of weight loss, encouraging the body to shed fat instead of muscle. If he's hungry after, he grabs a protein shake \"to fill my muscle stores up.\"\n\n\"I told my wife: one hour a day, I don't want anybody to bother me,\" Clark said. \"No phone calls, no 'honey, you got to fix the toilet, mow the grass.'\"\n\nNow, he looks forward to the dedicated, sacred time for workouts.\n\n\"An hour out of a day? Come on. That's nothing. Give it to yourself and then make it work,\" he said.",

    "description": "The 'Real Time With Bill Maher' host didn't hold back with his bold declaration.",
    "fullText": "Bill Maher made a blunt prediction about the midterm elections amid the intensified ICE raids in Minnesota.\n\nOn the Friday, January 23 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the host, 70, made his 2026 return after an extended holiday break.\n\nDuring a discussion with guest panelists, U.S. Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana and CNN analyst Kasie Hunt, Maher brought up the increasingly aggressive ICE in Minnesota.\n\n“Suggestion for the people in Minneapolis,” he said. “How about this? It’s so cold in this country, this storm that’s happening. How about it’s too cold to fight, and use that as an excuse, a face-saving excuse for everybody just to go home.”\n\nMaher continued, “ICE, you made your point. You made your point, OK? We got into something with too many illegals. Yes, that happened under [Joe] Biden. But these images, like I said, really ugly. I mean, when I think of some of these things that we’ve seen.”\n\n“The guy out in his underwear, no clothes on in the cold,” he began, narrating photos on the screen, of an American citizen who was detained with barley any clothing.\n\n“The kid,” he added, of a 5-year-old asylum seeker who was detained shortly after arriving home from preschool.\n\nMaher continued, “The pepper spray in the face, the disabled lady being pulled out of her car.”\n\nThat’s when Maher turned to Kennedy and said, “John, I’m just going to say it to you,” he began. “I’m not trying to pick a fight right away.”\n\nHe then boldly declared, “My prediction is this stuff, your party is going to get the dog s*** kicked out of you in the midterms. Because this is not what people voted for, and they’re going to hold the party responsible, as they should.”\n\nTo that, Kennedy pointed out, “I support enforcing our immigration laws. Now, how you enforce them matters.”\n\nReal Time With Bill Maher, Fridays at 10/9c, HBO\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

Look at Aggie Beever-Jones or Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s uncharacteristic hesitancy in the box in the second half, or the three shots Lauren James struck off-target in the final ten minutes.\n\nListen to Sonia Bompastor in the post-match press conference, unable to answer after being asked what had caused her side’s run of seven points in five Women’s Super League games.\n\nIn so many ways, Chelsea did not look like Chelsea on Saturday: they looked beatable.\n\nBompastor’s comments took place against a soundtrack of muffled dance music, presumably coming from the nearby away dressing room as Arsenal’s players celebrated a first win away at Chelsea in the league since September 2018.\n\nAfter an even but goalless first half, Beth Mead slotted Arsenal in front ten minutes after the break and Mariona Caldentey doubled the lead just after the hour. Chelsea let a series of promising chances go begging and are now six points behind leaders Manchester City, who play eighth-placed London City Lionesses today.\n\nThere are simply not enough superlatives to explain the excellence of @ArsenalWFC’s Mariona Caldentey 🌟#BarclaysWSL pic.twitter.com/YBHC7KTCvP\n\n— Barclays Women’s Super League (@BarclaysWSL) January 24, 2026\n\nThe most significant thing about Saturday’s result, though, is not necessarily its implications for the title race, in which City were already clear favourites. It is more that Chelsea’s aura of invincibility took a major beating.\n\nChelsea have lost before. Everton, who sit tenth, beat them 1-0 in December — but that felt like a defeat against the run of play, which could mostly be put down to Chelsea’s wastefulness (as well as Everton’s dogged defending). This was different; this time they were outplayed.\n\nRenee Slegers’ game plan worked perfectly, with Emily Fox and Katie McCabe pinning wing-backs Sandy Baltimore and Ellie Carpenter. The pair, usually crucial to how Chelsea progress up the pitch, had little space and were not able to link up with the forward line. Arsenal’s press saw Chelsea struggle to play out from the back, and they struggled to pick their way through the midfield, having to resort to long balls. Alyssa Thompson, playing up front with Kerr, was the main outlet — but her constant chasing in the channels stopped her threatening in the central area.\n\nChelsea were physically outfought, too, unable to make any of their nine corners count. Bompastor said her side were “not aggressive enough”, allowing Arsenal too much space to build their confidence.\n\nTheir finishing let them down, as it has multiple times this season. Of their 18 attempts, only one — a long-range effort from Lucy Bronze, comfortably saved — was on target. What is worrying for Chelsea is that this poor finishing is no longer a blip or a dry spell; it has persisted throughout the campaign. They have still scored in all but two of their games this season, but no longer feel like the same inevitable force in front of goal.\n\nThat bluntness is one thing — but the major lesson the rest of the WSL will take from today is that Chelsea can be outplayed. Rather than sitting back and hoping that Chelsea’s huffing and puffing will not blow their house down, there are ways to proactively hurt them.\n\nChelsea have looked imperfect before. They have looked wasteful before. But they have never looked low on confidence. Their dominance has been built on a deep, high-quality squad, and an unshakeable belief that they will come out on top. That is now being truly tested, as was clear from Bompastor’s words post-match.\n\n“Sometimes you need to recognise the other team was better than us today,” Bompastor said. “I think that’s what brings the excitement in this league, because the competition is high and I think to be able to perform in every game and to win every game, it’s tough.”\n\nShe is, of course, absolutely right. Chelsea’s consistency has defied logic — but they have never seemed to doubt their ability to keep it up. If they allow that faith in themselves to slip, it will only feed other teams’ confidence.\n\nIf Beth Mead has time and space, there is only ever ONE outcome 🔥@ArsenalWFC @BarclaysWSL pic.twitter.com/JBMG6r9Fo6\n\n— Barclays Women’s Super League (@BarclaysWSL) January 24, 2026\n\nSo what does a beatable Chelsea mean?\n\nFor Manchester City, their path to the title is clearer than ever. If they beat London City, they will move nine points clear — and have the opportunity to deal Chelsea a body blow in person next weekend when Bompastor’s side come to the Joie Stadium. For the rest of the chasing pack — Arsenal, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur — it means the Champions League race feels more open than ever. Chelsea are only in the top three by four points, and Tottenham and United have a game in hand.\n\nFor Chelsea, being beatable means their guard must be up. Not every WSL side has the quality that Arsenal used to exploit their weaknesses today, or to execute a similar gameplan — but the few that do will be smelling blood. They still need to face City and United again in the league, as well as a possible Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal if Slegers’ side make it through the playoffs.\n\nChelsea know what it is to be the team everyone wants to beat, and have worn that as a badge of honour. The challenge now is to stop it from becoming a target on their backs.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Here's why.\n\nIt's no secret that Memphis has a couple of young prospects that are already paying dividends this year.\n\nCam Spencer, a second-year guard out of UConn, has been a sparkplug for the Grizzlies offense. He averages 12 points per game and boasts a 46% clip from the 3-point line. He's been a big benefactor in games Morant is out and should continue to shine in his absence.\n\n21 PTS 💥 5 REB 💥 11 AST 💥 7/9 FG\n\nANOTHER double-double for Cam Spencer! The former @memphishustle assignee has now racked up six double-digit assist games this season. #GLeagueAlumpic.twitter.com/GrTNNRq9oL\n\n— NBA G League (@nbagleague) January 24, 2026\n\nCoward, a rookie out of Washington St., has risen to one of the more reliable Memphis players. He averages 14 point and 6.4 rebounds per game. With Morant gone, more of the scoring responsibility will go to him.\n\nBoth Coward and Spencer will have more opportunities to develop as young players with Morant's usage gone from the offense. It could increase their confidence and growth to fill bigger roles even when Morant returns.\n\nWhile Ja gets nursed back to health, reinforcements are on the way for the Memphis backcourt.\n\nJerome, a big offseason signing for the Grizzlies, has not taken the floor yet this season. He suffered a calf strain in preseason but is nearing his return in the coming weeks.\n\nTy Jerome is doing 5-on-5 work in practice. Tuomas Iisalo said he needs to build up over the next week or two for game action.\n\n“We are very close.”\n\n— Damichael Cole (@DamichaelC) January 23, 2026\n\nScotty Pippen Jr. also has hardly seen the floor this year after suffering from a left toe injury. He had surgery in October of 2025 and is expected to return in February.\n\nMORE: How long is Ja Morant out? Grizzlies guard to miss significant time with UCL injury\n\nBoth those players can command an offense and generate baskets themselves or by setting up others. It's what Memphis will need in Morant's absence.\n\nMorant, as talented as he is, is followed by the stench of controversy. Whether it's the multiple gun-related suspensions or his outspoken father, the All-Star point guard dominates headlines for the wrong reasons.\n\nIt was just last week that a heated conversation between Morant and teammate Vince Williams was caught on camera.\n\nJa Morant’s heated argument with Grizzlies teammate Vince Williams Jr. has been revealed 🗣️\n\nMorant: “It is what it is. Y’all don’t **** with me, I don’t **** with y’all. WHAT. WHAT. WHAT?”\n\nWilliams Jr.: “Let’s go to the back.”\n\nMorant: “Why? I’m right here. I’m right here! 5… pic.twitter.com/B8EzroDnjJ\n\n— Courtside Buzz (@CourtsideBuzzX) January 15, 2026\n\nCombine that with Morant being in trade rumors, all is not peaceful inside that locker room.\n\nThe Grizzlies obviously don't want to be without their best player. But there are reasons to see why they could be better off with some of their younger pieces taking on bigger roles.\n\nMorant will be out at least three weeks so Memphis will have plenty of time to see how the group responds.\n\nMORE:76ers' Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe address rumors after sideline argument",

    "fullText": "The Henderson Silver Knights paid tribute to the International Hockey League’s Las Vegas Thunder, and they did good to live up to the memory of Southern Nevada’s first professional hockey team.\n\nOn Saturday, the Silver Knights relied on late-game heroics and strong defense to ride out a close 4-3 victory over the Tucson Roadrunners.\n\nIt would not take long for the Silver Knights to get themselves on the board. Ten seconds into their first power play, the Silver Knights were able to cash in for an early lead. Lukas Cormier, making his return to the lineup, got a shot off from the point, and Kai Uchacz took advantage of the chaos and finished the play by sliding the puck past Roadrunners goaltender Matthew Villalta to break the ice.\n\nMinutes later, Sloan Stanick would keep his momentum rolling and give his team a cushion. The undrafted forward has already made waves early in his time in Henderson, and he did it again on an incredible solo effort. Getting a turnover in the offensive zone, Stanick launched a wicked shot that beat Villalta clean and secured his third goal in his first five AHL games.\n\n“He’s gotten to the hard areas to score goals,” said head coach Ryan Craig about the rookie. “I think his first two goals were from the top of the crease. His goal tonight, he reloads back above and scores between the hashmarks with a real good shot.”\n\nThe good times would not always last, however. Andrew Agozzino would put Tucson on the board on a quick-developing play to make good on the Roadrunners’ first possession in the offensive zone.\n\nNo change in the score during the second period, but what remained apparent was how aggressive the Silver Knights forecheck was. By the time the second was over, they had limited the Roadrunners to only seven shots.\n\n“They didn’t have any offense,” said forward Tuomas Uronen.\n\nJesper Vikman would be up for the challenge, however, especially on a breakaway save in the second period.\n\n“Every save matters. Obviously, that one maybe meant a little more to our team,” said Vikman.\n\nThe third period would see the Roadrunners catch yet another break. Keeping the play on the offensive zone by mere inches, Tyler Tullio was able to best Vikman on the glove side to tie the game up at two.\n\nHowever, the Henderson power play would once again make the difference. Taking advantage of a prolonged power play and Villalta breaking his stick, Uronen saw his opportunity and beat a Roadrunners defender to the front of the net. The Finn did not miss from point blank range, getting the puck between Villalta’s pads to put the Silver Knights back in the lead.\n\n“There’s moments in games, and I think that was the moment in this game,” said Uronen on the quick play.\n\nUronen would finish the job on another power play, besting Villalta with a beautiful shot off the post and into the net.\n\nAn Austin Poganski deflection would cut the lead back down to one to keep things interesting, but the Silver Knights would close the deal out to take the fans and Thunder alumni home happy.\n\nHowever, Craig wants more as the Silver Knights approach the second half of the season.\n\n“Still learning, still growing,” said Craig about his team. “We haven’t necessarily seen everybody together for a little while, which is okay. Opportunities are here for guys.”",

    "fullText": "Snowboarder Scotty James parlayed a never-before-landed trick combination into his fifth straight X Games title on the halfpipe Saturday and tied Shaun White with eight overall gold medals at the biggest event this side of the Olympics.\n\nIn the final major contest before next month's Milan Cortina Games, the 31-year-old Aussie capped off his winning run with two straight backside 1440-degree jumps. That's two tricks spinning with his back facing down the hill to start, one while riding forward, the other riding backward — or “switch.” They are among the toughest on the halfpipe.\n\nJames briefly put his hand onto the snow to stay upright after the second jump, but the judges rewarded him anyway. His score of 95 easily beat second-place finisher Haku Shimasaki of Japan.\n\n“I felt I wanted to do something for myself and for halfpipe and to push backside riding as much as I can,” said Scott, who wore his trademark red boxing gloves and celebrated by crowd surfing into the hundreds of fans who watched the action in Aspen, Colorado. “Tonight, I think it always was the plan. I wanted to come out and do the first back-to-back backside 14s, and I'm pumped.”\n\nJames is looking like the favorite heading into the Milan Cortina Olympics. Last week, he won the Laax Open in Switzerland — a contest in which defending Olympic champion Ayumu Hirano suffered a nasty fall and broke bones in his face, throwing his status for next month's Olympic halfpipe contest into limbo.\n\nJames has Olympic silver and bronze medals. In a documentary on his life that dropped earlier this Winter, he made no secret that he needs the Olympic gold to round out an otherwise impeccable career.\n\nJames has also shown a triple cork — three head-over-heels flips — as part of his repertoire this season, though the back-to-back 1440s was something nobody had seen.\n\nHe said he has always admired groundbreakers, such as slopestyler Mark McMorris, 2014 Olympic halfpipe champion Iouri Podladtchikov (the iPod) and White, and wanted to use this latest X Games performance to add something new.\n\n“I get a chip on my shoulder every year, thinking maybe I wouldn't be expected to show up and try again and win again,” he said. “I managed to do that today, and I'm speechless, honestly.”\n\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor years, the UFC promoted Paddy Pimblett as the next big thing. His rise to the top was meant to result in the Liverpool-born fighter holding gold.\n\nHowever, in his path at UFC 324 was a dangerous Justin Gaethje, who brutalized “The Baddy” for five rounds to once again win interim lightweight gold.\n\nThe UFC’s first show on Paramount+ began with a retrospective on the promotion's history, honoring those who laid the foundations for what it is today. UFC 324 showcased the future, with fighters using their skills to deliver highlight-reel wins.\n\nIt also helped that the UFC recently upped the ante with performance bonuses ($25k for KOs), as the first four bouts ended via knockout. The theme of the night transitioned smoothly to the main event.\n\nGaethje (27-5) came into the fight looking to retire as champion by 2027. He started guns blazing and didn’t slow down. “The Highlight” landed several uppercuts and jabs that cut the face of Pimblett (23–4), participating in the toughest fight of his career.\n\nThe eyes of Pimblett got poked at one point. He attempted to use elbows to hurt Gaethje. At certain points, they were efficient. Gaethje’s strikes, which dropped Pimblett, were just too much.\n\nPIMBLETT IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE EARLY\n\n📺 @paramountpluspic.twitter.com/ooBFDwjofz\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nPimblett had a second wind and proved his toughness against the toughest opponent of his career. He chopped Gaethje's legs in an attempt to keep him off balance. Pimblett even landed sharp uppercuts.\n\nGaethje, known for having a tough chin and attacking when smelling blood, was on another level.\n\nGaethje landed 178 significant strikes while Pimblett landed 169. The former landed 219 total strikes. The loss ended Pimblett's nine-fight win streak. Gaethje has now won two straight.\n\n\"That Scouser does NOT get knocked out.\" - Justin Gaethje\n\n📺 @paramountpluspic.twitter.com/LvqwmMGxqQ\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nUp next for Gaethje? It all depends on the status of champion Ilia Topuria, who is dealing with a personal matter. The interim champion could also fight Arman Tsarukyan, the top contender within the division.\n\nSean O’Malley may have secured a title shot on the White House card after beating Song Yadong in the co-main event. O’Malley (19-3, 1 NC) battled against Yadong (22-9, 1 NC), the latter landing leg kicks that hurt. “Suga” won round one and did enough in round three to get the win.\n\nO’Malley called out Petr Yan for the UFC bantamweight title, likely on the White House card. He understood if former champion Merab Dvalishvili got a third fight with Yan, but it appears likely the UFC will book O’Malley against the champion.\n\nWaldo Cortes-Acosta took it to Derrick Lewis, hurting the big man following vicious shots on the floor.\n\nRanked fifth at heavyweight, the Dominican used jabs and kicks to slow Lewis (29-13, 1 NC) down. Following a slip by Lewis, Cortes-Acosta (17-2) took advantage to get his third straight win.\n\nMORE: All you need to know about the UFC's partnership with Paramount+\n\nNatalia Silva earned a win against a former champion for the third straight time when she beat Rose Namajunas. Silva (20-5-1), replacing Alexa Grasso, was tentative to start the fight. The first round could have gone to anyone, but all three judges favored Silva.\n\nAs time went on, Silva looked confident. She took Namajunas (14-8) down late in the third, and it was enough to secure a win. With 13 straight wins, Silva may be next for flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\n\nArnold Allen and Jean Silva are known for their striking. They did so for three rounds, landing everything from leg kicks to uppercuts. Allen (20-4) used jabs to bloody Silva (17-3), while the latter used elbows and kicks to affect the spirit of Allen.\n\nSilva is back to his winning ways as a member of The Fighting Nerds.\n\nThe Sporting News provided results, analysis, and highlights from UFC 324.\n\nGaethje won via unanimous decision.\n\nRound five: Gaethje with several big shots. he missed and Pimblett took advantage.

    "title": "Lasses Preview: Can Sunderland Make Life Tough For The Saints?",
    "description": "Sunderland are back in league action as Southampton make the trip north. Charlotte Patterson preview’s today’s game!",
    "fullText": "Today, Sunderland welcome Southampton to Eppleton for a fixture that feels far more significant than the table alone suggests.\n\nOn the surface, it’s eighth versus sixth in a mid‑season meeting between two sides who’vw shared enough history in recent years to make the fixture familiar, if not outright fierce. But beneath that surface lies a deeper tension and a sense that today’s game could shape the direction of Sunderland’s season in ways that will only become clear weeks from now.\n\nWith a difficult run‑in looming and points becoming increasingly precious, this is the kind of game that can tilt momentum, shift belief and redefine expectations.\n\nSunderland arrive with twelve points from their opening run of fixtures, sitting eighth in the table with a goal difference of minus three. They’ve scored seventeen and conceded twenty, winning three, drawing three and losing five. It’s a record that reflects a season of mixed fortunes and where moments of genuine promise have been offset by lapses that have proved costly.\n\nSouthampton, meanwhile, sit sixth with eighteen points, having played one game more.\n\nTheir record of five wins, three draws, and four defeats, with twenty six goals scored and sixteen conceded, paints a picture of a team who’ve found a level of consistency that Sunderland are still striving to reach. They’re not runaway contenders, but they’re steady, structured, and capable of grinding out results even when not at their best. Their goal difference of plus ten suggests a side who manage both boxes well, who take their chances and limit their opponents’ opportunities.\n\nToday, the two sides meet, and with Sunderland’s upcoming fixtures offering little in the way of comfort, the stakes feel unusually high for a January afternoon at Eppleton.\n\nThe story of Sunderland’s season so far has been one of contrasts.\n\nThere have been spells where the team has looked capable of troubling anyone in the division. The attacking play has featured flashes of fluidity, with intelligent movement, sharp passing and a willingness to commit bodies forward. The midfield has occasionally dictated tempo and disrupted opponents, and the defence has produced periods of solidity.\n\nHowever, those spells haven’t always lasted and Sunderland have often been punished for brief lapses in concentration; moments where the standard of organisation has slipped or the decision‑making has faltered.\n\nThe twenty goals conceded are that of a team that’s been overwhelmed at times and have struggled to maintain control for the full ninety minutes. A missed clearance here, a poorly defended set piece there, a moment of hesitation in transition…these are the moments that’ve turned draws into defeats and wins into draws.\n\nEppleton — usually a source of strength — has mirrored that inconsistency.\n\nThe crowd remains as passionate and committed as ever, capable of lifting the team and unsettling opponents, but the results have not always matched the atmosphere.\n\nThere have been afternoons during which Sunderland have dominated without reward, and others where they’ve struggled to impose themselves. Today offers an opportunity to reaffirm Eppleton as a place where points are earned the hard way — and where visiting teams know they’ll be tested physically, tactically and emotionally.\n\nSouthampton, meanwhile, arrive with a different kind of rhythm.\n\nTheir season hasn’t been flawless but it’s been defined by structure and clarity. They know what they want to do, and they do it with discipline. Out of possession, they are compact and organised, difficult to pull apart and quick to close down space. In possession, they’re purposeful rather than flamboyant, moving the ball with intent and waiting for the right moments to commit numbers forward. .\n\nControl rather than chaos is what makes them such a challenging opponent for a Sunderland side still searching for consistency.\n\nSouthampton have the kind of team that punishes half‑mistakes, turns small openings into meaningful chances and manages games with a level of maturity that Sunderland are still developing. They don’t need opponents to be poor — they simply need them to be slightly off.\n\nThere’s also an emotional aspect to this fixture that adds another layer of intrigue.\n\nThese two sides have faced each other enough in recent seasons to build a quiet rivalry, one defined not by animosity but by familiarity. There have been tight contests, late goals and occasions on which one side has left feeling they deserved more. Those memories linger, shaping the tone of the encounter even before a ball is kicked.\n\nFor Sunderland, there is the added motivation of wanting to put right some of the frustrations of recent meetings; for Southampton, the confidence that comes from having taken points from this fixture before.\n\nThe players know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. The supporters recognise the patterns of the matchup, and the sense of narrative is impossible to ignore.\n\nFor Sunderland, the challenge today is to turn performances into points — and the attacking numbers show that there’s enough of a threat within this side to trouble any defence.\n\nWhen Sunderland move the ball quickly, when the rotations in midfield click and when the wide players are direct and brave, they create chances. The issue hasn’t been creating opportunities — it’s been taking them with the ruthlessness required at this level.\n\nDefensively, the task is to cut out the avoidable errors.\n\nToo many of the goals conceded have come from situations that felt manageable and from moments where a bit more aggression or clearer communication might’ve made the difference. Against a side like Southampton, those details matter. They don’t give up many chances and they don’t need many to score.\n\nSouthampton’s strengths are well known.\n\nTheir level of defensive organisation is among the highest in the division, and their ability to control the tempo makes them difficult to disrupt. Their midfield is composed and intelligent, capable of dictating the rhythm of the game, while their attack is efficient, with players who can finish clinically even if they aren’t creating a high volume of chances.\n\nHowever, they’re not without vulnerabilities. They don’t enjoy being forced to chase games, and they can be unsettled by quick transitions.\n\nTheir full backs — who play an important role in their attacking structure — can leave space in behind if turned around, and their centre backs, although strong positionally, aren’t the quickest over long distances. For Sunderland, that points towards a clear route to success: win the ball in midfield, transition quickly and exploit the spaces left by Southampton’s aggressive positioning.\n\nIt’s one thing to identify where the opportunities lie but it’s another to commit to exploiting them. Sunderland will need to trust their structure, trust their movement and trust each other. They can’t afford to play within themselves or allow Southampton to dictate the terms of the contest.\n\nWhat elevates today’s match beyond the status of a regular mid‑season fixture is the run‑in that awaits Sunderland.\n\nThe away trips to Charlton and Birmingham loom large, both sides with promotion ambitions and both grounds where points are notoriously difficult to come by. These are the kinds of fixtures where even a strong performance can end in a narrow defeat, and where the margins are slim and the pressure is high.\n\nThen there are the long journeys to Portsmouth and Ipswich.\n\nOn paper, these might be seen as opportunities to pick up points, but football rarely follows the script. Long travel, unfamiliar surroundings, and the mental and physical fatigue of the season can complicate even the most favourable fixtures. Portsmouth are stubborn and well‑organised at home, while Ipswich, despite their inconsistencies, have enough quality to cause problems.\n\nThis is why today feels pivotal — and Sunderland can’t afford to drift into that run‑in needing miracles.\n\nThey need to build momentum now, to create a buffer, to give themselves the confidence and belief required to navigate the challenges ahead. A win today wouldn’t solve everything, but it would change the mood, shift the narrative and make the table look a little less daunting.\n\nThere’a also the psychological aspect to consider.\n\nSunderland’s players know where they are in the table. They know the type of goals they’ve conceded and they’re aware of the games that’ve slipped away. What they need is a day where things go right, where the performance and the result align and where the work on the training ground is reflected on the scoreboard.\n\nEppleton can play a crucial role in that.\n\nWhen the crowd is engaged, when the noise builds and when the energy flows from the stands to the pitch, it can be a difficult place for visiting teams. Southampton — who prefer control and composure — may find that environment unsettling, but atmospheres are built, not assumed, and Sunderland need to give the supporters something to latch onto — whether it’s an early chance, a strong tackle or a spell of pressure.\n\nSuccess today does not require perfection — it requires clarity, conviction, and a willingness to embrace the challenge.\n\nSunderland need to be organised without the ball, brave with it, and ruthless inside both boxes. They need to manage the game, avoid the lapses that’ve cost them in the past, and trust that their best football is good enough to take points from a side like Southampton.\n\nIf they can do that, the table will look different tonight. The mood will shift, the run‑in will feel less intimidating and the season will take on a different complexion. If they can’t, the margins will tighten, and the climb will become steeper.\n\nIt’s a chance to change the tone and to show that Sunderland are a better side than their current position suggests. It’s also a chance to make Eppleton a fortress again; to give the supporters something to believe in and to set the stage for the challenges to come.\n\nThe season will not be defined by one match, but some matches shape the path that follows. Today feels like one of those and it’s up to Sunderland to seize it.\n\nAnd yet, on a personal note, there is a bittersweet twist.\n\nAs the writer of this preview, I find myself preparing to head off on holiday for a few days, meaning I won’t be there in person — a frustrating inevitability of timing, especially for a fixture that promises so much.\n\nI’ll do my best to catch the first half from the airport, phone in hand, suitcase at my side, hoping for a strong Sunderland performance to accompany the start of my travels. Even from afar, the pull of Eppleton and this Sunderland team remains impossible to ignore.",

    "fullText": "Vicky Mboko called Sunday's match at the Australian Open against first-seeded Aryna Sabalenka “a learning curve.”\n\nIf so, the 19-year-old Canadian is catching on very quickly.\n\nSabalenka won in two sets — 6-1, 7-6 (1) to reach the quarterfinals — but Mboko put enormous pressure on the world's top-ranked player in the second set and was a few shots away from forcing a third at Rod Laver Arena.\n\nAfter trailing 4-1 in the second set, Mboko rallied to force the tiebreaker and seemed to have the momentum until Sabalenka did, well, Sabalenka-like things and won her 20th straight tiebreak.\n\n“I think at the end of the day it really came down to experience,” Mboko said. “She played really great tennis. I, of course, had my chances.”\n\n“It was a pretty nice experience being it was my first time on the center court playing against the world No. 1,\" she added.\n\nMboko, No. 16 in the WTA Tour rankings, is becoming famous as a slow starter, which she was in the first set against the top-ranked Sabalenka. But it was different in the second once she seized an opening.\n\n“Trying to find my rhythm as the match went on was important for me,” she said. “I was pretty close in the second set.\"\n\nMboko has been showing off her tennis all across Australia.\n\nShe was the runner-up a week ago in the Adelaide International, losing to Mirra Andreeva in the final 6-3, 6-1. However, she defeated defending Australian Open champion Madison Keys 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the semifinals.\n\nMboko noted that against lesser players she's able to escape even when she hits shots that are short — not deep enough into the court.\n\n“But with her (Sabalenka) it was from the start, the moment my shot quality wasn't good enough, she was dictating right away,” Mboko said. “So that's something I could work on and learn from the next time.”\n\nAnd there will surely be a next time in every Grand Slam from here into the foreseeable future. Sabalenka, who is shooting for her third Australian Open title in four years, also made that point.\n\n“She’s an amazing player,” Sabalenka said of Mboko. “It was quite a fight. I’m super happy that I was able to close this match in straight sets. The second set was a bit tricky.”\n\nSabalenka faces another rising star in American 18-year-old Iva Jovic in the quarterfinals.\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are set to make a short trip across the capital to take on struggling Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, looking to preserve their 17-match unbeaten run against the Eagles.\n\nThe Blues are chasing back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since November, and could also extend their winning streak to three games on the bounce.\n\nLiam Rosenior has had a fine start to life at Chelsea, winning three of his four games in charge so far (L1).\n\nThe only defeat in that run came against Arsenal, with the Blues falling to a 3-2 defeat in the first leg of their EFL Cup semi-final clash at Stamford Bridge.\n\nSince then, Chelsea have kept back-to-back clean sheets, and Rosenior will hope for more of the same when the Blues head east of the capital later today.\n\nChelsea are heading into this fixture on the back of a narrow 1-0 Champions League win against Cypriot top-flight side Pafos in midweek.\n\nThat win moved them up to eighth in the Champions League standings, keeping their hopes of securing automatic qualification to the last 16 alive.\n\nThe win against Pafos came after a 2-0 success over Brentford, which ended a deplorable run of five Premier League games without victory.\n\nRosenior has made it clear that he will rotate his squad as much as he can to keep everyone fit, particularly after losing a couple of players to injury.\n\nThat means he could make up to seven changes from the side that beat Pafos in midweek.\n\nRobert Sanchez should return in goal, with Marc Cucurella, Trevoh Chalobah, Wesley Fofana, and Reece James ahead of the Spanish goalkeeper.\n\nCole Palmer was left out of the squad that faced Pafos, but should return for the game against Palace.\n\nHis return would move Enzo Fernandez back to central midfield alongside Moises Caicedo, while Alejandro Garnacho and Estevao line up on the flanks.\n\nRosenior has named Estevao as one of the players he wants to protect, but his cameo performance in midweek should give him the nod ahead of Pedro Neto.\n\nMeanwhile, Joao Pedro could replace Liam Delap at the top end of the pitch.",

    "title": "Vikings Rumors Spinning on a New OL Coach, Geno Smith, Kyle Rudolph’s Trade Idea",
    "description": "As the Minnesota Vikings move to put a punctuation mark on Offseason Week No. 3, the last several days delivered real […]",
    "fullText": "As the Minnesota Vikings move to put a punctuation mark on Offseason Week No. 3, the last several days delivered real intrigue, with developments including a new offensive line coach theory, Geno Smith floated as a quarterback option, and Kyle Rudolph’s quarterback endorsement.\n\nThree new angles hit Minnesota’s offseason in one rumor mill burst: a coaching possibility, a QB trade whisper, and a Rudolph-driven proposal.\n\nIt’s the second Purple Rumor Mill of the week, with all the trimmings.\n\nThe Vikings’ rumor mill doesn’t rest, so here’s the latest edition.\n\nRumor: Dwayne Ledford could be a candidate for Minnesota’s vacant OL coach post.\n\nLedford is suddenly available, and the Vikings, in theory, could pounce.\n\nSI.com’s Garrett Chapman outlined the Falcons’ staffing shakeup this week, noting, “The Atlanta Falcons have officially hired former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski to take over their franchise. The team announced the news on Saturday night, and by Sunday, there were more decisions that came to light as the new staff is put together.”\n\n“News will continue to evolve at the coordinator position, but one major piece of the puzzle has reportedly been highlighted. According to NFL insider Mike Garafolo, the Falcons will be bringing in Bill Callahan to coach the offensive line. The correlating result of this move is that longtime offensive line coach and run game coordinator Dwayne Ledford will become a free agent.”\n\nLedford has been a stabilizing force in run game structure, and his availability immediately puts offensive-minded teams on alert. Minnesota should take notice.\n\nWill Ragatz, also of SI.com, underscored the opportunity, “If the Vikings could find a way to land Ledford, it would be a big hire for O’Connell and company. They’ve got all the makings of a strong offensive line with Christian Darrisaw, Brian O’Neill, Will Fries, Donovan Jackson, and whoever’s playing center in 2026.”\n\n“Health is critical there, but so is coaching. If hired, Ledford would also presumably replace RBs coach Curtis Modkins as run game coordinator. The Vikings have never finished above 22nd in EPA per rush in four years under O’Connell.”\n\nMinnesota’s run game hasn’t lacked talent so much as oomph. Ledford would fix it.\n\nRumor: Geno Smith may be on the Vikings’ trade radar this offseason.\n\nESPN’s Kevin Seifert addressed the Vikings’ quarterback situation this week: “Adofo-Mensah and O’Connell made clear this week that they can’t count on that progress, after seeing the results of counting on it in 2025. It’s an understandable assessment. But quarterback acquisition is hard. The Vikings had a solid plan in 2025 and couldn’t execute it. Can they be better with their next opportunity? Their 2026 season almost certainly depends on it.”\n\nSeifert then turned to a familiar batch of names while surveying the league’s quarterback carousel.\n\n“The San Francisco 49ers’ Mac Jones and the Las Vegas Raiders’ Geno Smith could be available via trade, and the Miami Dolphins might part ways with Tua Tagovailoa. Jones has been a backup for two seasons, Smith ranked No. 27 in NFL QBR this season, and Tagovailoa ranked No. 26,” he wrote.\n\nSo, Smith joins Minnesota’s growing quarterback rumor mill, at least on paper. Here’s his NFL ranking among all quarterbacks per EPA+CPOE in the last four seasons:\n\nIn 2022, banked 4,282 passing yards and 30 passing touchdowns.\n\nSmith is a sideways option for the Vikings at quarterback, somebody with ample experience to support J.J. McCarthy. But his case is no better than others’. Too, Minnesota would have to send a draft pick to Las Vegas to get Smith, as he’s under contract in 2026.\n\nRumor: Kyle Rudolph thinks the Vikings should sniff around a Mac Jones trade.\n\nRudolph spoke to Kay Adams this week, name-dropping Jones as a Vikings quarterback target this offseason.\n\n“I think you got Mac Jones. To me, if I’m looking at that list, Aaron Rodgers, if he wants to come back and make a run with an incredibly talented roster in a division that he’s very familiar with, completely agree. But yeah, bringing somebody in doesn’t really matter who it is,” Rudolph opined.\n\n“There’s plenty of high-caliber veteran quarterbacks that could come in, and Kevin O’Connell always gets the most out of them. There’s no better quarterback whisperer than KOC, and I think he would be a great spot if you’re a veteran quarterback like Tua Tagovailoa, trying to revitalize your career, if he is on the market. Wouldn’t be a bad place to look.”\n\nThe 49ers’ brass also said this week that Jones won’t necessarily be for sale this offseason, so we shall see if Minnesota agrees with Rudolph and offers San Francisco a trade it can’t refuse.",

    "fullText": "St. James’ Park sets the stage for a gripping Premier League clash on Sunday afternoon as Newcastle United welcome Aston Villa to Tyneside.\n\nOn paper, Newcastle head into this fixture as underdogs, with the visitors sitting 10 points ahead in the Premier League table.\n\nHowever, the Magpies are in better form than Villa after putting together a four-match unbeaten streak in the Premier League (W3, D1).\n\nThe only blemish in that run came in a frustrating goalless draw against basement boys Wolverhampton Wanderers last weekend, which ended a three-game league winning run.\n\nDespite dominating proceedings, Newcastle couldn’t find a winner and will head into Sunday’s outing sitting 9th in the Premier League table.\n\nEddie Howe’s attacking unit recaptured their goalscoring form in the Champions League as the Magpies bounced back in emphatic style.\n\nThey claimed a comfortable 3-0 win against Eredivisie champions PSV Eindhoven at St. James’ Park, courtesy of goals from Yoane Wissa, Anthony Gordon, and Harvey Barnes.\n\nHowe will demand more of the same when his side return to Premier League duties, with the Magpies eyeing back-to-back home wins in all competitions.\n\nA win for Newcastle will also move them level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool as they look to reclaim their place in the top four.\n\nHowe would be wary of shuffling the XI that put PSV to the sword in midweek, but a fresh injury blow could force the Englishman to make one change for the Villa clash.\n\nNick Pope should retain his place in goal, with an unchanged back four of Kieran Trippier, Malick Thiaw, Sven Botman, and Lewis Hall ahead of the English goalkeeper.\n\nThe solitary change could come in midfield with academy talent Lewis Miley coming in for Newcastle skipper Bruno Guimaraes, who picked up a knock against PSV.\n\nThe Brazilian midfielder is ready to play through the pain. But Howe will likely protect the “pivotal” midfielder by giving Miley the nod alongside Sandro Tonali and Joelinton in midfield.\n\nAn attacking trio of Gordon, Wissa, and Barnes should also remain unchanged after their stellar Champions League display.\n\nWissa’s performance spells trouble for £69 million summer signing Nick Woltemade, who is on an eight-match goal drought since bagging a brace against Chelsea in December 2025.",

    "description": "Stan Winston and Michael Lantieri detail their real-world practical solutions to creating the film’s huge stars.",
    "fullText": "The jeep heads right for us, the driver so terrified he smashes into a log, shearing the windows and the seat backs clean off as the vehicle skids under, spinning almost out of control. A roar echoes from the dense grove behind the jeep; trees shudder, toppling down, crushed by some monstrous weight. Then it appears, its vast body supported by two powerful legs, its voracious jaws filled with teeth the size of daggers — a living Tyrannosaurus rex. The huge creature gives chase, careening through the mud. The T-rex smashes through the log, reducing it to kindling, then crashes into the jeep, denting its side and upending it into the mud. The driver and his companions stumble from the wreckage as the fearsome beast, more terrifying than any dragon of legend, chases them deep into the dense jungle of Jurassic Park.\n\nThis startling sequence, filmed in a single breathless shot, is one of dozens of collaborations between full-scale dinosaur creator Stan Winston and mechanical effects supervisor Michael Lantieri on Steven Spielberg's long-awaited adventure epic. Along with stop-motion animator Phil Tippett and ILM visual-effects supervisor Dennis Muren, ASC [whose contributions are further detailed in AC July, 1993], Lantieri and Winston round out Jurassic Park's revolutionary dinosaur-design team.\n\nUsing every known effects technique, and some they created out of necessity specifically for Jurassic Park, they may well have done the impossible: given convincing life to an unholy menagerie of creatures who haven't walked the earth in millions of years. It’s an achievement that may well change forever the way we look at effects films.\n\nLantieri and Winston's work was used almost exclusively for the live-action dinosaur effects during principal photography. Together, they helped one another solve problems that have plagued effects experts such as Willis O'Brien from the prehistoric era of cinematic illusion — the silent The Lost Continent and the legendary King Kong — to the present day. “We really worked as one crew,\" Lantieri marvels. “Early on, our four-person design team took this pie, which represented all of the effects in Jurassic Park, and cut it up. We figured who could best do each effect, and then one or the other would say, 'We can go so far with this; can you pick up from here and run with it?'\"\n\nIn the beginning there was Stan Winston. As the multi-Academy Award-winning makeup effects artist will tell you, every dinosaur created for Jurassic Park began on the drawing boards at his Stan Winston Studio in Van Nuys. The bearded makeup impresario is a cagey fox, dazzling his audience with reams of techno-jargon, but the man has undeniably produced some of the most remarkable creations in screen history: the xenomorph queen of Aliens, the Pumpkinhead demon (from the film he also directed), the robotic cyborg of The Terminator and the shape-shifting T-1000 in Mark 'Crash' McCreary.\n\nWhat gives Winston's mechanical marvels their edge seems to be a philosophy stemming from his own humble beginnings as a struggling actor who fell into the field he now dominates almost by accident. \"I got involved in a makeup apprenticeship program while I was waiting to be a star,\" he admits. \"I was a big Lon Chaney fan and I was inspired by him to create wonderful, bizarre and incredible fantasy and real characters for film. When I realized a prosthetic makeup on an actor's face wouldn't allow me to fully realize the characters I was asked to create, I began using special effects technology to create fantasy characters that were completely animatronic puppets. I haven't gone from makeup to special effects; I have increased my palette with more colors that allow me to create characters using all the technology available, be it a makeup, a prosthetic, or dinosaurs for Jurassic Park.\" Unlike others in Winston's field, he sees his creations as characters who have to perform, on cue, like any other actor. This makes his task more demanding, and more rewarding.\n\nOne and a half of Winston's two years on Jurassic Park were spent designing the creatures who populate fictional billionaire John Hammond's bizarre island amusement park. All told, Winston's crew visualized nine different species of dinosaurs, most prominent of which were two-legged predators such as the Tyrannosaurus rex, velociraptors [above], and \"spitters,\" [the dilophosaurus] along with four-footed vegetarians such as triceratops and the mammoth brachiosaurus. \"Steven felt that there should be a consistent dinosaur design,\" Winston explains, \"so even dinosaurs that were only realized in the computer at ILM, such as the ostrich-like gallimimus, were designed here. The approach is very simple and it's what we do on every project: artistically, everything starts on the drawing boards. We're certainly not going to throw two tons of clay at an armature and start sculpting a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex and hope that it looks great! On Jurassic Park, our concept artist was Mark 'Crash' McCreary, who did all the final renderings of the dinosaurs. The creatures' skin coloring was created by Shane Mahan and John Rosengrant, among many others.\"\n\nOnce the designs were finalized on paper, Winston's crew created 1/5th-scale sculptures of each dinosaur, except for the brachiosaurus, which was so huge in life that Winston opted to do him as a 1/19th-scale model. These clay maquettes were molded, cast in fiberglass and painted not only to show Spielberg what the creatures would look like in three dimensions, but also to serve as the models for the computer-generated dinosaur effects created by Phil Tippett in conjunction with ILM and Dennis Muren. Winston's crew also fabricated 1/5th-scale mechanical versions of each character destined to become a full-scale animatronic puppet.\n\nWinston says it was a brainstorm in the middle of the night that led him to devise a system for exactly translating his miniature dinosaurs into their full-scale counterparts: using cross-sections taken at precise intervals from his 1/5th-scale dinosaurs, he had them blown up five times and made into wooden patterns which were then strung along metal spines. \"We covered the wooden patterns with fiberglass to create a smooth solid surface, then started putting clay on it to make our finished sculpture,\" Winston boasts, \"and that became our sculpting armature. It ended up looking exactly like a very large version of those wooden dinosaur skeleton toys you can buy! The form of the dinosaur was done virtually by mechanical drawing, so our full-scale creations were identical to our 1/5th-scale maquettes. All we had to do then was to sculpt the skin and the detail. Later I learned this was exactly the way the Statue of Liberty was built!\"\n\nEach of the full-scale dinosaurs, which included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the spitters, the velociraptors, a triceratops and an insert brachiosaurus head and neck, took teams of sculptors months to craft to Winston and Spielberg's satisfaction. The sculptures were then molded, and from these molds flexible skins were cast which were then fitted over graphite and metal skeletons laden with all manner of mechanical devices: air bladders to simulate breathing, cable-actuated systems to perform certain body movements, radio-controlled servo motors to control facial motion. The creatures were all designed to operate in real time.\n\nMeanwhile, mechanical effects supervisor Michael Lantieri was hard at work creating what the four man design team laughingly called “dinosaur interfaces,” mechanical systems that would help these full-scale behemoths to stand, walk and perform in scenes. \"We always joked that Stan got the glamorous end of it,\" Lantieri says, \"but the behind the-camera work turned out to be really important and Stan was great about including us. We really worked together. If he'd made a creature that was only there from the waist up, we built out of our special 'dinosaur interface' things that could be attached to the creature to move it. Stan and I talked about where we could attach our interfaces, how we would move them and the speed [we would use]. We built a lot of different rigs that would accommodate Stan's puppeteers, underground cranes and dollies, as well as pneumatic cranes that would assist with the broad movements. In addition, my guys would be involved in the shoving and pushing needed to give the full range of motion.\"\n\nOf all the life-size dinosaurs, the velociraptors embody the most controversial blending of techniques: at the core of several of the various effects models are human beings. Given the dubious legacy of el cheapo productions such as Unknown Island, The Land Unknown, and Japan's legendary contribution to the genre, the Godzilla series, the idea of man-in-a-suit dinosaurs has been reviled by cineastes from time immemorial. Today, the man-in-a-suit approach has become state-of-the-art, and Winston is almost single-handedly responsible for the public's dramatic change in attitude. \"If there was a man inside a dinosaur, there was a great deal of technology inside that dinosaur, too,\" Winston observes.\n\n\"For Jurassic Park, we designed and built full-sized, performing, live-action dinosaurs. The methods we used involved whatever technology was required to create the performance needed. We built two man-in-suit raptors and two fully animatronic, no-human-being puppet raptors utilizing a combination of cable and servo control. We also made a set of walking legs and a set of running legs from the waist down. For certain shots, we created insert hands which could, for example, open doors. Then we fabricated our stunt raptors, full-sized floppy puppets and poseable puppets. All told, we built 8 to 10 full-sized raptors that did different things. We also built a baby raptor splitting out of its shell [seen featured image at top of page], which was totally real-time using cable control.\"\n\nWinston's goal was to create fluid, believable dinosaurs that bore no trace of the mechanics which gave them life. Specifically, he wanted to conquer the phenomenon he refers to as \"waga-waga,\" which he scientifically defines as the jolt that occurs when a large moving mass comes to a stop. Such jolts, which mimes employ to simulate robotic movement, work fine for machines like in The Terminator, but they would have seriously undermined Winston's attempt to bring his dinosaurs to convincing life. Through the careful application of some unusual, though strangely related technologies, the raptors and some of Winston's other dinosaur creations, most dramatically the full-scale Tyrannosaurus rex, employed a breakthrough \"anti-waga\" system. They were dubbed \"Steadi-Dinos\" because their movements were based on neutral buoyancy, the same principal which is integral to the Steadicam. This concept was envisioned by Craig Caton, one of Winston's key mechanical designers.\n\n\"I saw the relationship between a person having a hard time trying to hold a camera at the end of his arm and the need to hold up a head mechanically on a long neck,\" Winston beams, \"and I realized that the same wonderful system of counterspringing the camera so the weight load becomes neutral could help us mechanically. We realized that this could work very well for us in terms of certain head and neck movements, to make everything fluid. The actual infrastructures of our dinosaurs were countersprung just like a Steadicam, which made our creatures' movements totally fluid and organic. That technology went into the spitters and the velociraptors, two of our most active dinosaurs.\"\n\nBut this system achieved its most remarkable results in Jurassic Park's star attraction, a 40'-long, 9,000-pound animatronic machine that perfectly recreated the appearance and fluid motion of a full-sized Tyrannosaurus rex. \"The technology of the T-rex is beyond anything I think anybody has ever seen,\" Winston says. \"One of our big problems was figuring out how to make this 40'-long creature move quickly and violently, perform wonderfully, yet come to a smooth stop on cue without the waga-waga you would expect. We solved the problem through a series of computer-involved aspects of ramping up and ramping down speed, and by building accelerometers into our anti-waga devices. A series of accelerometers enabled us to measure the speed of the hydraulic rams moving within our dinosaur, which allowed us to counter that movement with other rams moving in the opposite direction elsewhere in the body. So our T-rex never completed a particular move and stopped without another aspect of the body compensating immediately. In order to keep this creature moving with speed and dynamics, nothing was allowed to come to a hard stop against its rigid 9,000 pounds without something else counterbalancing that motion. When its head comes to a sudden stop, something moves in the neck to compensate for it at that exact split second, which acts as a shock absorber. It's wonderful how this guy performs — he’s fast and big and dangerous and he's a great actor.\"\n\nWinston was concerned that the T-rex, weighing in at 9,000 pounds, was potentially as lethal off camera as on, and he began to worry about how to control this gigantic performer so it would interact on cue with its environment and not present a safety hazard. \"Unlike any other hydraulic creature you've seen in an amusement park, say King Kong [at Universal Studios], whose specific moves have been programmed in over a long period of time and who repeats those movements over and over, our Tyrannosaurus rex was this big hydraulic machine that had to perform on cue,\" Winston states. \"When you're an actor in a film, you have to be able to take direction immediately, so I was concerned about how to coordinate the computer keyboards with 8 or 10 people on them to make these big moves. The biggest problem we had beyond all this technology was safety. There's a real big danger factor working on a set with a 9,000-pound machine. This dinosaur could've killed someone really easiiy.\"\n\nAs with many of Winston's best ideas, the ideal solution to this hazard presented itself in the middle of the night. Winston had worked with performance Waldos many times before, but these telemetry suits, which translate the motion of the person wearing them into the performance of the mechanical creature itself, were designed for more humanoid characters. No one had ever devised a telemetry system for creatures that didn't mimic human motion. \"Thinking back to our 1/5th-scale mechanical T-rex prototype, I had the brainstorm that we could actually use one similar to it as our telemetry puppet!\" Winston says. \"I realized that we could literally build a performance Waldo for the T-rex that duplicated every motion he made in 1/5th scale, and use that as an interface for us to organically puppet the creature. Instead of having linear potentiometers linked to a control board, each potentiometer would correspond to a cylinder in our puppet version of the T-rex, so we had a 9,000-pound puppet that was literally operated by puppeteers manipulating a small version. That way, Steven could say, 'Let him rear up' and we could pull our 1/5th-scale Waldo back and let him act; our full-scale T-rex performed on the spot. If a situation required a really critical move, we could puppet it on the fly, and then, using the computer system that controlled our T-rex, we could record that move and repeat it over and over again at the push of a button.\"\n\nThe animatronic Tyrannosaurus rex was built in two parts. The upper body from head to tail down to the knee made up one section, while the legs comprised the other. The two sections could appear to be one creature by strategically placing a tree branch across the joint, there was also a set of dummy legs that could be positioned under the mechanical upper body. The effects team also constructed a foresection of the T-rex consisting of the front half of his body, which at 4,000 pounds was easier to move around than the full 9,000-pound version.\n\nThe gross movements of the nose to tail T-rex's massive upper body were controlled via a motion platform Winston calls the \"Dino-Simulator\" because of its similarities to a flight simulator, a hydraulically actuated, computer-operated platform capable of handling all six axes of movement smoothly, even while bearing an enormous weight load. Winston stresses that the full scale T-rex's articulation was tied directly into the flight-simulator concept. \"We took that same technology and, like branches on a tree, moved it right out to the tip of its nose,\" he says. \"The basis for the hydraulics and the mechanics and the fluidity of the T-rex's movement was the methodology behind flight simulators. The Dino-Simulator could fluidly move the creature forward, back, from side to side, and up and down. We took that system and continued to work up into the beast with hydraulic cylinders, transducers, and the addition of accelerometers, so what worked the Dino-Simulator also moved the entire dinosaur. Our problem was that it wasn't enough for the T-rex to move fluidly; it had to perform, so we had to take another step because now we had a long load-bearing situation that was setting itself up for an amazing waga! The solution involved computer cards to rapidly ramp-up and ramp-down speed, combined with counter-moves to stop the waga.\"\n\nAssisting with the construction of the Dino-Simulator was only the tip of the T-rex for veteran floor effects specialist Lantieri, who gives off the impression of a youthful elf with enormous enthusiasm for the problem-solving that comprises most of his work. It's hard to believe he got his start some 20 years ago handling effects for The Six-Million Dollar Man series at Universal Studios, where he now works his magic from his permanent, Spielberg-funded workspace on the lot. Along the way, Lantieri has won two Academy Award nominations and three British Academy Awards for his ability to contribute invisible expertise to such landmark productions as Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Back To The Future films.\n\nEven with all of this experience, however, Lantieri had never faced problems like those confronting him on Jurassic Park: \"Once you bring a dinosaur in for a shot, then what do you do with it? Not only did we have to move our creatures within the shot, we had to move them into position for the next setup. We had to be able to turn them around and move them out of the way. This meant we had to build very dinosaur-friendly sets to accommodate our winches and cranes and air bearings, most of which helped move the creatures into position and also, for certain shots, handled some of their broad movements in conjunction with Stan's puppeteers.\n\n\"We literally built a walker with training wheels to move the full set of T-rex legs. We also mounted the Dino-Simulator onto a tower that I built which was on air bearings, so we could use high-pressure air to glide a great deal of weight. Air bearings are used for moving heavy equipment out in the real world, but we use it for simulating earthquakes and other effects where we move big, heavy objects.\"\n\nSuch as 9,000-pound dinosaurs. This concept brings us back to the aforementioned shot in which the tyrannosaurus rex wreaks havoc on a jeep. \"The T-rex was supposed to give chase, run through a grove of trees, break through a gigantic log that's fallen across the road, then slam into the jeep,\" Lantieri smiles, pausing to catching his breath. \"Naturally, Steven wanted it in one shot. Upon the action cue, we were controlling half a dozen large real trees that had to be mowed down in sequence before we even see the T-rex. Each tree had to be scored, precut and hinged using internal cables, as well as cables on a pulley at a 45-degree angle. We set off sequential charges in the trees and had them spring loaded so they'd seem to plow from the back forward.\n\n\"Then we had this tree that had fallen across the road, which had to rip the windshield and shear the seat backs off our jeep as it crashes under it, but then break as our T-rex plows through it!\" Lantieri says, shaking his head. \"The fallen tree was built as a hollow log. It was made out of steel, then skinned with fiberglass and real bark and real limbs and real leaves. We then put a big air-driven piston through the center of it, so that when it was closed, just like a big barrel bolt, the log was sturdy and sound. The jeep actually drove into it at 30 m.p.h. and sheared the windshield off as everyone ducked at the last second, which was a real stunt that Gary Hymes supervised.\n\n\"A beat behind that, in the same shot, the T-Rex plunges through this log chest-first, which meant that we had to weaken the log and cause it to break itself open so we didn't hurt our creature! The second the jeep went through, I used high-pressure air to pull the piston and create a weak joint in the middle of the tree. The tree was then pulled back from the outside edges using hydraulics, like a swinging barn door, so that at the moment of impact with the T-rex we didn't hurt our star dinosaur.\n\n\"Lastly,\" Lantieri says with visible relief, \"we kept the shot going as the T-rex hits the side of the jeep, denting it and causing it to raise off the ground. Since our 9,000-pound animatronic puppet didn't have the strength to do what a real T-rex weighing 20 tons might do, we had to build a jeep that would dent itself on cue and appear to raise off the ground from the impact! We had the entire side of the jeep rigged with pneumatic rams and covered with lead sheets painted to look like the genuine steel skin. The ram, which was extended and welded to the lead skin, was then closed at high pressure at the moment of impact with the T-rex, and it sucked a great big dent in on the side of the jeep. We also had a pneumatic foot hidden behind the rear tire that slammed down into the ground and lifted the jeep off the ground, all of which had to be timed to the movement of the creature. This whole sequence was done in one shot, so you can imagine the amount of timing and cueing required in order for my crew and the stunt people to all hit their marks at the right moment. That was a huge mechanical effect.\" For added protection, the shot was also done as a motion-control move minus the T-rex, which could then be added later by ILM.\n\nThe film's most elaborate mechanical effects set piece again involved the Tyrannosaurus rex, who ravages a two-car caravan on a tour of Jurassic Park. The tour vehicles were supposed to be driverless Ford Explorers on a magnetic track. In reality, they were either radio-controlled or blind-driven vehicles which a driver controlled from underneath the hood. Lantieri had gained a lot of experience with these systems on Roger Rabbit, but he had never created a car that would literally crush itself. \"The crushable car was a real Ford Explorer,\" Lantieri explains. \"We replaced the door panels we wanted to crush with lightweight aluminum and lead, and we created replaceable, crushable roofs as well. We built a telescoping roll cage inside the headliners of the car, which was what actually pulled the roof down. We also had metal buckling on the side and glass breaking. It was all hydraulically driven, like a big crush press that we could control with joysticks. We stood right by the camera and Steven would say, 'Crush it a little more... a little more.' We were trying to give the feeling that this creature's foot was actually on top of the car, crushing it, which meant it couldn't seem like a mechanically clean crush. The car had to rock and crush at the same time, which required some puppeteering. When we shot our pickup scene inside the car with the two kids, we had to be sure that the roll cage was engineered to come to a stop at the right height so it wouldn't harm them, because Steven wanted it to look as if they were almost crushed.\"\n\nOnce the T-rex finishes demolishing the Ford Explorer, he bulldozes it over a cliff, where it lands in the branches of a huge tree. The kids then clamber out of the crushed vehicle as the branches give way, and the car chases them down the tree. The mix of kids and a 3,000-pound falling Ford had all the elements of a full-scale real-life disaster, but both Lantieri and Spielberg were fanatical about safety precautions. \"The tree was built on Stage 27, which is a pit,\" Lantieri recalls. \"Our tree was 60' high, and so detailed that its trunk was even covered with rolled bark that would scrape off as the car slid down it. The tree had to hold the weight of the real Explorer we were going to fly down after it got shoved over a cliff, so you can imagine all the safety precautions we had to go through. We used one of our regular cars with the motor removed, so it was just the frame and body, and we removed or replaced every piece that could break off. The only pieces that broke were ones that we controlled so we knew where they were going to fall. The car was always on a cable, but it still had to fall like it wasn't. It couldn't jerk when it fell. We actually put it into freefall using custom-built hydraulic wedges with electronic braking. That way, we could bring the car from a freefall to a controlled stop in one foot and it wouldn't snap on the cables because of the braking. It was all controlled digitally using a system we built combined with a descender rig that was capable of holding three or four tons. That way, we were able to drop a full-sized car on a limb above people's heads and do close calls. It was a tremendous responsibility, as well as a challenge, to make this look real.\"\n\nTo complicate matters further, the entire effect had to be completely timed out to Spielberg's nod. \"We had hydraulically controlled branches that would break on cue,\" Lantieri reveals, \"so I could build that cinematic tension that Steven loves to create — he's famous for it. After the car hit, the branch slowly started creaking and bent until he nodded, and then we let the branch break and the car fall. Steven knew exactly the length of suspense that he wanted to build. He'd say, 'Let it slip a little... let it slip... now!' and the car had to go right on the money. And it had to be repeatable. After the tree branch broke, we reset and reskinned it. We were all set to go while he waited, or we wouldn't be there the next day. That's part of the joy and challenge of working with someone like Steven.\"\n\nLantieri and company also created the usual atmospheric effects — rain, mist and fog — on set and on location, and also took care of details such as dinosaur tracks and park fences. \"Fencing!\" Lantieri shrieks. \"Let me tell you about a simple job, the kind of thing that would just slide by on this movie. When I read the script, the last thing on my mind was fencing! I was thinking, 'My God, the special effects on this movie! Do I really want this job?' But once we got the drawings and they said, 'Okay, just go put some fence up for us,' well, that took months.\"\n\nAnd yet, Lantieri concludes, \"I'm wondering where I go from here. I hope that having the opportunity to work on this film, with Steven as our fearless leader, wasn't a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nWinston concurs, adding: \"To me, the most exciting thing about Jurassic Park is that these dinosaurs are beautiful, they're real, and everything about their movements and their looks is organic. Some of the finest artists in the world worked for the longest time designing them, creating their look, their texture, and their movement, and the piece de resistance is the fact that they do perform and that they can act. And when they can't do something, that's where ILM and Dennis Muren come in. It'll be a beautiful, seamless mix of technologies so that what you see are living dinosaurs that are almost too real to be real.\"\n\nAlso from the June 1993 issue of AC is Jurassic Park: When Dinosaurs Rule the Box Office, in which cinematographer Dean Cundey, ASC details his approach to the project.",

    "fullText": "1993 was an important one for going to the movies, but for this screenwriter in particular it was magical. It was the year of The Fugitive, The Firm, True Romance, So I Married an Axe Murderer, and many more. Most importantly, though, it was the summer of Jurassic Park. It’s difficult to state what the world was like before Jurassic Park, because it was such a watershed moment in cinema. It was the biggest movie to come out that year, but one of the biggest movies to come out in cinema history—not just in terms of cinema history, but in terms of cultural impact. It’s a bonafide classic and after 30 years—or 65 million, depending on your reckoning—it still has so much to teach screenwriters, filmmakers, and storytellers.\n\nAdapting the Spirit if Not the Details\n\nJurassic Park was adapted into a screenplay by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, based on the book of the same name by Michael Crichton. Anyone who has read the novel and watched the movie will tell you that they bear only a passing resemblance to each other. There is nothing more boring than watching a movie that is a shot-for-shot remake of a novel, they tend to be way too long and monotonous. I’m thinking specifically of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone—a kitchen-sink adaptation that is just completely limp and makes no choices. But smart screenwriters understand that the medium matters and what works in a book does’t always work in a movie.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and What it Can Teach Screenwriters\n\nThe screenplay adaptation of Jurassic Park is a masterclass in changing things to make it more crowd-pleasing and easier to understand. In the book, there’s a subplot where they’re also racing against the clock to make sure no dinosaurs get off the island, streamlining that out of the narrative of the film was the right call.\n\nJohn Hammond is also given a redemption arc in the film that doesn’t exist in the novel. Reading an unapologetic capitalist who causes a disaster in a novel remains an unapologetic capitalist feels very realistic and natural, but in a film, audiences expect a change in characters.\n\nThe spirit of the book remains the same, but the adaptation creates something much more universal for the medium. Jurassic Park as an adaptation, even after thirty years, is worth studying in both directions for the beats of storytelling and how to do an adaptation correctly.\n\nJurassic Park would be a completely different movie if they didn’t explain the genesis of the dinosaurs. Try to imagine that film without explaining the science behind living dinosaurs. Would you, as an audience member, feel comfortable just jumping into that world without getting an answer about how the dinosaurs were made? So much of the fascinating science-fiction element of that film comes from the science behind how they might have brought the dinosaurs to life.\n\nThe movie wouldn’t work without that detour into the science because audiences would have spent too much time asking themselves why the dinosaurs existed. Crichton and Koepp, the writers of Jurassic Park, understood the assignment that they were given. It would be easy to look at all of the running time and script pages spent explaining the science and jump straight to the excitement, but the story unfolds in a much more mature way, allowing audiences to suspend their disbelief and follow the science.\n\nWithout the science, Jurassic Park likely wouldn’t be classified as science fiction—it would be just another B-adventure monster movie like King Kong. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with King Kong, but that’s just not what audiences were signing up for with a movie based on a Michael Crichton story.\n\nIt’s also fascinating to see the vehicle with which much of the science is revealed: a theme-park like video and ride that reveals the information at a low level, as if for children, frustrating the scientists who want to go deeper and ask more in-depth questions. It functions to let kids follow along and answer those more intelligent questions in a really elegant way.\n\nWhen you’re looking at what questions your story needs to answer, think about what they’re expecting and what questions they’d ask that would be to the detriment of the story. Make sure you’re answering everything you can that won’t get in the way.\n\nIt would have been easy for Jurassic Park to start with the dinosaurs—well, more than it already does with Muldoon battling the raptors. Aside from this opening tease, the dinosaurs are kept behind the proverbial curtain until our point-of-view characters—Doctors Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm—see them for the first time.\n\nThis is something that sets the tone for the film and lets us see how amazing this really is. By holding the reveal, the audience is able to bask in the wonder at the same time as the characters that have just entered this world.\n\nBack to the Future: A Perfect Trilogy for Writerly Study\n\nThink about this like the introduction of Orson Welles as Harry Lime in The Third Man. The characters all talk about him relentlessly, and we get to know him through everyone’s perception of him. When that light clicks on and he smiles devilishly, we know so much about what this could possibly mean in a way that really focuses the audience on their participation in the narrative. Jurassic Park does the same thing, but adds the element of the impossible to it—I mean, we can’t really clone dinosaurs yet.\n\nAs you build the major turns and reveals in your story, how can you craft them in a way that preserves that surprise and allows the audience to take part in the breathtaking awe? There are few better examples than this.\n\nThink about the build up of the velociraptors in the same context as Harry Lime. We see Muldoon struggle with one unseen at the beginning. We hear the stories Dr. Grant tells about them to scare children. They discuss how dangerous they are over their locked and hidden paddock. And then… once we know exactly how lethal they are, they’re released. It’s a perfect build up and is the only reason they’re so terrifying by the end.\n\nIf there’s another thing with celebrating in Jurassic Park, it’s the characterization and dialogue of each of the characters. They’re all so incredibly unique and lovable in their own ways (even if you hate them.) As you watch the movie, see if you can imagine any of the dialogue from one character coming out of the mouth of another character. There might be a tiny little bit of overlap between the kids, but aside from that, everyone is an expert in their field and talks in a really distinct way based on their background, training, and point of view.\n\nIf you were looking at the dialogue on the page without the character names attached, you’d be able to tell who was speaking. John Hammond speaks in a very proper way, his accent is practically dictated by his word choice. Dr. Sattler’s is generally more upbeat than Dr. Grant, and they differ in their specialties (paleobotany vs. more general paleontology). Dr. Malcolm is a force on his own with every line he utters. Even Dennis Nedry and the bloodsucking lawyer—both greedy—can easily be told apart.\n\nIt’s a master class in paying attention to each of the concerns, backgrounds, desires, education levels, and upbringings of a wide cast of characters. And none of them speak the same way.\n\nThe characters are also defined by small, subtle actions that are just as relatable to an audience as the words they speak. Think about Alan Grant tying the seatbelt on the helicopter together and his dislike of children. Add to that his decision to launch that flare and rescue the children when the T-Rex attacks, we have a very complicated character.\n\nAs you’re looking to refine your screenplay, think about ways you can set your characterizations in one direction, and show what the character is truly made of by making decisions in other directions.\n\nJurassic Park is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and it’s worth doing so. The story is tight, the filmmaking is incredible, and the John Williams score puts it over the top. But it all starts with words on the page and the script for this one is an all-timer. After 30 years, it still sings, maintaining the bombastic and mesmerizing effect that Steven Spielberg imbued it with initially.\n\nAlthough it’s hard to capture the feeling of watching it for the first time in 1993, do your best to put on those fresh eyes and see how well the screenplay works for the first timers. You’ll be surprised how many secrets a script can hold after all this time.\n\nJurassic Park is currently streaming with your Peacock subscription.

    "fullText": "In 2016, Olympus Camera made some buzz in the photo world when they claimed that their new camera was capable of an impressive 6.5 stops of stabilization and that the limiting factor was in fact the rotation of the Earth.  This was rather surprising given the slow and steady improvement since the first such stabilization systems were introduced in lenses in the 1990s.  These only provided a couple stops of benefit.  Since then the technology has improved dramatically and the move from film to silicon has allowed it to be incorporated into the camera itself as IBIS.\n\nA major driver of this increase in stabilization performance has been in the gyroscopic sensors used to measure the vibration and control electronics used to correct it.  For these types of applications, the accuracy of the zero offset of the gyro sensor is often the limiting factor.  Even when perfectly still, noise will cause the sensor to read a small but non-zero value, which will in turn cause the stabilization system to drift.  The smaller the drift, the longer the stabilization system can hold an image steady.  If there were no noise on the gyro sensor and the stabilization system worked perfectly, it should in theory be able to provide an infinite number of stops of benefit.  However, at somewhere around 6 stops of shutter speed increase, the limiting factor stops becoming the electronics, and instead becomes the rotational motion of the Earth!\n\nTo illustrate , lets imagine that you are somewhere on the Earth’s surface, pointing the camera due East or West.  For simplicity, lets assume you are on the equator, but your latitude doesn’t actually matter for this analysis.  There are 86,400 seconds in a day, so Earth rotates at a rate of 2π/86400 radians/second, or 7.27*10^-5 rad/s.  That means that your subject, which is presumably stationary on Earth’s surface as well, is rotating at this rate.  Your camera, which is using its IBIS system to attempt to keep everything as still as possible, may not realize that you are rotating with your subject and will instead try to zero out any rotation of the camera, including that of the Earth.  More technically, the camera is trying to maintain stability with respect to an inertial reference frame, which by virtue of the Earth’s rotation, you and your subject are not.\n\nThe camera will of course move with the Earth and your subject, but will rotate relative to the subject.  If the camera is pointed east as shown in the figure above, it will rotate up relative to the subject.\n\nLets say that you have an exposure time given by the variable T.  IBIS will therefore cause the image to move by a distance on the sensor given by:\n\nUsing our typical standard for the maximum allowable blur to be 1 pixel width, we get the maximum allowable shutter time to be\n\nA 24 megapixel full frame camera will have pixels that are 0.0059mm wide.  Plugging this into the above equation, we get\n\nIf we take 1/Focal Length as the standard advice for the maximum shutter speed you can use to achieve sharp images, this equation says we can use shutter speeds 81 times as long with stabilization before Earth’s rotation blurs the image by one pixel.  In more familiar terms:\n\nNeat.  Of course not all cameras have the same 0.0059mm pixel pitch, but the rule for the maximum hand-held shutter speed will vary accordingly, so this 6.3 stops will be consistent across most cameras.  We can turn this around and say that in order to provide 6.3 stops of stabilization, the system must be able to measure and compensate for rotations of the camera as slow as the Earth’s, or 360 degrees per day.  That’s pretty impressive.\n\nPresumably, a calculation like the one above or very similar was the inspiration for the claim by Olympus Camera:\n\n“6.5 stops is actually a theoretical limitation at the moment due to rotation of the earth interfering with gyro sensors”\n\nSince then the plot has thickened.  Olympus has released the OM-D E-M1X which claims to have 7.5 stops of stabilization, and Panasonic claims their new 70-200 f/2.8 has 7 stops of stabilization.  How could this be?  Without access to the data used to perform the CIPA stabilization rating test for these pieces of equipment, it’s difficult to say for sure.  In theory though, there are some possible ways to work around the limitations placed be Earth’s rotation:\n\nThe first isn’t a good solution for many reasons.  Don’t have GPS signal?  Shooting next to a magnet?  Your system won’t work.  The second solution is much more plausible, but still very difficult.  The user would have to be pointing the camera at the subject for long enough such that the drift in their aim at the subject is smaller than the drift from the rotation of the earth.  This is also implausible.  What is concerning though, is that this second method is one that could work very well to cancel out Earth’s rotation on the CIPA specified stabilization test apparatus.\n\nFor the CIPA stabilization test, the camera is mounted to a vibration platform.  The camera is then moved by the platform in a way that is determined by a CIPA provided waveform designed to mimic the motions from hand-holding a camera.  The setup is shown below:\n\nIn this test setup, the camera is mounted to a very stable platform and held there for a long time before and after the test images are being taken.  In theory, this could make it much easier to for the camera to identify and filter out any effects from Earth’s rotation.  If the waveform has no very low frequency components, it would be easy to identify any low frequency motion as Earth’s rotation.  Without knowing exactly what waveform is given to camera manufacturers to perform this test though, it’s impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions.  It would be great if we could get some independent verification of the stated stabilization values, but CIPA seems to make that deliberately difficult.  As quoted on their application guide:\n\nThis seems unnecessarily restrictive to me and makes independent verification and analysis of the test impossible.\n\nThis has been a long way of saying that I don’t know if Olympus and Panasonic have found a way to compensate for the Earth’s rotation in their stabilization systems, breaking through the 6.3 stop limit, or if they are achieving 7+ stops through oddities of the CIPA rating test.  If anyone has one of these cameras with 7+ stops of stabilization and some time on their hands, it would be really cool to show the camera breaking through the Earth rotation barrier.  If the cameras can’t, and you could show that Earth’s rotation is actually the limiting factor on the stabilization system, well that would be pretty cool too.",

    "description": "Jack Edwards shapes the online world’s reading habits from BookTok. But can he handle his success?",
    "fullText": "“Samuel Johnson, William Hazlitt, Harold Bloom and James Wood. And now you?”\n\n“Oh, I mean, that’s pretty crazy to hear, but I don’t know.”\n\nDr Johnson never filmed a “spicy books with cartoon covers” vlog. But Jack Edwards cannot quite deny being the most important literary critic in the world. In commercial terms, he certainly is. A nod from him fills bathtubs, train carriages and public parks with copies of a book he likes. Booksellers buy and arrange their stock to his taste. And he is not confined to new releases. When he dug up an obscure Dostoevsky (White Nights), his positive review moved it from cellars to shop windows instantaneously. I first met him for this interview around the time of the 2024 International Booker Prize. He had been asked to host the ceremony – and to livestream it. I watched him cruise up the red carpet, encircled by cameras and attendants.\n\nEdwards is a literary tastemaker, but not in the familiar mode. You will not find any submissions of his languishing in the LRB slush pile. Instead he posts on BookTok and BookTube, the social media planes concerned with reading, where millions of viewers watch videos about books. At first, BookTok was confined to the lonely bedrooms of coronavirus lockdowns. Now it has stalls at the Hay Festival and the National Literacy Trust. Waterstones has “BookTok made me buy it” tables.\n\nEdwards is the foremost star of these platforms. Per his bio, he is the “internet’s resident librarian”. He is 27 years old and, on YouTube, has 1.5 million subscribers and 158 million views – which is roughly 16 and 1,755 Wembley Stadiums respectively. He is conventionally handsome, and excitable and sensitive in manner. He started YouTube while at secondary school in Brighton. His first videos were “day in the life” vlogs, study tips and A-level results reactions.\n\nThe boom came when he progressed to Durham University to study literature. His atmospheric recordings of undergraduate life proved so popular that the dean of his college now calls its oversubscription “the Jack Edwards effect”.\n\nHis next major growth spurt came when his university career ended. When Oxford University rejected his master’s application in 2020, Edwards posted a video of himself crying, entitled “oxford university rejected my masters application… (sorry this video is sad)”. Social media rewards confession. Authenticity, sincerity and vulnerability were important – more important than orthodox intellectual baubles. He described social media to me as “democratic… When you log on, you don’t need a qualification, you don’t need to be an established journalist.”\n\nGraduating into the pandemic was “confusing and strange”, he says. Edwards did not feel he could be a “StudyTuber” if he was no longer a student. He spent a month alone. During it, he read 30 books and decided he wanted a career in them. But he could not secure a job in a hotel, let alone one in publishing.\n\nUnlike other hopefuls, however, Edwards had a platform. He could not get jobs with publishers, but HarperCollins was willing to publish his guide to university life, The Uni-Verse. Having tried the conventional routes into employment, Edwards launched himself as a full-time book influencer. He posted reading-related videos from London, Paris, New York, Korea and elsewhere. The period was “really special” to Edwards. He read favourite authors in their native locations. He started Mieko Kawakami’s All the Lovers in the Night on the bullet train to Tokyo and finished the last page as the train arrived. “From the first page I was just absolutely entranced… I felt this real sense of catharsis, that I’d been through this entire journey, physically throughout Japan, but also with that author.” Occasionally, in a bodega, a coffee shop, a bookstore or a library, people would “tap me on the shoulder and say that they read their favourite book because they found it from my channel. And there’s no better feeling in the world than that – nothing.”\n\nLike many graduates his age, Edwards settled down in London. He posts reviews, commentary and hauls. His style as a literary creator has become defined, and honours the lessons of his social media success. Books get positive reviews if they stir his emotions – especially if they make him weep. With social media, he told me, “we can visually see people reacting to a book and having a kind of subjective emotional response that feels even more personal than maybe a book critic or journalist can. [In traditional reviews] we don’t get to see them crying in response to a book that broke their heart. I think that’s part of the magic of BookTok.”\n\nEdwards champions BookTok and also defends it. Critics argue that the platform is more about being seen reading than actually reading, and that it promotes low-quality fiction. Edwards rejects that characterisation energetically: “The only feature common to all ‘BookTok books’ – which can mean both enemies-to-lovers roommate novels and Greek mythological retellings – is popularity with a young audience.” He reminds me of “White Nights”, the Dostoevsky story that his review placed “alongside Colleen Hoover and Sarah J Maas on a ‘BookTok made me buy it’ shelf… I’ll recommend contemporary novels alongside classics because I think often we’re looking for those moments that resonate with us and that feel perennial, that feel evergreen.”\n\nHis favourite classics are by Toni Morrison and James Baldwin. They are “people who I think really understood the human condition, what it was to feel, to love, and to interact with the people around us.” More recently, “I’m a big Sally Rooney fan. She talks about when you’re on your deathbed you’ll think about the people that you loved and that you interacted with… it’s not frivolous to make art about the people that you loved and that you interacted with.”\n\nHe keeps his core content mostly apolitical. There is a progressive, inclusionary tone to his videos – “a book from every country in Asia” or “banned books and rainbow capitalism” – but he is seldom explicitly partisan online. He is more outspoken, however, on his X account, where he reposts Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana and makes no secret of his dislike for Keir Starmer’s Labour government.\n\nMostly, his commitment is to books. He told me: “I think one of the truest things for the world right now is that the worst of times can facilitate really incredible art, and we need that sort of self-expression.” Where we have come from, where we are going, and so on are crucial considerations when giving praise: “They always do represent where we’re at as a society and a culture.” Edwards quoted Bertolt Brecht, asking if there will also be singing in the dark times – and answering yes: there will be singing about the dark times.\n\nWhen we first spoke I was struck by how open and positive Edwards was. It may come easily to the enormously successful, but Edwards maintained a generous, pleasant perspective the whole time we spoke. Abusive comments: “Sometimes people’s responses can be quite personal. I suppose that’s probably the drawback. But the pros outweigh the cons by a long way!” A spanner about the Booker’s politics: “You’re making me work for it, I’m on my toes!” Suffering a fanbase pile-on, as he did after criticising the author of The Kissing Booth: “Yeah! People feel very strongly about books. That’s part of the fun!” On the relevance of establishment awards: “For me they’re a good guiding light to discover new things.” On pressure: “I obviously feel pressure being online… to always keep it kind.”\n\nIt seems he has always been that way. A student at university contemporaneously with Edwards told me how sardonic whispers would circulate whenever it became known that “the YouTuber” was in a bar. People would ask for selfies, not without a trace of nastiness. At that time, Edwards was far from successful enough to overwhelm such sneers. But he was always a good sport. I was shown a picture in which he had been willing to hold up a baby doll that he had been handed without explanation.\n\nBut soon after our first interview, Edwards’s output waned. His videos became sparser and more subdued, and they stayed that way for the rest of 2024. Then, at the start of 2025, Edwards posted a confessional video titled “every book I want to read in 2025 (and why i stopped posting book reviews)”. He described last year as “something to survive” and admitted that it had “got to the point where I had to really seriously consider whether I wanted to continue doing this.”\n\nEdwards is subject to copious online abuse. On camera, he mentioned withholding his opinions on pop culture because people called them cringe. But the harassment is much harsher than that, and touches on topics Edwards does not mention. The top posts on his own Reddit page accuse him – without citing evidence – of not reading the books he talks about, plagiarising reviews and “scamming” his followers with unsubstantial paid-content tiers. The thread about him on the gossip forum Tattle Life has been remade after reaching the site’s comment limit four times. The comments often speculate, cruelly, about his sexuality.\n\nOn top of calculated abuse, Edwards also suffered from the ambient pressures of fame. For instance, the book review site Goodreads labels Edwards’s account “#1 most read”: if he leaves a review on a book, it will be the first one users see, meaning a negative review can severely affect a book’s chances of success.\n\nAll this got to Edwards. Friends asked if he realised he was apologising and issuing disclaimers before speaking when he socialised with them. He lived with his “guard up all the time, flinching constantly, feeling just genuinely afraid to share anything”. He stopped posting opinions and even changed his accent because of criticism. In the video in which he discussed his withdrawal, he acknowledged commenters who said they missed “the old Jack”. He said, “I miss him too, I really do.”\n\nBecoming an influencer is now by many accounts the most popular career ambition for the young. But many who succeed take long breaks for their mental health, or withdraw entirely. Edwards reckons that online fame is “not something the human brain is wired for”. He described it as “traumatic” to see “so many people discussing something about you.” It feels “so invasive and intimate”.\n\nEdwards was born in Brighton in 1998 with terrible eyesight. A prescription of 8.75 keeps you off the football pitch. “You don’t really see the ball until it’s, like, inches from your face, and by that point it’s too late to pick which part of the head it’s gonna hit,” Edwards told me when we spoke again in August last year. His bookishness proceeded from his near blindness; his parents taught him the letters very young so they could get him a proper eye test. He started a blog to review the new Hunger Games film when he was 14.\n\nIf reading was a solitary pastime for Edwards the child, it is a solitary job for Edwards the man. He lives in a flat in Soho – not a cheap part of London – with another content creator for a flatmate. He never joined anything like a graduate scheme with colleagues his age. He rents a co-working space because, he says, “I like to feel like there is life going on around me.” He sometimes wishes someone would give him feedback on his work before he publishes it, because when the first judges are the commenters, “at that point there’s no room to manoeuvre… you kind of get tested in the public court before you, you know?”\n\nEdwards’s Zoom background featured the same bookshelves visible in his dejected January 2025 video. But he seemed to have developed a new toughness since then. He looked older, with a more muscular neck and longer, slightly receding hair, and he seemed almost bloody-minded about pushing on. In his own words, “Maybe my prefrontal cortex just developed, but I no longer care to have to argue my point or prove my moral worth every time I don’t enjoy something.” He dismissed unfair criticism flatly, calling it “nitpicking culture” and “moral panic” that is “not how the world works”. Where his old videos overshared in “toxic honesty”, he now has definite lines about not discussing his friends or relationships. That “really cutting remarks” are the comments that “stay with you”, he acknowledged as an unfortunate but permanent fact. He had a detached view of social media. As well as disdaining the angsts it causes, he distrusts the comforts it offers. “You have this illusion of community,” it was surprising to hear him say, “when we’re really very alone.”\n\nHis latest project is an attempt to forge real community, though it is still essentially a social media product. He wants his new book club, Inklings, to be “this book club community where I can have something that’s a bit more solid, tangible”. When I asked about his hopes for the next five years, he said he was focusing on the work. At that time, Inklings had no episodes but was already the fastest-growing club in the platform Fable’s history. Since then, its episodes have featured Oisín McKenna (Evenings and Weekends), David Nicholls (One Day), Coco Mellors (Cleopatra and Frankenstein), Luke Thompson (Bridgerton) and the actor Cillian Murphy.\n\nIn September, he recorded an episode with Palestine-born novelist Yasmin Zaher at the Saatchi Gallery. A large, orderly crowd filled pews in a white gallery lit by pink accent lights. I had been the only man of the first 20 people to queue. It was possible to track the location of a daddy long legs that was floating through the room by the screaming and lurching it provoked. Edwards came down the aisle in a t-shirt and corduroy trousers, laughing nervously and smiling at his fans, who cheered. On stage, he said it was “so special for me to get to be here with you all… to take this thing we do in isolation… moments we spend in our own heads… and turn it into community”.\n\nEdwards said he escaped feeling overexposed by “finding something – for me, it’s been books and reading – to refract everything through”. He asked whether Zaher’s characters obsessed over “being clean, perhaps because there’s little else they can control”, and whether, in the case of another, the “dirty parts of her she couldn’t clean then became a target”. He said we knew “almost too much” about the protagonist when we heard her “sexual perversions and hot takes”, and mentioned another who “withholds, and she keeps for herself almost as a way of maintaining ownership of, and having control of, her identity, and saying, actually, I can’t be defined by external sources; I define myself”.\n\nZaher’s novel, The Coin, was her debut. Edwards asked if being unknown allowed her a “lack of inhibitions”. She agreed that you are freer when “you don’t know who your audience may be”. Edwards knows who his audience is, and they know him. He told me of fans commenting on his interviews that they could answer every question for him.\n\nBut if the relationship is not free; it is tender. Rose, 25, unemployed after failing to find a job in publishing, had been watching him “constantly for five years”. She said, “I literally rediscovered the love of literature through him – so big, big fan.” Allesia, 21, unemployed after recently graduating, had gotten into Edwards after immigrating from Ukraine six years ago, at which point she could not read in English. “I like how accessible he is to people who don’t read or have just started reading.” Ryan, 28, had watched Edwards for a decade. He now directs AI engineering at a tech company but had previously worked for influencers in LA. He had seen that “it’s all consuming when your entire life is to be someone; that can be brutal”.\n\nAlmost everyone was there by themselves. Some came with a parent or a friend, but I didn’t see a crowd of three. Rose said Edwards’s content was “the kind you stumble onto when you’re, like, in your room alone”. Ryan said that in his decade of viewing he had come to “enjoy my self more”. Almost immediately after taking the microphone, Edwards had said, “Bear with me while I try not to cry.” It was easy to imagine his audience feeling he had done the same for them. Edwards helped people, Rose reckoned: “He brings a lot of, like, humanity and empathy… I think the world would be a better place if everyone read fiction. It’s literally learning how to put yourself in other people’s shoes.”\n\nEdwards is working on his first novel. He would only tell me that it is historical and set in the UK. He will certainly find a publisher. He claims his whole life has been “that pursuit of letters on a page”. Whether that pursuit will lead to literary greatness of course remains to be seen. He may not become Dr Johnson – but Jack Edwards seems, at last, to be becoming himself.\n\n[Further reading: Cats are better than dogs – and much better than David Baddiel]",

    "title": "How China's 'Hurricane 3000' Microwave Weapon Drops Drones From The Air",
    "description": "Drone swarms can quickly overwhelm defenses and are difficult to combat effectively, but China's new microwave system could be about to change that.",
    "fullText": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has changed the face of battlefields forever. The widespread use of drones has left traditional air defenses floundering; launching missiles that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to counter threats that may only cost a few hundred dollars is not practical. Scale this up to countering swarms of drones, and the logistics, costs, and effectiveness of such systems wane even further. This is why systems like Israel's Iron Beam laser weapon that can destroy drones for a few dollars \"a pop\" are being developed and introduced into combat service.\n\nThe Chinese Hurricane 3000 system is another new weapon developed to tackle the growing use of drones in combat. However, unlike the laser-based Israeli system, the Hurricane 3000  system uses microwaves to disable drones and drone swarms at ranges exceeding 3 kilometers (1.9 miles). This is a similar weapon to the US Army's Leonidas microwave weapon, although China claims that the 3000's reported three-kilometer-plus range is over a kilometer more than the Leonidas system.\n\nThe Zhuhai Airshow in 2024 was when the public got a first peek at the new system, and it was later showcased during a military parade in Beijing in September 2025. More recently, Norinco, the Chinese state-owned contractor that developed the system, has disclosed some of the system's technical details and its intended role. Both systems are vehicle-mounted and can be operated independently or networked into a cohesive air defence system with missile, laser, and artillery units.\n\nThe history of war is not just a tale of conflicts; it's also often a story of an arms race that can seesaw dramatically. The rising use of drones on the battlefield amply demonstrates this point, as arms manufacturers clamor to come up with practical solutions to address this threat not just effectively, but cost-effectively. The use of high-power microwave weapons (HPM) is one area where developers have thrown a lot of resources, and the Chinese weapon is the latest manifestation of this.\n\nUnlike laser or kinetic weapons, HPMs are designed to overwhelm a drone or a UAV's electronic systems using bursts of concentrated electromagnetic energy. These bursts travel at the speed of light and can cause drones to fail in several ways, including EMI-induced timing errors and physical damage to electronic components. Another feature of such weapons is their versatility; advanced systems like Epirus' Leonidas can not only target specific drones but have already disabled a swarm of 49 drones in a few seconds. And, as long as they have power, the other main advantages of these weapons are a bottomless ammunition supply and an exponentially lower engagement cost.\n\nThe fact that these beams travel at the speed of light allows a rapid response once a target is detected and tracked. This makes them effective against fast, low-flying drones that are difficult (and potentially costly) to intercept using traditional air-defense methods. However, the system isn't flawless; it's generally considered to be a line-of-sight weapon, and its effectiveness can be reduced with effective shielding.\n\nThe Hurricane 3000 and its smaller Hurricane 2000 variant are mobile, truck-mounted systems that have moved from the experimental stage to field deployment and were showcased at China's 2025 V-Day Military Parade. The more advanced Hurricane 3000 system has a longer range,  improved tracking, detection, and fully automated combat capabilities. Overall, according to Yu Jianjun, a Norinco expert, the 3000 represents a \"comprehensive upgrade in combat performance compared to the Hurricane 2000.\"\n\nThe system uses radar to detect threats at longer ranges. Once detected, the system switches to optoelectronic sensors to guide the microwave antennas onto the target. However, this is not designed to replace existing air defenses. Rather, it's intended to complement the existing \"traditional\" missile and artillery systems to form an \"iron triangle\" drone defense system, with each system used to its own strengths.\n\nWhile the primary focus of the development program was to develop an effective way of countering the drone threat, Norinco says it wants to explore other potential applications for the platform. Mr. Yu said that among the options being explored are the use of the weapon to counter electronic warfare aircraft, interrupt communications, counteracting precision weapons, and, it's being proposed as a non-lethal active denial system against people. The latter is a beam of focused energy that can cause the recipients to encounter an intolerable burning sensation that has a minimal risk of injury.\n\nIn short, the Hurricane and similar weapons exist because shooting million-dollar missiles at hobby-grade drones stopped making sense.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "title": "Video of man taunting huge creature at marina sparks outrage online: 'Those things can destroy you'",
    "description": "\"Stop messing with nature unless it messes with you.\"",
    "fullText": "Sometimes a video shows someone doing something so ill-considered that it leaves viewers wondering how the person made it out of the situation uninjured — as was the case with footage of a tourist effectively picking a fight with a sea lion instead of enjoying a peaceful vacation.\n\nThe reel shared by the Tourons of National Parks (@touronsofnationalparks) Instagram account prompted strong criticism of the subject's decision-making.\n\nThe video shows a man spotting a sea lion at the boat launch of a marina. Instead of leaving the animal in peace, he goes up to terrorize it, egged on by voices off-camera. Lunging at the creature, raising a balled fist, and then trying to tackle the animal, the tourist jokingly appears to instigate a fight.\n\nLuckily, for his sake, the sea lion only squares up to him without doing serious damage. However, sea lion attacks have been on the rise in certain areas, according to CNN, and people have reported bites and uncharacteristic aggression that the news report attributed to toxic algae impacting the sea creatures.\n\nSadly, the encounter in the video is far from the first time that tourists have provoked wild animals. Videos of them aggravating elk, taunting bison, and getting charged at by oryx antelopes have gone viral, with many commenters criticizing the subjects for their thoughtless, dangerous, and cruel behavior.\n\nWild animals are not living their lives to entertain humans, and the audacity to try to harass a sea lion for no reason is dangerous. Not only is the tourist in the video causing stress to the animal, but he is also putting both himself and the sea lion at risk of harm.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court rejected the Justice Department's bid to charge five more people accused of disrupting a Minnesota church service this ​month, according to court documents made public on Saturday, revealing the lengths the Trump administration ‌has gone to prosecute those involved in the demonstration.\n\nThe ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest ‌legal setback for the Justice Department as it pursues demonstrators who interrupted a service on Sunday in protest of a pastor's apparent connection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One judge involved in the case said the department's request appeared to be unprecedented.\n\nA federal magistrate judge this week declined to approve arrest warrants ⁠for five proposed defendants, including former ‌CNN anchor Don Lemon, who recorded the demonstration, citing a lack of evidence. The judge approved charges for three alleged leaders of the demonstration, but struck ‍a proposed charge accusing them of physically obstructing a house of worship.\n\nDEFENDANTS ACCUSE ADMINISTRATION OF RETALIATION\n\nThe case has drawn substantial attention as the Trump administration pursues a sweeping immigration crackdown in the state and administration officials have vowed ​to protect Christian services.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ‌three defendants — activists Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly — were each charged with conspiracy against rights for allegedly intimidating and harassing parishioners, according to a criminal complaint. They have accused the Trump administration of retaliation over their protest.\n\nThe Justice Department first asked the chief trial judge and later the appeals court to immediately intervene and approve warrants for the five other proposed defendants, citing ⁠a risk of similar church disruptions.\n\nThe chief U.S. District Court ​judge in Minnesota, Patrick Schiltz, described the Justice Department's request ​as \"unheard of in our district\" and any other under the 8th Circuit, which covers seven U.S. states, according to a letter made public on Saturday.\n\nAll three judges ‍on the 8th Circuit panel ⁠agreed not to intervene. One judge, Leonard Steven Grasz, wrote that he believed prosecutors had shown enough evidence to justify charges against the other proposed defendants, but that prosecutors have ⁠ways to get them approved other than through the appeals court.\n\nThe Justice Department can still ask a grand jury to ‌approve charges against the demonstrators or seek to present additional evidence to the magistrate judge.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The bloodiest crackdown on dissent since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution is slowly coming into focus, despite authorities cutting off the Islamic Republic from the internet and much of the wider world.\n\nCities and towns smell of smoke as fire-damaged mosques and government offices line streets. Banks have been torched, their ATMs smashed. Officials estimate the damage to be at least $125 million, according to an Associated Press tally of reports by the state-run IRNA news agency from over 20 cities.\n\nThe number of dead demonstrators reported by activists continues to swell. Activists warn it shows Iran engaging in the same tactics it has used for decades, but at an unprecedented scale — firing from rooftops on demonstrators, shooting birdshot into crowds and sending motorcycle-riding paramilitary Revolutionary Guard volunteers in to beat and detain those who can’t escape.\n\n“The vast majority of protesters were peaceful. The video footage shows crowds of people — including children and families — chanting, dancing around bonfires, marching on their streets,” said Raha Bahreini, of Amnesty International. \"The authorities have opened fire unlawfully.”\n\nThe killing of peaceful protesters — as well as the threat of mass executions — have been a red line for military action for U.S. President Donald Trump. An American aircraft carrier and warships are approaching the Mideast, possibly allowing Trump to launch another attack on Iran after bombing its nuclear enrichment sites last year. That risks igniting a new Mideast war.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to detailed questions from the AP regarding the suppression of the demonstrations.\n\nThe demonstrations began Dec. 28 at Tehran’s historic Grand Bazaar, initially over the collapse of Iran's currency, the rial, then spread across the country.\n\nTensions exploded on Jan. 8, with demonstrations called for by Iran's exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi. Witnesses in Tehran told the AP before authorities cut internet and phone communication that they saw tens of thousands of demonstrators on the streets.\n\nAs communications failed, gunfire echoed through Tehran.\n\n“Many witnesses said they had never seen such a large number of protesters on the streets,” said Bahar Saba of Human Rights Watch. “Iranian authorities have repeatedly shown they have no answers other than bullets and brutal repression to people taking to the streets.”\n\nAli Akbar Pourjamshidian, a deputy interior minister speaking on state TV Wednesday, acknowledged the violence began in earnest on Jan. 8.\n\n“More than 400 cities were involved,\" he said.\n\n“Tonight you all must be vigilant. Tonight is the night for keeping mosques, all bases everywhere filled with ‘Hezbollahi,’” Yekta said, using a word for “followers of God” that carries the connotation of fervent supporters of Iran's theocracy.\n\nAlready weakened by the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June, the authorities decided to fully employ violence to end the demonstrations, experts said.\n\n“I think the regime viewed it as this was a moment of existential threat and that they could either allow it to play out and allow the protests to build and allow foreign powers to increase their rhetoric and increase their demands on Iran,” said Afshon Ostovar, an expert on the Revolutionary Guard and professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California.\n\n\"Or they could turn out the lights, kill as many people as necessary ... and hope they could get away with it. And I think that’s what they ultimately did.”\n\nBasij key in disrupting protests\n\nIn Iran, one of the main ways its theocracy can squash demonstrations is through the Basij, the Guard's volunteer arm.\n\nMosques in Iran include facilities for the Basij. Guard Gen. Heydar Baba Ahmadi was quoted by the semiofficial Mehr news agency in 2024 as estimating “79% of Basij resistance bases are located in mosques and 5% in other holy places.”\n\nIranian state media repeatedly has aired images of mosques damaged in the protests without exploring their links to the Basij.\n\n“Most neighborhood Basij bases are co-located with mosques and most neighborhood Basij leaders are associated with the mosque leadership,\" Ostovar said, adding that demonstrators “going after regime targets” associated with repression would have considered them “a legitimate part of it.”\n\nVideos show Basij holding long guns, batons and pellet guns. Anti-riot police can be seen wearing helmets and body armor, carrying assault rifles and submachine guns.\n\nThe videos show police firing shotguns into crowds, something authorities deny despite corpses showing wounds consistent with metal birdshot. Scores have reportedly suffered blinding eye wounds from birdshot — something seen in the protests around the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.\n\nIran's semiofficial ILNA news agency reported that Tehran's Farabi Eye Hospital, the premiere clinic for eye injuries, called in “all current and retired doctors” to help those injured.\n\nWe “received accounts that the security forces were just firing relentlessly at protesters,” said Bahreini of Amnesty International.\n\n\"They’re not just targeting one or two people to create a climate of terror for people to disperse ... but just relentlessly firing at thousands of protesters and chasing after them, even as they were fleeing so that more people were just collapsing to the ground with severe gunshot wounds.”\n\nCasualties grow as crackdown intensifies\n\nFor two weeks, Iran offered no overall casualty figures. Then on Wednesday, the government said 3,117 people were killed, including 2,427 civilians and security forces. That left another 690 dead that Pourjamshidian identified as “terrorists.”\n\nThat conflicts with figures from the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which put the death toll on Saturday at 5,137, based on activists inside Iran verifying fatalities against public records and witness statements. It said 4,834 were demonstrators, 208 were government-affiliated personnel, 54 were children and 41 were civilians not participating in protests.\n\nDeath tolls in Iran have long been inflated or deflated for political reasons. But the fact that Iran's theocracy offered any death toll — and gave a number beyond any other political unrest to strike the country in the modern era — underlines the scale of what happened.\n\nIt also provides a justification for the ongoing mass arrest campaign and internet shutdown. State media report dozens to hundreds of people detained daily.\n\nPourjamshidian also gave an extensive list of vandalism from the protests and crackdown, including 750 banks, 414 government buildings, 600 ATMs and hundreds of vehicles that sustained damage.\n\nMeanwhile, uncertainty looms for Iran's theocracy over what Trump may or may not do.\n\nTraditionally, Iranians hold memorial services for their late loved ones 40 days after their deaths — meaning the country could see renewed demonstrations around Feb. 17. Online videos from Behesht-e Zahra, the massive cemetery on the outskirts of Tehran, show mourners chanting: “Death to Khamenei!”\n\nSatellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by the AP show large numbers of cars daily at Behesht-e Zahra’s southern reaches, where those killed in the demonstrations are being buried.\n\nElaheh Mohammadi, a journalist at Tehran's pro-reform newspaper Ham Mihan, recently noted it had been shut by authorities. She said journalists were working on stories about Behesht-e Zahra they weren't able to publish.\n\n“We send out a message to let people know we’re still alive,” Mohammadi wrote online. “The city smells of death.”\n\n“Hard days have passed and everyone is stunned; a whole country is in mourning, a whole country is holding back tears, a whole country has a lump in its throat.\"",

    "fullText": "Bank of America (BAC) just waved a not-so-subtle red flag for bond market investors and anyone positioned in the stock market.\n\nIn a new Flow Show note, chief equity strategist Michael Hartnett argued that the era “anything but bonds” is here, and that the traditional safety trade has failed.\n\nIn laying out his curt rationale, he said the first half of the 2020s delivered what he terms “bond-market humiliation,” with long-duration government debt suffering unprecedented damage.\n\nFor perspective, the data support Hartnett’s point that long-duration government bonds have indeed incurred large, unusual losses.\n\nThe iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (a proxy for “long bonds”) shed a massive 31% in 2022 (one of its worst years), with the maximum drawdown at nearly -47.8% from its 2020 peak through late 2025.\n\nSo where does the money go when bonds can no longer protect your portfolio?\n\nWell, BofA’s answer is broad and, in many ways, among the more contrarian takes.\n\nHartnett expects the back half of the decade to favor international stocks, emerging markets, commodities, and gold, with a weaker dollar fueling overseas reflation.\n\nSo the AI stocks that have hogged all the spotlight over the past three years could take a back seat to small- and mid-cap players on the back of powerful reshoring trends and industrial rebuilding.\n\nBofA’s warning is less about the next big trade and more about the foundation beneath investing portfolios, which has apparently shifted.\n\nHartnett believes that bonds (the shock absorbers) effectively failed at their primary job, compelling investors to rethink risk across the entire stock market.\n\nThat rethink, Hartnett believes, is underway already.\n\nA weaker dollar, stronger commodity prices, and reflation outside the U.S. will favor international and emerging-market stocks, which have otherwise lagged.\n\nGoldman Sachs issues urgent take on stock market for 2026\n\nAnalyst who nailed 2023 bull run sets S&P 500 target for 2026\n\nLongtime fund manager sends blunt message on P/E ratios\n\nNasdaq’s near 24-hour trading plan sparks Wall Street backlash\n\nEvery major analyst’s S&P 500 price target for 2026\n\nFor perspective, the U.S. Dollar Index has shed 9% of its value in the last 12 months and dropped nearly 2% in the last 5 days alone, MarketWatch noted.\n\nTo look at the numbers for emerging stocks, let's take a clean gauge in the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF to see how they’ve fared against the tech-heavy S&P 500.\n\nFor the full year 2025, here’s how the tape fared.",

What the f*ck is wrong with you?” the woman yelled as ICE agents surrounded their target and dragged him to the ground. As ICE continued to wrestle with the man, a shot rang out, followed by multiple more shots as the officers moved away from the victim.\n\nThe woman holding the camera screamed and moved away from the scene before returning and yelling repeatedly, “What the f*ck did you do?!”\n\nThe video then showed the man lying on his back motionless as the ICE officers backed away, some with guns pointed at the victim.\n\nOthers were heard screaming in the background as the person with the orange backpack ran toward the woman recording.\n\n“Oh, my God, Oh, my God! What the f*ck did you just do?” the woman yelled repeatedly as the ICE agents stood over the man.\n\n“Someone call the ambulance!” the woman yelled over and over as another person yelled “Call 9-1-1!”\n\n“Somebody call 9-1-1!

    "description": "Forecast of cold temperatures has held true. Wichita has had a negative wind chill since late Friday morning.",
    "fullText": "Wichita saw about 3.2 inches of snow from Friday through noon Saturday, with the potential for a few more inches before the storm ends, Wichita-based National Weather Service meteorologist James Cuellar said.\n\nWichita was originally forecast to get 6-10 inches of snow. Cuellar said Wichita will likely now be \n\nAreas north of Wichita have already seen more snow than that, with the highest amount being around seven inches near Beloit.\n\nHowever, most of Kansas will end up having less snow than originally forecast, as the storm, which is affecting most of the eastern half of the U.S., has now shifted south of most of Kansas.\n\nHere is a look at how much snow has fallen across Kansas through 10 a.m. Saturday:\n\nFriday’s prediction also called for snow hitting Wichita area in two rounds, the second being Saturday night into Sunday morning. Cuellar said the forecast now shows snowfall throughout the day Saturday, that will likely taper off in the evening.\n\nBut, he said, “Wichita is going to be right on the border” of a band of snow hitting tonight that’s more likely to hit along and east of the Turnpike in south-central and southeast Kansas. The band will be a “pretty sharp line” where 20 miles will mean a large difference in snowfall, he said.\n\nIf it does hit Wichita directly, it could push the top-end total snowfall to about 7 inches, he said. It would also keep the snow falling in Wichita later into Sunday morning.\n\nEven if the original snow predictions fall short, the cold was the biggest concern for Kansas with this storm. The coldest wind chill so far in Wichita was negative 17 degrees before 11 p.m. on Friday night, with the wind chill remaining in the negative teens all Saturday morning. The temperature hasn’t climbed above the single digits since late Friday morning.\n\nNegative wind chills are still forecast in the mornings on Sunday and Monday.\n\nIn states south and east of Kansas, there are still concerns for “catastrophic ice accumulation,” according to the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center.\n\n“Long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous and impassable travel conditions are likely,” the prediction center said. “Catastrophic impacts are expected where freezing rain amounts exceed one-half inch, with locally over one inch ice accumulation possible in parts of northern Louisiana, central and northern Mississippi, southern Tennessee, and the southern Appalachians.”",

    "description": "John...",
    "fullText": "A powerful statement from Jacob Frey pleads with Trump to pull ICE forces out of Minneapolis before more people are killed.\n\nOne day after tens of thousands of Minnesotans marched in sub-zero weather to call for an end to the violent presence of federal forces on the streets of Minneapolis, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed another Minnesotan Saturday morning on the streets of the city where, on January 7, an ICE agent gunned down 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.\n\nPresident Trump, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials quickly issued unsubstantiated claims that the Minnesotan who died Saturday—a man identified as Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse who worked with the Veterans Administration and was an active member of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3669—was an armed “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law enforcement,” and that the federal agent fired in self-defense.\n\nBut the immediate responses from the administration, with their propagandistic and contradictory language (including an unwarranted DHS claim that Pretti, who was reportedly a 37-year-old licensed gun owner with no known criminal history beyond traffic citations, intended to “massacre law enforcement”), mirrored discredited and widely condemned statements made by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other officials following the Good shooting. Expressing deep skepticism about statements from DHS and ICE as a rush to judgment, and urging calm, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz promised a thorough investigation, while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a sober yet impassioned call to President Trump to end ICE’s mass surge into the city.\n\nBack on January 7, Mayor Frey made international headlines when he challenged the validity of claims by Noem and her aides and associates, which contradicted the evidence from videos recorded as Good was killed. “Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bullshit,” said Frey, who declared, “To ICE, get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”\n\nFrey’s statement following Saturday’s shooting employed different language. Yet it was no less powerful, and no less compelling. And it is worth considering in its entirety.\n\nI just saw a video of more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death. How many more residents, how many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end? How many more lives need to be lost before this administration realizes that a political and partisan narrative is not as important as American values? How many times must local and national leaders plead with you, Donald Trump, to end this operation and recognize that this is not creating safety in our city?\n\nAs you’ll hear from [Minneapolis Emergency Management Department Rachel] Sayre in just a second, we have seen these kinds of operations in other places, in other countries, but not here in America—not in a way where a great American city is being invaded by its own federal government.\n\nI’m done being told that our community members are responsible for the vitriol in our streets. I’m done being told that our local elected officials are solely responsible for turning down the temperature. Just yesterday, we saw 15,000 people peacefully protesting in the streets, speaking out, standing up for their neighbors. Not a single broken window, not a single injury. Those peaceful protests embody the very principles that both Minneapolis and America was founded upon.\n\nConversely, the mass militarized force and unidentified agents who are occupying our streets, that is what weakens our country. That is what erodes trust in both law enforcement and in democracy itself. So, to everyone listening, stand with Minneapolis. Stand up for America. Recognize that your children will ask you: What side you were on? Your grandchildren will ask you what you did to act to prevent this from happening again, to make sure that the foundational elements of our democracy were rock solid. What did you do to protect your city? What did you do to protect your nation?\n\nThis is not what America is about. This is not a partisan issue. This is an American issue. This administration, and everyone involved in this operation should be reflecting. They should be reflecting right now, and asking themselves, what exactly are you accomplishing? If the goal was to achieve peace and safety, this is doing exactly the opposite. If the goal was to achieve calm and prosperity, this is doing exactly the opposite. Are you standing up for American families right now or are we tearing them apart?\n\nThe invasion of these heavily armed masked agents roaming around on our streets of Minneapolis, emboldened with a sense of impunity, it has to end. This is not how it has to be.\n\nSo, to President Trump, this is a moment to act like a leader. Put Minneapolis, put America first in this moment. Let’s achieve peace. Let’s end this operation; and I’m telling you, our city will come back, safety will be restored. We’re asking for you to take action now to remove these federal agents.\n\nWith that, the mayor called on Sayre, the director of the Emergency Management Department for the City of Minneapolis, to address the chaos that unfolded since the beginning of the Trump administration’s massive Operation Metro Surge, which is targeting the city’s immigrant communities.\n\nDescribing “the terror and the feeling of helplessness” of the people of Minneapolis, Sayre added, “My background is in international humanitarian response in conflict zones. In Yemen, Haiti, Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine. What I’ve seen here is what I’ve seen there. A powerful entity violently and intentionally terrorizing people, making them afraid to go outside so they can’t earn a living, so that kids are forced out of school. This has a lasting generational impact. People can’t plan a single day of their lives because they don’t know who is around the corner and if their family member or a neighbor is about to be taken away.”",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts wears No. 30 as a tribute to his late mentor and friend, Maury Wills.\n\nWills previously wore the number when he played for the Dodgers as their shortstop from 1959-1966 and 1969-1972. Roberts formed a close friendship with his mentor when he was a member of the Dodgers from 2002-2004.\n\nWills worked as a special instructor for the Dodgers and worked closely with a young Roberts on baserunning and bunting. While Roberts was traded in the middle of the 2004 season to the Boston Red Sox, the pair maintained a close relationship.\n\nRoberts continued to wear No. 30 after his playing career was over as he chose to sport the number when he became the Dodgers’ manager in 2016.\n\nWills passed away in September 2022 and had expressed to Roberts prior to his death that he hoped nobody else would wear No. 30.\n\nFlash forward to 2026, the Dodgers signed Kyle Tucker to a four-year, $240 million deal. The All-Star outfielder had previously worn No. 30 throughout his entire career, but chose a new jersey number after a conversation with Roberts.\n\n“It was a fun conversation that Tuck and I had,” the Dodgers skipper said at Tucker’s introductory press conerence. “It was just more of, Maury and I have just had such a great relationship. And one of the things that he was like, ‘Gosh, before I die, I hope—or when I die, I hope that no one else wears that number.’ And so, it’s really near and dear to me.”\n\nRoberts first joined the Dodgers as a fourth-year player after playing the first three seasons of his career with the Cleveland Guardians, where he wore No. 20.\n\nRoberts was traded to the Red Sox in the midst of this third season in LA. The outfielder became a key figure for Boston’s improbable World Series run in 2004, most notably for his stolen base in Game 4 of the 2004 AL Championship Series.\n\nWhile Roberts only played 45 regular season games for the Red Sox, he became a beloved figure in Boston as his stolen base represents the turning point for the organization’s World Series title.\n\nRoberts has a .266 career batting average with 23 home runs, 213 RBIs and 243 stolen bases. He accumulated a 9.1 career bWAR over 10 MLB seasons.\n\nWhile Roberts had a respectable playing career, he is regarded as one of the best managers in baseball. Roberts will end up in Cooperstown and has already cemented his legacy as the arguably the greatest Dodgers skipper in franchise history.",

    "fullText": "The Steelers will be undergoing several coaching changes this offseason following the resignation of head coach Mike Tomlin. Pittsburgh verbally agreed to hire Mike McCarthy on Saturday as its next head coach, and the Steelers will also be searching for a new offensive coordinator.\n\nSteelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith is expected to take the same role at Ohio State, as reported by ESPN’s Pete Thamel on Saturday.\n\nSmith served as the Steelers offensive coordinator from 2024 to 2025 after the Atlanta Falcons let him go as head coach. Smith began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at North Carolina. He’s only spent two years coaching at the college level, including a season as a defensive intern at Ole Miss in 2010.\n\nOhio State’s offensive coordinator Brian Hartline accepted the head coaching position at South Florida in early December. Now, the Buckeyes have finally found someone to take charge of their offense.\n\nOhio State’s head coach, Ryan Day is known for his offensive-minded approach; however, he allowed Hartline to handle the play-calling throughout last season, only stepping in for the College Football Playoffs. It’s likely that Smith will take over the play-calling duties at Ohio State moving forward.\n\nThe Steelers will now be on the lookout for their next offensive coordinator, and that search is likely to kick off soon.\n\nMore NFL: NFL Writer Identifies College QB Steelers Could Draft To Pair With Mike McCarthy\n\nThe post Ex-Steelers Coach Reportedly Hired By Ohio State appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay.\n\nIn between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in team history.\n\nBut those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for players who followed her to the national team.\n\n“Well, it's sort of the point, right?” she said ahead of Saturday’s farewell ceremony before a crowd of 19,397. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like.\n\n“It's different, and it's going to take different things for people to have success.”\n\nTalk about following in Press’ footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S. goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City’s Ally Sentnor.\n\nAnd that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay’s Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears.\n\nPress scored her final international goal in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October.\n\nThat, Press said, will continue to provide her with a link to the game.\n\n“We're so integrated into the women's sports ecosystem, through podcasts, through merchandise and through the women's soccer community,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it.\n\n“In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.”\n\nPress got her start in soccer in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, about a dozen miles from where her career officially ended Saturday in Carson. As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl.\n\n“I didn’t touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.”\n\nShe went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. With the national team she went to three Olympics, won World Cups and played a key role in the landmark lawsuit against U.S. Soccer that ended with the women earning equal pay with the men’s team.\n\nIt’s a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players.\n\n“I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. “She made a name for herself a little later. You never know when your opportunity will be. So make the most of it when it comes.”\n\nU.S. coach Emma Hayes never had a chance to work directly with Press, though she wanted to bring her overseas to Chelsea FC when Hayes managed there and Press was looking to move to the Women’s Super League.\n\n“I’ve always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. “What she’s achieved, as well-traveled as she is, what an honor to be coaching on the day she gets celebrated in her hometown.”\n\nFor Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of life to the next. And, she acknowledged, there are a few things she’s going to miss.\n\n“I am so sad that I don't play soccer anymore,” she said. “I miss training. I miss being on a team, being around young people. I miss being outside every day. I miss the grass. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.\"\n\n“I like to talk about all the things that I miss, because I think ‘I'm retired. It's easy now.’ No. I had the best job in the world. And it's an irreplaceable job.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Teenager Blades Brown shot a strong 68 on Saturday at PGA West to get the chance to battle World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and AmEx champion Si Woo Kim on Sunday for title",
    "fullText": "Have you ever fathomed Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy or Scottie Scheffler playing rock-paper-scissors with a fan at the ropes in the heat of competition? Of course not. Tiger loathed even eye contact, and Rory and Scottie offer fist bumps occasionally, but most of the great players covet trying to stay in some kind of zone.\n\nThen again, none of them had quite the youthful verve of Blades Brown, nor did they have a chance to embrace the moment while being 18 years old and contending into Sunday of a $9.2 million PGA Tour event.\n\nIn the midst of birdieing his final three holes—the last two coming at a combined 72 feet— to finish a round of four-under-par 68 in the third round of The American Express, Brown strode down to the island 17th green at the PGA West Stadium Course. When a boy not much younger than him approached the rope line and gestured to play Rock-Paper-Scissors, Brown took the bait—and kept with it as they walked through five rounds, before Blades won with a “rock.”\n\nOf course he won. That’s the kind of surreal week the recent high school graduate from Nashville is having in California’s Coachella Valley. In only his 10th PGA Tour start after making his debut here a year ago, Brown backed up his course-record 60 on the Nicklaus Course on Friday with strong round in gusty conditions on the hardest course in the three-venue rotation, and he’ll return at the Stadium on Sunday morning to compete in the final threesome with Scheffler, the World No. 1 who is gunning for his 20th career victory, and past AmEx champion Si Woo Kim.\n\nKim leads at 22 under after shooting 66 on Saturday at La Quinta Country Club, while Brown and Scheffler (68) are a shot back after Scheffler needed to make a long par putt on the 18th to reach the anchor group.\n\nAt stake for Brown is his opportunity to become the second-youngest player with an official win on the PGA Tour, while no one ever has pulled off what he could—lifting a trophy after playing eight consecutive days across two tours. Brown flew to Palm Springs on Wednesday after the final round of the Korn Ferry Tour’s event in the Bahamas, where he tied for 17th.\n\n“I’m having fun out there,” Brown said. “I’m 18 years old playing on the PGA Tour. How awesome is that? I finished high school about two weeks ago, so it’s nice to have that burden off my back. But I’m really looking forward to tomorrow.”\n\nIf Brown, who is ranked 485th in the world, is feeling any nerves, he certainly isn’t showing it. He definitely had to practice patience on Pete Dye’s challenging Stadium layout—there wasn’t going to be an eight-under start through seven holes like on Friday on the Nicklaus Course. Brown birdied Nos. 5 and 6 but bogeyed 7 and then parred eight straight holes.\n\nA chip to close range gave him a birdie at the par-5 16th, and then Brown’s putter caught fire. After nearly hitting his tee shot too long into the water at the “Aclatraz” green at 17 and engaging with that kid at the ropes, he rolled in a 25-foot birdie. At 18, Brown piped a 268-yard tee shot into the middle of the fairway and hit his approach to 43 feet. Again, he put a calm and perfect stroke on his ball for birdie. In the round, Brown made 128 feet of putts.\n\n“Hooped two putts coming in, and that was cool,” Brown said with a smile.\n\nWhat makes Brown’s performance this week particularly surprising is that after turning pro at 17 years old in late 2024, he has not been a consistent contender in tournaments. He played 14 times on the KFT last season and had two top-10s—though one of those was a T-2 in April’s Veritex Championship, where he tied for second after opening with a 61.\n\nHe made his PGA Tour debut as a pro in The AmEx last year and missed the cut. There would be four more missed weekends over another seven starts, with a pair of T-34s as Brown’s best results.\n\nAt this point, Brown is still trying to build on all of his experiences.\n\n“I think if I can take every single competitive professional tournament round and learn something from it; you just keep stacking those day after day it's going to be a really cool story,” Brown said. “So that's one thing that I tried to do is I try to learn from every round. And yeah, last year was a little unfortunate, but I learned from it. I think that's what you have to do.”\n\nScheffler, 29. has his own strong motivations to win his first AmEx. If he can snatch his 20th victory, the Texan will be the second-youngest to reach the milestone and in the second-fastest time at 151 starts. Woods tops both categories.\n\nScheffler seemingly could have the lead going into Sunday, given how how many scoring opportnities he gave hiimsel on the Stadium. But down the final stretch alone, he missed a 13-foot birdie putt at 15, an 18-foot eagle attempt at 16 and a 22-footer for birdie at 17.\n\nScheffler was ultimately fortunate to get into Sunday's final group after he missed the green from the middle of the fairway. His difficult sidehill chip motored 25 feet past the hole, but Scheffler drained the putt for par.\n\nIn his post-round interview, Kim asked with interest if he was playing with Scheffler on Sunday, and at the time it was uncertain as Scheffler finished up. It was clear that Kim, a four-time PGA Touur winner who is ranked 42nd in the world, was eager to get that draw.\n\n\"Hopefully playing with Scottie, and we can have some fun,\" Kim said. \"Just not thinking about trying to win or trying to finish, just enjoy the round. That's my goal.\"\n\nKim, 30, became the youngest winner of the Players Championship when he won in 2017, and it would take him another four years for the next victory—a one-shot triumph over Patrick Cantlay in The AmEx. Kim's last win came in the 2023 Sony Open in Hawaii.",

    "fullText": "How good is Charles Bediako? Get to know controversial Alabama player returning to Tide after playing in NBA G League originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe world of college basketball is changing. Through loopholes, players who have gone on to play professional basketball — though not in the NBA — have found ways to return to college and tap into unused eligibility.\n\nOne such player is Alabama’s Charles Bediako. If you recognize the name, it may be because the 7-foot center spent two seasons with the Crimson Tide from 2021 to 2023. After the conclusion of the 2022–23 season, he declared for the NBA Draft.\n\nBediako wasn't selected but has played in three seasons of the G League, with three different teams. He has now cited that he made a career mistake by leaving college, especially given how the NIL landscape has shifted. Bediako pointed toward international players who never made the NBA, being able to use their unused eligibility after playing overseas, and a temporary injunction was submitted, giving him permission to suit up once again for the Crimson Tide on Saturday, January 24.\n\nHere is more on the controversial Bediako, and his return to Alabama after leaving the Crimson Tide for the G League.\n\nSN's NCAAB HQ: Scores | Schedule | Standings | Latest Polls\n\nBediako is a 7-ft. center. He is a solid player, but his college stats from his first stint at Alabama suggest that he is fine, not great. From 2021 to 2023 he averaged 6.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 19.3 minutes per game in 70 games. The Crimson Tide may use him more now if he has developed from his time in the G League, but it isn't like Alabama is getting back a former No. 1 overall pick.\n\nCharles Bediako takes the floor for warmups to a warm welcome from the student section pic.twitter.com/zhrE1DI3ZH\n\n— Katie Windham (@katiewindham_) January 24, 2026\n\nBediako played 46 games in the G League between 2023 and 2025. In that span, he averaged 21.3 minutes per game with 8.4 points and 8.0 rebounds. Bediako played better in the G League than he did at Alabama during his first stint, but it remains to be seen how his game will translate back to college.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game G League stats.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game college stats from his first stint with the Crimson Tide.\n\nNo. Bediako was not drafted. He opted to leave Alabama after the 2022-2023 season, but he went undrafted. Bediako signed with the San Antonio Spurs' G League team.\n\nMORE: Why is Bediako allowed to return to college basketball?\n\nIn the 2021 class, 247Sports had Bediako ranked as the No. 35 player in the nation. He was considered the sixth-best center as well as the seventh-best player from Florida.\n\nAmong centers, he was ranked behind Chet Holmgren, Jalen Duren, Efton Reid, Nate Bittle and Enoch Boakye. In Florida, he was ranked behind Duren, Caleb Houstan, Moussa Diabate, Reid, Bittle, Tamar Bates and Benny Williams.\n\nBediako was born in Ontario, Canada, on March 10, 2002. As college — and potentially professional — basketball became an option, he began to move around.\n\nHe started his high school career at Ridley College in Ontario before transferring to Andrews Osborne Academy in Willoughby, Ohio. Bediako later transferred again, spending the remainder of his high school career at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nBediako was born on March 10, 2002. He is 23 years old, and will turn 24 years old ahead of the 2026 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the slim win over the Washington Wizards, the Charlotte Hornets have now won four of their last six games and only find themselves ten games below .500 at 18-28.\n\nTwo of those wins came against some of the best teams in the NBA, including the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Lakers, on the road as they finally attempt to change the organization's long-term landscape.\n\nThe young talent with star potential that Charlotte possesses is what makes them stand out as a team that could become a solid team in the future, especially with players such as LaMelo Ball, Kon Knueppel, Brandon Miller, etc.\n\nMore: These stats prove why the Charlotte Hornets' success is likely to continue\n\nIn fact. Miller has been a massive reason for the Hornets' recent success, scoring at least 20 points in the last six games and averaging 23.7 points per game with a 65.3 true shooting percentage.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Miller began to take those next steps in his career and prove why the Hornets selected him with their second overall draft pick in 2023. After averaging 21 points last season, Miller is already at 20 points this season, with about two full months of the season remaining.\n\nOn Saturday, Miller nearly recorded a triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists while missing only four shots, and that speaks to the progression Miller has made not only individually but also in his impact on winning and getting his teammates involved.\n\nThe Hornets are 15-14 when Miller is on the court, but only 3-14 when he isn't, and that in itself should serve as the primary indication of just how valuable the young star is to the hive.\n\nWarriors, Bucks among teams interested in Hornets' Miles Bridges\n\nBrandon Miller admits how the Hornets can bridge the gap against the better teams\n\nESPN analyst's top ranked rookie may surprise you\n\nLaMelo Ball gets coach's plaudits for his performances beyond the offensive play\n\nHornets have engaged in trade talks surrounding Karl-Anthony Towns",

    "title": "MLB Insider Predicts Outcome for Tarik Skubal Arbitration Case With Detroit Tigers",
    "description": "ESPN’s Jeff Passan explains why Tarik Skubal could win a record $32 million in arbitration over the Tigers’ $19M offer, citing Cy Young history and elite performance.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers and Tarik Skubal are staring at a number that has never existed in an arbitration hearing before.\n\nSkubal’s side filed at $32 million for the 2026 season. The Tigers countered at $19 million. That $13 million spread is not just large, it’s unprecedented. No arbitration case in MLB history has featured anything close to that kind of gap, and no player has ever been awarded a salary anywhere near $32 million through the process.\n\nYet, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan, history may be about to bend.\n\nPassan’s argument centers on one simple truth: Skubal isn’t just elite, he’s in rare, historic territory.\n\n“Even if the comparables are in Detroit’s favor, even if a $32 million award would smash the previous high awarded in a room by more than $12 million, Skubal is the first American Leaguer to win consecutive Cy Young Awards since Pedro Martinez in 1999-2000.”\n\nThat kind of resume changes how cases are viewed. Passan continued:\n\n“And in a world where lesser pitchers get $30 million-plus a season and Skubal can compare his salary to any in MLB, his performance, the best pitcher in baseball — will be enough to carry the day.”\n\nIn other words, precedent matters, but dominance matters more. Skubal’s back-to-back Cy Youngs place him in a category that very few pitchers in modern history have ever occupied.\n\nEven with logic, numbers, and awards on his side, Passan made it clear that nothing is guaranteed in the arbitration room.\n\n“Arbitration hearing rooms are notorious for their unpredictability,” Passan wrote. “Lawyers who have argued cases have left the room convinced they’d made airtight arguments — and lost. Others were despondent in the aftermath, certain of defeat, and emerged victorious.”\n\n“Which is to say that whatever approach Tarik Skubal’s team takes in trying to convince a three-person panel that he’s worthy of the $32 million he’s seeking instead of the $19 million the Detroit Tigers are offering, the ultimate result is a crapshoot.”\n\nThat uncertainty is what makes this case so fascinating — and potentially historic.\n\nBeyond the legal drama, this standoff sends a message. Skubal is the face of the franchise, the best pitcher in baseball, and the foundation of Detroit’s contention window. Filing at $19 million while he seeks $32 million creates a tension that goes far beyond one season’s paycheck.\n\nWhether the panel sides with Skubal or the Tigers, the outcome will ripple into future extension talks, trade rumors, and how the organization is viewed by its own superstar.\n\nOne way or another, Skubal will take the mound in 2026 as a Cy Young winner. The only question is whether he’ll do it as the most highly paid arbitration player in MLB history.\n\nThe post MLB Insider Predicts Outcome for Tarik Skubal Arbitration Case With Detroit Tigers appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "The University of Utah was a sizable underdog going into its second matchup of the season against rival BYU on Saturday at the Marriott Center, but the Runnin’ Utes made the Cougars work for the win.\n\nFor 25 minutes, Utah bucked those odds and kept things close with BYU — until a decisive second-half run was enough to give the No. 13 Cougars some breathing room in an eventual 91-78 win.\n\nThat makes it five straight losses for the Utes in Provo, with their last win in the series at the Marriott Center coming in 2014.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the loss that dropped Utah to 9-11 overall and 1-5 in Big 12 play.\n\nUtes coach Alex Jensen talks a lot about avoiding 2-3 minute lulls, something that consistently plagues Utah as it goes through a transition year.\n\nOutside of their win over TCU when Jensen said the team didn’t have many peaks and valleys, the Utes are prone to stretches of high and low play.\n\nIn the case of the rivalry game, the most critical lull came in the second half after Utah had climbed to within 55-53.\n\nThe Utes went over three minutes before their next bucket and fell behind eight before Keanu Dawes hit a 3.\n\nFrom there, BYU further extended its lead out to a game-high 13, at 69-56, as part of a 14-3 run over a five and a half-minute stretch.\n\nOne of the reasons Utah was able to stick around for so long Saturday was its ability to connect from 3-point range.\n\nThe Utes made 5 of 11 from 3 in the first half, then hit their first five in the second half.\n\nFor the game, Utah hit 13 of 21 3-pointers and 8 of 10 in the second half.\n\nDawes, who led the Utes with 23 points, made four of those 3-pointers, while Terrence Brown had 22 points and four 3-pointers of his own.\n\nThe Utes “held” BYU’s freshman sensation, AJ Dybantsa, to 23 points in the first game between these two schools two weeks ago.\n\nThis time, though, Dybantsa had a career game.\n\nHe finished with a career-high 43 points, shooting 15 of 24 from the field.\n\nHis back-to-back 3-pointers, the second coming with 3:12 to play, sealed Dybantsa breaking the school freshman record for points in a game.\n\nBehind Dybantsa’s dominance, the Cougars outscored Utah 48-14 in the paint.",

    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "fullText": "The return of World Rally Championship cars tackling Monaco’s famous Grand Prix circuit has proved a hit with drivers who wish the initiative to become a more permanent fixture in the future.\n\nMonaco’s famous circuit echoed to the sound of WRC for the first time since 2008 as a shortened version of the Formula 1 track played host to a 2.65km super special stage for this year’s Monte Carlo Rally.\n\nThe event has previously held a stage utilising the grand prix circuit in the 2007 and 2008 editions of the rally. Subaru’s Chris Atkinson and Ford’s François Duval famously clocked identical fastest times when the Monaco circuit last featured as part of a stage in 2008.\n\nThis year’s edition witnessed crowds flocking to the circuit despite inclement weather to watch the WRC’s elite complete a stage constructed using the start/finish straight and harbour area of the circuit.\n\nRacing Bulls Formula 1 driver Liam Lawson was in attendance, with the Kiwi afforded several runs of the stage driving a Ford Puma Rally1 car before the stage was live. Hyundai’s Adrien Fourmaux won the stage by 0.7s from Toyota’s Takamoto Katsuta.\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg survives with healthy lead intact\n\nThe WRC hosting super special stages in city centres bringing the rally to the fans is nothing new, but holding such a stage in such an iconic venue such as the Monaco Grand Prix circuit is an initiative that many in the severe park feels is important to grow the category.\n\nThe promotion of the WRC has been a hot topic in recent years, with the subject thrust back into the spotlight as the championship welcomes a new commercial rights holder and owner. From a manufacturer’s perspective, the exposure is crucial.\n\n“This is what we need to have in the WRC. Even though the weather is like this, it is full of people and there is a great atmosphere, and this kind of thing we need to have. Bringing it to the people,\" said Toyota team principal Jari-Matti Latvala.\n\nHyundai’s Thierry Neuville echoed Latvala’s sentiment and is hopeful the stage will return at future Monte Carlo WRC rounds.\n\n“It was cool and well done to the organisers and the organisation, and this is what rallying needs as well. The crowds are there, and the show was good despite the disastrous weather conditions. I think it is something they should do again,” Neuville told Motorsport.com.\n\n“I think we need to go to the crowds. This is something I enjoy when it is something nice like a historical circuit. It makes it even more special.”\n\nHis teammate Adrien Fourmaux added: “It was quite cool to drive on the circuit and I think it is a really good initiative to drive in Monaco because I feel for a few years now the fans in Monaco are not following the rally so much because they just have the start and the finish here. Now we can give them a show, the car the noise and the atmosphere.\n\n“I think we should do the whole track — one lap,\" he smiled.\n\nSuper special stages are usually not among drivers favourites when it comes to WRC events, but M-Sport-Ford’s Josh McErlean went as far as saying that the Monaco stage was “massive for the sport.”\n\n“It is quite bananas to think where you are at and what you are doing. The stage was obviously quite difficult for us on slick tyres and the cobbles were extremely slippy,” said McErlean.\n\n“It is a nice way to end the day and for the sport it is massive. It is what it needs and hopefully more cities and towns can do things like this.”\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg survives with healthy lead intact\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg in control, as Elfyn Evans holds off Sebastien Ogier\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg moves clear of rivals after nine stages\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

UFC 324 is the first show of the Paramount+ era and the first numbered event that is not a PPV in the United States (you’ve still got to pony up extra for it in Canada, the U.K. and most other places).\n\nUFC 324’s main event is Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett for the interim Lightweight title. The interim 155-pound strap is in play since Ilia Topuria has gone on hiatus to deal with some issues in his personal life.\n\nMuch has been said about the worthiness of these two fighters for this title (like this), especially when Arman Tsarukyan is being left out in the cold. Gaethje is coming off a win over Rafael Fiziev back in March 2025. That was his first fight since his epic UFC 300 knockout loss to Max Holloway in 2024 (relive that here). Pimblett’s last fight was his drubbing of Michael Chandler. Pimblett is on a long win streak in UFC, but his last half-dozen opponents have all been on the wrong side of 35.\n\nThe co-main event was supposed to be Kayla Harrison vs. Amanda Nunes for Harrison’s Bantamweight title, a title Nunes had held for a record time. However, that fight was cancelled after it was revealed that Harrison was requiring neck surgery (details here). That fight has now been shelved, possibly indefinitely.\n\nSean O’Malley vs. Song Yadong has been promoted to the co-main slot. Those two will be hoping to get another fight with Petr Yan, this time with a title on the line.\n\nRounding out the main card is Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis, Arnold Allen vs. Jean Silva and Natalia Silva vs. Rose Namajunas.\n\nUFC 324’s “Prelims” have some interesting match-ups, including super prospect Ateba Gautier taking on Andrey Pulyaev, among others.\n\nWell, this is easy — so long as you are in the United States.\n\nYou can watch all of UFC 324 with Paramount+. The Early Prelims start at 5:30 p.m. ET. The Late Prelims start at 7 p.m. ET. and the Main Card kicks off at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nI will be providing live play-by-play, instant results, highlights and updates for all the fights right here starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.\n\nSee you then!

He then stung Bukauskas with a little counter shot. From then on, Bukauskas withdrew into his shell and fought with very little confidence. The opposite was true of Krylov. With his confidence boosted, he let his hands go and was able to get the third buzzer beating finish of the night.\n\n\"This is the night of the buzzer beaters.\" – @joerogan @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/7Mb7lcGYfQ\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nAlex Perez vs. Charles Johnson: Johnson looked quick and clean early on, but maybe he was too casual. Perez caught him with a massive left hook and dropped him. Johnson was in survival mode from that moment on. Perez stayed patient and followed up with knees and another big hook to finally bring about the TKO. That’s a massive win for Perez, but also a very big stumble for Johnson.\n\nALEX PEREZ JUST KEPT COMING\n\n📺 @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/pxTZratdzH\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nJosh Hokit vs. Denzel Freeman: Hokit’s levels of athleticism and activity are very rare quantities in Heavyweight MMA. He had all that on display while whooping on Freeman, the best opponent he’s ever faced. He out wrestled him and lit him up on the feet to earn his second first round finish in a row (albeit in strange fashion with referee Mark Smith calling an end to it after he saw Freeman was exhausted and struggling to stay on his feet). Hokit also took the opportunity to taunt Freeman multiple times during the fight.\n\nJosh Hokit stops Denzel Freeman pic.twitter.com/ISC7ircCrO\n\n— MMA Mania (@mmamania) January 24, 2026\n\nAdam Fugitt vs. Ty Miller: This was a competitive striking affair for much of the round until Miller found a way through with some big shots.

    "fullText": "I recently launched Trivet, and I've enjoyed seeing people install it on websites ranging from personal homepages to business blogs.\n\nBefore AI, Trivet would have taken me a few weeks to build. Now, Codex wrote the first version in 40 minutes.\n\nIn the past, building software was so difficult that launching something was impressive in and of itself. But as things get easier to build, it's harder to stand out. Code has become content - abundant, disposable, something you produce rather than labor over. We've transitioned from \"make something people want\" to \"make anything you want\".\n\nFor example, I'll open-source the theme powering this site. A few years ago, this would have represented a lot of work. There would have been utility for people making their own templates. Instead, today it's a footnote - a curiosity for those who want to \"view source\" on this website and see how it works.\n\nAs a maker, AI enables me to build more and faster than I ever could have dreamed. But projects are no longer the investment they used to be. I find myself with decision fatigue - I ask \"what should I build next?\" every few days, instead of every few months. In the age of AI, it's harder to think of a \"big project\" to work on slowly in my free time.\n\nWith code getting easier, I find myself thinking more about data. My old coworker Jason posted a video about using Claude Code to organize his notes. There's so much useful knowledge spread out across many sources. People know Claude for writing code, but its superpower is searching and understanding thousands of files.\n\nWhen I went to Japan last year, I wanted to ask \"what is every Tokyo coffee shop and jazz kissa mentioned on craigmod.com,\" but I couldn't. That desire led me to build Contraption MCP - so I could have a research agent over my writing. The first time I used it and got a real answer synthesized from years of posts, it felt like a new kind of utility - a digital proprioception enabling me to fluidly navigate and explore my writing.\n\nExploring information is still a hard problem in the age of AI. MCP is useful, but more of a technical protocol. \"RSS for AI,\" as Stan summarized to me.\n\nThe next project I'm contemplating is codenamed \"Bell\" — a search agent for this blog, built on top of the Contraption MCP. I want it to be more accessible than raw MCP: something you can use in a browser, drawing on a variety of sources. It could answer questions like \"which craft-focused books are mentioned on this blog,\" but also \"how does subscriber export work on Postcard.\" Part of the motivation for Bell is building software for myself. But, the other part is continuing to explore the future of digital tools through making projects.\n\nSo, what should I build next? Two things feel true: we should default to building for ourselves, and understanding our own data is where some hard problems now live.\n\nI think the widespread impulse to take a photo of everything is in fact, at root, a creative one. It reflects a desire to not just receive life passively, but to intervene in it creatively: To frame the shot, to find the most compelling angle, to draw out the emotion, to honor the light… to participate.\n\n- This life gives you nothing, Blackbird Spyplane",

    "description": "Organizations requiring IT workers to commute to an office need to ground decisions in value creation, focus on data-driven results, and avoid badge-swipe metrics, employment experts say.",
    "fullText": "Work-from-office mandates are accelerating as the world moves further away from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the push toward in-person work environments will make it more difficult for IT leaders to retain and recruit staff, some experts say.\n\nOver the past year, many companies, including IT giants Amazon and Microsoft, have required employees to work from the office, with many other organizations mandating on-site work in previous years.\n\nNearly half of all workers, and nearly two-thirds of IT professionals, were feeling pressure from their employers to work from the office as of early 2025, according to the 2025 Technology at Work Report, released by IT security firm Ivanti.\n\nAdvocates of in-person work expect increased productivity and improved collaboration as employees work from the office, although several studies have suggested that workers can be just as productive when working remotely, and employment experts say collaboration gains can be difficult to measure.\n\nThere is value in cross-functional teams working together in person, says Lawrence Wolfe, CTO at marketing firm Converge. “When teams meet for architecture sessions, design sprints, or incident response, the pace of progress, as well as the level of clarity, may increase simply because being in-person caters to the way most people in the business interact,” he says.\n\nHowever, there are potential downsides for IT leaders, with strict work-from-office policies making it more difficult to attract and retain top IT talent. “In addition to resistance, there would also be the risk of talent turnover,” Wolfe adds. “The truth is, both physical and virtual collaboration provide tremendous value.”\n\nIvanti’s survey suggests that IT workers are skeptical of return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Eighty-three percent of IT workers surveyed say flexible work arrangements are either “high value” or “essential,” compared to 73% of office workers.\n\nMeanwhile, IT workers facing work-from-office mandates are two to three times more likely than their counterparts to look for new jobs, according to Metaintro, a search engine that tracks millions of jobs.\n\nIT leaders hiring new employees may also face significant headwinds, with it taking 40% to 50% longer to fill in-person roles than remote jobs, according to Metaintro.\n\n“Some of the challenges CIOs face include losing top-tier talent, limiting the pool of candidates available for hire, and damaging company culture, with a team filled with resentment,” says Lacey Kaelani, CEO and cofounder at Metaintro.\n\nDespite possible resistance, it makes sense for some IT jobs to be tied to an office, says Lena McDearmid, founder and CEO of culture and leadership advisory firm Wryver. Some IT roles, including device provisioning, network operations, and conference room IT support, are better done in person, she notes.\n\nShe sees some other benefits in specific situations. “In-person work is genuinely valuable for onboarding and mentoring early-career technologists, especially when learning how the organization actually operates, not just how the codebase works,” McDearmid says. “It’s also powerful when teams need to think together in high-bandwidth ways: whiteboards, war rooms, architecture reviews, incident response, or when solving messy, cross-functional problems.”\n\nThere is weaker evidence that blanket in-office mandates improve day-to-day productivity across all IT roles, she adds.\n\n“Many technologists, especially engineers, data scientists, and architects doing deep, complex work, often perform better in controlled environments with fewer interruptions,” McDearmid says. “In those cases, presence alone doesn’t create value. Purpose does.”\n\nEffective collaboration can happen remotely when teams have clear norms, strong documentation, and psychological safety, she adds. “I’ve also seen teams sitting next to each other collaborate poorly because decisions are unclear or leaders equate visibility with progress,” she says. “Collaboration doesn’t automatically improve just because people share a building.”\n\nThere are several downsides for IT leaders to in-person work mandates, McDearmid adds, as orders to commute to an office can feel arbitrary or rooted in control rather than in value creation. “That erodes trust quickly, particularly in IT teams that proved they could deliver remotely for years,” she adds.\n\nThe mandates can also create new friction for IT leaders by requiring them to deal with morale issues, manage exceptions, and spend time enforcing policy instead of leading strategy, she says.\n\n“There’s also a real risk of losing experienced, high-performing talent who have options and are unwilling to trade autonomy for proximity without a clear reason,” McDearmid adds. “When companies mandate daily commutes without a clear rationale, they often narrow their talent pool and increase attrition, particularly among people who know they can work effectively elsewhere.”\n\nInstead of asking how they can get people to work from the office, successful CIOs focus on what types of work are better when employees are together and how to intentionally plan for those scenarios, McDearmid says.\n\n“When return-to-office is aligned to real value creation, teams usually understand it,” she adds. “When it isn’t, it shows up quickly in engagement and retention.”\n\nIT leaders facing commute-to-office mandates should focus on data that measures work outcomes, not badge swipes, adds Rebecca Wettemann, CEO at IT analyst firm Valoir. CIOs can help IT teams by enabling them to automate repetitive works so they can focus on measurable outputs, she adds.\n\nIT leaders enforcing in-person work mandates can also focus on making the workplace a real place to collaborate, she adds. CIOs can align office space, meeting schedules, and in-office days so they reinforce the goals of collaboration and knowledge sharing, Wettemann adds.\n\nCIOs should look for ways to remove friction from the workplace through automation, should allow for flexibility, and should communicate how work-from-office policies are data-driven, she says.\n\n“The real danger is when RTO is a corporate mandate that isn’t aligned with the realities of the workplace, or even worse, when it’s being used as a Band-Aid for poor management,” Wettemann says. “When IT professionals feel they’re being evaluated based on badge swipes, not real accomplishments, they will either act accordingly or look to work elsewhere.”",

    "title": "The iOS 26 Adoption Rate Is Not Bizarrely Low Compared to Previous Years",
    "description": "A change to how Safari reports the OS it is running on led many in the media to lose their minds.",
    "fullText": "A few weeks ago there were a rash of stories claiming that iOS 26 is seeing bizarrely low adoption rates from iPhone users. The methodology behind these numbers is broken and the numbers are totally wrong. Those false numbers are so low, so jarringly different from previous years, that it boggles my mind that they didn’t raise a red flag for anyone who took a moment to consider them.\n\nThe ball started rolling with this post from Ed Hardy at Cult of Mac on January 8, “iOS 26 Still Struggles to Gain Traction With iPhone Users”, which began:\n\nOnly a tiny percentage of iPhone users have installed iOS 26,\naccording to data from a web analytics service. The adoption rate\nis far less than previous iOS versions at this same point months\nafter their releases. The data only reveals how few iPhone users\nrun Apple’s latest operating system upgrade, not why they’ve\nchosen to avoid it. But the most likely candidate is the new\nLiquid Glass look of the update. [...]\n\nRoughly four months after launching in mid-September, only about\n15% of iPhone users have some version of the new operating system\ninstalled. That’s according to data for January 2026 from\nStatCounter. Instead, most users hold onto previous versions.\n\nFor comparison, in January 2025, about 63% of iPhone users had\nsome iOS 18 version installed. So after roughly the same\namount of time, the adoption rate of Apple newest OS was about\nfour times higher.\n\nThose links point to Statcounter, a web analytics service. A lot of websites include Statcounter’s analytics tracker, and Statcounter’s tracker attempts to determine the version of the OS each visitor’s device is running. The problem is, starting with Safari 26 — the version that ships with iOS 26 — Safari changed how it reports its user agent string. From the WebKit blog, “WebKit Features in Safari 26.0”:\n\nAlso, now in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS 26 the user agent\nstring no longer lists the current version of the operating\nsystem. Safari 18.6 on iOS has a UA string of:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6 like Mac OS X)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.6\nMobile/15E148 Safari/604.1\n\nAnd Safari 26.0 on iOS has a UA string of:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6 like Mac OS X)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.0\nMobile/15E148 Safari/604.1\n\nThis matches the long-standing behavior on macOS, where the user\nagent string for Safari 26.0 is:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.0\nSafari/605.1.15\n\nIt was back in 2017 when Safari on Mac first started freezing the\nMac OS string. Now the behavior on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS does\nthe same in order to minimize compatibility issues. The WebKit and\nSafari version number portions of the string will continue to\nchange with each release.\n\nIn other words, Safari now reports, in its user agent string, that it’s running on iOS 18.6 when it is running on iOS 18.6, and reports that it’s running on iOS 18.6 when it’s running on iOS 26.0 or later. And it’s going to keep reporting that it’s running on iOS 18.6 forever, just like how Safari 26 on MacOS reports that it’s running on MacOS 10.15 Catalina, from 2019.\n\nStatcounter completely dropped the ball on this change, and it explains the entirety of this false narrative that iOS 26 adoption is incredibly low. (Statcounter has a “detect” page where you can see what browser and OS it thinks you’re using.) The reason they reported that 15 percent of iPhone users were using iOS 26 is probably because that’s the amount of web traffic Statcounter sees from iOS 26 web browsers that aren’t Safari (most of which, I’ll bet, are in-app browser views in social media apps).\n\nNick Heer, at Pixel Envy, wrote a good piece delving into this saga. And then he posted a follow-up item pointing out that (a) Statcounter’s CEO has acknowledged their error and they’re fixing it; and (b) Wikimedia publishes network-wide stats that serve as a good baseline. The audience for Wikipedia is, effectively, the audience for the web itself. And Wikipedia’s stats show that while iOS 26 adoption, in January 2026, isn’t absurdly low (as Statcounter had been suggesting, erroneously, and writers like Ed Hardy at Cult of Mac and David Price at Macworld foolishly regurgitated, no matter how little sense it made that the numbers would be that low), they are in fact lower than those for iOS 18 a year ago and iOS 17 two years ago. Per Wikimedia:\n\nSo, no, iOS 26 adoption isn’t at just 15 percent, which only a dope would believe, but it’s not as high as previous iOS versions in previous years at this point on the calendar. Something, obviously, is going on.\n\nDavid Smith, developer of popular apps like Widgetsmith and Pedometer++, on Mastodon:\n\nI noticed iOS 26 adoption had entered a ‘third wave’ of rapid\nadoption. So I made a graph of the relative adoption versus iOS 18\nat this point in the release cycle.\n\nWhile lower than iOS 18 at this point for my apps (65% vs. 78%),\nthe shape of this graph says to me that Apple is in full control\nof the adoption rate and can tune it to their plans. The\ncoordinated surges are Apple dialing up automatic updates.\n\nIf this surge were as long as previous ones, we’d hit the\nsaturation point very soon.\n\nWhat’s going on, quite obviously, is that Apple itself is slow-rolling the automatic updates to iOS 26. For years now Apple has steered users, via default suggestions during device setup, to adopt settings to allow OS updates to happen automatically, including updates to major new versions. Apple tends not to push these automatic updates to major new versions of iOS until two months after the .0 release in September. This year that second wave was delayed by about two weeks, and there’s now a third wave starting midway through January. It’s a different pattern from previous years — but it’s a pattern Apple controls. A large majority of users of all Apple devices get major OS updates when, and only when, their devices automatically update. Apple has been slower to push those updates to iOS 26 than they have been for previous iOS updates in recent years. With good reason! iOS 26 is a more significant — and buggier — update than iOS 18 and 17 were.\n\nPeople like you, readers of Daring Fireball, may well be hesitant to update to iOS 26, or (like me) to MacOS 26, or to any of the version 26 OS updates, because you are aware of things (like UI changes) that you are loathe to adopt.\n\nBut the overwhelming majority of Apple users — especially iPhone users — just let their devices update automatically. They might like iOS 26’s changes, they might dislike them, or they might not care or even notice. But they just let their software updates happen automatically — and they will form the entirety of their opinions regarding iOS 26 after it’s running on their iPhones.",

We are now in 2026, and the situation has reached a tipping point.\n\nDaniel has submitted a pull request on GitHub that removes all mentions of the bug bounty program from cURL's documentation and website. Coinciding with that, the project's security.txt file has been updated with some blunt language that makes the new policy crystal clear.\n\nThe cURL team intends to make a proper announcement in the coming days, though many outlets have already covered the news of this happening, so I would say they ought to get on it ASAP! 😆\n\nThe program officially ends in a few days on January 31, 2026. After that, security researchers can still report issues through GitHub or the project's mailing list, but there won't be any cash involved.\n\nWhat pushed them over the edge?, you ask. Well, just weeks into 2026, seven HackerOne reports came in within a 16-hour period in just one week. Some were actual bugs, but none of them were security vulnerabilities. By the time Daniel posted his recent weekly report, they'd already dealt with 20 submissions in 2026.\n\nThe main goal here is said to be stopping the flood of garbage reports. By eliminating the money incentive, they are hoping people (or bots?) will stop wasting the security team's time with half-baked, unresearched submissions.\n\nHe also gives a stern warning to wannabe AI sloppers, saying that:\n\nSo, yeah, that's that. If people still don't understand that AI slop is harmful to such sensitive pieces of software, then sure, they can go ahead and make a fool of themselves.\n\nSuggested Read 📖: Open Source Project LLVM Says Yes to AI-Generated Code",

    "title": "Cow Clicker",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Cow Clicker is an incremental social network game on Facebook developed by video game researcher Ian Bogost. The game serves as a deconstructive satire of social games. The goal of the game is to earn \"clicks\" by clicking on a sprite of a cow every six hours. The addition of friends' cows to the player's pasture allows the user to also receive \"clicks\" whenever the player's cow is clicked. A premium currency known as \"Mooney\" allows the user to purchase different cow designs and skip the six-hour interval between clicks.\n\nIn the wake of a controversial speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.\n\nSome critics praised Cow Clicker for its dissection of the common mechanics of social network games and viewed it as a commentary on how social games affect people.\n\nThe player is initially given a pasture with nine slots and a single plain cow, which the player may click once every six hours. Each time the cow is clicked, a point also known as a \"click\" is awarded; if the player adds friends' cows to their pasture, they also receive clicks added to their scores when the player clicks their own cow. As in other Facebook games, players are encouraged to post announcements to their news feed whenever they click their cow. A virtual currency known as \"Mooney\" can be bought with Facebook Credits; it can be used to purchase special \"premium\" cow designs, and the ability to skip the six-hour time limit that must be waited before the cow can be clicked again.[1][2]\n\nAt the 2010 Game Developers Conference, Zynga's game FarmVille was awarded the \"Best New Social/Online Game\" at its Game Developers Choice Awards. Ian Bogost (who was also in attendance) was critical of Zynga's success, as he felt that its business model was focused on convincing users to pay money to progress further in their \"freemium\" games rather than treating gaming as an artistic experience. He also believed Zynga's vice president Bill Mooney was trying to attack \"artistic\" gaming during his acceptance speech for the award when he personally invited independent game developers to join his company.[3] After the conference, Bogost coined the term \"cow clickers\" to describe games such as FarmVille which only involve performing tasks at certain intervals, since in these games, \"you click on a cow, and that’s all you do.\" Bogost compared the players of Zynga's games to the rats in B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning experiment, often receiving variable reinforcement rather than regular rewards. As one of the most vocal critics of Zynga's practices and business model, Bogost made further appearances at various events and panels to discuss his views on social gaming.[3]\n\nIn July 2010, Bogost was scheduled to make an appearance at a New York University seminar, \"Social Games On Trial\", to discuss the controversial aspects of social network gaming. To clearly demonstrate what he felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of these games, Bogost quickly developed a Facebook game entitled Cow Clicker. The game was designed to be a satire of what Bogost personally believed were the only points of FarmVille: to encourage users to continue playing by inviting other users into the game, and to provide incentives for those who purchase virtual goods.[3] The bulk of the code was written in three days.[4]\n\nUnexpectedly to Bogost, Cow Clicker became a viral phenomenon, amassing over 50,000 players by September 2010. In response to its sudden popularity, he committed to improving the game with new features. Updates to the game added awards for reaching certain milestones (such as the Golden Cowbell for 100,000 clicks), the ability to earn Mooney by clicking on other users' Cow Clicker news feed posts, and the chance to randomly gain or lose Mooney on every click. New cow designs were also introduced, such as an oil-coated cow to commemorate the BP oil spill, and the \"Stargrazer Cow\", which was only a mirror image of the original cow that cost around $20's worth of Mooney.[3][5]\n\nAlthough continually disturbed by its popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming and social networking trends; such as the addition of an API to allow websites to have their own clickable cows (in a process he dubbed \"Cowclickification\"), the spin-off game Cow Clicker Blitz (co-developed with PopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka), \"My First Cow Clicker\" for iOS (a parody of simplistic education apps; designed to \"train\" children on cow clicking and add the resulting clicks to their parent's total), and a \"Cow Clicktivism\" campaign where users could click on an emaciated cow to donate to Oxfam America—with a goal of donating an actual cow to a third world country. The cow, known as the \"Cowclicktivist Cow\", could also be unlocked for the player's pasture with a $110 donation.[1][3][5]\n\nIn 2011, an alternate reality game known as the \"Cow ClickARG\" was held, where a series of clues from the \"bovine gods\" eventually revealed that a \"Cowpocalypse\" would occur on July 21, 2011 (exactly one year since the original release of the game). From then on, every click made by players would deduct thirty seconds from a countdown clock leading to the Cowpocalypse. However, players could extend the countdown clock by paying to supplicate with Facebook Credits: paying 10 credits would extend the countdown by a single hour, while 4,000 would extend the countdown by an entire month.[6] After $700 worth of extensions, the countdown clock expired on the evening of September 7, 2011. At this point, the game remained playable, but all the cows were replaced by blank spaces and said to have been raptured. Bogost intended the Cowpocalypse event to signal the \"end\" of the game to players; when addressing a complaint by a fan who felt the game was no longer fun after the cow rapture, Bogost responded that \"it wasn't very fun before.\"[3][5][7]\n\nIn 2018, Bogost wrote an article for The Atlantic discussing the collection of data by Facebook apps, with reference to Cow Clicker, following a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data. Bogost notes that Facebook apps appear to be part of the website itself, whereas they actually operate with almost no oversight. He claims that \"without even trying\", Cow Clicker stored its users' Facebook ID and any networks (such as workplaces) that the user was a part of, and that this information is still stored on his private server. Bogost notes that he could have used this data for malicious purposes, criticising Facebook's \"move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development\".[4]\n\nCow Clicker received critical attention soon after its release. One early commentator was Alexia Tsotsis of TechCrunch, who acknowledged the game's intent as a commentary on the impact of social network games. In an interview, Bogost foresaw the transformation of the internet into a \"compulsive virtual dystopia\" through Zynga's use of social gaming.[2][3]\n\nNick Yee of the Palo Alto Research Center compared the players of games which do not provide \"meaningful opportunities for achievement, social interaction, and challenge\" to rats in a Skinner box. Accordingly, he compared Cow Clicker to being inside an \"incredibly clear Skinner box\"—acknowledging how little effort the game took in order to keep users playing the game. Jason Tanz of Wired considered Cow Clicker as an example of the growth in the trend of gamification—where developers introduce elements influenced by games into their services without providing the normal \"experience\" a game traditionally incorporates.[3]\n\nPopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka praised Cow Clicker for being the type of \"ironic, satirical, self-referential\" game that Facebook's game ecosystem was lacking, as he felt there were too many commercially driven games on the social network. Playdom's Scott Jon Siegel criticized the game for not going far enough in its satire, and putting too many highlights on the \"absurd monetisation practices and meaningless clicking which social games are all too well known for.\"[1]\n\nThe game Cookie Clicker was developed by Julien Thiennot in 2013. Bogost describes as it as Cow Clicker's \"logical conclusion\".[8]",

Meanwhile, on Polymarket, traders have bet about $210,000 on how much snow New York City will see this weekend. The winning category is now 8 to 10 inches.\n\nThe storm is expected to bring heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain to multiple states in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Northeast this weekend. The National Weather Service says the storm could impact some 180 million Americans. Thousands of flights have already been canceled.\n\nPrediction markets allow users to buy and sell shares in the outcomes of future events, such as sports or elections. Polymarket also provides real-time updates, allowing bets to provide insights into how consumers and investors think.\n\nPolymarket bettors correctly predicted nearly the entire slate of Golden Globe winners last week, prompting a celebration from Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan.\n\n\"We have a long way to go to educate the public on the value of market-based forecasts, but you can't deny its accuracy,\" Coplan wrote. \"People have more clarity about the world because Polymarket exists.\"\n\nThe new markets are not strictly regulated, and some bets have looked a lot like insider trading. A last-minute bet on Polymarket earlier this month that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro would be ousted netted strong returns after the US captured Maduro in a surprise raid hours later.\n\nSnowfall totals, on the other hand, are perhaps less susceptible to market manipulation.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Cunningham-South Cons: Smith\n\nTries: Hamer-Webb, Van Poortvliet, Steward, Blamire, Perese Cons: Searle 3 Pens: Searle\n\nJack van Poortvliet delivered a timely reminder to England coach Steve Borthwick as he finalises Six Nations plans with a stunning solo try as Leicester Tigers cruised past struggling Harlequins.\n\nThe Tigers scrum-half produced a moment of quality at The Stoop in a match that the visitors dominated from start to finish, his solo effort in the first half the pick of the visitors' five tries.\n\nGabriel Hamer-Webb, Freddie Steward, Jamie Blamire and Izaia Perese scored the others as the visitors ran roughshod over a Quins outfit with a bonus point win to move into fourth place in the Prem table.\n\nChandler Cunningham-South ensured that the home side did not suffer a second shutout of the season with a late try to save blushes, but it was nowhere near enough to avoid a fifth straight defeat in the Prem for Jason Gilmore's struggling outfit.\n\nUncapped Sela called up for England Six Nations tilt\n\nBears edge past Chiefs in rainstorm to go third\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nVan Poortvliet was one of the brighter lights in a dominant display and he will be hoping a slight niggle which saw him limp from the field halfway through the second half does not continue his bad luck with England.\n\nThe 24-year-old scored the try which won the series against Argentina last summer only for his chances of a place in Borthwick's autumn squad to be spoiled by a shoulder injury.\n\nHe also missed out on the 2023 World Cup after hurting his ankle in a warm-up game against Wales the month before the tournament.\n\nBorthwick may well be keeping his fingers crossed, too, after a confident display included an early assist with a long pass to Hamer-Webb, who went over unchallenged for a debut Tigers try.\n\nYet it was Van Portvliet's kick and collect after a neatly worked short line-out routine that proved a cut above.\n\nAfter gathering the ball and racing down the right flank he stepped off his right boot to jink inside what was left of the Quins defence before going over.\n\nTop-to-bottom Quins issues 'not a quick fix' - Care\n\nQuins look to be lacking in confidence as much as anything and had their own chance to level at 7-7 after Cadan Murley broke the Tigers defensive line only for Bryn Bradley to fumble the final pass with the line beckoning.\n\nIt appeared to sum up where they are at the moment, certainly on the domestic front where none of their decent European form (they thrashed La Rochelle in the Champions Cup to finish second in their pool) seems to be rubbing off.\n\nFrom Bradley's mistake things only got worse for the home side with Van Poortvliet's effort, a Billy Searle penalty and a penalised high tackle from winger Nick David ensuring Quins went in 17-0 and a man down at the break.\n\nWhile the home side held out while David was in the bin, Steward broke through the dual attentions of Sam Riley and Elliot Williams just after the hour to make it 22-0, Searle's boot adding the extras.\n\nBlamire and Perese came off the bench to add to Quins pain with a short range power and long range speed finishes before Cunningham-South's outstretched arm through a sea of limbs at least got them on the scoreboard at the death.\n\nMore worrying for Quins management was the fact that a significant number of home fans were not there to see it, having already departed after seeing enough of a side who remain second from bottom on just 10 points after 10 games.\n\nHarlequins head coach Jason Gilmore said:\n\n\"Our fans have been brilliant. We had a sold-out Stoop today but I can understand their feelings. They are loyal to the team and club. We need to give them something to enjoy on the field.\n\n\"It's not skillset, it's mindset. We went on the back foot pretty quickly and couldn't turn things around. We must see to what steps we need to put in place to regain that mindset.\n\n\"We need to build a squad which can hold out under fire.\"\n\nLeicester head coach Geoff Parling told BBC Radio Leicester:\n\n\"Twelve of our lads had e.coli when they got back from South Africa last weekend and four of our staff so I didn't let any of those into the training building on Tuesday as we didn't want to infect anybody.\n\n\"But the group has proved to be very adaptable and this was a fine win.\n\n\"I was a bit frustrated at the end that we let them in for that try but that was a great performance overall. The pack worked hard for each other, it was very windy and conditions were quite hard but I am very pleased with what we did.\n\n\"Jack van Poortvliet was excellent today. He's had some injuries which have not helped him at certain times. His speed of delivery is good and he's a top-notch number nine. He showed what he can do with that try, too.\n\n\"He came off [with an injury] but hopefully it is just a dead leg. He is going to get it scanned and hopefully it is not too serious.\n\n\"The league doesn't lie. We are obviously not at the very top and there are things we can improve on to really push on. But we work hard for each other, look organised and are growing our game gradually.\"\n\nHarlequins: Green, David, Northmore, Bradley, Murley, Smith, Friday; Kerrod, Walker, Delgado, Treadwell, Petti, Cunningham-South, Kenningham, Dombrandt\n\nReplacements: Riley, Hobson, E Williams, T Williams, Driscoll, Lawday, Green, Evans\n\nLeicester: Steward, Hamer-Webb, Wand, Bailey, Hassell-Collins, Searle, van Poortvliet; Smith, Clare, Heyes, Henderson, Chessum, Liebenberg, Reffell, Ilione\n\nReplacements: Blamire, van der Flier, Hurd, Moro, Cracknell, Allan, O'Connor, Perese",

    "fullText": "Bristol Bears leapfrogged Exeter Chiefs to move up to third in the Prem table with a hard-fought 8-3 win in appalling conditions at Sandy Park.\n\nWith the rain teeming down, the first half was largely punctuated by handling errors and referee Karl Dickson's whistle, with neither side able to get points on the board until Henry Slade's penalty just before the half-hour mark.\n\nThe game's only try then came through Noah Heward's sliding effort, after Olly Woodburn was unable to gather the ball as half-time approached.\n\nIn what had looked increasingly like a scoreless second half, James Williams' late penalty condemned Rob Baxter's men to their first home defeat of the season.\n\nIn a match that was meant to herald the long-awaited returns of Bears stalwarts Steven Luatua and Gabriel Ibitoye, all the focus was on the conditions, with neither team able to produce the running rugby so desired by both fan bases.\n\nBarely able to see through the rain, both sides adopted a hard yards and box kicking approach in the first half, one that failed to deliver any real attacking momentum for either until the dying moments of the first half.\n\nIt was Slade who stepped up, converting a penalty, minutes after Tom Jordan had squandered a similar opportunity for Bristol at the other end.\n\nIn a game desperately crying out for points, Slade was then forced to dot the ball down under his own posts after Woodburn's mishandling led to the ball squirming out on the liquid surface.\n\nFrom the ensuing scrum, Bristol eventually capitalised.\n\nSlade was lucky not to be penalised when he knocked on as he attempted to intercept a pass meant for Matias Moroni deep in the Chiefs' 22.\n\nBut Louis Rees-Zammit was able to pick up the ball and find space on the outside to feed Heward, who slid in for what turned out to be the only try of the game.\n\nWith the rain easing as the second half began, Exeter drove up into the Bears' 22, but were unable to break through the impervious Bristol defence, eventually being penalised after Gabriel Oghre had stolen the ball back.\n\nSlade then had the chance to put Exeter ahead for the first time, but his penalty from the halfway line drifted agonisingly wide.\n\nThe Chiefs had the majority of the ball but were unable to capitalise and it was the Bears who looked most like scoring when Rees-Zammit counter-attacked, only for his grubber kick forward to drift long, allowing Woodburn to recover.\n\nThe home side then paid for their profligacy.\n\nSlade's up and under was charged down in midfield, forcing the England centre to dive on the loose ball before being penalised for holding on.\n\nWilliams then made no mistake, slotting the ensuing penalty through the posts as Bristol left Sandy Park sodden, but victorious.\n\nThe result leaves Exeter in fifth on 35 points, following Leicester's 34-7 win over Harlequins.\n\nVan Poortvliet shines as Leicester dominate Quins\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nBristol Bears' director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Radio Bristol:\n\n\"The beauty of the weather is that it was black and white, we had to roll our sleeves up and commit to everything.\n\n\"The physicality, the getting up off the ground, making another tackle, the defensive sets we had were brilliant, not just to defend but also not to give away penalties.\n\n\"We're really showing that we can win in lots of ways - there is more to this team than just throwing the ball around.\n\n\"To win eight games out of the last nine is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.\"\n\nExeter Chiefs' director of rugby Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:\n\n\"We made quite a lot of errors, there's a lot of things for us to look at that we could've done better, but the Bears made a lot of errors as well.\n\n\"In a very tight game, they probably shaded the areas that win and lose games. Their mistakes hurt them less than ours did.\n\n\"We didn't quite finish things off, they defended their line really strongly, we weren't quite good enough today, let's move on.\"\n\nExeter: Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Haydon-Wood, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Chapman; Sio, Dweba, Tchumbadze; Jenkins (c), Zambonin, Hooper, Roots, Fisilau.\n\nReplacements: Yeandle, Goodrick-Clarke, Roots, Pearson, Capstick, Cairns, Hammersley, Ridl.\n\nBristol: Rees-Zammit; Heward, Moroni, Janse van Rensburg, Ravouvou; Jordan, Randall; Genge, Oghre, Kloska; Rubiolo, Batley, Luatua, Harding (c), Mata.\n\nReplacements: Thacker, Lahiff, Halliwell, Owen, Grondona, Marmion, Williams, Ibitoye.",

Even when they signed the two new forwards I still didn't think they would have enough to stay up – and they still might not – but the manager seems to have stopped the rot and some of the pressure has eased on him.\n\n\"Forest are now probably looking over their shoulders a bit nervously whereas before there seemed to be three teams cast adrift at the bottom.\"",

    "description": "Final Score EFL pundit Sam Parkin reflects on the highs and lows after Saturday's action.",
    "fullText": "After another dramatic Saturday turned up plenty of action, former Swindon, Ipswich and Luton striker and BBC Final Score pundit Sam Parkin gives his takeaways from what we learned across the Championship and rest of the EFL.\n\nThere were two 4-0 wins in the early games in the Championship on Saturday as Middlesbrough showed their promotion credentials by thumping Preston North End while Millwall swept aside Charlton Athletic at The Den to keep pace at the top.\n\nParkin: \"I thought the Middlesbrough game would be tighter against a Preston team who's had a really good season, but I think the recent form played out really.\n\n\"That's a fourth win in a row for Middlesbrough, and Preston have lost their past four and they're struggling to find the net.\n\n\"I thought if there was a flaw in their set-up in comparison to the other top teams - namely Coventry City and Ipswich Town - it might be the amount of goals that they're likely to score.\n\n\"But it's really timely that Tommy Conway has started scoring and Morgan Whittaker's made an incredible difference as well.\n\n\"They're in a brilliant place at the moment. They're playing some great football and they've come through a tough week with some tough games by winning at Stoke and beating Preston so convincingly, which is not to be sniffed at.\n\n\"For Millwall, I think it's the most depth they've had in recent years with loads of exciting attacking players.\n\n\"They've been able to get Macaulay Langstaff and Josh Coburn in the line-up together, and Aziz has had an incredible season as well and played a part in their first goal.\n\n\"They've got a great opportunity this year, probably the best opportunity they've had in recent times to get in the play-offs and potentially the Premier League.\"\n\nOff the back of Middlesbrough's early win against Preston, Ipswich were stunned by Sheffield United, who were reduced to 10 men late on, as they lost ground on the Championship automatic promotion places.\n\nParkin: \"I think it was always going to be a tough game for Ipswich today at Sheffield United. They've got a few players missing through injury and they've got a massive month ahead.\n\n\"That's the only thing I can see derailing Ipswich - they've got to play seven games in February with the FA Cup and a rearranged game.\n\n\"So the squad will be tested. I think they've probably got the numbers to do it, but when, comparatively, some teams would play five or six games [in February] it does have a little bit of an effect.\n\n\"They're going to have to deal with a fixture pile-up but the way they're going, especially at Portman Road, I don't think today's result will affect them too much.\n\n\"I still have Ipswich probably just slightly out in front of Middlesbrough, which sounds strange speaking after such a convincing Boro win and a disappointing afternoon for Ipswich, but I just think that depth will prevail in the long run.\n\n\"Sheffield United have picked up under Chris Wilder and they'll probably be looking at the table tonight and thinking that potentially they could go on a run and make it in the play-offs themselves with so many games to play for.\"\n\nWrexham moved sixth in the Championship table courtesy of their comeback win at QPR. Phil Parkinson led the Hollywood-owned club to three promotions in a row, and a morale-boosting win in the capital will have their fans dreaming of a remarkable four from four as they barged into the play-off picture.\n\nParkin: \"Wrexham are in great form at the moment. With 10 minutes to go it looked like they were going to leave with nothing from QPR, so to turn it around and sneak into the top six tonight, that'll be a great journey home for the supporters and the players.\n\n\"I think the reality of the situation is, with that cluster of teams that are hoping to get into the play-offs, they've got the financial backing to add a few more players at the end of the window.\n\n\"They've got a quality squad as it is but if they could add a couple of savvy signings then we could be talking about another promotion or at least another play-off campaign, which would be absolutely incredible.\n\n\"I think everyone probably had maybe Birmingham slightly in front of where Wrexham were at the start of the season in terms of their potential in the Championship, so it's flip-flopped a little bit in their favour.\n\n\"But as we see in so many seasons, that final play-off position, even though it seems a long way away, seems open for someone, and why not Wrexham? They've certainly got the squad to do it.\"\n\nWigan certainly needed a boost having strayed close to the League One drop zone after a chastening home loss to Bolton Wanderers last week. Latics boss Ryan Lowe said Saturday's trip to fellow strugglers Doncaster Rovers was not a six-pointer, but his side were forced to come from behind to rescue a 3-3 draw across the Pennines.\n\nParkin: \"Doncaster's home form in particular has been really indifferent, so it was a little bit of a surprise to see them in that lead.\n\n\"I wouldn't have envisaged Wigan getting back into it because they don't strike me as the most free-scoring. I know that they lost narrowly to Bolton in a local derby but it's a position in the league I didn't see them being in.\n\n\"Hopefully, they can use that as a catalyst to rise up the table. They're the afternoons that stick with you as a player. When you come back from 3-0 behind - I think I did it once in my career - the memories in the dressing room are really amazing days.\n\n\"So being in a terrible position, that dressing room would be really elated at full-time.\"\n\nIn League Two, Bromley and Swindon Town - the top two at the start of the day - played out a thriller with the Ravens edging out Ian Holloway's side, while Cambridge United stunned Tranmere Rovers to move up to fourth. Just four points separate second and seventh as the promotion race hots up in the fourth tier.\n\nParkin: \"The top of League Two is one of the most exciting areas of the EFL at the moment. I just think there's so many good teams and so many different teams.\n\n\"You have the underdog story of Bromley, of course, who are out in front and earned a massive victory over Swindon, and I don't think you can underplay that.\n\n\"Nicke Kabamba got the winner and that's nine goals he's scored, with seven as a substitute, which just shows what a brilliant signing he's been.\n\n\"Cambridge, likewise, are on an incredible run with their budget. I'm sure they're operating with one of the lowest in comparison to teams around them like Salford and MK Dons.\n\n\"Karl Robinson has really got Salford going, and then you see Walsall as well who, yes, dropped points this afternoon, but they were play-off finalists last year and have re-built a really competitive squad this year.\n\n\"I just think you literally cannot predict who's going to be in the top three. It's so open, so exciting, and it's set up brilliantly for the last few months of the season.\"\n\nSam Parkin was talking to BBC Sport England's Jay Freeman.",

    "fullText": "Our rising global temperatures aren't just a distant threat to the natural world anymore; they have a very real, palpable impact on personal finances and the greater economy.\n\nA statistical analysis of climate risks in Mongolia over recent years pointed to a correlation between monetary instability — at the individual, local, and national levels — and regional weather patterns and abnormalities.\n\nConducted by the United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the research indicated that Mongolia's financial foundation is facing pressure from two sides. The region's floods, droughts, and extreme winters — or dzuds — often damage homes and infrastructure and leave the agricultural industry floundering, but unfortunately, supporting the burgeoning clean energy industry and taking other climate-forward steps is costly.\n\nPer the ESCAP report, Mongolia suffers an average loss equivalent to more than $425 million each year, owing in particular to drought-driven losses of close to $350 million.\n\nAt a broad level, the high atmospheric temperatures brought on by urban carbon pollution and other environmentally unfriendly practices have begun disrupting our global weather patterns, increasing aridity in many regions and supercharging natural disasters like floods and hurricanes.\n\nFor a country like Mongolia, which relies heavily on its agricultural sector, atypical climate and severe storms and floods can cripple economic development by devastating crop yields.\n\nLikewise, the surge in extreme weather drives up the costs of home ownership, particularly as a result of rising insurance costs.\n\n\"Infrastructure damage from floods can impair businesses and real estate values, undermining mortgage portfolios,\" ESCAP explained. \"These climate stressors can lead to higher loan default rates, market volatility, liquidity strains, and even legal liabilities for financial institutions.\"\n\nMongolia isn't the only part of the world to encounter the financial consequences of extreme weather for homeowners. Experts observed a similar trend in California following the Los Angeles wildfires in early 2025, which hiked up premiums for homeowners in medium- and high- risk areas.\n\nAlthough combating climate pollution may appear to be the obvious solution, Mongolia's experience revealed to ESCAP that transition costs can prove just as precarious. The country's decarbonization goals and attempts to fortify its renewable energy sector come at the expense of the livestock industry — trimmed down to reduce methane-releasing cattle populations — and the mining industry, a cornerstone of Mongolia's foreign trade.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Quirke, Carpenter, O'Flaherty 2 Cons: Ford 3 Pen: Ford\n\nTries: Freeman, Hutchinson, R Smith, Todaro, Kemeny, Coles, Pollock Cons: Belleau 3, Furbank\n\nNorthampton Saints returned to the top of The Prem after coming out on top of a 11-try thriller over Sale Sharks.\n\nHaving lost the lead to Bath following their win over Gloucester on Friday, Saints showed what they are all about with a display full of bold, attacking rugby.\n\nTommy Freeman and Rory Hutchinson scored in the first half, before Robbie Smith, Edoardo Todaro, Josh Kemeny, Alex Coles and Henry Pollock grabbed second-half tries.\n\nThe Sharks scored four tries of their own through Raffi Quirke, Joe Carpenter and two from Tom O'Flaherty and they led 29-26 with less than an quarter of the game to go.\n\nBut Northampton's late burst of three tries proved decisive as they claimed an eighth win from 10 Prem games to move two points clear of Bath, and a first win at this venue since 2017.\n\nDefeat leaves Sale in seventh and with their hopes of a fourth consecutive top-four spot all but over, as they lie 16 points adrift of fourth spot.\n\nBristol edge past Exeter in rainstorm to go third\n\nVan Poortvliet shines as Leicester dominate Quins\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nIn a heavyweight clash involving 11 of England's Six Nations squad, either starting or on the bench, it was Saints who made a blistering start.\n\nFreeman, a likely starter for the opener with Wales at Allianz Stadium on 7 February, touched down inside the first seven minutes after a sharp reverse pass from Alex Mitchell set him up.\n\nNorthampton's slick handling was again in evidence as they spread the ball across the line with Kemeny supplying the pass for centre Hutchinson to score in the left corner.\n\nThere should have been a third score after a brilliant offload from Callum Chick and a reverse pass from Hutchinson, only for Freeman to inexplicably spill it with a try there for the taking.\n\nAnd with that let-off, Quirke, bound for Newcastle Red Bulls next season, spotted a gap in the defence to dive over under the posts.\n\nSale ended the first half with a man less as Tom Curry was yellow carded after being adjudged to have gone high on Kemeny, but remarkably by the time Curry returned, his side were ahead.\n\nGeorge Ford kicked a penalty with the last kick of the first half when Mitchell gave up 10 metres for not handing the ball over to reduce the deficit to three, before Carpenter went over in the corner in the first minute after the restart to make it 15-14.\n\nBut the Saints pack took it upon themselves to restore their advantage with hooker Smith eventually the one adjudged to have got the ball over the line.\n\nThat just started an incredible period of play as the lead changed hands. O'Flaherty's first try and a superb touchline conversion from Ford had Sale back in front.\n\nBut a blistering counter attack involving Mitchell and George Furbank was brilliantly finished in the corner by Italy teenager Todaro, for his seventh Prem try of the season.\n\nHowever, Sale's next attack saw them suck in defenders and Rob du Preez's kick was on the money for O'Flaherty to score again to lead 29-26.\n\nSaints delved into their box of tricks one more time with Chick breaking through and although Mitchell was held up by O'Flaherty, superb support play from Kemeny allowed the Australia flanker to score in the corner.\n\nThis time, there was no letting it slip as Coles finished off after a number of phases near the line, before Pollock rounded things off in the only way he can, running through from halfway before spectacularly diving over.\n\nSo while Saints sit pretty for the next two months as The Prem takes a break for the Six Nations, Sale are left to lick their wounds.\n\nSale Sharks director of rugby Alex Sanderson said:\n\n\"We came up short in quite a few areas – set-piece early on, scrum dominance, collisions around the rucks, things that led into them having momentum and almost being able to score at will.\n\n\"That's where we fell short across the 80 minutes and probably across the season if I'm being honest. Consistent inaccuracies in too many fundamental parts of our game.\n\n\"It probably shows where we're at, at this moment in time. Northampton are a team in form, we're a team trying to find some form.\n\n\"Realistically, that's us done for the play-offs, but not the season. I am not going to give up on a season in January. No, we are going to get better. There is that to play for, and scalps to take.\"\n\nNorthampton Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson said:\n\n\"Alex Sanderson had said it was a huge fixture for them, so we knew there would be an emotional spike from them and we know Sale are a very good side and it would be nip-and-tuck.\n\n\"It was a mad game with the wind, that made it pretty chaotic, but we stuck to our guns enough to get away in the last 10 minutes.\n\n\"We created loads in the first half and didn't convert it and then they come straight out and score and it's game on. But I admire the way we stuck at the plan.\n\n\"It's been a long time here. We felt we've been close the last couple of years. Other sides have struggled to get results up here, so that makes it all the sweeter that we managed to get over the line in the last game in this block.\"\n\nSale: Carpenter; O'Flaherty, R du Preez, Ma'asi-White, Wills; Ford, Quirke; Rodd, Jibulu, Harper, van Rhyn, Bamber, Vermuelen, Dugdale, T Curry.\n\nReplacements: Caine, McIntyre, Bell, Burrow, Gilmore, Warr, Louw, Reed.\n\nNorthampton: Hendy; Freeman, Hutchinson, Dingwall, Todaro; Belleau, Mitchell; Iyogun, R Smith, Davison, Coles, van der Mescht, Kemeny, Pearson, Chick.\n\nReplacements: Wright, Fischetti, Millar Mills, Prowse, Lockett, Pollock, McParland, Furbank.",

    "fullText": "Head coach Eddie Howe believes Newcastle United can still achieve \"great things\" despite the constraints of financial rules as his side look to upset the Premier League's status quo.\n\nClubs who spend the most on wages have traditionally picked up the most points per game.\n\nBut both Newcastle and Sunday's opponents Aston Villa have bucked that trend in recent years with the eighth and sixth-biggest salary bills in the top flight respectively.\n\nNewcastle qualified for the Champions League in 2023 and 2025, while Aston Villa followed suit in 2024.\n\nBoth are bidding to do so again this season and Howe's men could move up to fourth with a victory against third-placed Villa if results elsewhere go their way.\n\n\"People much cleverer than me will say that the wage bill follows the league position, but I can't think that way,\" said the Newcastle boss.\n\n\"We have got to think differently and find ways to still win games to upset the status quo and finish as high as we can.\n\n\"That will always be my belief, and that was my belief from day one in management. Football is played on the pitch - not with the money.\"\n\nIt is worth noting Newcastle's net spend on new signings last summer was £100m-plus, but they sold star striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British transfer record fee of £125m.\n\nTargets such as Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, James Trafford and Benjamin Sesko also opted to join Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United respectively rather than move to St James' Park.\n\nAlthough Newcastle are majority owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia, legacy clubs - also including Arsenal and Tottenham - have the ability to spend more within the rules on account of their superior income streams.\n\nAnalysis from financial firm Deloitte revealed Liverpool generated £367m \n\n\"I know people are bored of us talking about it, but it's factual,\" he added. \"Building our revenues will be so important, and I know there's a lot of work behind the scenes to do that.\n\n\"I have always had the belief that, whatever situation you have, you have to try to outperform your resources. You have to try to overachieve. You have to stretch every ounce of energy and effort from the squad that you have.\n\n\"We believe we can still achieve great things - regardless of what financial restrictions there are on us.\"\n\nOverall squad costs from the 2026-27 league campaign will be limited to 85% of a club's revenue, while teams competing in Europe will have to adhere to Uefa's maximum of 70%.",

Things like “smart compose,” as well as the feature that automatically filters your emails into “promotional” and “social” inboxes, and even spell-check, grammar check and autocorrect are currently tied to the Gemini opt-in.\n\nSo, as you opt out of sharing your information, you might want to consider whether you’re ready to lose some features in exchange.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Olena Janchuk spends another day of freezing isolation in her high-rise apartment.\n\nThe former kindergarten teacher has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and has been trapped for weeks on the 19th floor of her Kyiv tower block, 650 steps from the ground.\n\nLong daily blackouts caused by Russia’s bombardment of power plants and transmission lines have made working elevators a luxury.\n\nWith January temperatures plummeting to minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), there’s a permanent line of frost on the inside of Janchuk’s windows, white patterns creeping across the glass by morning.\n\nThe 53-year-old huddles over a makeshift fireplace of candles arranged beneath stacked bricks, designed to absorb and slowly release heat. USB charging cables snake across the floor from overloaded power strips, while her electric blanket is hooked up to a power bank rationed for the coldest hours.\n\n“When there’s no light and heat for seventeen and a half hours, you have to come up with something,” she said. “The bricks work best in a small room, so we stay in there.”\n\nKyiv, a city of about 3 million people, is dominated by tower blocks, many from the Soviet era, now left without power for most of the day.\n\nIn this fourth winter of war, electricity is a rationed commodity.\n\nResidents plan their lives around electricity schedules: when to cook, shower, charge phones and run washing machines. Food is chosen for shelf life, water filtered into bottles and stored in buckets. Small camping gas burners are used to heat soup or tea when the power is out.\n\nSleep is fractured by air raid sirens and the need to use electricity during off-peak hours.\n\nOutside, across snow-covered Kyiv, diesel generators rumble on commercial streets. Shoppers navigate aisles using phone flashlights, and bars glow by candlelight.\n\nApps notify users of narrowing electricity windows — usually just a few hours — enough for a household reboot.\n\nLife gets harder on the higher floors\n\nJanchuk’s 22-story building is located near a power station and residents can see the missile and drone attacks firsthand, flashes lighting up the horizon at night.\n\nDuring blackouts, they climb the stairs in darkness, phone lights bouncing off concrete steps, often accompanied by the echo of children and barking dogs. People sometimes leave plastic bags with cookies or water inside elevators for those who get stuck when the power cuts midride.\n\nJanchuk’s husband, out working most of the day, brings the groceries in the evening while her mother, 72-year-old Lyudmila Bachurina, is in charge of chores.\n\n“It’s cold, but we manage,” the mother says, holding a square USB-charged flashlight she recently mounted on the wall. “When the lights come on, I start turning on the washing machine, fill up water bottles, cook food, charge power banks, run around the kitchen and run around the house.”\n\nIn upscale neighborhoods, residents pool funds for generators to keep elevators running. But most blocks — home to pensioners, families and people with disabilities — cannot afford them.\n\nDisability advocates, including groups representing wounded war veterans, say staircases have become an invisible social barrier, cutting people off inside their own homes.\n\nThey are urging city officials to fund generators for residential buildings.\n\nUntil then, life bends around the electricity timetable. USB lamps, power banks and inverter batteries have become household staples. Telegram chats help neighbors check on the elderly and swap blackout updates.\n\nFrom upper floors, Kyivans look out over a skyline of high rises and the city’s historic golden-domed churches. At night, flashes of explosions are visible as Russia continues its campaign against Ukraine’s energy system.\n\nRussia has inflicted vast damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure\n\nToo many power stations and transmission lines have been hit to meet demand, even with electricity imports from Europe. To prevent a grid collapse, operators impose rolling blackouts, keeping hospitals and critical services alive while homes go dark.\n\nAt one coal-fired power plant struck repeatedly, shift supervisor Yuriy walks through wreckage of charred machinery, collapsed roofs and control panels melted into useless lumps. Repairs are carried out by torchlight, giant sandbags shielding what still works. Photographs of colleagues killed on the job hang near the entrance.\n\n“After missile and drone attacks, the consequences are terrible — large-scale,” he said.\n\nOfficials asked that the plant’s location and Yuriy’s full name not be disclosed for security reasons.\n\n“Our energy equipment has been destroyed. It is expensive,” Yuriy said. “Right now, we’re restoring what we can.”\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nKyiv has repeatedly updated its austere winter power-saving schedule, dimming or cutting streetlights in low-traffic areas and investing in less centralized power generation.\n\nIn the tower blocks, restoration feels far off.\n\n“I’m tired, really tired, to be honest. When you can’t go outside, when you don’t see the sun, when there’s no light and you can’t even go to the store on your own. … It wears you down,” Bachurina said.\n\n“But the important thing, as all Ukrainians say now, is that we will endure anything until the war ends.”\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "(Corrects typo in first subhead)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - When Fabiola, a single mother and naturalized U.S. citizen from Latin America, first learned of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, she said she was heartbroken and terrified.\n\nThen she joined the thousands of other Minnesotans who have volunteered to track ICE agents since Good was killed - despite her fears for herself and her son ​Asher, who is seven.\n\n“I do feel scared, but at the same time, I know I have to take care of my people too,” she said.\n\nActivists say they have been overwhelmed by new volunteers - despite the potential for violence - ‌since Good was killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.\n\nFederal agents on Saturday shot dead a Minneapolis resident, the second person since the Trump administration surged 3,000 immigration enforcement officials to the city.\n\nFabiola, who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and owns a construction company, never knew Good. The mother of three ‌was fatally shot when she stopped her car during an immigration enforcement action, just blocks from Fabiola's home.\n\nDHS did not respond to requests for comment on the risks to observers in Minnesota, but officials say federal agents respond with gunfire when they fear for their lives. Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary, and other Trump administration officials have described the protesters and observers as \"anti-ICE\" and \"far left\" agitators.\n\nWHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME\n\nFabiola and Asher now blow their whistles when they spot immigration agents on their way to school. She taught Asher how to identify federal agents by their uniforms, and made him memorize his grandparents' phone numbers in case she is detained.\n\nFabiola, who declined to share her last name for fear of retribution, has also started delivering food to people afraid to leave their homes. And she regularly ⁠stops by the makeshift memorial to Good.\n\n“She’s got kids, and her kids don’t have their ‌mom now,\" Fabiola said. \"If something happened to me, where is my boy going to go?”\n\nVice President JD Vance said during a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday that Good was trying to ram Ross with her car. Analyses of bystander video by Reuters and other outlets show Good's wheels were turned away from Ross, and that his legs were clear of the vehicle when he shot her.\n\nAt least five ‍organizations offer training on how to monitor ICE actions, warn immigrants of their presence and document the use of force against detainees and protesters. Online training for one of those groups has been hitting maximum capacity of 1,000 within hours, said Kate Wegener, an immigration attorney who leads the trainings.\n\n“We were fearful that attendance would be lower after her death, but it was the complete opposite,” she said.\n\nThe sessions typically offer safety tips: stay at least eight feet from federal agents; follow orders given by officers and keep one's distance when driving behind convoys of agents.\n\nSome of ​the observers are hyper-aware of the risks. Janet, a resident of a Minneapolis suburb who declined to share her last name out of fear of doxxing, said she has written letters to friends and family to be opened if she's killed.\n\nMinnesota ‌authorities at state and local levels have encouraged the observers. Governor Tim Walz has urged residents to take out their phones and document federal agents.\n\nThe observers, often identified by their fluorescent green vests and whistles looped around their necks, are now an increasingly common sight along busy roads and residential neighborhoods when the heavily armed, masked federal agents dressed in tactical gear are deployed.\n\nThe community pushback has had some effect. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino on Wednesday said the city presented a “difficult operating environment” for enforcement agents.\n\nOrganizers compared the level of engagement to the surge of activism following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nOn a recent day, two new volunteers, a married couple, straddled their bikes next to a busy intersection on the lookout for ICE agents. Snow gathered on their jackets and frost clung to their eyelashes.\n\n“I kind of woke up to what was happening when Renee Good was killed – I knew bad things were happening, but hadn't realized quite how bad it was yet,” ⁠said Aaron, who is 41 and works in marketing. He declined to share his last name out of fear of retribution. “And then when that happened, ​it was like, it's time to start doing something.”\n\nEarlier that day, he said he had adjusted his six-mile run to cover neighborhoods where residents had reported ​ICE sightings near schools.\n\nPushing back against immigration enforcement carries risk. The immigration observers have been teargassed and arrested. State authorities said Friday they were compiling data on arrests but it was not immediately available.\n\nFor Patty O’Keefe, a 36-year-old non-profit worker, those risks underline the importance of the observers.\n\n\"They wouldn't be working so hard to intimidate us and utilizing all those resources if we weren't actually ‍being successful in gumming up the works of their operation or ⁠slowing them down,” O’Keefe said.\n\nEarlier this month, as she was following ICE agents in her car, she said five federal agents shattered her car window, handcuffed her, and put her in an unmarked SUV. She said ICE agents photographed her, insulted her and held her for eight hours in a Minneapolis detention center before she was released without charge.\n\nDHS did not respond to a request for comment on O'Keefe's account of the incident, and Reuters was unable to ⁠determine independently what occurred.\n\nShe said she now struggles with anxiety - but will continue volunteering.\n\n\"I'm just stubborn, and I'm not wanting to give in to the fear.\"\n\nMany residents speak about Good with a sense of reverence, describing her as an inspiration.\n\nOn the street where she was killed, dozens of people defied dangerously ‌cold weather to add to the mounds of bouquets, stuffed animals and electric candles glowing through the snow at a makeshift memorial.\n\n“She gave her life for us,” Fabiola said. “Her soul is in heaven, and she protects ‌us.”",

    "fullText": "Wildlife smuggling cases are often uncovered at borders or ports, but officials say trains are also being used to illegally move live animals. According to the Hindustan Times, passenger routes can make criminal transport easier to hide in plain sight.\n\nOfficials with the Railway Protection Force said they recovered 102 live turtles from the Howrah-Dehradun Doon Express after inspecting five unclaimed bags found beneath seats and berths in a coach.\n\nInspector Banarsi Yadav said the train arrived at Gaya Junction around 10:30 p.m., when a joint patrol was underway as part of Operation Wilep. He said the turtles were protected under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, making the transport a criminal offense. While no one was arrested, the animals were handed over to the forest department, which gave the turtles a health check.\n\n\"After no passenger claimed the bags, they were opened. We found 102 live turtles inside those bags,\" Yadav told the Times.\n\nWildlife trafficking can disrupt ecosystems while harming efforts to conserve them. For example, moving animals from their natural habitats to new territories can weaken vulnerable wildlife populations by introducing the former as invasive species that affect breeding and eating habits. When trafficking routes overlap with human travel and trade ports, however, it may be harder to enforce protections.\n\nIt can also increase the chances that animals get injured or killed as well as increase wildlife-human interactions that can end in disaster. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported that smugglers often transport illegally captured turtles in extremely cramped and inhumane conditions that contribute to deadly disease outbreaks among the animals. In one case, eastern box turtles that were trafficked were infected with ranavirus, which is known to cause hemorrhaging and fluid accumulation. There is no known cure.\n\nPer the Times, Operation Wilep focuses on patrols, inspections, and coordination with other departments to intercept wildlife traffickers on rail routes.\n\nIf you're looking to get involved in raising awareness about the illegal wildlife trade, it's important to note that, like other critical climate issues, public awareness and community engagement are key to addressing the issue. A widespread understanding of how smuggling impacts ecosystems can affect how many people recognize and report suspicious activity.\n\nDo you think America has a plastic waste problem?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Store brands help us save money, but the truth is the product is often made by a brand name producer. If Walmart's butter tastes familiar, here's why.",
    "fullText": "A shopper's pre-dinner surprise highlighted online speculations about manufacturing products and brand packaging. As one TikTok creator opened packages of Land O' Lakes butter, the buyer was faced with butter sticks wrapped in Walmart's Great Value brand labels. On TikTok, several shoppers are convinced that the butter is in fact the same and that brands and packaging simply drives price differences. \"I'm sure Land 'O Lakes makes the Great Value butter and they mixed up the wrappers on the line,\" wrote a TikTokker. \"The amount of people that don't know it all comes from the same factories is INSANE,\" added another. One commenter on Facebook recalled being informed by a worker that machines would be stopped for labels to be switched and packaging to continue.\n\nWalmart customers appreciate the price point of Great Value products. \"Everything is made by some other company and just branded Great Value Sam's choice, etc.,\" wrote a Redditor. \"Never had a problem with Great Value honestly. Especially given the fact that most, if not all Great Value products are made and packaged by their name brand counterparts.\" Sara Lee has been linked to Great Value White Bread, and Peter Pan has been associated with Great Value Peanut Butter, for example, but it can take some detective work to determine concrete answers.\n\nOn Quora, industry insiders revealed that dairy production can change from region to region and which suppliers are available. \"Two companies that I know for sure on the East Coast are Land 'O Lakes and Blue Bonnet,\" the user revealed before adding that brand names would be changed on packaging labels during manufacturing processes. \"Great Value is Walmart's private‑label brand; the butter sold under the Great Value name is produced for Walmart by multiple co‑packers rather than a single manufacturer,\" the user explained. One Facebooker explained that Walmart contracts brands to package Great Value products. \"Land 'O Lakes and Great Value are the exact same butter, made in the same factory on the same line, they just switch the labels and packaging,\" added another. \"I worked in a name brand place that also made a generic product. But we would stop to change labels, while the machine operator changed the recipe,\" chimed in a TikTokker.\n\nTo locate details about a specific manufacturer on a package, the names of makers and co-packers are often listed somewhere near the ingredient and nutrition profile. Product codes can also indicate information about particular facilities. Additionally, customer service departments may provide supplier information that correspond to recorded codes. Since Walmart's supplier network changes, however, information may only refer to a specific code and date of product, making sweeping statements difficult to provide — and contributing to the rumors that continue to swirl online.\n\nWant more food knowledge?
