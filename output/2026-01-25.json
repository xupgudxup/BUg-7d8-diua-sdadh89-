    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts wears No. 30 as a tribute to his late mentor and friend, Maury Wills.\n\nWills previously wore the number when he played for the Dodgers as their shortstop from 1959-1966 and 1969-1972. Roberts formed a close friendship with his mentor when he was a member of the Dodgers from 2002-2004.\n\nWills worked as a special instructor for the Dodgers and worked closely with a young Roberts on baserunning and bunting. While Roberts was traded in the middle of the 2004 season to the Boston Red Sox, the pair maintained a close relationship.\n\nRoberts continued to wear No. 30 after his playing career was over as he chose to sport the number when he became the Dodgers’ manager in 2016.\n\nWills passed away in September 2022 and had expressed to Roberts prior to his death that he hoped nobody else would wear No. 30.\n\nFlash forward to 2026, the Dodgers signed Kyle Tucker to a four-year, $240 million deal. The All-Star outfielder had previously worn No. 30 throughout his entire career, but chose a new jersey number after a conversation with Roberts.\n\n“It was a fun conversation that Tuck and I had,” the Dodgers skipper said at Tucker’s introductory press conerence. “It was just more of, Maury and I have just had such a great relationship. And one of the things that he was like, ‘Gosh, before I die, I hope—or when I die, I hope that no one else wears that number.’ And so, it’s really near and dear to me.”\n\nRoberts first joined the Dodgers as a fourth-year player after playing the first three seasons of his career with the Cleveland Guardians, where he wore No. 20.\n\nRoberts was traded to the Red Sox in the midst of this third season in LA. The outfielder became a key figure for Boston’s improbable World Series run in 2004, most notably for his stolen base in Game 4 of the 2004 AL Championship Series.\n\nWhile Roberts only played 45 regular season games for the Red Sox, he became a beloved figure in Boston as his stolen base represents the turning point for the organization’s World Series title.\n\nRoberts has a .266 career batting average with 23 home runs, 213 RBIs and 243 stolen bases. He accumulated a 9.1 career bWAR over 10 MLB seasons.\n\nWhile Roberts had a respectable playing career, he is regarded as one of the best managers in baseball. Roberts will end up in Cooperstown and has already cemented his legacy as the arguably the greatest Dodgers skipper in franchise history.",

    "fullText": "The Steelers will be undergoing several coaching changes this offseason following the resignation of head coach Mike Tomlin. Pittsburgh verbally agreed to hire Mike McCarthy on Saturday as its next head coach, and the Steelers will also be searching for a new offensive coordinator.\n\nSteelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith is expected to take the same role at Ohio State, as reported by ESPN’s Pete Thamel on Saturday.\n\nSmith served as the Steelers offensive coordinator from 2024 to 2025 after the Atlanta Falcons let him go as head coach. Smith began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at North Carolina. He’s only spent two years coaching at the college level, including a season as a defensive intern at Ole Miss in 2010.\n\nOhio State’s offensive coordinator Brian Hartline accepted the head coaching position at South Florida in early December. Now, the Buckeyes have finally found someone to take charge of their offense.\n\nOhio State’s head coach, Ryan Day is known for his offensive-minded approach; however, he allowed Hartline to handle the play-calling throughout last season, only stepping in for the College Football Playoffs. It’s likely that Smith will take over the play-calling duties at Ohio State moving forward.\n\nThe Steelers will now be on the lookout for their next offensive coordinator, and that search is likely to kick off soon.\n\nMore NFL: NFL Writer Identifies College QB Steelers Could Draft To Pair With Mike McCarthy\n\nThe post Ex-Steelers Coach Reportedly Hired By Ohio State appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "Christen Press, who was honored by the U.S. women's soccer team before its win over Paraguay, is determined to be advocate for women's sports in retirement.",
    "fullText": "Christen Press welcomed herself to the U.S. women’s soccer team by scoring twice in her debut in the first game of 2013. The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay.\n\nIn between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in team history.\n\nBut those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for players who followed her to the national team.\n\n“Well, it's sort of the point, right?” she said ahead of Saturday’s farewell ceremony before a crowd of 19,397. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like.\n\n“It's different, and it's going to take different things for people to have success.”\n\nTalk about following in Press’ footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S. goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City’s Ally Sentnor.\n\nAnd that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay’s Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears.\n\nPress scored her final international goal in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October.\n\nThat, Press said, will continue to provide her with a link to the game.\n\n“We're so integrated into the women's sports ecosystem, through podcasts, through merchandise and through the women's soccer community,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it.\n\n“In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.”\n\nPress got her start in soccer in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, about a dozen miles from where her career officially ended Saturday in Carson. As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl.\n\n“I didn’t touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.”\n\nShe went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. With the national team she went to three Olympics, won World Cups and played a key role in the landmark lawsuit against U.S. Soccer that ended with the women earning equal pay with the men’s team.\n\nIt’s a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players.\n\n“I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. “She made a name for herself a little later. You never know when your opportunity will be. So make the most of it when it comes.”\n\nU.S. coach Emma Hayes never had a chance to work directly with Press, though she wanted to bring her overseas to Chelsea FC when Hayes managed there and Press was looking to move to the Women’s Super League.\n\n“I’ve always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. “What she’s achieved, as well-traveled as she is, what an honor to be coaching on the day she gets celebrated in her hometown.”\n\nFor Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of life to the next. And, she acknowledged, there are a few things she’s going to miss.\n\n“I am so sad that I don't play soccer anymore,” she said. “I miss training. I miss being on a team, being around young people. I miss being outside every day. I miss the grass. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.\"\n\n“I like to talk about all the things that I miss, because I think ‘I'm retired. It's easy now.’ No. I had the best job in the world. And it's an irreplaceable job.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "Blades Brown, 18, reaches dream showdown with Scottie Scheffler in final round of The American Express",
    "description": "Teenager Blades Brown shot a strong 68 on Saturday at PGA West to get the chance to battle World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and AmEx champion Si Woo Kim on Sunday for title",
    "fullText": "Have you ever fathomed Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy or Scottie Scheffler playing rock-paper-scissors with a fan at the ropes in the heat of competition? Of course not. Tiger loathed even eye contact, and Rory and Scottie offer fist bumps occasionally, but most of the great players covet trying to stay in some kind of zone.\n\nThen again, none of them had quite the youthful verve of Blades Brown, nor did they have a chance to embrace the moment while being 18 years old and contending into Sunday of a $9.2 million PGA Tour event.\n\nIn the midst of birdieing his final three holes—the last two coming at a combined 72 feet— to finish a round of four-under-par 68 in the third round of The American Express, Brown strode down to the island 17th green at the PGA West Stadium Course. When a boy not much younger than him approached the rope line and gestured to play Rock-Paper-Scissors, Brown took the bait—and kept with it as they walked through five rounds, before Blades won with a “rock.”\n\nOf course he won. That’s the kind of surreal week the recent high school graduate from Nashville is having in California’s Coachella Valley. In only his 10th PGA Tour start after making his debut here a year ago, Brown backed up his course-record 60 on the Nicklaus Course on Friday with strong round in gusty conditions on the hardest course in the three-venue rotation, and he’ll return at the Stadium on Sunday morning to compete in the final threesome with Scheffler, the World No. 1 who is gunning for his 20th career victory, and past AmEx champion Si Woo Kim.\n\nKim leads at 22 under after shooting 66 on Saturday at La Quinta Country Club, while Brown and Scheffler (68) are a shot back after Scheffler needed to make a long par putt on the 18th to reach the anchor group.\n\nAt stake for Brown is his opportunity to become the second-youngest player with an official win on the PGA Tour, while no one ever has pulled off what he could—lifting a trophy after playing eight consecutive days across two tours. Brown flew to Palm Springs on Wednesday after the final round of the Korn Ferry Tour’s event in the Bahamas, where he tied for 17th.\n\n“I’m having fun out there,” Brown said. “I’m 18 years old playing on the PGA Tour. How awesome is that? I finished high school about two weeks ago, so it’s nice to have that burden off my back. But I’m really looking forward to tomorrow.”\n\nIf Brown, who is ranked 485th in the world, is feeling any nerves, he certainly isn’t showing it. He definitely had to practice patience on Pete Dye’s challenging Stadium layout—there wasn’t going to be an eight-under start through seven holes like on Friday on the Nicklaus Course. Brown birdied Nos. 5 and 6 but bogeyed 7 and then parred eight straight holes.\n\nA chip to close range gave him a birdie at the par-5 16th, and then Brown’s putter caught fire. After nearly hitting his tee shot too long into the water at the “Aclatraz” green at 17 and engaging with that kid at the ropes, he rolled in a 25-foot birdie. At 18, Brown piped a 268-yard tee shot into the middle of the fairway and hit his approach to 43 feet. Again, he put a calm and perfect stroke on his ball for birdie. In the round, Brown made 128 feet of putts.\n\n“Hooped two putts coming in, and that was cool,” Brown said with a smile.\n\nWhat makes Brown’s performance this week particularly surprising is that after turning pro at 17 years old in late 2024, he has not been a consistent contender in tournaments. He played 14 times on the KFT last season and had two top-10s—though one of those was a T-2 in April’s Veritex Championship, where he tied for second after opening with a 61.\n\nHe made his PGA Tour debut as a pro in The AmEx last year and missed the cut. There would be four more missed weekends over another seven starts, with a pair of T-34s as Brown’s best results.\n\nAt this point, Brown is still trying to build on all of his experiences.\n\n“I think if I can take every single competitive professional tournament round and learn something from it; you just keep stacking those day after day it's going to be a really cool story,” Brown said. “So that's one thing that I tried to do is I try to learn from every round. And yeah, last year was a little unfortunate, but I learned from it. I think that's what you have to do.”\n\nScheffler, 29. has his own strong motivations to win his first AmEx. If he can snatch his 20th victory, the Texan will be the second-youngest to reach the milestone and in the second-fastest time at 151 starts. Woods tops both categories.\n\nScheffler seemingly could have the lead going into Sunday, given how how many scoring opportnities he gave hiimsel on the Stadium. But down the final stretch alone, he missed a 13-foot birdie putt at 15, an 18-foot eagle attempt at 16 and a 22-footer for birdie at 17.\n\nScheffler was ultimately fortunate to get into Sunday's final group after he missed the green from the middle of the fairway. His difficult sidehill chip motored 25 feet past the hole, but Scheffler drained the putt for par.\n\nIn his post-round interview, Kim asked with interest if he was playing with Scheffler on Sunday, and at the time it was uncertain as Scheffler finished up. It was clear that Kim, a four-time PGA Touur winner who is ranked 42nd in the world, was eager to get that draw.\n\n\"Hopefully playing with Scottie, and we can have some fun,\" Kim said. \"Just not thinking about trying to win or trying to finish, just enjoy the round. That's my goal.\"\n\nKim, 30, became the youngest winner of the Players Championship when he won in 2017, and it would take him another four years for the next victory—a one-shot triumph over Patrick Cantlay in The AmEx. Kim's last win came in the 2023 Sony Open in Hawaii.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe world of college basketball is changing. Through loopholes, players who have gone on to play professional basketball — though not in the NBA — have found ways to return to college and tap into unused eligibility.\n\nOne such player is Alabama’s Charles Bediako. If you recognize the name, it may be because the 7-foot center spent two seasons with the Crimson Tide from 2021 to 2023. After the conclusion of the 2022–23 season, he declared for the NBA Draft.\n\nBediako wasn't selected but has played in three seasons of the G League, with three different teams. He has now cited that he made a career mistake by leaving college, especially given how the NIL landscape has shifted. Bediako pointed toward international players who never made the NBA, being able to use their unused eligibility after playing overseas, and a temporary injunction was submitted, giving him permission to suit up once again for the Crimson Tide on Saturday, January 24.\n\nHere is more on the controversial Bediako, and his return to Alabama after leaving the Crimson Tide for the G League.\n\nSN's NCAAB HQ: Scores | Schedule | Standings | Latest Polls\n\nBediako is a 7-ft. center. He is a solid player, but his college stats from his first stint at Alabama suggest that he is fine, not great. From 2021 to 2023 he averaged 6.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 19.3 minutes per game in 70 games. The Crimson Tide may use him more now if he has developed from his time in the G League, but it isn't like Alabama is getting back a former No. 1 overall pick.\n\nCharles Bediako takes the floor for warmups to a warm welcome from the student section pic.twitter.com/zhrE1DI3ZH\n\n— Katie Windham (@katiewindham_) January 24, 2026\n\nBediako played 46 games in the G League between 2023 and 2025. In that span, he averaged 21.3 minutes per game with 8.4 points and 8.0 rebounds. Bediako played better in the G League than he did at Alabama during his first stint, but it remains to be seen how his game will translate back to college.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game G League stats.\n\nHere is a look at Bediako's per-game college stats from his first stint with the Crimson Tide.\n\nNo. Bediako was not drafted. He opted to leave Alabama after the 2022-2023 season, but he went undrafted. Bediako signed with the San Antonio Spurs' G League team.\n\nMORE: Why is Bediako allowed to return to college basketball?\n\nIn the 2021 class, 247Sports had Bediako ranked as the No. 35 player in the nation. He was considered the sixth-best center as well as the seventh-best player from Florida.\n\nAmong centers, he was ranked behind Chet Holmgren, Jalen Duren, Efton Reid, Nate Bittle and Enoch Boakye. In Florida, he was ranked behind Duren, Caleb Houstan, Moussa Diabate, Reid, Bittle, Tamar Bates and Benny Williams.\n\nBediako was born in Ontario, Canada, on March 10, 2002. As college — and potentially professional — basketball became an option, he began to move around.\n\nHe started his high school career at Ridley College in Ontario before transferring to Andrews Osborne Academy in Willoughby, Ohio. Bediako later transferred again, spending the remainder of his high school career at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nBediako was born on March 10, 2002. He is 23 years old, and will turn 24 years old ahead of the 2026 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the slim win over the Washington Wizards, the Charlotte Hornets have now won four of their last six games and only find themselves ten games below .500 at 18-28.\n\nTwo of those wins came against some of the best teams in the NBA, including the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Lakers, on the road as they finally attempt to change the organization's long-term landscape.\n\nThe young talent with star potential that Charlotte possesses is what makes them stand out as a team that could become a solid team in the future, especially with players such as LaMelo Ball, Kon Knueppel, Brandon Miller, etc.\n\nMore: These stats prove why the Charlotte Hornets' success is likely to continue\n\nIn fact. Miller has been a massive reason for the Hornets' recent success, scoring at least 20 points in the last six games and averaging 23.7 points per game with a 65.3 true shooting percentage.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Miller began to take those next steps in his career and prove why the Hornets selected him with their second overall draft pick in 2023. After averaging 21 points last season, Miller is already at 20 points this season, with about two full months of the season remaining.\n\nOn Saturday, Miller nearly recorded a triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists while missing only four shots, and that speaks to the progression Miller has made not only individually but also in his impact on winning and getting his teammates involved.\n\nThe Hornets are 15-14 when Miller is on the court, but only 3-14 when he isn't, and that in itself should serve as the primary indication of just how valuable the young star is to the hive.\n\nWarriors, Bucks among teams interested in Hornets' Miles Bridges\n\nBrandon Miller admits how the Hornets can bridge the gap against the better teams\n\nESPN analyst's top ranked rookie may surprise you\n\nLaMelo Ball gets coach's plaudits for his performances beyond the offensive play\n\nHornets have engaged in trade talks surrounding Karl-Anthony Towns",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers and Tarik Skubal are staring at a number that has never existed in an arbitration hearing before.\n\nSkubal’s side filed at $32 million for the 2026 season. The Tigers countered at $19 million. That $13 million spread is not just large, it’s unprecedented. No arbitration case in MLB history has featured anything close to that kind of gap, and no player has ever been awarded a salary anywhere near $32 million through the process.\n\nYet, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan, history may be about to bend.\n\nPassan’s argument centers on one simple truth: Skubal isn’t just elite, he’s in rare, historic territory.\n\n“Even if the comparables are in Detroit’s favor, even if a $32 million award would smash the previous high awarded in a room by more than $12 million, Skubal is the first American Leaguer to win consecutive Cy Young Awards since Pedro Martinez in 1999-2000.”\n\nThat kind of resume changes how cases are viewed. Passan continued:\n\n“And in a world where lesser pitchers get $30 million-plus a season and Skubal can compare his salary to any in MLB, his performance, the best pitcher in baseball — will be enough to carry the day.”\n\nIn other words, precedent matters, but dominance matters more. Skubal’s back-to-back Cy Youngs place him in a category that very few pitchers in modern history have ever occupied.\n\nEven with logic, numbers, and awards on his side, Passan made it clear that nothing is guaranteed in the arbitration room.\n\n“Arbitration hearing rooms are notorious for their unpredictability,” Passan wrote. “Lawyers who have argued cases have left the room convinced they’d made airtight arguments — and lost. Others were despondent in the aftermath, certain of defeat, and emerged victorious.”\n\n“Which is to say that whatever approach Tarik Skubal’s team takes in trying to convince a three-person panel that he’s worthy of the $32 million he’s seeking instead of the $19 million the Detroit Tigers are offering, the ultimate result is a crapshoot.”\n\nThat uncertainty is what makes this case so fascinating — and potentially historic.\n\nBeyond the legal drama, this standoff sends a message. Skubal is the face of the franchise, the best pitcher in baseball, and the foundation of Detroit’s contention window. Filing at $19 million while he seeks $32 million creates a tension that goes far beyond one season’s paycheck.\n\nWhether the panel sides with Skubal or the Tigers, the outcome will ripple into future extension talks, trade rumors, and how the organization is viewed by its own superstar.\n\nOne way or another, Skubal will take the mound in 2026 as a Cy Young winner. The only question is whether he’ll do it as the most highly paid arbitration player in MLB history.\n\nThe post MLB Insider Predicts Outcome for Tarik Skubal Arbitration Case With Detroit Tigers appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "The University of Utah was a sizable underdog going into its second matchup of the season against rival BYU on Saturday at the Marriott Center, but the Runnin’ Utes made the Cougars work for the win.\n\nFor 25 minutes, Utah bucked those odds and kept things close with BYU — until a decisive second-half run was enough to give the No. 13 Cougars some breathing room in an eventual 91-78 win.\n\nThat makes it five straight losses for the Utes in Provo, with their last win in the series at the Marriott Center coming in 2014.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the loss that dropped Utah to 9-11 overall and 1-5 in Big 12 play.\n\nUtes coach Alex Jensen talks a lot about avoiding 2-3 minute lulls, something that consistently plagues Utah as it goes through a transition year.\n\nOutside of their win over TCU when Jensen said the team didn’t have many peaks and valleys, the Utes are prone to stretches of high and low play.\n\nIn the case of the rivalry game, the most critical lull came in the second half after Utah had climbed to within 55-53.\n\nThe Utes went over three minutes before their next bucket and fell behind eight before Keanu Dawes hit a 3.\n\nFrom there, BYU further extended its lead out to a game-high 13, at 69-56, as part of a 14-3 run over a five and a half-minute stretch.\n\nOne of the reasons Utah was able to stick around for so long Saturday was its ability to connect from 3-point range.\n\nThe Utes made 5 of 11 from 3 in the first half, then hit their first five in the second half.\n\nFor the game, Utah hit 13 of 21 3-pointers and 8 of 10 in the second half.\n\nDawes, who led the Utes with 23 points, made four of those 3-pointers, while Terrence Brown had 22 points and four 3-pointers of his own.\n\nThe Utes “held” BYU’s freshman sensation, AJ Dybantsa, to 23 points in the first game between these two schools two weeks ago.\n\nThis time, though, Dybantsa had a career game.\n\nHe finished with a career-high 43 points, shooting 15 of 24 from the field.\n\nHis back-to-back 3-pointers, the second coming with 3:12 to play, sealed Dybantsa breaking the school freshman record for points in a game.\n\nBehind Dybantsa’s dominance, the Cougars outscored Utah 48-14 in the paint.",

    "title": "If Aaron Rodgers wants to play, Steelers' hire of Mike McCarthy reboots an option for the QB",
    "description": "Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real. But burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "description": "WRC crews tackled a portion of the F1 Monaco GP circuit for the first time since 2008",
    "fullText": "The return of World Rally Championship cars tackling Monaco’s famous Grand Prix circuit has proved a hit with drivers who wish the initiative to become a more permanent fixture in the future.\n\nMonaco’s famous circuit echoed to the sound of WRC for the first time since 2008 as a shortened version of the Formula 1 track played host to a 2.65km super special stage for this year’s Monte Carlo Rally.\n\nThe event has previously held a stage utilising the grand prix circuit in the 2007 and 2008 editions of the rally. Subaru’s Chris Atkinson and Ford’s François Duval famously clocked identical fastest times when the Monaco circuit last featured as part of a stage in 2008.\n\nThis year’s edition witnessed crowds flocking to the circuit despite inclement weather to watch the WRC’s elite complete a stage constructed using the start/finish straight and harbour area of the circuit.\n\nRacing Bulls Formula 1 driver Liam Lawson was in attendance, with the Kiwi afforded several runs of the stage driving a Ford Puma Rally1 car before the stage was live. Hyundai’s Adrien Fourmaux won the stage by 0.7s from Toyota’s Takamoto Katsuta.\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg survives with healthy lead intact\n\nThe WRC hosting super special stages in city centres bringing the rally to the fans is nothing new, but holding such a stage in such an iconic venue such as the Monaco Grand Prix circuit is an initiative that many in the severe park feels is important to grow the category.\n\nThe promotion of the WRC has been a hot topic in recent years, with the subject thrust back into the spotlight as the championship welcomes a new commercial rights holder and owner. From a manufacturer’s perspective, the exposure is crucial.\n\n“This is what we need to have in the WRC. Even though the weather is like this, it is full of people and there is a great atmosphere, and this kind of thing we need to have. Bringing it to the people,\" said Toyota team principal Jari-Matti Latvala.\n\nHyundai’s Thierry Neuville echoed Latvala’s sentiment and is hopeful the stage will return at future Monte Carlo WRC rounds.\n\n“It was cool and well done to the organisers and the organisation, and this is what rallying needs as well. The crowds are there, and the show was good despite the disastrous weather conditions. I think it is something they should do again,” Neuville told Motorsport.com.\n\n“I think we need to go to the crowds. This is something I enjoy when it is something nice like a historical circuit. It makes it even more special.”\n\nHis teammate Adrien Fourmaux added: “It was quite cool to drive on the circuit and I think it is a really good initiative to drive in Monaco because I feel for a few years now the fans in Monaco are not following the rally so much because they just have the start and the finish here. Now we can give them a show, the car the noise and the atmosphere.\n\n“I think we should do the whole track — one lap,\" he smiled.\n\nSuper special stages are usually not among drivers favourites when it comes to WRC events, but M-Sport-Ford’s Josh McErlean went as far as saying that the Monaco stage was “massive for the sport.”\n\n“It is quite bananas to think where you are at and what you are doing. The stage was obviously quite difficult for us on slick tyres and the cobbles were extremely slippy,” said McErlean.\n\n“It is a nice way to end the day and for the sport it is massive. It is what it needs and hopefully more cities and towns can do things like this.”\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg survives with healthy lead intact\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg in control, as Elfyn Evans holds off Sebastien Ogier\n\nWRC Monte Carlo: Oliver Solberg moves clear of rivals after nine stages\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

UFC 324 is the first show of the Paramount+ era and the first numbered event that is not a PPV in the United States (you’ve still got to pony up extra for it in Canada, the U.K. and most other places).\n\nUFC 324’s main event is Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett for the interim Lightweight title. The interim 155-pound strap is in play since Ilia Topuria has gone on hiatus to deal with some issues in his personal life.\n\nMuch has been said about the worthiness of these two fighters for this title (like this), especially when Arman Tsarukyan is being left out in the cold. Gaethje is coming off a win over Rafael Fiziev back in March 2025. That was his first fight since his epic UFC 300 knockout loss to Max Holloway in 2024 (relive that here). Pimblett’s last fight was his drubbing of Michael Chandler. Pimblett is on a long win streak in UFC, but his last half-dozen opponents have all been on the wrong side of 35.\n\nThe co-main event was supposed to be Kayla Harrison vs. Amanda Nunes for Harrison’s Bantamweight title, a title Nunes had held for a record time. However, that fight was cancelled after it was revealed that Harrison was requiring neck surgery (details here). That fight has now been shelved, possibly indefinitely.\n\nSean O’Malley vs. Song Yadong has been promoted to the co-main slot. Those two will be hoping to get another fight with Petr Yan, this time with a title on the line.\n\nRounding out the main card is Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis, Arnold Allen vs. Jean Silva and Natalia Silva vs. Rose Namajunas.\n\nUFC 324’s “Prelims” have some interesting match-ups, including super prospect Ateba Gautier taking on Andrey Pulyaev, among others.\n\nWell, this is easy — so long as you are in the United States.\n\nYou can watch all of UFC 324 with Paramount+. The Early Prelims start at 5:30 p.m. ET. The Late Prelims start at 7 p.m. ET. and the Main Card kicks off at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nI will be providing live play-by-play, instant results, highlights and updates for all the fights right here starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.\n\nSee you then!

Perez caught him with a massive left hook and dropped him. Johnson was in survival mode from that moment on. Perez stayed patient and followed up with knees and another big hook to finally bring about the TKO. That’s a massive win for Perez, but also a very big stumble for Johnson.\n\nALEX PEREZ JUST KEPT COMING\n\n📺 @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/pxTZratdzH\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nJosh Hokit vs. Denzel Freeman: Hokit’s levels of athleticism and activity are very rare quantities in Heavyweight MMA. He had all that on display while whooping on Freeman, the best opponent he’s ever faced. He out wrestled him and lit him up on the feet to earn his second first round finish in a row (albeit in strange fashion with referee Mark Smith calling an end to it after he saw Freeman was exhausted and struggling to stay on his feet). Hokit also took the opportunity to taunt Freeman multiple times during the fight.\n\nJosh Hokit stops Denzel Freeman pic.twitter.com/ISC7ircCrO\n\n— MMA Mania (@mmamania) January 24, 2026\n\nAdam Fugitt vs. Ty Miller: This was a competitive striking affair for much of the round until Miller found a way through with some big shots.

    "fullText": "I recently launched Trivet, and I've enjoyed seeing people install it on websites ranging from personal homepages to business blogs.\n\nBefore AI, Trivet would have taken me a few weeks to build. Now, Codex wrote the first version in 40 minutes.\n\nIn the past, building software was so difficult that launching something was impressive in and of itself. But as things get easier to build, it's harder to stand out. Code has become content - abundant, disposable, something you produce rather than labor over. We've transitioned from \"make something people want\" to \"make anything you want\".\n\nFor example, I'll open-source the theme powering this site. A few years ago, this would have represented a lot of work. There would have been utility for people making their own templates. Instead, today it's a footnote - a curiosity for those who want to \"view source\" on this website and see how it works.\n\nAs a maker, AI enables me to build more and faster than I ever could have dreamed. But projects are no longer the investment they used to be. I find myself with decision fatigue - I ask \"what should I build next?\" every few days, instead of every few months. In the age of AI, it's harder to think of a \"big project\" to work on slowly in my free time.\n\nWith code getting easier, I find myself thinking more about data. My old coworker Jason posted a video about using Claude Code to organize his notes. There's so much useful knowledge spread out across many sources. People know Claude for writing code, but its superpower is searching and understanding thousands of files.\n\nWhen I went to Japan last year, I wanted to ask \"what is every Tokyo coffee shop and jazz kissa mentioned on craigmod.com,\" but I couldn't. That desire led me to build Contraption MCP - so I could have a research agent over my writing. The first time I used it and got a real answer synthesized from years of posts, it felt like a new kind of utility - a digital proprioception enabling me to fluidly navigate and explore my writing.\n\nExploring information is still a hard problem in the age of AI. MCP is useful, but more of a technical protocol. \"RSS for AI,\" as Stan summarized to me.\n\nThe next project I'm contemplating is codenamed \"Bell\" — a search agent for this blog, built on top of the Contraption MCP. I want it to be more accessible than raw MCP: something you can use in a browser, drawing on a variety of sources. It could answer questions like \"which craft-focused books are mentioned on this blog,\" but also \"how does subscriber export work on Postcard.\" Part of the motivation for Bell is building software for myself. But, the other part is continuing to explore the future of digital tools through making projects.\n\nSo, what should I build next? Two things feel true: we should default to building for ourselves, and understanding our own data is where some hard problems now live.\n\nI think the widespread impulse to take a photo of everything is in fact, at root, a creative one. It reflects a desire to not just receive life passively, but to intervene in it creatively: To frame the shot, to find the most compelling angle, to draw out the emotion, to honor the light… to participate.\n\n- This life gives you nothing, Blackbird Spyplane",

    "description": "Organizations requiring IT workers to commute to an office need to ground decisions in value creation, focus on data-driven results, and avoid badge-swipe metrics, employment experts say.",
    "fullText": "Work-from-office mandates are accelerating as the world moves further away from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the push toward in-person work environments will make it more difficult for IT leaders to retain and recruit staff, some experts say.\n\nOver the past year, many companies, including IT giants Amazon and Microsoft, have required employees to work from the office, with many other organizations mandating on-site work in previous years.\n\nNearly half of all workers, and nearly two-thirds of IT professionals, were feeling pressure from their employers to work from the office as of early 2025, according to the 2025 Technology at Work Report, released by IT security firm Ivanti.\n\nAdvocates of in-person work expect increased productivity and improved collaboration as employees work from the office, although several studies have suggested that workers can be just as productive when working remotely, and employment experts say collaboration gains can be difficult to measure.\n\nThere is value in cross-functional teams working together in person, says Lawrence Wolfe, CTO at marketing firm Converge. “When teams meet for architecture sessions, design sprints, or incident response, the pace of progress, as well as the level of clarity, may increase simply because being in-person caters to the way most people in the business interact,” he says.\n\nHowever, there are potential downsides for IT leaders, with strict work-from-office policies making it more difficult to attract and retain top IT talent. “In addition to resistance, there would also be the risk of talent turnover,” Wolfe adds. “The truth is, both physical and virtual collaboration provide tremendous value.”\n\nIvanti’s survey suggests that IT workers are skeptical of return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Eighty-three percent of IT workers surveyed say flexible work arrangements are either “high value” or “essential,” compared to 73% of office workers.\n\nMeanwhile, IT workers facing work-from-office mandates are two to three times more likely than their counterparts to look for new jobs, according to Metaintro, a search engine that tracks millions of jobs.\n\nIT leaders hiring new employees may also face significant headwinds, with it taking 40% to 50% longer to fill in-person roles than remote jobs, according to Metaintro.\n\n“Some of the challenges CIOs face include losing top-tier talent, limiting the pool of candidates available for hire, and damaging company culture, with a team filled with resentment,” says Lacey Kaelani, CEO and cofounder at Metaintro.\n\nDespite possible resistance, it makes sense for some IT jobs to be tied to an office, says Lena McDearmid, founder and CEO of culture and leadership advisory firm Wryver. Some IT roles, including device provisioning, network operations, and conference room IT support, are better done in person, she notes.\n\nShe sees some other benefits in specific situations. “In-person work is genuinely valuable for onboarding and mentoring early-career technologists, especially when learning how the organization actually operates, not just how the codebase works,” McDearmid says. “It’s also powerful when teams need to think together in high-bandwidth ways: whiteboards, war rooms, architecture reviews, incident response, or when solving messy, cross-functional problems.”\n\nThere is weaker evidence that blanket in-office mandates improve day-to-day productivity across all IT roles, she adds.\n\n“Many technologists, especially engineers, data scientists, and architects doing deep, complex work, often perform better in controlled environments with fewer interruptions,” McDearmid says. “In those cases, presence alone doesn’t create value. Purpose does.”\n\nEffective collaboration can happen remotely when teams have clear norms, strong documentation, and psychological safety, she adds. “I’ve also seen teams sitting next to each other collaborate poorly because decisions are unclear or leaders equate visibility with progress,” she says. “Collaboration doesn’t automatically improve just because people share a building.”\n\nThere are several downsides for IT leaders to in-person work mandates, McDearmid adds, as orders to commute to an office can feel arbitrary or rooted in control rather than in value creation. “That erodes trust quickly, particularly in IT teams that proved they could deliver remotely for years,” she adds.\n\nThe mandates can also create new friction for IT leaders by requiring them to deal with morale issues, manage exceptions, and spend time enforcing policy instead of leading strategy, she says.\n\n“There’s also a real risk of losing experienced, high-performing talent who have options and are unwilling to trade autonomy for proximity without a clear reason,” McDearmid adds. “When companies mandate daily commutes without a clear rationale, they often narrow their talent pool and increase attrition, particularly among people who know they can work effectively elsewhere.”\n\nInstead of asking how they can get people to work from the office, successful CIOs focus on what types of work are better when employees are together and how to intentionally plan for those scenarios, McDearmid says.\n\n“When return-to-office is aligned to real value creation, teams usually understand it,” she adds. “When it isn’t, it shows up quickly in engagement and retention.”\n\nIT leaders facing commute-to-office mandates should focus on data that measures work outcomes, not badge swipes, adds Rebecca Wettemann, CEO at IT analyst firm Valoir. CIOs can help IT teams by enabling them to automate repetitive works so they can focus on measurable outputs, she adds.\n\nIT leaders enforcing in-person work mandates can also focus on making the workplace a real place to collaborate, she adds. CIOs can align office space, meeting schedules, and in-office days so they reinforce the goals of collaboration and knowledge sharing, Wettemann adds.\n\nCIOs should look for ways to remove friction from the workplace through automation, should allow for flexibility, and should communicate how work-from-office policies are data-driven, she says.\n\n“The real danger is when RTO is a corporate mandate that isn’t aligned with the realities of the workplace, or even worse, when it’s being used as a Band-Aid for poor management,” Wettemann says. “When IT professionals feel they’re being evaluated based on badge swipes, not real accomplishments, they will either act accordingly or look to work elsewhere.”",

    "description": "A change to how Safari reports the OS it is running on led many in the media to lose their minds.",
    "fullText": "A few weeks ago there were a rash of stories claiming that iOS 26 is seeing bizarrely low adoption rates from iPhone users. The methodology behind these numbers is broken and the numbers are totally wrong. Those false numbers are so low, so jarringly different from previous years, that it boggles my mind that they didn’t raise a red flag for anyone who took a moment to consider them.\n\nThe ball started rolling with this post from Ed Hardy at Cult of Mac on January 8, “iOS 26 Still Struggles to Gain Traction With iPhone Users”, which began:\n\nOnly a tiny percentage of iPhone users have installed iOS 26,\naccording to data from a web analytics service. The adoption rate\nis far less than previous iOS versions at this same point months\nafter their releases. The data only reveals how few iPhone users\nrun Apple’s latest operating system upgrade, not why they’ve\nchosen to avoid it. But the most likely candidate is the new\nLiquid Glass look of the update. [...]\n\nRoughly four months after launching in mid-September, only about\n15% of iPhone users have some version of the new operating system\ninstalled. That’s according to data for January 2026 from\nStatCounter. Instead, most users hold onto previous versions.\n\nFor comparison, in January 2025, about 63% of iPhone users had\nsome iOS 18 version installed. So after roughly the same\namount of time, the adoption rate of Apple newest OS was about\nfour times higher.\n\nThose links point to Statcounter, a web analytics service. A lot of websites include Statcounter’s analytics tracker, and Statcounter’s tracker attempts to determine the version of the OS each visitor’s device is running. The problem is, starting with Safari 26 — the version that ships with iOS 26 — Safari changed how it reports its user agent string. From the WebKit blog, “WebKit Features in Safari 26.0”:\n\nAlso, now in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS 26 the user agent\nstring no longer lists the current version of the operating\nsystem. Safari 18.6 on iOS has a UA string of:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6 like Mac OS X)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.6\nMobile/15E148 Safari/604.1\n\nAnd Safari 26.0 on iOS has a UA string of:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6 like Mac OS X)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.0\nMobile/15E148 Safari/604.1\n\nThis matches the long-standing behavior on macOS, where the user\nagent string for Safari 26.0 is:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)\nAppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.0\nSafari/605.1.15\n\nIt was back in 2017 when Safari on Mac first started freezing the\nMac OS string. Now the behavior on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS does\nthe same in order to minimize compatibility issues. The WebKit and\nSafari version number portions of the string will continue to\nchange with each release.\n\nIn other words, Safari now reports, in its user agent string, that it’s running on iOS 18.6 when it is running on iOS 18.6, and reports that it’s running on iOS 18.6 when it’s running on iOS 26.0 or later. And it’s going to keep reporting that it’s running on iOS 18.6 forever, just like how Safari 26 on MacOS reports that it’s running on MacOS 10.15 Catalina, from 2019.\n\nStatcounter completely dropped the ball on this change, and it explains the entirety of this false narrative that iOS 26 adoption is incredibly low. (Statcounter has a “detect” page where you can see what browser and OS it thinks you’re using.) The reason they reported that 15 percent of iPhone users were using iOS 26 is probably because that’s the amount of web traffic Statcounter sees from iOS 26 web browsers that aren’t Safari (most of which, I’ll bet, are in-app browser views in social media apps).\n\nNick Heer, at Pixel Envy, wrote a good piece delving into this saga. And then he posted a follow-up item pointing out that (a) Statcounter’s CEO has acknowledged their error and they’re fixing it; and (b) Wikimedia publishes network-wide stats that serve as a good baseline. The audience for Wikipedia is, effectively, the audience for the web itself. And Wikipedia’s stats show that while iOS 26 adoption, in January 2026, isn’t absurdly low (as Statcounter had been suggesting, erroneously, and writers like Ed Hardy at Cult of Mac and David Price at Macworld foolishly regurgitated, no matter how little sense it made that the numbers would be that low), they are in fact lower than those for iOS 18 a year ago and iOS 17 two years ago. Per Wikimedia:\n\nSo, no, iOS 26 adoption isn’t at just 15 percent, which only a dope would believe, but it’s not as high as previous iOS versions in previous years at this point on the calendar. Something, obviously, is going on.\n\nDavid Smith, developer of popular apps like Widgetsmith and Pedometer++, on Mastodon:\n\nI noticed iOS 26 adoption had entered a ‘third wave’ of rapid\nadoption. So I made a graph of the relative adoption versus iOS 18\nat this point in the release cycle.\n\nWhile lower than iOS 18 at this point for my apps (65% vs. 78%),\nthe shape of this graph says to me that Apple is in full control\nof the adoption rate and can tune it to their plans. The\ncoordinated surges are Apple dialing up automatic updates.\n\nIf this surge were as long as previous ones, we’d hit the\nsaturation point very soon.\n\nWhat’s going on, quite obviously, is that Apple itself is slow-rolling the automatic updates to iOS 26. For years now Apple has steered users, via default suggestions during device setup, to adopt settings to allow OS updates to happen automatically, including updates to major new versions. Apple tends not to push these automatic updates to major new versions of iOS until two months after the .0 release in September. This year that second wave was delayed by about two weeks, and there’s now a third wave starting midway through January. It’s a different pattern from previous years — but it’s a pattern Apple controls. A large majority of users of all Apple devices get major OS updates when, and only when, their devices automatically update. Apple has been slower to push those updates to iOS 26 than they have been for previous iOS updates in recent years. With good reason! iOS 26 is a more significant — and buggier — update than iOS 18 and 17 were.\n\nPeople like you, readers of Daring Fireball, may well be hesitant to update to iOS 26, or (like me) to MacOS 26, or to any of the version 26 OS updates, because you are aware of things (like UI changes) that you are loathe to adopt.\n\nBut the overwhelming majority of Apple users — especially iPhone users — just let their devices update automatically. They might like iOS 26’s changes, they might dislike them, or they might not care or even notice. But they just let their software updates happen automatically — and they will form the entirety of their opinions regarding iOS 26 after it’s running on their iPhones.",

    "fullText": "Last year in May, the cURL project's bug bounty program was inundated with AI slop, where many bogus reports were opened on HackerOne, leaving the cURL maintainers to go through garbage.\n\nThe problem didn't stop even after Daniel Stenberg, the creator of cURL, threatened to ban anyone whose bug report was found to be AI slop. We are now in 2026, and the situation has reached a tipping point.\n\nDaniel has submitted a pull request on GitHub that removes all mentions of the bug bounty program from cURL's documentation and website. Coinciding with that, the project's security.txt file has been updated with some blunt language that makes the new policy crystal clear.\n\nThe cURL team intends to make a proper announcement in the coming days, though many outlets have already covered the news of this happening, so I would say they ought to get on it ASAP! 😆\n\nThe program officially ends in a few days on January 31, 2026. After that, security researchers can still report issues through GitHub or the project's mailing list, but there won't be any cash involved.\n\nWhat pushed them over the edge?, you ask. Well, just weeks into 2026, seven HackerOne reports came in within a 16-hour period in just one week. Some were actual bugs, but none of them were security vulnerabilities. By the time Daniel posted his recent weekly report, they'd already dealt with 20 submissions in 2026.\n\nThe main goal here is said to be stopping the flood of garbage reports. By eliminating the money incentive, they are hoping people (or bots?) will stop wasting the security team's time with half-baked, unresearched submissions.\n\nHe also gives a stern warning to wannabe AI sloppers, saying that:\n\nSo, yeah, that's that. If people still don't understand that AI slop is harmful to such sensitive pieces of software, then sure, they can go ahead and make a fool of themselves.\n\nSuggested Read 📖: Open Source Project LLVM Says Yes to AI-Generated Code",

    "title": "Cow Clicker",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Cow Clicker is an incremental social network game on Facebook developed by video game researcher Ian Bogost. The game serves as a deconstructive satire of social games. The goal of the game is to earn \"clicks\" by clicking on a sprite of a cow every six hours. The addition of friends' cows to the player's pasture allows the user to also receive \"clicks\" whenever the player's cow is clicked. A premium currency known as \"Mooney\" allows the user to purchase different cow designs and skip the six-hour interval between clicks.\n\nIn the wake of a controversial speech by Zynga's president at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, Bogost developed Cow Clicker for a presentation at a New York University seminar on social gaming in July 2010. The game was created to demonstrate what Bogost felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of social games, such as the promotion of social interaction and monetization rather than the artistic aspects of the medium. As the game unexpectedly began to grow in popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming trends, such as gamification, educational apps, and alternate reality games.\n\nSome critics praised Cow Clicker for its dissection of the common mechanics of social network games and viewed it as a commentary on how social games affect people.\n\nThe player is initially given a pasture with nine slots and a single plain cow, which the player may click once every six hours. Each time the cow is clicked, a point also known as a \"click\" is awarded; if the player adds friends' cows to their pasture, they also receive clicks added to their scores when the player clicks their own cow. As in other Facebook games, players are encouraged to post announcements to their news feed whenever they click their cow. A virtual currency known as \"Mooney\" can be bought with Facebook Credits; it can be used to purchase special \"premium\" cow designs, and the ability to skip the six-hour time limit that must be waited before the cow can be clicked again.[1][2]\n\nAt the 2010 Game Developers Conference, Zynga's game FarmVille was awarded the \"Best New Social/Online Game\" at its Game Developers Choice Awards. Ian Bogost (who was also in attendance) was critical of Zynga's success, as he felt that its business model was focused on convincing users to pay money to progress further in their \"freemium\" games rather than treating gaming as an artistic experience. He also believed Zynga's vice president Bill Mooney was trying to attack \"artistic\" gaming during his acceptance speech for the award when he personally invited independent game developers to join his company.[3] After the conference, Bogost coined the term \"cow clickers\" to describe games such as FarmVille which only involve performing tasks at certain intervals, since in these games, \"you click on a cow, and that’s all you do.\" Bogost compared the players of Zynga's games to the rats in B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning experiment, often receiving variable reinforcement rather than regular rewards. As one of the most vocal critics of Zynga's practices and business model, Bogost made further appearances at various events and panels to discuss his views on social gaming.[3]\n\nIn July 2010, Bogost was scheduled to make an appearance at a New York University seminar, \"Social Games On Trial\", to discuss the controversial aspects of social network gaming. To clearly demonstrate what he felt were the most commonly abused mechanics of these games, Bogost quickly developed a Facebook game entitled Cow Clicker. The game was designed to be a satire of what Bogost personally believed were the only points of FarmVille: to encourage users to continue playing by inviting other users into the game, and to provide incentives for those who purchase virtual goods.[3] The bulk of the code was written in three days.[4]\n\nUnexpectedly to Bogost, Cow Clicker became a viral phenomenon, amassing over 50,000 players by September 2010. In response to its sudden popularity, he committed to improving the game with new features. Updates to the game added awards for reaching certain milestones (such as the Golden Cowbell for 100,000 clicks), the ability to earn Mooney by clicking on other users' Cow Clicker news feed posts, and the chance to randomly gain or lose Mooney on every click. New cow designs were also introduced, such as an oil-coated cow to commemorate the BP oil spill, and the \"Stargrazer Cow\", which was only a mirror image of the original cow that cost around $20's worth of Mooney.[3][5]\n\nAlthough continually disturbed by its popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming and social networking trends; such as the addition of an API to allow websites to have their own clickable cows (in a process he dubbed \"Cowclickification\"), the spin-off game Cow Clicker Blitz (co-developed with PopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka), \"My First Cow Clicker\" for iOS (a parody of simplistic education apps; designed to \"train\" children on cow clicking and add the resulting clicks to their parent's total), and a \"Cow Clicktivism\" campaign where users could click on an emaciated cow to donate to Oxfam America—with a goal of donating an actual cow to a third world country. The cow, known as the \"Cowclicktivist Cow\", could also be unlocked for the player's pasture with a $110 donation.[1][3][5]\n\nIn 2011, an alternate reality game known as the \"Cow ClickARG\" was held, where a series of clues from the \"bovine gods\" eventually revealed that a \"Cowpocalypse\" would occur on July 21, 2011 (exactly one year since the original release of the game). From then on, every click made by players would deduct thirty seconds from a countdown clock leading to the Cowpocalypse. However, players could extend the countdown clock by paying to supplicate with Facebook Credits: paying 10 credits would extend the countdown by a single hour, while 4,000 would extend the countdown by an entire month.[6] After $700 worth of extensions, the countdown clock expired on the evening of September 7, 2011. At this point, the game remained playable, but all the cows were replaced by blank spaces and said to have been raptured. Bogost intended the Cowpocalypse event to signal the \"end\" of the game to players; when addressing a complaint by a fan who felt the game was no longer fun after the cow rapture, Bogost responded that \"it wasn't very fun before.\"[3][5][7]\n\nIn 2018, Bogost wrote an article for The Atlantic discussing the collection of data by Facebook apps, with reference to Cow Clicker, following a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data. Bogost notes that Facebook apps appear to be part of the website itself, whereas they actually operate with almost no oversight. He claims that \"without even trying\", Cow Clicker stored its users' Facebook ID and any networks (such as workplaces) that the user was a part of, and that this information is still stored on his private server. Bogost notes that he could have used this data for malicious purposes, criticising Facebook's \"move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development\".[4]\n\nCow Clicker received critical attention soon after its release. One early commentator was Alexia Tsotsis of TechCrunch, who acknowledged the game's intent as a commentary on the impact of social network games. In an interview, Bogost foresaw the transformation of the internet into a \"compulsive virtual dystopia\" through Zynga's use of social gaming.[2][3]\n\nNick Yee of the Palo Alto Research Center compared the players of games which do not provide \"meaningful opportunities for achievement, social interaction, and challenge\" to rats in a Skinner box. Accordingly, he compared Cow Clicker to being inside an \"incredibly clear Skinner box\"—acknowledging how little effort the game took in order to keep users playing the game. Jason Tanz of Wired considered Cow Clicker as an example of the growth in the trend of gamification—where developers introduce elements influenced by games into their services without providing the normal \"experience\" a game traditionally incorporates.[3]\n\nPopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka praised Cow Clicker for being the type of \"ironic, satirical, self-referential\" game that Facebook's game ecosystem was lacking, as he felt there were too many commercially driven games on the social network. Playdom's Scott Jon Siegel criticized the game for not going far enough in its satire, and putting too many highlights on the \"absurd monetisation practices and meaningless clicking which social games are all too well known for.\"[1]\n\nThe game Cookie Clicker was developed by Julien Thiennot in 2013. Bogost describes as it as Cow Clicker's \"logical conclusion\".[8]",

    "fullText": "Tries: Cunningham-South Cons: Smith\n\nTries: Hamer-Webb, Van Poortvliet, Steward, Blamire, Perese Cons: Searle 3 Pens: Searle\n\nJack van Poortvliet delivered a timely reminder to England coach Steve Borthwick as he finalises Six Nations plans with a stunning solo try as Leicester Tigers cruised past struggling Harlequins.\n\nThe Tigers scrum-half produced a moment of quality at The Stoop in a match that the visitors dominated from start to finish, his solo effort in the first half the pick of the visitors' five tries.\n\nGabriel Hamer-Webb, Freddie Steward, Jamie Blamire and Izaia Perese scored the others as the visitors ran roughshod over a Quins outfit with a bonus point win to move into fourth place in the Prem table.\n\nChandler Cunningham-South ensured that the home side did not suffer a second shutout of the season with a late try to save blushes, but it was nowhere near enough to avoid a fifth straight defeat in the Prem for Jason Gilmore's struggling outfit.\n\nUncapped Sela called up for England Six Nations tilt\n\nBears edge past Chiefs in rainstorm to go third\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nVan Poortvliet was one of the brighter lights in a dominant display and he will be hoping a slight niggle which saw him limp from the field halfway through the second half does not continue his bad luck with England.\n\nThe 24-year-old scored the try which won the series against Argentina last summer only for his chances of a place in Borthwick's autumn squad to be spoiled by a shoulder injury.\n\nHe also missed out on the 2023 World Cup after hurting his ankle in a warm-up game against Wales the month before the tournament.\n\nBorthwick may well be keeping his fingers crossed, too, after a confident display included an early assist with a long pass to Hamer-Webb, who went over unchallenged for a debut Tigers try.\n\nYet it was Van Portvliet's kick and collect after a neatly worked short line-out routine that proved a cut above.\n\nAfter gathering the ball and racing down the right flank he stepped off his right boot to jink inside what was left of the Quins defence before going over.\n\nTop-to-bottom Quins issues 'not a quick fix' - Care\n\nQuins look to be lacking in confidence as much as anything and had their own chance to level at 7-7 after Cadan Murley broke the Tigers defensive line only for Bryn Bradley to fumble the final pass with the line beckoning.\n\nIt appeared to sum up where they are at the moment, certainly on the domestic front where none of their decent European form (they thrashed La Rochelle in the Champions Cup to finish second in their pool) seems to be rubbing off.\n\nFrom Bradley's mistake things only got worse for the home side with Van Poortvliet's effort, a Billy Searle penalty and a penalised high tackle from winger Nick David ensuring Quins went in 17-0 and a man down at the break.\n\nWhile the home side held out while David was in the bin, Steward broke through the dual attentions of Sam Riley and Elliot Williams just after the hour to make it 22-0, Searle's boot adding the extras.\n\nBlamire and Perese came off the bench to add to Quins pain with a short range power and long range speed finishes before Cunningham-South's outstretched arm through a sea of limbs at least got them on the scoreboard at the death.\n\nMore worrying for Quins management was the fact that a significant number of home fans were not there to see it, having already departed after seeing enough of a side who remain second from bottom on just 10 points after 10 games.\n\nHarlequins head coach Jason Gilmore said:\n\n\"Our fans have been brilliant. We had a sold-out Stoop today but I can understand their feelings. They are loyal to the team and club. We need to give them something to enjoy on the field.\n\n\"It's not skillset, it's mindset. We went on the back foot pretty quickly and couldn't turn things around. We must see to what steps we need to put in place to regain that mindset.\n\n\"We need to build a squad which can hold out under fire.\"\n\nLeicester head coach Geoff Parling told BBC Radio Leicester:\n\n\"Twelve of our lads had e.coli when they got back from South Africa last weekend and four of our staff so I didn't let any of those into the training building on Tuesday as we didn't want to infect anybody.\n\n\"But the group has proved to be very adaptable and this was a fine win.\n\n\"I was a bit frustrated at the end that we let them in for that try but that was a great performance overall. The pack worked hard for each other, it was very windy and conditions were quite hard but I am very pleased with what we did.\n\n\"Jack van Poortvliet was excellent today. He's had some injuries which have not helped him at certain times. His speed of delivery is good and he's a top-notch number nine. He showed what he can do with that try, too.\n\n\"He came off [with an injury] but hopefully it is just a dead leg. He is going to get it scanned and hopefully it is not too serious.\n\n\"The league doesn't lie. We are obviously not at the very top and there are things we can improve on to really push on. But we work hard for each other, look organised and are growing our game gradually.\"\n\nHarlequins: Green, David, Northmore, Bradley, Murley, Smith, Friday; Kerrod, Walker, Delgado, Treadwell, Petti, Cunningham-South, Kenningham, Dombrandt\n\nReplacements: Riley, Hobson, E Williams, T Williams, Driscoll, Lawday, Green, Evans\n\nLeicester: Steward, Hamer-Webb, Wand, Bailey, Hassell-Collins, Searle, van Poortvliet; Smith, Clare, Heyes, Henderson, Chessum, Liebenberg, Reffell, Ilione\n\nReplacements: Blamire, van der Flier, Hurd, Moro, Cracknell, Allan, O'Connor, Perese",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola needed to shake things up after his weary Manchester City side began to flag this season and Omar Marmoush served a reminder of his talent after the Spaniard dropped two of his key players to the bench on Saturday.\n\nStar striker Erling Haaland's prolific form has ground to a halt, while Phil Foden has also looked a shadow of his usual self in recent games as City have fallen back in the Premier League title race.\n\nManager Guardiola felt the meeting with bottom side Wolves was the ideal time to give the duo a rest and his decision to put them on the bench was vindicated.\n\nMarmoush, 26, had to stand up after starting in place of Haaland and the Egyptian showed how vital a role he can play in the remainder of this season by scoring his first top-flight goal of the campaign in the 2-0 victory.\n\n\"Last season when he arrived he was unbelievable for two or three months,\" said Guardiola. \"Without him it would have been impossible to achieve qualification for the Champions League or reach the FA Cup final.\n\n\"He is a special player, not old, not young, but has margin to improve and a sense of goal [with] dynamic energy in his runs, which is really good.\n\n\"I see him more as a striker than a proper winger but he is a guy for transition actions. I am so happy for him.\"",

    "fullText": "Bristol Bears leapfrogged Exeter Chiefs to move up to third in the Prem table with a hard-fought 8-3 win in appalling conditions at Sandy Park.\n\nWith the rain teeming down, the first half was largely punctuated by handling errors and referee Karl Dickson's whistle, with neither side able to get points on the board until Henry Slade's penalty just before the half-hour mark.\n\nThe game's only try then came through Noah Heward's sliding effort, after Olly Woodburn was unable to gather the ball as half-time approached.\n\nIn what had looked increasingly like a scoreless second half, James Williams' late penalty condemned Rob Baxter's men to their first home defeat of the season.\n\nIn a match that was meant to herald the long-awaited returns of Bears stalwarts Steven Luatua and Gabriel Ibitoye, all the focus was on the conditions, with neither team able to produce the running rugby so desired by both fan bases.\n\nBarely able to see through the rain, both sides adopted a hard yards and box kicking approach in the first half, one that failed to deliver any real attacking momentum for either until the dying moments of the first half.\n\nIt was Slade who stepped up, converting a penalty, minutes after Tom Jordan had squandered a similar opportunity for Bristol at the other end.\n\nIn a game desperately crying out for points, Slade was then forced to dot the ball down under his own posts after Woodburn's mishandling led to the ball squirming out on the liquid surface.\n\nFrom the ensuing scrum, Bristol eventually capitalised.\n\nSlade was lucky not to be penalised when he knocked on as he attempted to intercept a pass meant for Matias Moroni deep in the Chiefs' 22.\n\nBut Louis Rees-Zammit was able to pick up the ball and find space on the outside to feed Heward, who slid in for what turned out to be the only try of the game.\n\nWith the rain easing as the second half began, Exeter drove up into the Bears' 22, but were unable to break through the impervious Bristol defence, eventually being penalised after Gabriel Oghre had stolen the ball back.\n\nSlade then had the chance to put Exeter ahead for the first time, but his penalty from the halfway line drifted agonisingly wide.\n\nThe Chiefs had the majority of the ball but were unable to capitalise and it was the Bears who looked most like scoring when Rees-Zammit counter-attacked, only for his grubber kick forward to drift long, allowing Woodburn to recover.\n\nThe home side then paid for their profligacy.\n\nSlade's up and under was charged down in midfield, forcing the England centre to dive on the loose ball before being penalised for holding on.\n\nWilliams then made no mistake, slotting the ensuing penalty through the posts as Bristol left Sandy Park sodden, but victorious.\n\nThe result leaves Exeter in fifth on 35 points, following Leicester's 34-7 win over Harlequins.\n\nVan Poortvliet shines as Leicester dominate Quins\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nBristol Bears' director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Radio Bristol:\n\n\"The beauty of the weather is that it was black and white, we had to roll our sleeves up and commit to everything.\n\n\"The physicality, the getting up off the ground, making another tackle, the defensive sets we had were brilliant, not just to defend but also not to give away penalties.\n\n\"We're really showing that we can win in lots of ways - there is more to this team than just throwing the ball around.\n\n\"To win eight games out of the last nine is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.\"\n\nExeter Chiefs' director of rugby Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:\n\n\"We made quite a lot of errors, there's a lot of things for us to look at that we could've done better, but the Bears made a lot of errors as well.\n\n\"In a very tight game, they probably shaded the areas that win and lose games. Their mistakes hurt them less than ours did.\n\n\"We didn't quite finish things off, they defended their line really strongly, we weren't quite good enough today, let's move on.\"\n\nExeter: Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Haydon-Wood, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Chapman; Sio, Dweba, Tchumbadze; Jenkins (c), Zambonin, Hooper, Roots, Fisilau.\n\nReplacements: Yeandle, Goodrick-Clarke, Roots, Pearson, Capstick, Cairns, Hammersley, Ridl.\n\nBristol: Rees-Zammit; Heward, Moroni, Janse van Rensburg, Ravouvou; Jordan, Randall; Genge, Oghre, Kloska; Rubiolo, Batley, Luatua, Harding (c), Mata.\n\nReplacements: Thacker, Lahiff, Halliwell, Owen, Grondona, Marmion, Williams, Ibitoye.",

    "description": "Final Score EFL pundit Sam Parkin reflects on the highs and lows after Saturday's action.",
    "fullText": "After another dramatic Saturday turned up plenty of action, former Swindon, Ipswich and Luton striker and BBC Final Score pundit Sam Parkin gives his takeaways from what we learned across the Championship and rest of the EFL.\n\nThere were two 4-0 wins in the early games in the Championship on Saturday as Middlesbrough showed their promotion credentials by thumping Preston North End while Millwall swept aside Charlton Athletic at The Den to keep pace at the top.\n\nParkin: \"I thought the Middlesbrough game would be tighter against a Preston team who's had a really good season, but I think the recent form played out really.\n\n\"That's a fourth win in a row for Middlesbrough, and Preston have lost their past four and they're struggling to find the net.\n\n\"I thought if there was a flaw in their set-up in comparison to the other top teams - namely Coventry City and Ipswich Town - it might be the amount of goals that they're likely to score.\n\n\"But it's really timely that Tommy Conway has started scoring and Morgan Whittaker's made an incredible difference as well.\n\n\"They're in a brilliant place at the moment. They're playing some great football and they've come through a tough week with some tough games by winning at Stoke and beating Preston so convincingly, which is not to be sniffed at.\n\n\"For Millwall, I think it's the most depth they've had in recent years with loads of exciting attacking players.\n\n\"They've been able to get Macaulay Langstaff and Josh Coburn in the line-up together, and Aziz has had an incredible season as well and played a part in their first goal.\n\n\"They've got a great opportunity this year, probably the best opportunity they've had in recent times to get in the play-offs and potentially the Premier League.\"\n\nOff the back of Middlesbrough's early win against Preston, Ipswich were stunned by Sheffield United, who were reduced to 10 men late on, as they lost ground on the Championship automatic promotion places.\n\nParkin: \"I think it was always going to be a tough game for Ipswich today at Sheffield United. They've got a few players missing through injury and they've got a massive month ahead.\n\n\"That's the only thing I can see derailing Ipswich - they've got to play seven games in February with the FA Cup and a rearranged game.\n\n\"So the squad will be tested. I think they've probably got the numbers to do it, but when, comparatively, some teams would play five or six games [in February] it does have a little bit of an effect.\n\n\"They're going to have to deal with a fixture pile-up but the way they're going, especially at Portman Road, I don't think today's result will affect them too much.\n\n\"I still have Ipswich probably just slightly out in front of Middlesbrough, which sounds strange speaking after such a convincing Boro win and a disappointing afternoon for Ipswich, but I just think that depth will prevail in the long run.\n\n\"Sheffield United have picked up under Chris Wilder and they'll probably be looking at the table tonight and thinking that potentially they could go on a run and make it in the play-offs themselves with so many games to play for.\"\n\nWrexham moved sixth in the Championship table courtesy of their comeback win at QPR. Phil Parkinson led the Hollywood-owned club to three promotions in a row, and a morale-boosting win in the capital will have their fans dreaming of a remarkable four from four as they barged into the play-off picture.\n\nParkin: \"Wrexham are in great form at the moment. With 10 minutes to go it looked like they were going to leave with nothing from QPR, so to turn it around and sneak into the top six tonight, that'll be a great journey home for the supporters and the players.\n\n\"I think the reality of the situation is, with that cluster of teams that are hoping to get into the play-offs, they've got the financial backing to add a few more players at the end of the window.\n\n\"They've got a quality squad as it is but if they could add a couple of savvy signings then we could be talking about another promotion or at least another play-off campaign, which would be absolutely incredible.\n\n\"I think everyone probably had maybe Birmingham slightly in front of where Wrexham were at the start of the season in terms of their potential in the Championship, so it's flip-flopped a little bit in their favour.\n\n\"But as we see in so many seasons, that final play-off position, even though it seems a long way away, seems open for someone, and why not Wrexham? They've certainly got the squad to do it.\"\n\nWigan certainly needed a boost having strayed close to the League One drop zone after a chastening home loss to Bolton Wanderers last week. Latics boss Ryan Lowe said Saturday's trip to fellow strugglers Doncaster Rovers was not a six-pointer, but his side were forced to come from behind to rescue a 3-3 draw across the Pennines.\n\nParkin: \"Doncaster's home form in particular has been really indifferent, so it was a little bit of a surprise to see them in that lead.\n\n\"I wouldn't have envisaged Wigan getting back into it because they don't strike me as the most free-scoring. I know that they lost narrowly to Bolton in a local derby but it's a position in the league I didn't see them being in.\n\n\"Hopefully, they can use that as a catalyst to rise up the table. They're the afternoons that stick with you as a player. When you come back from 3-0 behind - I think I did it once in my career - the memories in the dressing room are really amazing days.\n\n\"So being in a terrible position, that dressing room would be really elated at full-time.\"\n\nIn League Two, Bromley and Swindon Town - the top two at the start of the day - played out a thriller with the Ravens edging out Ian Holloway's side, while Cambridge United stunned Tranmere Rovers to move up to fourth. Just four points separate second and seventh as the promotion race hots up in the fourth tier.\n\nParkin: \"The top of League Two is one of the most exciting areas of the EFL at the moment. I just think there's so many good teams and so many different teams.\n\n\"You have the underdog story of Bromley, of course, who are out in front and earned a massive victory over Swindon, and I don't think you can underplay that.\n\n\"Nicke Kabamba got the winner and that's nine goals he's scored, with seven as a substitute, which just shows what a brilliant signing he's been.\n\n\"Cambridge, likewise, are on an incredible run with their budget. I'm sure they're operating with one of the lowest in comparison to teams around them like Salford and MK Dons.\n\n\"Karl Robinson has really got Salford going, and then you see Walsall as well who, yes, dropped points this afternoon, but they were play-off finalists last year and have re-built a really competitive squad this year.\n\n\"I just think you literally cannot predict who's going to be in the top three. It's so open, so exciting, and it's set up brilliantly for the last few months of the season.\"\n\nSam Parkin was talking to BBC Sport England's Jay Freeman.",

    "fullText": "Our rising global temperatures aren't just a distant threat to the natural world anymore; they have a very real, palpable impact on personal finances and the greater economy.\n\nA statistical analysis of climate risks in Mongolia over recent years pointed to a correlation between monetary instability — at the individual, local, and national levels — and regional weather patterns and abnormalities.\n\nConducted by the United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the research indicated that Mongolia's financial foundation is facing pressure from two sides. The region's floods, droughts, and extreme winters — or dzuds — often damage homes and infrastructure and leave the agricultural industry floundering, but unfortunately, supporting the burgeoning clean energy industry and taking other climate-forward steps is costly.\n\nPer the ESCAP report, Mongolia suffers an average loss equivalent to more than $425 million each year, owing in particular to drought-driven losses of close to $350 million.\n\nAt a broad level, the high atmospheric temperatures brought on by urban carbon pollution and other environmentally unfriendly practices have begun disrupting our global weather patterns, increasing aridity in many regions and supercharging natural disasters like floods and hurricanes.\n\nFor a country like Mongolia, which relies heavily on its agricultural sector, atypical climate and severe storms and floods can cripple economic development by devastating crop yields.\n\nLikewise, the surge in extreme weather drives up the costs of home ownership, particularly as a result of rising insurance costs.\n\n\"Infrastructure damage from floods can impair businesses and real estate values, undermining mortgage portfolios,\" ESCAP explained. \"These climate stressors can lead to higher loan default rates, market volatility, liquidity strains, and even legal liabilities for financial institutions.\"\n\nMongolia isn't the only part of the world to encounter the financial consequences of extreme weather for homeowners. Experts observed a similar trend in California following the Los Angeles wildfires in early 2025, which hiked up premiums for homeowners in medium- and high- risk areas.\n\nAlthough combating climate pollution may appear to be the obvious solution, Mongolia's experience revealed to ESCAP that transition costs can prove just as precarious. The country's decarbonization goals and attempts to fortify its renewable energy sector come at the expense of the livestock industry — trimmed down to reduce methane-releasing cattle populations — and the mining industry, a cornerstone of Mongolia's foreign trade.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Quirke, Carpenter, O'Flaherty 2 Cons: Ford 3 Pen: Ford\n\nTries: Freeman, Hutchinson, R Smith, Todaro, Kemeny, Coles, Pollock Cons: Belleau 3, Furbank\n\nNorthampton Saints returned to the top of The Prem after coming out on top of a 11-try thriller over Sale Sharks.\n\nHaving lost the lead to Bath following their win over Gloucester on Friday, Saints showed what they are all about with a display full of bold, attacking rugby.\n\nTommy Freeman and Rory Hutchinson scored in the first half, before Robbie Smith, Edoardo Todaro, Josh Kemeny, Alex Coles and Henry Pollock grabbed second-half tries.\n\nThe Sharks scored four tries of their own through Raffi Quirke, Joe Carpenter and two from Tom O'Flaherty and they led 29-26 with less than an quarter of the game to go.\n\nBut Northampton's late burst of three tries proved decisive as they claimed an eighth win from 10 Prem games to move two points clear of Bath, and a first win at this venue since 2017.\n\nDefeat leaves Sale in seventh and with their hopes of a fourth consecutive top-four spot all but over, as they lie 16 points adrift of fourth spot.\n\nBristol edge past Exeter in rainstorm to go third\n\nVan Poortvliet shines as Leicester dominate Quins\n\nEleven-try Saracens thump Newcastle Red Bulls\n\nIn a heavyweight clash involving 11 of England's Six Nations squad, either starting or on the bench, it was Saints who made a blistering start.\n\nFreeman, a likely starter for the opener with Wales at Allianz Stadium on 7 February, touched down inside the first seven minutes after a sharp reverse pass from Alex Mitchell set him up.\n\nNorthampton's slick handling was again in evidence as they spread the ball across the line with Kemeny supplying the pass for centre Hutchinson to score in the left corner.\n\nThere should have been a third score after a brilliant offload from Callum Chick and a reverse pass from Hutchinson, only for Freeman to inexplicably spill it with a try there for the taking.\n\nAnd with that let-off, Quirke, bound for Newcastle Red Bulls next season, spotted a gap in the defence to dive over under the posts.\n\nSale ended the first half with a man less as Tom Curry was yellow carded after being adjudged to have gone high on Kemeny, but remarkably by the time Curry returned, his side were ahead.\n\nGeorge Ford kicked a penalty with the last kick of the first half when Mitchell gave up 10 metres for not handing the ball over to reduce the deficit to three, before Carpenter went over in the corner in the first minute after the restart to make it 15-14.\n\nBut the Saints pack took it upon themselves to restore their advantage with hooker Smith eventually the one adjudged to have got the ball over the line.\n\nThat just started an incredible period of play as the lead changed hands. O'Flaherty's first try and a superb touchline conversion from Ford had Sale back in front.\n\nBut a blistering counter attack involving Mitchell and George Furbank was brilliantly finished in the corner by Italy teenager Todaro, for his seventh Prem try of the season.\n\nHowever, Sale's next attack saw them suck in defenders and Rob du Preez's kick was on the money for O'Flaherty to score again to lead 29-26.\n\nSaints delved into their box of tricks one more time with Chick breaking through and although Mitchell was held up by O'Flaherty, superb support play from Kemeny allowed the Australia flanker to score in the corner.\n\nThis time, there was no letting it slip as Coles finished off after a number of phases near the line, before Pollock rounded things off in the only way he can, running through from halfway before spectacularly diving over.\n\nSo while Saints sit pretty for the next two months as The Prem takes a break for the Six Nations, Sale are left to lick their wounds.\n\nSale Sharks director of rugby Alex Sanderson said:\n\n\"We came up short in quite a few areas – set-piece early on, scrum dominance, collisions around the rucks, things that led into them having momentum and almost being able to score at will.\n\n\"That's where we fell short across the 80 minutes and probably across the season if I'm being honest. Consistent inaccuracies in too many fundamental parts of our game.\n\n\"It probably shows where we're at, at this moment in time. Northampton are a team in form, we're a team trying to find some form.\n\n\"Realistically, that's us done for the play-offs, but not the season. I am not going to give up on a season in January. No, we are going to get better. There is that to play for, and scalps to take.\"\n\nNorthampton Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson said:\n\n\"Alex Sanderson had said it was a huge fixture for them, so we knew there would be an emotional spike from them and we know Sale are a very good side and it would be nip-and-tuck.\n\n\"It was a mad game with the wind, that made it pretty chaotic, but we stuck to our guns enough to get away in the last 10 minutes.\n\n\"We created loads in the first half and didn't convert it and then they come straight out and score and it's game on. But I admire the way we stuck at the plan.\n\n\"It's been a long time here. We felt we've been close the last couple of years. Other sides have struggled to get results up here, so that makes it all the sweeter that we managed to get over the line in the last game in this block.\"\n\nSale: Carpenter; O'Flaherty, R du Preez, Ma'asi-White, Wills; Ford, Quirke; Rodd, Jibulu, Harper, van Rhyn, Bamber, Vermuelen, Dugdale, T Curry.\n\nReplacements: Caine, McIntyre, Bell, Burrow, Gilmore, Warr, Louw, Reed.\n\nNorthampton: Hendy; Freeman, Hutchinson, Dingwall, Todaro; Belleau, Mitchell; Iyogun, R Smith, Davison, Coles, van der Mescht, Kemeny, Pearson, Chick.\n\nReplacements: Wright, Fischetti, Millar Mills, Prowse, Lockett, Pollock, McParland, Furbank.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank left Turf Moor to the sounds that are now becoming a familiar backing track to what looks an increasingly unsustainable tenure.\n\nCristian Romero's last-minute header rescued a 2-2 draw just as Burnley looked on the brink of piling more embarrassment on the embattled Dane by securing their first win in 14 Premier League games.\n\n'Dr Tottenham' – the jibe that suggests they can prescribe a cure for even the most serious ills of their opponents – looked to be on the brink of the most dramatic cure yet until Romero struck.\n\nBut if Frank thought this would ease the growing anger of travelling fans he would have been sorely mistaken as he once more felt the full force of their fury after the final whistle.\n\nIndeed, the discontent surfaced even in the first half as Spurs fans chanted \"sideways and backwards everywhere we go\" as the ball was passed around aimlessly.\n\nMicky van de Ven's opening goal was greeted with ironic chants of \"we're staying up\" from the visitors' section.\n\nAnd, once the final whistle sounded, Frank walked off to deafening chants of \"sacked in the morning\" from his own fans and other more colourful phrases of the uncomplimentary variety.\n\nFrank's position came under internal scrutiny after the home loss to another struggling side, West Ham United, with BBC Sport reporting that at least one member of the club's executive team has actively raised the option of ending his reign in recent weeks.\n\nThe question for the club's hierarchy now is whether they should move quickly to put him out of his misery or give Frank the opportunity to turn Spurs' fortunes around.",

    "fullText": "Head coach Eddie Howe believes Newcastle United can still achieve \"great things\" despite the constraints of financial rules as his side look to upset the Premier League's status quo.\n\nClubs who spend the most on wages have traditionally picked up the most points per game.\n\nBut both Newcastle and Sunday's opponents Aston Villa have bucked that trend in recent years with the eighth and sixth-biggest salary bills in the top flight respectively.\n\nNewcastle qualified for the Champions League in 2023 and 2025, while Aston Villa followed suit in 2024.\n\nBoth are bidding to do so again this season and Howe's men could move up to fourth with a victory against third-placed Villa if results elsewhere go their way.\n\n\"People much cleverer than me will say that the wage bill follows the league position, but I can't think that way,\" said the Newcastle boss.\n\n\"We have got to think differently and find ways to still win games to upset the status quo and finish as high as we can.\n\n\"That will always be my belief, and that was my belief from day one in management. Football is played on the pitch - not with the money.\"\n\nIt is worth noting Newcastle's net spend on new signings last summer was £100m-plus, but they sold star striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British transfer record fee of £125m.\n\nTargets such as Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, James Trafford and Benjamin Sesko also opted to join Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United respectively rather than move to St James' Park.\n\nAlthough Newcastle are majority owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia, legacy clubs - also including Arsenal and Tottenham - have the ability to spend more within the rules on account of their superior income streams.\n\nAnalysis from financial firm Deloitte revealed Liverpool generated £367m \n\n\"I know people are bored of us talking about it, but it's factual,\" he added. \"Building our revenues will be so important, and I know there's a lot of work behind the scenes to do that.\n\n\"I have always had the belief that, whatever situation you have, you have to try to outperform your resources. You have to try to overachieve. You have to stretch every ounce of energy and effort from the squad that you have.\n\n\"We believe we can still achieve great things - regardless of what financial restrictions there are on us.\"\n\nOverall squad costs from the 2026-27 league campaign will be limited to 85% of a club's revenue, while teams competing in Europe will have to adhere to Uefa's maximum of 70%.",

Things like “smart compose,” as well as the feature that automatically filters your emails into “promotional” and “social” inboxes, and even spell-check, grammar check and autocorrect are currently tied to the Gemini opt-in.\n\nSo, as you opt out of sharing your information, you might want to consider whether you’re ready to lose some features in exchange.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Olena Janchuk spends another day of freezing isolation in her high-rise apartment.\n\nThe former kindergarten teacher has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and has been trapped for weeks on the 19th floor of her Kyiv tower block, 650 steps from the ground.\n\nLong daily blackouts caused by Russia’s bombardment of power plants and transmission lines have made working elevators a luxury.\n\nWith January temperatures plummeting to minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), there’s a permanent line of frost on the inside of Janchuk’s windows, white patterns creeping across the glass by morning.\n\nThe 53-year-old huddles over a makeshift fireplace of candles arranged beneath stacked bricks, designed to absorb and slowly release heat. USB charging cables snake across the floor from overloaded power strips, while her electric blanket is hooked up to a power bank rationed for the coldest hours.\n\n“When there’s no light and heat for seventeen and a half hours, you have to come up with something,” she said. “The bricks work best in a small room, so we stay in there.”\n\nKyiv, a city of about 3 million people, is dominated by tower blocks, many from the Soviet era, now left without power for most of the day.\n\nIn this fourth winter of war, electricity is a rationed commodity.\n\nResidents plan their lives around electricity schedules: when to cook, shower, charge phones and run washing machines. Food is chosen for shelf life, water filtered into bottles and stored in buckets. Small camping gas burners are used to heat soup or tea when the power is out.\n\nSleep is fractured by air raid sirens and the need to use electricity during off-peak hours.\n\nOutside, across snow-covered Kyiv, diesel generators rumble on commercial streets. Shoppers navigate aisles using phone flashlights, and bars glow by candlelight.\n\nApps notify users of narrowing electricity windows — usually just a few hours — enough for a household reboot.\n\nLife gets harder on the higher floors\n\nJanchuk’s 22-story building is located near a power station and residents can see the missile and drone attacks firsthand, flashes lighting up the horizon at night.\n\nDuring blackouts, they climb the stairs in darkness, phone lights bouncing off concrete steps, often accompanied by the echo of children and barking dogs. People sometimes leave plastic bags with cookies or water inside elevators for those who get stuck when the power cuts midride.\n\nJanchuk’s husband, out working most of the day, brings the groceries in the evening while her mother, 72-year-old Lyudmila Bachurina, is in charge of chores.\n\n“It’s cold, but we manage,” the mother says, holding a square USB-charged flashlight she recently mounted on the wall. “When the lights come on, I start turning on the washing machine, fill up water bottles, cook food, charge power banks, run around the kitchen and run around the house.”\n\nIn upscale neighborhoods, residents pool funds for generators to keep elevators running. But most blocks — home to pensioners, families and people with disabilities — cannot afford them.\n\nDisability advocates, including groups representing wounded war veterans, say staircases have become an invisible social barrier, cutting people off inside their own homes.\n\nThey are urging city officials to fund generators for residential buildings.\n\nUntil then, life bends around the electricity timetable. USB lamps, power banks and inverter batteries have become household staples. Telegram chats help neighbors check on the elderly and swap blackout updates.\n\nFrom upper floors, Kyivans look out over a skyline of high rises and the city’s historic golden-domed churches. At night, flashes of explosions are visible as Russia continues its campaign against Ukraine’s energy system.\n\nRussia has inflicted vast damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure\n\nToo many power stations and transmission lines have been hit to meet demand, even with electricity imports from Europe. To prevent a grid collapse, operators impose rolling blackouts, keeping hospitals and critical services alive while homes go dark.\n\nAt one coal-fired power plant struck repeatedly, shift supervisor Yuriy walks through wreckage of charred machinery, collapsed roofs and control panels melted into useless lumps. Repairs are carried out by torchlight, giant sandbags shielding what still works. Photographs of colleagues killed on the job hang near the entrance.\n\n“After missile and drone attacks, the consequences are terrible — large-scale,” he said.\n\nOfficials asked that the plant’s location and Yuriy’s full name not be disclosed for security reasons.\n\n“Our energy equipment has been destroyed. It is expensive,” Yuriy said. “Right now, we’re restoring what we can.”\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nKyiv has repeatedly updated its austere winter power-saving schedule, dimming or cutting streetlights in low-traffic areas and investing in less centralized power generation.\n\nIn the tower blocks, restoration feels far off.\n\n“I’m tired, really tired, to be honest. When you can’t go outside, when you don’t see the sun, when there’s no light and you can’t even go to the store on your own. … It wears you down,” Bachurina said.\n\n“But the important thing, as all Ukrainians say now, is that we will endure anything until the war ends.”\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "(Corrects typo in first subhead)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - When Fabiola, a single mother and naturalized U.S. citizen from Latin America, first learned of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, she said she was heartbroken and terrified.\n\nThen she joined the thousands of other Minnesotans who have volunteered to track ICE agents since Good was killed - despite her fears for herself and her son ​Asher, who is seven.\n\n“I do feel scared, but at the same time, I know I have to take care of my people too,” she said.\n\nActivists say they have been overwhelmed by new volunteers - despite the potential for violence - ‌since Good was killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.\n\nFederal agents on Saturday shot dead a Minneapolis resident, the second person since the Trump administration surged 3,000 immigration enforcement officials to the city.\n\nFabiola, who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and owns a construction company, never knew Good. The mother of three ‌was fatally shot when she stopped her car during an immigration enforcement action, just blocks from Fabiola's home.\n\nDHS did not respond to requests for comment on the risks to observers in Minnesota, but officials say federal agents respond with gunfire when they fear for their lives. Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary, and other Trump administration officials have described the protesters and observers as \"anti-ICE\" and \"far left\" agitators.\n\nWHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME\n\nFabiola and Asher now blow their whistles when they spot immigration agents on their way to school. She taught Asher how to identify federal agents by their uniforms, and made him memorize his grandparents' phone numbers in case she is detained.\n\nFabiola, who declined to share her last name for fear of retribution, has also started delivering food to people afraid to leave their homes. And she regularly ⁠stops by the makeshift memorial to Good.\n\n“She’s got kids, and her kids don’t have their ‌mom now,\" Fabiola said. \"If something happened to me, where is my boy going to go?”\n\nVice President JD Vance said during a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday that Good was trying to ram Ross with her car. Analyses of bystander video by Reuters and other outlets show Good's wheels were turned away from Ross, and that his legs were clear of the vehicle when he shot her.\n\nAt least five ‍organizations offer training on how to monitor ICE actions, warn immigrants of their presence and document the use of force against detainees and protesters. Online training for one of those groups has been hitting maximum capacity of 1,000 within hours, said Kate Wegener, an immigration attorney who leads the trainings.\n\n“We were fearful that attendance would be lower after her death, but it was the complete opposite,” she said.\n\nThe sessions typically offer safety tips: stay at least eight feet from federal agents; follow orders given by officers and keep one's distance when driving behind convoys of agents.\n\nSome of ​the observers are hyper-aware of the risks. Janet, a resident of a Minneapolis suburb who declined to share her last name out of fear of doxxing, said she has written letters to friends and family to be opened if she's killed.\n\nMinnesota ‌authorities at state and local levels have encouraged the observers. Governor Tim Walz has urged residents to take out their phones and document federal agents.\n\nThe observers, often identified by their fluorescent green vests and whistles looped around their necks, are now an increasingly common sight along busy roads and residential neighborhoods when the heavily armed, masked federal agents dressed in tactical gear are deployed.\n\nThe community pushback has had some effect. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino on Wednesday said the city presented a “difficult operating environment” for enforcement agents.\n\nOrganizers compared the level of engagement to the surge of activism following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nOn a recent day, two new volunteers, a married couple, straddled their bikes next to a busy intersection on the lookout for ICE agents. Snow gathered on their jackets and frost clung to their eyelashes.\n\n“I kind of woke up to what was happening when Renee Good was killed – I knew bad things were happening, but hadn't realized quite how bad it was yet,” ⁠said Aaron, who is 41 and works in marketing. He declined to share his last name out of fear of retribution. “And then when that happened, ​it was like, it's time to start doing something.”\n\nEarlier that day, he said he had adjusted his six-mile run to cover neighborhoods where residents had reported ​ICE sightings near schools.\n\nPushing back against immigration enforcement carries risk. The immigration observers have been teargassed and arrested. State authorities said Friday they were compiling data on arrests but it was not immediately available.\n\nFor Patty O’Keefe, a 36-year-old non-profit worker, those risks underline the importance of the observers.\n\n\"They wouldn't be working so hard to intimidate us and utilizing all those resources if we weren't actually ‍being successful in gumming up the works of their operation or ⁠slowing them down,” O’Keefe said.\n\nEarlier this month, as she was following ICE agents in her car, she said five federal agents shattered her car window, handcuffed her, and put her in an unmarked SUV. She said ICE agents photographed her, insulted her and held her for eight hours in a Minneapolis detention center before she was released without charge.\n\nDHS did not respond to a request for comment on O'Keefe's account of the incident, and Reuters was unable to ⁠determine independently what occurred.\n\nShe said she now struggles with anxiety - but will continue volunteering.\n\n\"I'm just stubborn, and I'm not wanting to give in to the fear.\"\n\nMany residents speak about Good with a sense of reverence, describing her as an inspiration.\n\nOn the street where she was killed, dozens of people defied dangerously ‌cold weather to add to the mounds of bouquets, stuffed animals and electric candles glowing through the snow at a makeshift memorial.\n\n“She gave her life for us,” Fabiola said. “Her soul is in heaven, and she protects ‌us.”",

The operator said it expected normal grid conditions during the watch.\n\nFor regular updates, ERCOT suggests subscribing to TXANS notifications and following its official social media channels.\n\nAustin Energy serves the city of Austin.\n\nTo receive updates on outages, text \"REG\" to 287846\n\nTo report an outage: Call 512-322-9100, text \"OUT\" to 287846 or go to https://austinenergy.ifactornotifi.com/ui/outage-reporting\n\nOncor serves eastern Williamson County, northeastern Travis County, northwest Bastrop County, Dallas County and Tarrant County.\n\nTo receive updates on outages, text \"REG\" to 66267\n\nTo report an outage: Call 888-313-4747 or go to https://stormcenter.oncor.com/\n\nPedernales Electric Cooperative serves the Hill Country west of Austin and parts of western Williamson, Travis and Hays counties.\n\nTo report an outage: Call 888-883-3379, text \"outage\" to 25022 or go to https://www.pec.coop/reportoutage\n\nCenterPoint Energy serves the Houston metro area.\n\nTo report an outage: Call 800-227-1376.\n\nEl Paso Electric serves the city of El Paso.\n\nTo report an outage: Call (915) 877-3400.\n\nLubbock Power & Light (LP&L) is the main energy provider for Lubbock residents.\n\nTo report an electric outage, email or text Lubbock Power & Light at LightsOut@LPandL.com or call (806) 775-2509.\n\nPotter County's main energy provider is Atmos Energy.\n\nTo report an outage, call 888-286-6700.",

    "fullText": "Wildlife smuggling cases are often uncovered at borders or ports, but officials say trains are also being used to illegally move live animals. According to the Hindustan Times, passenger routes can make criminal transport easier to hide in plain sight.\n\nOfficials with the Railway Protection Force said they recovered 102 live turtles from the Howrah-Dehradun Doon Express after inspecting five unclaimed bags found beneath seats and berths in a coach.\n\nInspector Banarsi Yadav said the train arrived at Gaya Junction around 10:30 p.m., when a joint patrol was underway as part of Operation Wilep. He said the turtles were protected under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, making the transport a criminal offense. While no one was arrested, the animals were handed over to the forest department, which gave the turtles a health check.\n\n\"After no passenger claimed the bags, they were opened. We found 102 live turtles inside those bags,\" Yadav told the Times.\n\nWildlife trafficking can disrupt ecosystems while harming efforts to conserve them. For example, moving animals from their natural habitats to new territories can weaken vulnerable wildlife populations by introducing the former as invasive species that affect breeding and eating habits. When trafficking routes overlap with human travel and trade ports, however, it may be harder to enforce protections.\n\nIt can also increase the chances that animals get injured or killed as well as increase wildlife-human interactions that can end in disaster. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported that smugglers often transport illegally captured turtles in extremely cramped and inhumane conditions that contribute to deadly disease outbreaks among the animals. In one case, eastern box turtles that were trafficked were infected with ranavirus, which is known to cause hemorrhaging and fluid accumulation. There is no known cure.\n\nPer the Times, Operation Wilep focuses on patrols, inspections, and coordination with other departments to intercept wildlife traffickers on rail routes.\n\nIf you're looking to get involved in raising awareness about the illegal wildlife trade, it's important to note that, like other critical climate issues, public awareness and community engagement are key to addressing the issue. A widespread understanding of how smuggling impacts ecosystems can affect how many people recognize and report suspicious activity.\n\nDo you think America has a plastic waste problem?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Store brands help us save money, but the truth is the product is often made by a brand name producer. If Walmart's butter tastes familiar, here's why.",
    "fullText": "A shopper's pre-dinner surprise highlighted online speculations about manufacturing products and brand packaging. As one TikTok creator opened packages of Land O' Lakes butter, the buyer was faced with butter sticks wrapped in Walmart's Great Value brand labels. On TikTok, several shoppers are convinced that the butter is in fact the same and that brands and packaging simply drives price differences. \"I'm sure Land 'O Lakes makes the Great Value butter and they mixed up the wrappers on the line,\" wrote a TikTokker. \"The amount of people that don't know it all comes from the same factories is INSANE,\" added another. One commenter on Facebook recalled being informed by a worker that machines would be stopped for labels to be switched and packaging to continue.\n\nWalmart customers appreciate the price point of Great Value products. \"Everything is made by some other company and just branded Great Value Sam's choice, etc.,\" wrote a Redditor. \"Never had a problem with Great Value honestly. Especially given the fact that most, if not all Great Value products are made and packaged by their name brand counterparts.\" Sara Lee has been linked to Great Value White Bread, and Peter Pan has been associated with Great Value Peanut Butter, for example, but it can take some detective work to determine concrete answers.\n\nOn Quora, industry insiders revealed that dairy production can change from region to region and which suppliers are available. \"Two companies that I know for sure on the East Coast are Land 'O Lakes and Blue Bonnet,\" the user revealed before adding that brand names would be changed on packaging labels during manufacturing processes. \"Great Value is Walmart's private‑label brand; the butter sold under the Great Value name is produced for Walmart by multiple co‑packers rather than a single manufacturer,\" the user explained. One Facebooker explained that Walmart contracts brands to package Great Value products. \"Land 'O Lakes and Great Value are the exact same butter, made in the same factory on the same line, they just switch the labels and packaging,\" added another. \"I worked in a name brand place that also made a generic product. But we would stop to change labels, while the machine operator changed the recipe,\" chimed in a TikTokker.\n\nTo locate details about a specific manufacturer on a package, the names of makers and co-packers are often listed somewhere near the ingredient and nutrition profile. Product codes can also indicate information about particular facilities. Additionally, customer service departments may provide supplier information that correspond to recorded codes. Since Walmart's supplier network changes, however, information may only refer to a specific code and date of product, making sweeping statements difficult to provide — and contributing to the rumors that continue to swirl online.\n\nWant more food knowledge?
