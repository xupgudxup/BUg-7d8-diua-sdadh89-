    "description": "Ski jumping has been pushed into the spotlight after a whistleblower uncovered a cheating scandal that involves, of all things, crotch manipulation.",
    "fullText": "MILAN — Adrian Livelten hunched over a sewing machine last March on the eve of the men’s ski jumping competition at the Nordic World Ski Championships.\n\nThe suit technician for Norway’s national ski jumping team brazenly made alterations to suits belonging to the country’s two top contenders after those suits had already passed inspection. Livelten did this in plain view of Norway ski jumping head coach Magnus Brevik, seated in a chair halfway across the room.\n\nWhat neither Livelten nor Brevik realized at the time was that someone was recording them in secrecy from behind a curtain, someone who intended to distribute the video far and wide the following day. The damning footage shared by the anonymous whistleblower shook the sport of ski jumping, bringing out into the open the cheating that happened behind closed doors.\n\nWhen officials from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) seized suits belonging to reigning Olympic champion Marius Lindvik and fellow Norwegian Johann André Forfang, they found rules violations that initially went unnoticed during the competition. Stiffer, non-elastic thread had been sewn into the suits to pull down the crotch area during flight, increasing the surface area and creating more aerodynamic lift in a sport where inches can be the difference between medaling and missing the podium.\n\n\"Probably the most shocking part was that it was Norway because they’ve always been considered one of the more standup teams,” said Johnny Spillane, the first American to medal in the sport of Nordic combined, which consists of ski jumping and cross-country skiing. \"Everyone is going to push the limits. That hasn't changed and that probably will never change, but this was deliberately altering a suit after it had been tested in order to cheat. This was the most blatant cheating I've heard of.\"\n\nThe Norway cheating scandal highlighted two irrefutable facts about the crotch-obsessed sport of ski jumping on the precipice of the 2026 Winter Olympics. There is, as Finnish coach Petter Kukkonen put it last April, “a culture of cheating” in ski jumping. And the battleground between unscrupulous teams and rule-upholding regulators is often below the belt.\n\nMale ski jumpers must wear tight-fitting suits that are no more than 4 centimeters larger than their body measurements at any point. Most national teams seek to find every millimeter they can because a bigger, baggier suit catches more wind and provides more lift during flight than a smaller one does.\n\nFittingly, the most advantageous place to enlarge a ski jumper’s suit is the crotch area. Adding just a centimeter of fabric to the circumference of that part of a suit increases flight distance by approximately 2.8 meters — or more than 9 feet — according to a study published by Frontiers in Sports and Active Living in October 2025.\n\nAthletes chasing that competitive advantage have resorted to trickery when having their body dimensions measured prior to a competition. The more they reduce the distance between their inseam and the floor when FIS equipment controllers record their body measurements, the lower regulators will allow the crotch of their suit to hang while airborne.\n\nIn November 2020, Kukkonen told Finland’s leading tabloid newspaper that athletes were stuffing dish cloths and sponges in their underwear during body measuring. In a recent appearance on the Skirious Problems podcast, Austria’s Mika Vermeulen revealed that when he competed in nordic combined earlier in his career, veterans told him before his first body measuring, “It’s very important to tape your c*** back.”\n\nVermeulen later described ski jumpers putting modeling clay in their underwear to lower their crotch-to-floor measurement by five centimeters.\n\n“People used to cheat a f*** ton,” Vermeulen said.\n\nSalacious stories like those were already pushing ski jumping out of the margins and into the mainstream entering these Olympics. Then the German tabloid Bild sparked further curiosity in January when it reported that ski jumpers have worn condom-like sleeves filled with hyaluronic acid to enlarge themselves before measurement.\n\n“When I read that article, all I could do was shake my head,” USA Ski Jumping and Nordic Combined sport director Anders Johnson said. “If that is really what other people were doing previously, I can't believe that that's how far people have taken it.”\n\nOn Thursday, the alleged scandal went to the top of the performance-enhancing food chain when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was asked about it just 24 hours before the Opening Ceremony of the 2026 Olympics.\n\n\"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that [an enlarged crotch area in their suits] could improve performance,” WADA president Witold Banka said. “If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"\n\nCheating in ski jumping isn’t a new phenomenon. Athletes have been pushing boundaries and exploiting loopholes ever since the sport’s governing body began setting rules restricting how far they can fly.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Austrian national team unveiled suits that were highly permeable in the front but did not allow air to pass through in the back. The resulting parachute effect helped Austrian jumpers take gold and silver in the men’s large-hill event at the 1976 Winter Olympics. Seventeen-year-old Austrian prodigy Toni Innauer set a world record the following month and then bettered it two days later.\n\nThe success of those suits inspired copycat attempts, some well-executed, others not so much. Former American ski jumper Jeff Hastings recalls an early 1980s competitor who “put a garbage bag in the back of his suit to try to get the ‘76 Austrian effect.”\n\n“Everybody could hear him up there rustling like crazy,” Hastings said. “It wasn’t even effective but he was just trying to get a little advantage.”\n\nDetailed rules governing the air permeability of ski jumping suits soon went into effect, but that didn’t deter athletes eager to find even the slightest competitive advantage. Retired ski jumpers have admitted to coating the back of their suits with hairspray or slathering on wood glue in an effort to reduce air flow, improve lift and fly longer.\n\n“You name it, people have tried it,” Spillane said.\n\nAs the sport’s deep-pocketed superpowers stopped buying suits from third-party manufacturers and started hiring sophisticated specialists to produce them in-house, new opportunities to cheat have materialized over the past 10-15 years. Teams sought to gain an advantage by creating custom suits for athletes that exceeded their body measurement by as much as possible without resulting in a disqualification.\n\nThe ideal place to add material is where the legs converge, according to Dr. John Goff, visiting physics professor at the University of Puget Sound and author of the book Gold Medal Physics. The crotch area of the suit is naturally stretched wide with a jumper’s legs in a “V” position during flight. It’s also close to the body’s center of gravity, helping an athlete gain lift without sacrificing control.\n\n“The crotch region, where the legs part, is kind of a sharp transition point,” Goff said. “If you can put some kind of material there to smooth that out, you can reduce the turbulence and increase the lift for the skier. That can have a pretty big influence on the flight.”\n\nFor FIS regulators seeking to prevent teams from gaining an advantage, the process starts with athletes stripping down to their underwear. Athletes must have their body dimensions measured before competitions in the presence of an FIS equipment controller, a team official and a qualified doctor or nurse.\n\nSince 2023, those measurements have sometimes been taken with the help of a 3D body scanner. Before then, it was always a manual process. As American Nordic Combined skier and 2018 Olympian Ben Berend once detailed in a blog post, that made the crotch measurement part of this process particularly awkward.\n\n“The process consists of standing with your feet 40 cm apart wearing nothing but underwear,” Berend wrote in 2016. “Then a metal rod is moved up as high as possible until it hits your junk. The measurement is essentially junk to floor in centimeters.”\n\nThe intrusiveness doesn’t end once the measuring process is over. Athletes also must endure what FIS described in a 2023 memo as a “visual crotch area inspection.” A supervising doctor or nurse checks the athlete “for any irregularities in the genital area” — in other words an artificial prosthesis in the athlete’s underwear that could reduce the crotch-to-floor measurement.\n\nAs a result of stories like the ones shared by Kukkonen and Vermeulen, the process is fraught with suspicion that national teams are finding ways to bypass the rules.\n\nA friend recently sent Hastings a screenshot of one of the world’s top-ranked ski jumpers in mid-flight last year.\n\n“The crotch on his suit practically came down to his knees,” Hastings said. “I’m exaggerating a little bit, but it looked like he had a diaper on.”\n\nBetween suspicious images like that one, unconfirmed gossip about which teams were cheating and the knowledge of how much difference a little extra fabric can make, Johnson admits it creates a toxic culture.\n\n“If one team starts cheating, then two or three start doing it,” Johnson said. “Once you have the best nations in the world doing it, then everyone kind of has to follow suit. It just spreads like wildfire and then once it does, it’s really hard to get back.”\n\nThe chicanery mostly occurred in secret until the anonymous whistleblower shined a spotlight on Norway’s dishonesty and turned the birthplace of ski jumping into a symbol for everything wrong with the sport. Austria, Slovenia and Poland filed formal protests against the Norwegians during the World Championships and called for their results to be annulled.\n\n“This is doping, just with a different needle,” former German Olympic champion Jens Weissflog told the German newspaper Bild at the time.\n\nLindvik and Forgang claimed ignorance, insisting they never would have jumped had they known their suits were rigged. When their coaches backed them, the Norwegian ski jumpers received suspensions of just three months, enabling them to return in time for the 2025-26 World Cup season and the Olympics, where the men’s competition begins on Feb 9.\n\nThe penalty was harsher for Livelten, Brevik and Norway assistant coach Thomas Lobben, each of whom confessed to being part of the conspiracy. On January 15, an independent ethics panel backed the FIS’s request for a punishment strong enough to serve as a deterrent against future cheating, suspending the trio for 18 months apiece.\n\n“In (the panel’s) view, now is indeed the appropriate time to put down a clear marker to what is not acceptable,” the panel’s scathing ruling read.\n\nFor many in American ski jumping circles, the Norway cheating scandal entangled close friends. In 2022, USA Ski Jumping signed a formal partnership with the Norwegian national team for the current Olympic cycle to hold joint training camps and coaching clinics and to collaborate on sports science.\n\nWhile Johnson doesn’t condone what Norway did, he also bristles at how the Norwegians have become “the scapegoat for a much broader issue within our sport.”\n\n“There has been a lot of hypocrisy from other nations,” Johnson said. “I don’t have any personal beef with any of these teams, but it was incredibly disappointing for me to see the response from some of the nations. I think everyone needs to take a look at themselves in the mirror. No one can say they were fully clean. They can only claim they are because they didn’t get caught.”\n\nEmbarrassed by the Norway scandal, FIS has since hired new equipment control coordinators and introduced sweeping reforms for the 2025-26 season. The changes include increased use of 3D scanners for pre-event body measurements, more precisely defined rules for how suits can be cut and shaped and more training for equipment controllers who oversee pre- and post-jump inspections.\n\nHarsher sanctions can now be issued for rules violations during 3D measurement or for the manipulation of a suit after it has passed inspection. Athletes disqualified for an equipment violation during a competition will receive a yellow card. A further transgression will result in a red card and suspension from the following event.\n\nTo Johnson and many others in the ski jumping community, the most notable change is one that has gone unmentioned in any FIS press release.\n\nIn the past, Johnson found that “it was much easier for FIS to discard or disqualify athletes from smaller nations because they didn’t have that political pull in the sport.” This year, highly ranked jumpers from prominent nations have been cited for equipment violations, athletes like Slovenia’s Timi Zajc, who was tied for second place at an event in Germany earlier this winter when he was disqualified for suit violation.\n\n“This year, it doesn’t seem to matter if you’re from Austria or Slovenia or Poland or the United States,” Johnson said. They’re enforcing the rules for everyone.”\n\nAs the world’s top ski jumpers prepare to showcase their talents on the Olympic stage this month, the obvious question is whether the competition will be fair. Will the threat of stricter rules and tougher punishments be enough to deter cheaters? Or will the pursuit of Olympic glory tempt some countries to try to skirt the rules?\n\n“Going into this Olympics, I have a lot more faith and trust in the system,” Johnson said, “but I still have my reservations that teams are really going to be in compliance, that they’re not going to be trying something new.”",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher Tanner Scott revealed he wants L.A. to re-sign reliever Evan Phillips.\n\nThe Dodgers non-tendered the veteran reliever earlier in the offseason due to the injury he sustained. Rather than paying him for a whole season — which he wouldn’t pitch much in after undergoing Tommy John surgery — the Dodgers released him into the free agency pool.\n\n“I do talk to Evan quite often,” Scott said at DodgerFest on Saturday. “I mean, we’ll see where it goes. I like the guy and hope he comes back.”\n\nPhillips and Scott had history before the Dodgers, playing together on the Baltimore Orioles from 2018-20 and reuniting after the Dodgers signed Scott ahead of 2025.\n\nPhillips pitched just seven games for the Dodgers last season before his injury, but had a fantastic run to kick off the year. He didn’t allow a run through 5.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe Dodgers will certainly consider bringing Phillips back, as he is a great weapon to have in the bullpen.\n\nHe had a 2.22 ERA through 201 appearances with the Dodgers, and never allowed a run for the Dodgers in the postseason. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman addressed the idea of bringing him back earlier in the offseason.\n\n“We had a number of back and forth discussions with Evan and his free agent,” Friedman said. ” It is challenging with him coming off surgery so he is going to take some time and look to sign after he throws off the mound when his rehab allows. Evan has been a big part of our past success and we will continue the conversation about bringing him back. We respect that he is taking this time to decide what is best for him and his family.”\n\nEvery team in baseball could use an arm like Phillips, and the Dodgers would likely have a leg up on the rest of the league if they were to move for the right-hander later in the season.\n\nThe post Tanner Scott Wants Dodgers to Bring Back Free Agent Reliever appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

According to the pool practice report, Emmanwori was “limited in practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury that he suffered during practice.”\n\nAs the report notes, Emmanwori “walked off the field on his own shortly before 4 p.m. Several players and coaches went over to comfort him before he left.”\n\nAsked about the situation after practice, Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald stated that the safety “had an ankle today, we brought him in to look at it, and we’ll kind of go from here and figure out what are the next steps?”\n\nThe rookie safety is a key contributor to Seattle’s defense, the top scoring unit in the NFL. He has lined up all over the field for the Seahawks, spending most of his time down in the box but he has also seen time in the slot, on the outside, and even as a deep safety. His ability to be a stout defender against the run while holding up in coverage allows Seattle to rely on their sub defensive packages, while still being able to slow down opposing rushing attacks.\n\nHe was spotted walking under his own power into the team hotel following practice, but with a noticeable limp:\n\nPlease be alright Nick pic.twitter.com/8TUnAuiqy1\n\n— ᴅᴏxx ⚡️ (@new_era72) February 5, 2026\n\nHis health will be a huge story to follow ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\nUpdate (Thursday evening): Emmanwori did not practice on Thursday due to the ankle injury:\n\nS Nick Emmanwori did not practice because of his ankle injury. https://t.co/J7upYXE0Ne\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 6, 2026",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are (sort of) getting healthier ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\nRobert Spillane, who has been dealing with an ankle injury that not only contributed to him missing four games at the conclusion of the regular season but caused him to exit early during an AFC Championship victory over the Denver Broncos, returned to practice for the first time in two weeks on Thursday.\n\nHarold Landry III, who returned to practice this week after previously missing time with a knee injury, saw his status go the other way as he was once again sidelined.\n\nSpillane has insisted that he’ll be ready to go for the Super Bowl, doubling down despite conflicting words over the last couple of days. Landry, who did not play in the conference championship game, said he was confident in his ability to play earlier this week, though missing practice after previously returning isn’t a great sign.\n\nDrake Maye, who suffered a shoulder injury during that same game, was previously listed as a limited participant on the injury report but remained a full participant for the second consecutive day.

    "description": "Since the start of Big 12 play, the Cougars have been among the league’s worst defensive squads.",
    "fullText": "BYU’s offense did its job Wednesday night.\n\nYes, the Cougars turned the ball over too much, but they also shot 50% from the field, 43% from 3-point range and scored 92 points, which is all typically more than enough offensive firepower to capture road wins in the Big 12.\n\nBut instead of picking up a much-needed, stabilizing Quad 1 victory at Oklahoma State, BYU found itself on the wrong end of a memorable 99-92 upset, as the Cougars’ defense completely whiffed against the Cowboys.\n\nBYU offered little resistance against the Cowboys, who drove downhill all night to score 52 points in the paint — something a frustrated Kevin Young repeatedly mentioned to reporters following the loss, and an increase of more than 20 points from BYU’s previous season average of paint points allowed.\n\nIn the second half alone, Oklahoma State scored 58 points at a blistering average of 1.57 points per possession. Every time the Cowboys had the ball after halftime, they ended up 1.57 points richer, with BYU only stopping them 24.3% of the time.\n\nAccording to the defensive analytics provided by StatBroadcast, neither AJ Dybantsa nor Richie Saunders, two typically solid defenders, recorded a single defensive stop against Oklahoma State. Every time the Cowboys targeted Dybantsa or Saunders, they scored.\n\nBYU’s remaining starters weren’t much better on the defensive end. When Rob Wright III, Kennard Davis Jr. and Keba Keita were on the floor, Oklahoma State averaged 153.4, 148.8 and 146.8 points per 100 possessions each, respectively.\n\n“Our defense, it was terrible,” Young said after the loss. “They had 52 points in the paint. They scored at will. We couldn’t keep anyone in front of us, and it was just a layup fest.”\n\nYoung later added, “We couldn’t guard the ball. We got too spread out. That’s way too many, you know, 52 points in the paint, it’s not good, right? And then attention to detail, that’s something that our team has struggled with ... but more than anything, just our one-on-one defense was abysmal.”\n\nWednesday’s letdown was the loudest example of BYU’s most troubling recent trend — a widespread defensive plunge.\n\nAs noted by broadcaster Greg Wrubell on X, the Cougars ranked No. 17 nationally in KenPom’s defensive efficiency metric back on Jan. 5. Just a month later, BYU has plummeted 25 spots to No. 42.\n\nBYU's KenPom offensive and defensive efficiency ratings on--\n\nJan. 5:\n10th AdjO\n17th AdjD\n\nFeb. 5:\n10th AdjO\n42nd AdjD\n\n— Greg Wrubell (@gregwrubell) February 5, 2026\n\nBeing the country’s 42nd-best defensive team may appear fine on paper, especially considering BYU ranked No. 82 at the end of last season. But the Cougars’ defensive results since the start of Big 12 play, which spurred the 25-spot slide, are cause for major concern.\n\nBYU is allowing Big 12 opponents to score 83.4 points per game, ranking 13th out of 16 teams in the conference. The only teams behind the Cougars are Kansas State, Arizona State, and Utah, who are all far outside of the NCAA Tournament conversation.\n\nFor comparison, top-10-ranked Houston, Iowa State and Arizona are all allowing Big 12 averages of 63.3, 67.7 and 71.9 points each, respectively — quite the gap from BYU’s 83.4 mark.\n\nIn their current three-game losing skid, the Cougars have surrendered 275 points (91.67 per game), with Arizona, Kansas and Oklahoma State combining to make 61.9% of their 2-point baskets.\n\nDuring BYU's 3 game losing streak, they have allowed opponents to shoot 61.9% from 2 point range.\n\nFor the entire season, the worst defense in 2pt% allowed in the nation is 62.5% by Chicago St.\n\n61.9% would be the 2nd worst in the nation.\n\n— CougarStats (@CougarStats) February 5, 2026\n\nBYU has to figure out a way to get stops, disrupt opposing rhythm and guard without fouling so often. The Cougars can’t rely on their offense to bail them out of shootouts every night — look at how that’s gone the past three games.\n\nDuring nonconference play, BYU enjoyed various flashes of defensive brilliance, albeit against lesser competition than the current Big 12 gauntlet.\n\nThe Cougars don’t need newfound brilliance, but if they can’t quickly figure out some sort of improvement to yield defensive respectability, their postseason ceiling becomes dramatically lower. Defense will determine how far BYU plays into March.\n\n“... We’re just going through it right now,” Young said. “We’ve just got to lick our wounds and just work, work, work and figure out what each guy individually can do to help the team right now.”",

    "fullText": "A Los Angeles Superior Court judge denied UCLA’s attempt to force a lawsuit over its potential move from the Rose Bowl into arbitration.\n\nIn a ruling issued Tuesday, Judge Joseph Lipner rejected UCLA’s motions to compel arbitration and stay the case, clearing the way for the breach-of-contract lawsuit to proceed in court.\n\n“The court DENIES the motions to compel arbitration. The Court DENIES the motions to stay proceedings,” according to the minute order. “UCLA also filed a motion to quash deposition subpoenas and enter a protective order. The Court DENIES UCLA’s motion to quash.”\n\nIn addition to UCLA’s request, the judge also denied similar arbitration motions filed by Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC and StadCo LA LLC, both entities affiliated with SoFi Stadium.\n\nThe City and the Rose Bowl Operating Company welcomed the decision, saying the ruling clears the way for the case to move forward in court.\n\n“For more than forty years, UCLA has benefited from a unique partnership with the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl, a partnership that was memorialized in a carefully negotiated contract that extends through 2044,” the statement said. “That agreement was the foundation for hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer-backed investments made to modernize and preserve one of the most iconic sports venues in the world. In return, UCLA made a clear and binding commitment to play its home football games at the Rose Bowl through 2044 and expressly waived any right to terminate that commitment early, and we are confident that a court will agree.”\n\nUCLA is currently in a legal battle with the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Operating Company. The city and the company sued the prestigious university to prevent the university from breaking its lease. UCLA is under contract with the Rose Bowl through 2044.\n\nThe post Judge Forces Arbitration in Multi-Million Dollar Rosel Bowl Lawsuit appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "With the transfer portal window now closed, the full picture of roster movement is clear. Many programs saw heavy losses because of coaching changes. Others dealt with exits due to playing time or system changes. Some schools managed the damage quickly. Others now face long rebuilds. Here is a breakdown of the schools with the most transfer portal departures. (Via CFB)\n\nCal fired Justin Wilcox and hired Tosh Lupoi from Oregon. That move triggered roster turnover. A total of 35 players entered the portal. The Bears kept their most important player in quarterback Jaron Kaewe Sagapolutele. He impressed as a freshman in 2025. Cal added 31 new transfers to stabilize the roster. Keeping the starting quarterback helped limit the impact.\n\nAuburn made a coaching change by firing Hugh Freeze. That decision caused major exits. The biggest loss was wide receiver Cam Coleman, who transferred to Texas. Other departures included Kayin Lee, Kensley Louidor Faustin, Horatio Fields, Amaris Williams, Xavier Chaplin and Malik Blocton. New coach Alex Golesh rebuilt quickly. He added 39 transfers, including 13 from USF. Quarterback Byrum Brown followed Golesh and is expected to lead the offense.\n\nFlorida State finished 5-7 in 2025 and placed 13th in the ACC. That season led to heavy movement. A total of 36 players entered the portal. Key exits included Earl Little Jr., Lawayne McCoy, Randy Pittman, Edwin Joseph and Justin Cryer. Mike Norvell responded by adding 22 transfers. Quarterback Ashton Daniels and running back Tre Wisner are set to lead the offense in 2026.\n\nMichigan State fired Jonathan Smith and hired Pat Fitzgerald. The coaching change caused 37 players to leave. Losses included Makhi Frazier, Aisea Moa, Chance Rucker, Aidan Chiles and Nick Marsh. Quarterback Alessio Milivojevic stayed and finished the season as the starter. The Spartans added 28 transfers. Wide receiver KK Smith and center Trent Fraley were key additions.\n\nArkansas fired Sam Pittman during the season and hired Ryan Silverfield from Memphis. That move led to 38 portal entries. Jaheim Singletary and Jac’Qawn McRoy were among the top departures. Silverfield rebuilt fast by adding 41 new transfers. Arkansas ranked eighth in the On3 Team Transfer Portal Rankings. New players included Steven Soles from Kentucky and Jasper Parker from Michigan.\n\nMississippi State also had 38 players leave. Jeff Lebby enters his third year as head coach. The Bulldogs lost several starters, including Jayvin James to Alabama and Zack Owens to Missouri. Jayven Williams transferred to BYU, while Kedrick Bingley Jones went to Alabama. Quarterback KaMario Taylor stayed and is expected to start in 2026. Mississippi State added 24 transfers, including seven offensive linemen. Wide receiver Marquis Johnson joined from Missouri.\n\nWest Virginia continued reshaping its roster under Rich Rodriguez. The Mountaineers lost 44 players to the portal and added 34 new ones. Quarterback Michael Hawkins transferred from Oklahoma and is expected to start. Experience was lost on the offensive line with Donovan Haslam heading to Tennessee. Wide receiver Cam Vaughn transferred to Miami. The program remains in rebuild mode.\n\nPenn State fired James Franklin in October. That move opened the door for mass departures in January. A total of 46 players left the program. New coach Matt Campbell kept linebacker Tony Rojas and cornerback Daryus Dixson. Several players followed Franklin to Virginia Tech. Twelve Penn State players transferred to Blacksburg, including quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer and tight end Luke Reynolds.\n\nIowa State saw 54 players enter the portal after Matt Campbell left for Penn State. His exit ended a long era with the Cyclones. Top players who left included Rocco Becht, Benjamin Brahmer, Marcus Neal and Jeremiah Cooper. Campbell brought 23 Iowa State players with him to Penn State. Jimmy Rogers was hired from Washington State to replace him. He added 48 new players to stop the losses. Replacing that level of talent will be difficult.\n\nOklahoma State led the nation with 64 transfer portal exits. Mike Gundy was fired three games into the 2025 season. That move opened a 30 day portal window for players. A second window in January raised the total even higher. New coach Eric Morris arrived from North Texas and rebuilt the roster fast. He added 54 new transfers. Quarterback Drew Mestemaker and running back Caleb Hawkins followed him from North Texas. Notable losses included Wendell Gregory, Jaylen Lloyd and Noah McKinney.\n\nThe transfer portal changed the direction of many programs this cycle. Coaching changes caused the largest waves of exits. Oklahoma State and Iowa State were hit the hardest. Penn State and West Virginia also saw major losses. Other teams balanced departures with strong transfer classes. How well these schools recover will shape the 2026 season.\n\nThe post Schools with highest college football transfer portal departures appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — On Jan. 9, freestyle skier Eileen Gu posted on Instagram a “Day in my life” video commemorating the one-month countdown to the Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\nGlimpses of Gu brushing her teeth, eating breakfast, riding a ski lift, practicing tricks on a giant airbag, cooling down with a 5 kilometer run, talking to the media, completing a doping test and reading a book while she’s in a hyperbaric chamber were all stuffed into a 29-second Instagram reel.\n\nWithin 10 days, it generated more than a million views.\n\nSo it’s probably no coincidence that Gu, the American-born dual gold medal winner who chose to compete for China in 2019, was the fourth highest-paid female athlete of 2025.  According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of her $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nWhile sponsorships have always been crucial to the earning potential of Olympic athletes, who generally aren’t raking in huge sums of prize money, financial success no longer hinges on whose image lands on the Wheaties box.\n\nNow most of it happens on social media, where the line between Olympic athletes and influencers has been blurred — usually to the benefit of their pocketbooks as this Winter Games draws close.\n\n“The number of Olympians who have become more popular and made money in the Olympics has grown exponentially,” said Doug Shabelman, the CEO of Chicago-based Burns Entertainment, a firm that matches celebrities and athletes with marketing opportunities. “Now everybody, whether you win or lose, can be an influencer. Before you had to win gold medals, you had to do something special. Now social media has leveled the playing field, and the marketability of these athletes is 365 days a year.”\n\nGu is among the handful of Olympic athletes at the top of that food chain along with the likes of Simone Biles and Lindsey Vonn. It’s no surprise given Gu’s success in the sport and her endorsement potential in China, which likely played at least some role in her choice to represent her mother’s homeland rather than the more crowded American market.\n\nBut you don’t need to be the most successful winter sports athlete in a country of 1.4 billion people to leverage social media for endorsement dollars.\n\nTake freestyle skier Alex Ferreira. Once a year, he puts on a prosthetic mask, a gray wig and fake facial hair to make him look like a skiing has-been, goes to the slopes with a film crew, talks trash to younger skiers and shocks crowds as executes Olympic-level tricks.\n\nThe character, “Hot Dog Hans,” was inspired by Kyrie Irving’s portrayal of streetball legend “Uncle Drew.” Though it started out as a one-time gag a few years ago, Ferreira realized within 15 minutes of his first day in costume that it was something he could draw out into a multi-episode series of short films.\n\nThe full Hans skits now generate hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube, with the clips drawing millions on Instagram. And while it may have started as a fun distraction, it has become a high-profile example of how an Olympic athlete who is not particularly famous in the mainstream world can find a niche that leads to dollars.\n\n“We’re in this day and age where your main job is to compete, learn new tricks, go to these contests and win them,” Ferreira said. “But the other half of the business is gaining sponsors, so you need to create content as well. I’m a professional skier, but I’m also an influencer in a way. Basically, when you think the job is over, you have to get back and get on the computer and start cranking out content. When I started, it was much less than that.”\n\nThough the content game does require more time outside of traditional training and media obligations, it keeps many athletes in the mix during those four-year gaps between Olympics when they don’t get as much mainstream attention. And then, once an Olympics begins, you never really know what’s going to hit.\n\nOne of the biggest social media stars of the Paris Games was Henrik Christiansen, a Norwegian swimmer who did not finish better than 20th in any of his three events but went viral for videos about chocolate chip muffins in the athletes’ village. The “Muffin Man” now has more than 500,000 followers on TikTok and is still trading off the joke. One of his most popular recent videos from last October shows him whisking cocoa powder into a mixing bowl trying to replicate a recipe he’s watching on television.\n\n“I’m 56, and our generation, we still look at it like, ‘We want to see the winners and the great stories,’” Shabelman said. “But a different generation has different things they’re more interested in, and there are so many different avenues now, so many different ways to get your story and your personality out that it changed the game in a big way on the marketing side.\n\n“It’s not just the winners anymore. Engagement on social media with fans is so important to marketers because they don’t just want to see how many people look at videos. They want to see who’s engaging, who has that accessibility and who has something that other people don’t.”\n\nIt also helps that Olympic sports, particularly in the winter, have great visuals that lend themselves to social media. Whether it’s a striking costume being worn by a figure skater, a gravity-defying trick on a snowboard or simply the backdrop of a snow-capped mountain, Winter Olympians don’t necessarily have to stretch far outside their comfort zone to create eye-catching content.\n\nMany of Gu’s posts, for instance, have nothing to do with sports and fall more into the category of modeling or a peek into the lifestyle of a rich, young woman who travels the world like a true celebrity and hangs out with other celebrities. They are slickly produced and undeniably targeted to demographics that are not watching the Freestyle Ski World Cup.\n\n“We are still a society that does value attractiveness and different elements that we all have come to know about people who are endorsers,” Shabelman said. “But then you also add on being really good at building great content, you have a lot of (famous) friends you might tag in a post and that might get you even more followers.”\n\nThough not every Olympic athlete handles their social media as seriously or professionally as Gu, it’s now just a fact of life that maximizing endorsement potential — which is what keeps many of these Olympians going in sports that don’t offer big prize money — often runs through Instagram or TikTok.\n\n“Content creation is what’s happening right now,” snowboarder Jamie Anderson said. “It’s bigger than almost anything. There are YouTubers making more money than NFL players. So it really doesn’t matter what I think about it, it’s happening. You kind of have to move with the waves. It’s definitely the future of marketing and sports. Times have changed quick.”",

    "description": "Listen to Falcons president Matt Ryan indirectly prove why the Bears are being cheated out of compensatory picks for Ian Cunningham.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears have seen several departures in the front office and coaching staff this offseason, including assistant general manager Ian Cunningham taking the Atlanta Falcons' GM job.\n\nIt's a departure several years in the making as Cunningham was always primed for a promotion, and the consolation prize for Chicago was always going to be two third-round compensatory picks (one for two consecutive NFL drafts). But, at least right now, the Bears aren't slated to receive comp picks for Cunningham given Matt Ryan is the Falcons' President of Football Operations and Cunningham wouldn't be the main guy in charge.\n\nBut from everything that we've heard, Cunningham would be the guy steering the ship in Atlanta, which means Chicago should be receiving comp picks following his loss (via the Rooney Rule). But don't take it from me. Hear it straight from the mouth of Ryan, who explains that Cunningham will be in charge of the roster, which indicates a promotion and would warrant compensatory picks.\n\n#Falcons president Matt Ryan says GM Ian Cunningham will be the one driving the ship and in charge when it comes to the draft and free agency.\n\n(🎥 @NFLonCBS) pic.twitter.com/i9jg4OKM1K\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) February 5, 2026\n\n\"Ian's in charge,\" Ryan told NFL on CBS. \"Ian's in charge of (free agency and the NFL draft). I'm looking forward to learning about this. I said it the other day in Ian's presser, I've never sat in a draft meeting. Monday's going to be the first time I'm sitting in a draft meeting, so I've got a lot to learn. Sitting, observing, being a fly on the wall. If there's something Ian has a question about or something I can help with, I'm all ears and I'm happy to share my opinion. But Ian is driving this boat, and he is the one leading us moving forward.\"\n\nThe NFL typically awards compensatory picks in early-to-late March, so nothing is official right now. And if the Bears want to appeal the league's potential stance on no comp picks for Cunningham, this video of Ryan describing how Cunningham will indeed be running the Falcons would certainly help Chicago's case.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Matt Ryan's comments prove Bears are getting cheated out of comp picks",

    "fullText": "Yongin FC may be new to the K League stage, but they appear ready to upset the old guard. Backed by a city hall with deep pockets, Yongin have snapped up several big-name free agents. Is this a recipe for success, or are Yongin about to become an expensive retirement home?\n\nThe most important thing to understand is that Yongin FC are a brand-new club. They have never played a competitive match of football. Yongin are a K League 2 side because the local city hall applied for membership and met the minimum requirements set out by the governing body.\n\nThey boast a training centre and a modern 35,000-capacity stadium that has already hosted international football, AFC Champions League fixtures, and K League matches. Not to mention, they have assembled a playing squad dripping with experience.\n\nFormer Gwangju striker Gabriel returns to Korea after an unsuccessful spell in Japan. At 24, the Brazilian forward is at an ideal age, especially given his prior K League experience. He scored eight goals and provided five assists in 33 matches during the 2024 season. The powerful striker has the physique and attributes to excel in K League 2.\n\nAside from his military service with Sangmu, Kim Bo-sub has been with Incheon United since his teens. A two-time K League 2 champion, he has over 200 appearances across multiple positions. Korean clubs value versatile, two-footed players, and Kim fits that mould perfectly.\n\nKim Min-woo will aim to bring all his experience to Mireu Stadium.\n\nKim Min-woo is another highly experienced, multi-position free agent to sign on for the Yongin project. He also brings 23 Korea Republic caps, along with experience in Japan, China, and domestically with Suwon Bluewings and Ulsan HD. However, he failed to make a significant impact after returning to Suwon last summer.\n\nWhen Portuguese goalkeeper Emanuel Novo signed on New Year’s Day, he did something no foreign goalkeeper had done in the 21st century: he registered with a K League club. The 26-year ban on foreign goalkeepers is officially over. Novo has played in Portugal, Saudi Arabia, and Romania, and will face competition from former Incheon United keeper Hwang Seong-min.\n\nAt 37, Shin Jin-ho’s best days may be behind him, but he can still have a very positive impact on the squad. When players gather for the first time, they will see a midfielder with 430 career appearances, two K League 1 titles, and AFC Champions League experience.\n\nAside from a stint in the Arabian Gulf, Shin has represented Pohang, Ulsan, FC Seoul, Incheon United, and Sangmu. He arrives from Seongnam with a K League 2 trophy and proof that he can still perform at this level.\n\nTwenty-one-year-old striker Lee Gyu-dong joins on loan from K League 1 champions Jeonbuk Hyundai. Born in neighbouring Suwon, he spent 2024 on loan with the Bluewings.\n\nLee Gyu-dong represents Jeonbuk U-18.\n\nInterestingly, that period coincided with Suwon’s temporary move to Yongin due to pitch repairs at Big Bird. As a result, Lee is already familiar with Mirue Stadium, having played five matches there. He scored twice for Suwon as their promotion bid ended early, and his impact in Yongin should be stronger.\n\nAre Yongin primed for an immediate playoff push?\n\nWhen Ko Jeong-woon guided Gimpo FC from the semi-professional K3 League into K League 2 in 2022, expectations were low. Gimpo had always been competitive in K3—never champions, but regularly finishing in the top three—yet the step up was seen as too big for a small, city-owned club on the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.\n\nInstead, Gimpo exceeded expectations. Their debut season ended with an eighth-place finish (out of 11), followed by a heartbreaking playoff defeat to Gangwon FC the following year.\n\nProgress has since stalled, but Yongin appear to be attempting something similar. “Very, very rich” was how one rival club official described Yongin to me. 2026 is the perfect time to enter K League 2 with lofty ambitions. Two teams earn automatic promotion, with another qualifying via the playoffs. A fourth promotion place is also possible, depending on where Gimcheon Sangmu finish in K League 1.\n\nLooking across the 17 squads, Yongin are arguably a top-five team on paper. What a story that would be.\n\nIt isn't Yongin's fault, but there is'new club fatigue' amongst K League 2 fans. On the surface, Yongin offer nothing we haven't seen before - a new club with a very small fan base, an oversized stadium with a running track, and a club based in Gyeonggi, a region of the country now completely over-represented at this level.\n\nWhat sets Yongin apart is their ambition. Every club will talk about winning the league, earning promotion and eventually to qualify for continental football. It all feels a little hallow. Yongin are different. They recruited Anyang's team manager, who has experience building a squad to escape K League 2. And, aside from the players mentioned above, 34-year-old Suk Hyun-jun is also in the squad.\n\nSuk is a 15-times Korean international, who's played for Ajax Amsterdam, FC Porto, and Al-Ahli. Suk's time is coming to an end, but look out for another striker, Jardel, who has been capped by Guinea-Bissau, and former Seoul E-Land defender Kwak Yun-ho. Yongin's ambitions are clear. Can they break the understandable new club fatigue?",

    "description": "Open Source Policy Summit 2026: Open source gains urgency as Europe reassesses reliance on US tech",
    "fullText": "Open Source Policy Summit 2026 European tech leaders are waking up to the risk of the US simply turning off their IT services.\n\nThe Register FOSS desk attended the 2026 Open Source Policy Summit in Brussels last week. The tone of the event was distinctly different to that of the same event three years ago. We encountered new notes of determination, expressed forcefully by Finnish MEP Aura Salla:\n\nIn case some listeners didn't see the problem with that:\n\nThe US could turn us off inside one hour.\n\nThe Reg has quoted Salla before. She has been making this point for a while, with increasing directness, but just over a year into Donald Trump's second term as president of the United States, it continues to grow in importance.\n\nAs we covered in October last year, one of the leaders in this effort is the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which switched away from Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook to Open-Xchange and Mozilla Thunderbird. The head of Schleswig's Chancellery and Minister for Digital Transformation, Dirk Schrödter, gave a keynote saying: \"We are free; now everyone must follow.\"\n\nHe noted that although it had saved the state government money, it wasn't without cost. The process had required significant expenditure, but that was good for European businesses that had helped the state in its transition. We liked his summary of the status quo:\n\nWe're in the habit of exporting public money out of Europe, and importing dependencies.\n\nIn a later panel on \"Open Source and Economic Security,\" he noted that digitization in Germany can be difficult, partly due to its state-level IT management and strategy. He recommended a pragmatic approach:\n\nDon't look at the big mountain in the distance. Look at concrete steps you can take to start.\n\nSo, for now, Schleswig is still running Windows, but has replaced Microsoft Office with LibreOffice on \"nearly 100 percent\" of machines. It's using Thunderbird for email, calendars, and contacts, talking to Open-Xchange on the back end, alongside the Matrix-based Element for chat and Nextcloud for collaboration.\n\nOther speakers on the same panel made the point that FOSS doesn't mean free of charge, but spending money with European companies means benefits to European economies – keeping more of the EU's vast public spending inside the EU. As Leontina Sandu put it: \"We spend 0.4 percent of EU money on software licenses. It's a lot – public sector spending is half of the EU's GDP.\" Blogger Markus Sandelin estimates that the EU spends over €200 million a year just on Microsoft 365 licenses.\n\nCompanies working on open source in Europe, of course, stand to profit significantly from this. Thales's Daniel Glazman put it more bluntly: \"Open source will succeed when we forget the word 'cost.'\" IBM's Jochen Friedrich shared a pithy one-line summary of how Europe needs to transform its economies away from old heavy industries and into open \n\nThe Eclipse Foundation's Mike Milinkovich echoed Salla's earlier point that Microsoft effectively had a kill switch over Office 365, but pointed out that the company has more such controls: it also owns GitHub. As he put it, \"more or less every company and organization in Europe pulls from GitHub, because it uses JavaScript and Maven, so this applies to them too.\"\n\nPortuguese professor Mario Campolargo flipped the equation around. Any part of the EU paying for software should be sharing the code it's paying for:\n\nIf the money is public, the code should be public.\n\nOf course, this isn't just a European problem. It applies just as much to the nearly 200 countries of the United Nations. A short item, oddly described as an \"intervention,\" talked about the upcoming UN Open Source Week 2026 and the UN Open Source Principles – including that the city of Barcelona just adopted them.\n\nTo most people working with FOSS, they probably seem simple and reasonable, but having the UN on board adds considerable clout, and spelling them out is the sort of thing that reassures technophobic politicians:",

    "fullText": "Counter-Strike Bench: GPT 5.3 Codex vs Claude Opus 4.6Stepan Parunashvili·Feb 5th, 2026We're Instant. We give you and your agents unlimited databases and backends. Build whatever you like, from your next startup to an alternative Counter-Strike. Sign up and build your first app in minutes\nGPT 5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6 shipped within minutes of each other. How well do they compare building a multiplayer Counter-Strike?\nWe tried and found out. Here's how the gameplay feels:\n\nAnd if you're curious, you can play it yourself:\n\nGPT 5.3 Codex's attempt: https://53strike.vercel.app/\nClaude Opus 4.6's attempt https://46strike.vercel.app/\n\nWe have a full recording of us building it here.\nHere's what surprised us:\nBoth models were a leap over any previous generation\nYou can compare the results with our last benchmark. These models made much more realistic maps on the first try. Their weapons were better. And they got much more right on the first shot. Codex had some issues with accounting for HP under respawns, and Claude has some issues spawning inside obstacles. But a simple paste got them fixing it. At no point did they get stuck and require guidance.\nGPT 5.3 Codex was much faster than Claude\nIn just about every prompt GPT 5.3 Codex finished in about half the time. This could be because of the harness: We noticed Claude Code did much more upfront research than Codex.\nClaude Opus 4.6 performed better on 5/6 prompts\nBut perhaps the upfront research came to good use, because Claude Opus 4.6 beat out GPT 5.3 Codex on all prompts but one (and the last one was a tie).\n\nGPT 5.3 CodexClaude Opus 4.6FrontendBoxes + Physics🥈🥇Gun + Creativity🥈🥇Sounds + Animations🥈🥇BackendMultiplayer🥈🥇Maps🥈🥇Bonus🤝🤝\nClaude drew more interesting maps. Claude made a nicer weapon. The gameplay UI was much nicer on Claude's first try.\nBoth models struggled a bit with physics\nAt this point, neither model had issues drawing out the UI, setting up the backend, or getting caught up in bugs from three.js. The frontier now seems to be about physics.\nFor example, Claude generated maps where players could end up stuck. Here's Claude's \"inferno valley\" and \"nuke zone\" produced 4-wall obstacles in the center:\n\nThere would be no way for users to leave. Codex also had trouble with direction. The enemy's \"point of view\" was coming out from the back of their had, rather than the front.\nWith both models you could shoot through obstacles. Claude Opus 4.6 at least made it so you couldn't walk through the obstacles -- but with Codex you could.\nWith either one, it was fun to build and play!",

    "title": "We Reverse-Engineered Docker Sandbox's Undocumented MicroVM API",
    "description": "Docker ships with an undocumented API for spawning isolated microVMs. Here's how to use it for more than just AI agents.",
    "fullText": "Docker ships with an undocumented API for spawning microVMs. We reverse-engineered it and built the open-source Sandbox Agent SDK to allow orchestrating coding agents inside of them.\n\nDocker & containers are the standard for how we’ve been running backends. Recently, more workloads have been moving to sandboxes for untrusted code execution, which Docker is not suitable for.\n\nWith the launch of Docker Sandboxes, Docker quietly shipped an undocumented API for microVMs that can power sandboxes.\n\nThis looks promising to be a unified way of managing sandboxes on your own infrastructure using microVMs, just like Docker did for containers 10 years ago. (Today it only supports macOS/Windows. Requires nested virtualization.)\n\nDocker Sandboxes (launch post) are Docker’s solution for running AI coding agents safely. Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini need to run arbitrary code, install packages, and modify files. MicroVMs let them run --dangerously-skip-permissions without being dangerous.\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a glorified docker run command, but under the hood Docker is using a completely different technology: microVMs.\n\nContainers are what most developers know and love when they run docker run. They provide basic file system, network, and process isolation between the host machine.\n\nHowever, it’s a common misconception that containers are good enough for running untrusted code (AI agents, user-submitted scripts, multi-tenant plugins).\n\nIn order to achieve better security, products like AWS Lambda, Fly.io, and most sandbox providers use microVMs for lightweight virtual machines with separate kernels for better security. It’s lighter than a full virtual machine, but does not carry as much overhead. This is considered the gold standard of isolating user code. There are many other documents that better describe microVMs & Firecracker if you’d like to read more.\n\nThis is why Docker built Sandboxes on microVMs instead of containers while remaining compatible with Docker containers.\n\nThis opens up use cases that containers can’t safely handle:\n\ndocker sandbox run is strictly limited to Docker’s whitelisted agents: Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Kiro, and Cagent. It currently does not let you run your own Docker containers.\n\nSo naturally, I went down the rabbit hole to see if I could reverse engineer the underlying microVM API in order to run any code I’d like inside of sandboxes.\n\nDocker’s sandboxd daemon manages all of the virtual machines and listens on ~/.docker/sandboxes/sandboxd.sock.\n\nThe VM name follows the pattern {agent_name}-vm. socketPath is your per-VM Docker daemon, which we’ll use in the next step.\n\nNormally all containers share /var/run/docker.sock. Anyone with socket access can see and control every other container.\n\nSandboxes flip this. Each microVM gets its own Docker daemon at ~/.docker/sandboxes/vm/<name>/docker.sock for maximum isolation. Containers run like normal inside the microVM, but are completely isolated from the host and other VMs.\n\nTo target different daemons, we will need to override the Unix socket path using curl --unix-socket ... or docker --host unix://....\n\nNew VMs are completely isolated from the host, so we need to manually load images we’ve built into the VM.\n\nWe do this by building, archiving, and loading the image into the VM like this:\n\n$VM_SOCK is the socketPath from the earlier step.\n\nNow the fun part: we can finally run our image and work with it like any other Docker container.\n\nmicroVMs route outbound traffic through a filtering proxy at host.docker.internal:3128. Your container needs these env vars:\n\nThe proxy does man-in-the-middle on HTTPS (hence NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0) for network policy enforcement. For production use, install the CA certificate from ca_cert_path in the VM response instead of disabling TLS verification.\n\nWorkspace syncs at the same absolute path, so volume mounts just work:\n\nDocker Sandboxes require Docker Desktop 4.58+ on macOS or Windows. Linux is not supported since Docker Desktop uses platform-specific virtualization (Apple Virtualization.framework on macOS, Hyper-V on Windows).\n\nThe raw microVM API is powerful, but building a production agent orchestration system on top of it requires handling:\n\nWe built the Sandbox Agent SDK to handle all of this. It wraps the microVM API and provides a simple interface for spawning and interacting with AI coding agents:\n\nSee the full guide on deploying with Docker Sandboxes.\n\nDocker’s microVM API opens up secure isolation for any workload, not just the handful of agents Docker officially supports. Whether you’re building an AI coding assistant, running untrusted user code, or isolating multi-tenant plugins, the /vm API gives you the primitives to do it safely.\n\nThe API is undocumented and subject to change, but it works today on Docker Desktop 4.58+. If you’re building something with it, we’d love to hear about it.",

    "fullText": "Transfer of subjects of acclaimed film about inhumane prison conditions described as ‘straight-up retaliation’\n\nThe Alabama prison system has moved three well-known incarcerated activists who supported a 2022 prison strike and were featured in an Oscar-nominated documentary about the troubled system to isolated cells with little contact with others, family members and attorneys said.\n\nFamily members of the three men said they fear for their loved ones’ safety and are concerned the moves to solitary confinement are a form of retaliation for outspokenness about problems within the prison system. Robert Earl Council, Melvin Ray and Raoul Poole were transferred two weeks ago from their existing prisons to solitary confinement at the Kilby correctional facility outside Montgomery, their lawyers said. The transfers come as some groups have encouraged a new prison labor strike this year.\n\n“This is straight-up retaliation,” said Julie Sledd, who is close to Poole and spoke to the Associated Press about his situation. “They’ve all three been very involved in standing up for the rights of incarcerated citizens.”\n\nCouncil, Ray and Poole were featured in The Alabama Solution, a documentary about the state prison system that relied heavily on cellphone footage from inmates. The film has been nominated for an Academy Award in the documentary category.\n\nSledd said she had been able to talk to Poole once since the transfer and he told her the men are being held in separate cells on an isolated and closely guarded floor.\n\n“Since their arrival, the men have been cut off from contact with their families and are being held in isolation with no contact with other prisoners or prison staff except for a small group of guards and supervisors,” lawyers representing the three men said in a statement.\n\nThe attorneys said the prison system did not provide a reason for the move and said the restrictions “far exceed standard administrative segregation protocols”.\n\n“Given [the Alabama department of corrections’] decade-long documented history of excessive force against prisoners and its pattern of retaliation against these specific individuals – including a prior 2021 incident in which four guards nearly killed Robert Council – their attorneys fear for the activists’ safety and well-being,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe Alabama department of corrections cited security concerns as the reason the men were moved, but did not elaborate.\n\n“The transfer of inmates is based on intelligence that they are engaged in activity that is detrimental to the safety and security of the facilities and the public,” prison officials said in an statement emailed by a spokesperson, Kelly Betts.\n\nThe statement added that “all inmates are safe, secure and receiving regular meals and other services as needed”, and that they have had legal visits and phone service.\n\nEarnestine Council said on Wednesday that she had received little information about her son and had not been able to speak with him. Ann Brooks, Ray’s mother, said she had not been able to reach her son, although he was able to make one call to his brother.\n\n“I don’t know what is going to happen or what could happen,” Brooks said.\n\nThe moves come as some have pushed for a new prison labor strike this year similar to one in 2022 that drew national attention. Thousands of Alabama inmate workers went on strike that year, refusing to work in prison kitchens, laundries and factories to protest against conditions in the state lockups.\n\nSeveral inmates told the AP that prisons had recently reduced the amount of food and other items they can buy each week at the prison commissary, a move that could prevent items from being stockpiled ahead of any strike.\n\nThe prison system said in a statement that food service had been contracted out to a new vendor, Aramark, but did not elaborate.\n\n“We’re really concerned because they’ve had retaliation and abuse in response to all of their activism,” said Andrew Jarecki, director of The Alabama Solution.\n\n“It’s particularly ironic that these men who are incredibly brave – and frankly, scholars – and have learned the law and have been leaders and always observe nonviolent means of protest, are always met with violence by authorities.”",

    "fullText": "The Royal Government of Bhutan has moved over $22 million in BTC out of sovereign wallets over the past week alone, drawing attention from the crypto community.\n\nOne transaction, 5 days ago, was directly sent to addresses linked to market maker QCP Capital, Arkham data revealed. The moves align with Bhutan’s periodic sales of BTC since it began mining the crypto in 2019.\n\n“From our observations, Bhutan periodically sells BTC in clips of around $50M, with a particularly heavy period of selling around mid-late September 2025,” Arkham wrote.\n\nBesides, the Himalayan Kingdom’s crypto portfolio has gone down more than 70% from its $1.4 billion peak to $412 million, following market depreciation.\n\nPer Bitcoin Treasuries, Bhutan remains the seventh-largest government Bitcoin holder.\n\nBhutan has been mining Bitcoin since 2019 and saw more than $765 million in BTC profit.\n\n“They mined most of their BTC before the halving in 2024, and tapered heavily after that,” said the Arkham report. “This is because the cost to mine a single Bitcoin roughly doubled, which made mining less efficient.”\n\nFurther, the nation seems to have mined 8,200 BTC in 2023 alone, making it the heaviest mining year. It approximately mined 1800 BTC in 2022 and 300 BTC in 2024.\n\nThe BTC transfers from the government wallet in the past week come after Bitcoin has been slumping to $70,000. The largest crypto has tumbled 7.36% over the last 24 hours, outpacing the broader crypto market’s 6.39% fall.\n\nDespite the heavy transfers, blockchain data analysts note that they are more likely to be internal reallocation or custodial arrangements rather than liquidation. The country’s wallet balances remain largely unchanged.\n\nBhutan has made similar mass wallet moves in the past without triggering market crashes.\n\nRead original story Bhutan Quietly Sells Over $22M in Bitcoin, Triggers Speculation Over Possible Sell-Offs by Sujha Sundararajan at Cryptonews.com",

    "fullText": "A defenseless toddler was almost run over — twice — after the child tumbled out of an SUV when the car door suddenly flew open.\n\nAccording to Fullerton, Calif., police, the vehicle was making a turn when the front passenger door opened and a 19-month-old baby fell onto the roadway. The mom, who’s been identified as Jacqueline Hernandez, 35, of La Habra, Calif., then stopped short, nearly causing the car behind her to rear-end her, per New York Post.\n\nA video released by police shows another car almost running over the tyke, but its driver managed to slam on the brakes just feet away from the baby.\n\nHernandez is then seen running around to the passenger side to pick up the child.\n\nPolice were only alerted to the incident when a witness came forward and reported it. The information enabled them to identify the mother. Hernandez was then arrested on suspicion of felony child abuse, the Fullerton police said in a statement.\n\nThe toddler was injured in the fall but was expected to make a full recovery after being treated at a hospital.\n\n“Why was the baby in the front seat, and not in a car seat in the back buckled up,” asked one commenter on Instagram.\n\nUnder California law, children under 2 need to be placed in a rear-facing car seat, and until age 8, children must ride in the back seat.\n\n“This made me sick to my stomach,” another viewer commented on Instagram. “So happy the baby will make a full recovery.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie’s Brother Issues New Emotional Plea for Missing Mom as First Ransom Deadline Passes\n\nPatrick Mahomes Sr. Reportedly Remains in Jail, Could Face 10-Year Sentence for Violating Probation\n\nKaroline Leavitt ‘Can’t Guarantee’ ICE Agents ‘Won’t Be Around a Polling Location’ During Elections\n\nThis story California Woman Arrested on Felony Child Abuse After 19-Month-Old Baby Tumbles Out of SUV first appeared on National Enquirer.

    "fullText": "Tech has been clobbered by a broad rotation taking place in 2026, and the latest sell-off in software stocks has only added to the pain. Yet, on the other end of that pain has been a $24 billion gain for short-sellers.\n\nThe software rout took off this week, but some of the biggest names in tech have been struggling all year, battling both micro and macro forces that have hurt demand for high-flying AI plays.\n\nFor short-sellers betting against these stocks, the last six weeks have been a windfall. A report from data analytics firm S3 Partners reveals that short-sellers have netted billions in paper profits as they bet tech would drop from nosebleed levels.\n\nThe firm noted that while short sellers have been betting against some of the biggest names in software all year, they have been increasing their bearish positions recently as conditions shifted and volatility surged.\n\n\"U.S. Software stocks have generated $24 billion in MTM PNL for short sellers YTD, while the market capitalization of the sector has declined by $1 trillion,\" the firm's report reads.\n\nS3 highlighted several software stocks that short sellers have been increasingly betting against\n\nOf the software stocks on the list, Microsoft stands out, the firm said, because of the way short-seller behavior around it has changed amid its sharp decline this year.\n\n\"Historically, MSFT behaves like a reversal stock, with shorts covering on the way down,\" S3 noted. \"Now it is trading like a momentum-driven, distressed name, with shorts increasing into weakness.\"\n\nWhile the AI trade has faced intensifying scrutiny lately, the firm sees the widespread bearish trade as specific to software stocks, as short interest in the overall Magnificent 7 and the Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, has been flat.\n\nS3 maintains, though, that hedge funds are focused on increasing their short positions in large-cap tech, even as many sector leaders have already logged big declines.\n\n\"Contagion is visible across short books, with AVGO and AMZN seeing short-interest increases of 15% and 10%, and AVGO down 10% YTD,\" he stated.",

    "description": "The lake scene between Sophie and Benedict in \"Bridgerton\" season 4 is changed from the book. Here's why that's a good thing.",
    "fullText": "Mr. Darcy and Anthony Bridgerton, please welcome Benedict Bridgerton to the \"emerging out of a lake\" hall of fame.\n\nThere are a few monumental scenes straight from the pages of Julia Quinn's books that fans demanded be included in the Netflix adaptation. You know the ones — remember the carriage scene from season three? Or the mirror scene that ended up being the longest sex scene in the show's (steamy) history? Or maybe you're more of a Kanthony fan, which means you were eagerly anticipating a certain bee sting.\n\nThis season's monumental scene was known by the fans as \"the lake scene.\" It's a big moment for Benedict (Luke Thompson) and Sophie (Yerin Ha), the leads of season four. They've fully warmed up to each other after a few days at My Cottage, and it's become difficult to ignore the simmering tension between them.\n\nSo, when Sophie accidentally comes upon a nude Benedict taking a swim in the lake in episode three … well, you can guess what happens next.\n\nIt would seem these two have decided to wade into deeper waters..for now. pic.twitter.com/3gvGiXkhXd\n\nBut it actually goes down quite differently in Quinn's book, \"An Offer From a Gentleman.\"\n\nIt's a short (but impactful) scene in the show.\n\nAfter recovering from a fever brought on by injuries he sustained while protecting Sophie's honor — long story — Benedict and Sophie are spending time at Benedict's (charming, if inaccurately named) My Cottage so he can recuperate.\n\nWhile taking a walk, Sophie accidentally spots a naked Benedict taking a swim in the lake. Of course, he promptly spots her and begins teasing her for ogling.\n\nBut it takes a turn when Sophie blurts out she \"can't help but notice\" Benedict, wherever he is. The two share a passionate kiss before Benedict backs away, apologizing.\n\nThe two then go their separate ways, with Benedict (as usual) being charmed by Sophie's awkwardness.\n\nThe lake scene occurs in chapter 11, about 40% of the way through the book — and it's a much longer encounter.\n\nFirst of all, the kiss is a lot more intense, lasts a lot longer, and has some more flirty banter, including Sophie accidentally calling Benedict by his first name (which he loves) and telling him that she doesn't normally do this kind of thing.\n\nWhere it gets a bit dicey, though, is that this is when Benedict asks Sophie to be his mistress after deducing that she's been lying about her parentage.\n\nAs she does when he makes this offer in episode four, Sophie says no. We don't know how Benedict will react to this refusal in the show, but we can be almost certain that it won't be what his literary counterpart does: Blackmail Sophie into working for his mother.\n\nYes, you read that right. When Sophie refuses to be Benedict's mistress, he tells her she can either work for Violet or he'll report her to the police for stealing from him.\n\nUnderstandably, Sophie is furious about this — and actually punches Benedict in the face when he says she's \"not being intelligent\" — but ultimately accepts the offer to work at Bridgerton House.\n\nOf the many changes \"Bridgerton\" showrunner Jess Brownell has made from the source material, this is one we're quite relieved about.\n\nIn the book, Benedict isn't trying to be slimy when he does this. Ultimately, he's trying to protect Sophie from having to navigate the world on her own (and he's basically accepted the fact that he loves her and can't live without her), but that doesn't make it any less icky to read.\n\nInstead, the show has actually leaned into the tricky power dynamic between Benedict, a member of the Ton, and Sophie, a maid. Soon after the lake scene in the show, he has a conversation with Mrs. Crabtree, one of the caretakers of his cottage, who warns him that the inherent power imbalance between him and Sophie means that a relationship between them can never truly be equal.\n\nIt's a surprising bit of reality from an otherwise fantastical show.\n\nThe mistress offer comes a bit later during what's been dubbed the \"staircase scene\" — a show invention — after Benedict has seen that a friend of his has a mistress he's truly fallen in love with, and, by all accounts, the two seem happy. Benedict is genuinely trying to make it work with Sophie as best as he can.\n\nBut we'll have to wait until part two on February 26 to see how Sophie responds.",

    "description": "At the National Prayer Breakfast, Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) called on the president to “be invested in the alleviation of suffering” across America.",
    "fullText": "With President Donald Trump standing awkwardly behind him, a Democratic congressman used his prayer at the National Prayer Breakfast to urge Trump to “think of families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nSpeaking at the bipartisan Washington, D.C., event on Thursday shortly after Trump gave a rambling address, Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) offered a prayer for “the future of this nation,” and asked God to “lead this president into greater levels of compassion.”\n\nNews: Minneapolis Mayor Shreds ‘Thoughts And Prayers’ Over School Shooting: Kids ‘Were Literally Praying’\n\nJackson, the son of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, said, “Today, we remind him that the lives of millions of people are in his hands, and that he has the power to turn mourning into dancing or to reduce the country into a cosmic elegy of chaos and suffering.”\n\nJackson continued by calling on Trump to be “mindful of the poor” and “be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening on farms in the Midwest, in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nHe added that “we are all Americans, all made in the image of God, and that none of us are free unless all of us have our freedoms protected.” (Watch video at the end of the story.)\n\nWhen the prayer finished, Trump shook Jackson’s hand and appeared to say, “Great words.”\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nDuring his address, the Republican president said he didn’t know “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”\n\nThe plea to Trump came amid weeks of chaos in Minnesota as a result of his administration’s immigration crackdown, with the president’s rhetoric helping to sow discord.\n\nPolitics: Hillary Clinton Pulls No Punches In Fiery Response To GOP Congressman\n\nThe president has baselessly accused the state of harboring thousands of violent undocumented immigrants, calling them the “worst of the worst.”\n\nAgainst a backdrop of protests against the influx, federal agents have shot dead two U.S. citizens ― 37-year-old Renee Good and Alex Pretti, also 37 ― in separate incidents.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it is scaling back immigration operations around Minnesota by withdrawing about 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal officers sent to the state.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News later that day, Trump admitted he could have adopted “a little bit of a softer touch” in the region.\n\nwow -- with Trump standing behind him, a man (not sure who he is) offers this prayer: \"We pray that he would be mindful of the poor and that he would be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.\" pic.twitter.com/toJk9vIboF\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter Setting Minneapolis Ablaze, Trump Now Appears Interested In Dampening The Flames\n\nJD Vance Won't Apologize For Amplifying Smears Against Alex Pretti\n\nTrump's Border Czar Announces 700 Immigration Officers To Immediately Leave Minnesota",

    "description": "Tesla filed two new trademark applications on Tuesday for possible Roadster logos.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is only a few months away from its planned Roadster demo, and it might be getting a fresh new logo to boot.\n\nThe automaker filed two new trademark applications on Tuesday with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. One of the filings shows a sleek design featuring three minimalist lines that appear to form a vehicle.\n\nThe second application is for the styling of the name. The company submitted protections for \"Roadster\" in an all-caps styling with a stretched shape and segmented letters.\n\nPer both filings, the logos haven't yet been used on commercial vehicles.\n\nTrademark attorney Josh Gerben wrote in a blog post that companies often file trademark applications on an \"intent to use basis\" ahead of a public launch.\n\n\"By filing early, Tesla locks in a nationwide priority date, preventing third parties from attempting to register the same or confusingly similar marks after the logos are publicly announced,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe electric-car maker ramped up work on the Roadster last summer, Business Insider previously reported. Designs for the Roadster that were seen by insiders last year showed a two-seater with butterfly doors. At the time, a source with knowledge of the issue said the vehicle was at least two to three years from production.\n\nElon Musk has hyped up the revamped Roadster over the past few months. He has said the vehicle will be able to fly.\n\nIn a January interview, Musk said \"if safety is your number one goal, don't buy the Roadster,\" adding that it would be the \"best of the last of the human-driven cars.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO said during the company's third-quarter earnings call that the new Roadster will be unveiled on April 1, joking that April Fools' Day will give him \"some deniability.\"\n\n\"I could say I was just kidding,\" he said.\n\nHe had previously said Tesla planned to unveil the vehicle by the end of 2025.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "I tried six brands of store-bought tater tots from Sonic, Ore-Ida, Cascadian Farm, McCain, Signature Select, and Alexia Foods to find the best ones.",
    "fullText": "Tater tots, potato puffs, potato rounds, potato barrels — these crispy, slightly snacks go by many names.\n\nThey've followed me from the middle-school cafeteria to late-night study sessions in college and always hit the spot.\n\nTo find the best, easy-to-make frozen tots, I reviewed the offerings from six brands: Sonic, Signature Select, Ore-Ida, Alexia Foods, McCain, and Cascadian Farm.\n\nFor consistency's sake, I bought the most basic flavor from each brand and followed each package's cooking instructions.\n\nHere's how I'd rank the store-bought tater tots from my least favorite. to my top pick.\n\nMy expectations for the Sonic tots were already low because I don't love the fast-food chain. However, even when I put my bias aside, they still disappointed me.\n\nI baked the tots at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 18 minutes. When I pulled them out of the oven, they looked crispy and brown.\n\nUnfortunately, the crispiness was all these tots had to offer.\n\nThough the outer texture was good, the tater tots didn't have much flavor. I thought the soft interior kind of just tasted like plain, undercooked potato.\n\nOre-Ida created the original Tater Tot and owns the trademark, so I expected the brand to set the standard for the rest of the potato-based snacks.\n\nI cooked them in the oven at 425 degrees for 25 minutes until golden brown.\n\nIf you love the thin, crispy fries at the bottom of a takeout bag, these tots are probably for you. They had the crispiest texture of all the brands I tested.\n\nBut even though they were supposedly seasoned according to the package, I didn't think these had much flavor. Compared to some of the others, they left something to be desired.\n\nI had high expectations for Cascadian Farm's organic spud puppies because I have enjoyed other frozen products from the brand.\n\nOut of the bag, these tots were a darker shade of brown than Sonic or Ore-Ida. The color only deepened when I baked them at 450 degrees for 18 minutes.\n\nThey almost felt and tasted like a lighter version of tater tots — they definitely weren't as greasy as some of the other brands I tried.\n\nThe spud puppies were decently crispy, but unfortunately, I found the flavor a little underwhelming.\n\nMcCain offers a quicker-cooking bag of frozen tots. I baked them at 425 degrees for 12 minutes.\n\nThey were less crispy than some of the others, but I still enjoyed the texture.\n\nDespite what the packaging said, the taters didn't appear to be heavily seasoned. When I tried them, though, I tasted a hint of onion.\n\nThe flavor almost reminded me more of a latke. Unfortunately, this is a tater-tot comparison, not a latke review; otherwise, I would've ranked these higher.\n\nAlexia Foods' seasoned tater tots have flavors listed on the packaging — roasted garlic, cracked black pepper, sour cream, and chives — so I was hopeful.\n\nI baked them in the oven at 425 degrees for 18 minutes. These puffs were crispy, herby, and had a good russet-potato flavor.\n\nWithout question, Alexia Foods ranked first on my list. The light garlic and pepper flavors set them apart from the other options.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 5, 2025, and most recently updated on February 5, 2026.",

    "title": "I asked an insider what went wrong at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post",
    "description": "After Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013, the billionaire was considered a model owner. Not anymore. I asked an insider what happened.",
    "fullText": "Lots of people are angry at Jeff Bezos because of the massive cuts he's ordered at his Washington Post. But a decade ago, Bezos was widely celebrated for his ownership of the Post, which he had bought for $250 million in 2013.\n\nUnder Bezos' ownership, the Post made huge investments in tech and staff. And readers loved the results — especially during the first Trump era, when the paper turned profitable.\n\nNow things are very different: The Post says it has been losing gobs of money for the past few years, and Bezos has made a series of moves interpreted as a shift toward Trump — which spurred reader revolts, which made things even worse. And all of that led to this week's cuts.\n\nI talked to Erik Wemple, a New York Times media reporter who previously worked at the Post for 14 years, to try to reconcile the two eras of Bezos and the Post, and to get a sense of what might happen next. You can hear our entire chat on my Channels podcast; what follows is an edited excerpt from our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: What shape was the Post in when Bezos bought it in 2013?\n\nErik Wemple: The Graham family, which had owned the Post forever, was an amazing steward for the paper. But they had to scale back their newsroom, because the internet had blown holes in classified ads. Classifieds used to be huge at The Washington Post.\n\nAt the time Bezos bought it in 2013, it was not dysfunctional. These were really good journalists, but the paper was in a bit of a funk. It wasn't a reclamation project, but it had seen better days.\n\nIt was faded when he bought it.\n\nCorrect. And when Bezos came in 2013, he really wowed the staff. We all asked him questions. He answered those questions with tremendous enthusiasm and competence. He seemed really energized by this.\n\nWhat did he think he was going to do?\n\nWhen he came in, he was energetic, but deferential on the particulars of running the newspaper. He's like, \"You know what? I'm not in this business, but I do know how to organize discussions about the future of a business.\" And that's what he did. I was in one of them; it was really remarkable.\n\nHe had these things that he believed in. He was important in guiding conversations. And it was really remarkable because he backed it up with money. He invested in the newspaper. He invested in political coverage, big time. Investigative went up. International got a huge, huge boost. And the technology did too.\n\nThis is exactly what you want from your billionaire tech owner: Give us a bunch of money. Improve our tech. Also, stay away. Don't tell us what to do.\n\nThat was exactly the sentiment. And one of the things you mentioned in there is really worth pausing on for a second, which is the lack of intervention, the lack of meddling. He just sort of looked on. And the newsroom really, really, really roared. Especially in the first Trump period.\n\nSo not only does this produce great journalism, it seems like it becomes a business success story — the paper becomes profitable again. Then, after Trump left the White House, there was a lot of hand-wringing about what happens after the Trump bump. People expected audiences to decline across lots of different publications, and that happened, so it makes sense that the Post would struggle a bit. But the numbers you hear about the reported losses — $77 million in 2023, $100 million in 2024 — are staggering. I still don't understand how you can swing to losses like that just because your traffic goes down. What am I missing?\n\nOne of the things that has been reported and pretty well substantiated is they may have over-indexed on staff growth. They vaulted up over a thousand in early 2021, up to 1,100. So I think they got ahead of themselves, and they had to pair that back. That's one of the things.\n\nAnother consideration is that the digital advertising market sort of dried up, so that was a big deal.\n\nIt's all somewhat of a mystery, but I don't doubt that there are meaningful losses.\n\nCan this just be as simple as the Post overhiring? Lots of companies have done that — the tech guys did during the pandemic.\n\nNo, I don't think so. Especially if you look at the more recent past, when they tinkered with the opinion side and shot themselves in the foot.\n\nIn October 2024, the Post announced it would not be endorsing a candidate in the presidential election. And that happened after the Washington Post editorial board had drafted an editorial in favor of Kamala Harris. And hell broke loose — a subscription desertion of hundreds of thousands.\n\nThat's an astonishing number. I remember thinking that it couldn't be real.\n\nThe cause and effect could not have been more direct. People said, \"No way. I'm not giving my money to this organization.\"\n\nThe Post has continued to do lots of news reporting that is critical of the Trump administration. Which made me curious about this line in editor Matt Murray's explanation of the cuts this week. He praises the work the paper has done, and then points out problems, and says \"even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\"\n\nIt almost sounds like what David Ellison and Bari Weiss say about remaking CBS News. Does that mean we should expect the Post's news reporting to change in some sort of ideological way?\n\nIf Matt Murray or any of his top editors had actually edited that memo, they would've asked for specifics. And they would've put a big question mark alongside that and ask, \"What the hell are you talking about here? Why are you speaking in such elliptical language? Why are you trying to whisper to the newsroom some message that you're not willing to articulate?\"\n\nWe need to ask him exactly what he's saying. I think that that is coded language, and I think that could be political.\n\nIt's a strange thing for the executive editor to be saying. It's almost as if he's asking for some force to adjust the newsroom cadence and its sensibility — when he has the power to do that.\n\n(Editor's note: The Post's PR department on Thursday afternoon referred Business Insider to an interview Murray had with The Wall Street Journal: \"You have to be where users are,\" he said. \"We have to do great journalism that people engage with.\" He said that included an effort to \"talk to a lot of different kinds of people and reflect the full diversity of life,\" the Journal reported.)\n\nWhy does Jeff Bezos own The Washington Post? It seems to be nothing but a headache for him the last few years. It doesn't seem like it helps him curry favor with Donald Trump. It's not like he's using it to buy the \"Melania\" documentary for $75 million. What is the upside for him, and why does he continue to own it, do you think?\n\nErik Wemple: I have no idea. That is something all of us in the media trade have been trying to figure out. It is entirely a black box.\n\nMany years ago, he seemed to be deriving a great deal of satisfaction from this. There was a close bond between The Washington Post Establishment and Bezos. I'm pretty sure it isn't as strong as it once was.\n\nSo I think that the enjoyment he got from his association with his institution has probably faded.\n\nBut in 2024, he said, \"We saved The Washington Post once, and we're going to save it a second time.\" So there's another challenge, right? I guess that that would be something that he would derive some pleasure from. And I would imagine that if he wanted to get really involved and engaged, the way he was back in 2013-2015, the newsroom would welcome that.\n\nA lot of the success stories we hear about in digital media these days are specifically publications that are focused largely or entirely on Washington, DC: Politico, Axios, Punchbowl, Semafor. Some of them have direct DNA from The Washington Post. Is there any chance of the Post reclaiming any of that, either through an acquisition or just by focusing on Washington and policy?\n\nThey have this Washington Post Intelligence thing now, which is sort of akin to that. But I don't know if there are new streams of revenue opening up at the Post. And I think that that's one of the reasons that the staff is so disaffected and so disappointed in the current management — they don't see any sort of progress towards new business.\n\nI think they're seeing cuts. And also a fair amount of silence. I don't think that they're getting the feedback from management that they deserve.",

    "fullText": "A California man whom an FBI official slammed as a \"total imposter\" was arrested and charged Thursday over allegations that he sent a fake ransom demand for Nancy Guthrie, the mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.\n\n\"Did you get the bitcoin were [sic] waiting on our end for the transaction,\" Derrick Callella texted two family members of Nancy Guthrie on Wednesday, following reports of a ransom demand tied to the elderly woman's disappearance that listed a Bitcoin wallet address, his criminal complaint said.\n\nThe complaint, filed in Arizona federal court, said Callella admitted to sending the messages. It was not immediately clear whether Callella had retained an attorney.\n\nAuthorities believe the 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie was taken from her ranch-style home just outside Tucson, Arizona, in the Catalina Foothills five days ago.\n\nFBI Phoenix's special agent in charge, Heith Janke, announced the arrest on Thursday at a press conference over Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.\n\nThe FBI official said the arrest was related to an \"imposter ransom demand\" for the woman. \"It was someone that was trying to profit from it — a total imposter,\" Janke said.\n\nJanke also issued a message to anyone involved in Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, urging them to \"do the right thing.\"\n\n\"This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well-being,\" Janke said.\n\nThe FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance, Janke announced.\n\nAuthorities said that an additional ransom letter regarding Nancy Guthrie, sent to local and national media outlets, is being taken \"seriously.\"\n\nThat note made a monetary \"demand\" for 5 p.m. local time Thursday, said Janke.\n\n\"If a transfer wasn't made, then I think a second demand was for next Monday,\" Janke said, declining to provide other specifics.\n\nAn Apple Watch and a floodlight were also mentioned in ransom letters, Janke said.\n\n\"We're not going to go into specifics. It's very important that we keep this investigation moving forward, and we don't want to put more facts out there that others then can use to try to profit from this,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities revealed new details around the timeline of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance on Thursday and confirmed that the blood discovered on the elderly woman's porch belonged to her.\n\nNancy Guthrie was dropped off at her home by her family just before 10 p.m. on January 31. At 1:47 a.m. MST the next day, the woman's doorbell camera disconnected, police said.\n\nAt 2:12 a.m., the doorbell software detected a person on the camera, but there was no available video footage, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said during the Thursday press conference. Minutes later, Nancy Guthrie's pacemaker app showed a disconnect from her phone.\n\nHer family checked in on her at 11:56 a.m. and called 911 shortly after, police said.\n\nNanos said that Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera had also been removed. No suspects or persons of interest have yet been identified in the case, the sheriff said.\n\nOn Wednesday, in an emotional video post alongside her siblings, Savannah Guthrie pleaded to her mother's possible abductors to \"please reach out to us.\"\n\n\"We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk,\" the famed NBC anchor said, adding, \"We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.\"\n\nNancy Guthrie suffers from physical ailments and requires daily medications that, if not taken every 24 hours, could have life-threatening consequences.\n\n\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" Nanos said.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors plan to increase incentives for companies that cooperate during criminal investigations, including ​promises not to prosecute them, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan said ‌on Thursday.\n\nJay Clayton's remarks at an industry conference come as the Justice Department is scaling back ‌corporate crime enforcement and refocusing on immigration and drug cases under the Trump administration.\n\nWhat new incentives will prosecutors offer cooperating companies?\n\nHow is Justice Department changing corporate crime enforcement?\n\nWhich sectors will face increased white-collar crime scrutiny?\n\nWhat are Clayton's criticisms of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?\n\nCompanies need to know there is a specific benefit to cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in rooting out wrongdoers, Clayton said at the Securities Enforcement Forum in ⁠New York.\n\nThat includes offering companies ‌so-called non-prosecution agreements, or NPAs -- deals which Democrats have criticized in the past.\n\n\"Our approach is going to be: let's ‍get an NPA signed as quickly as possible that calls for continued cooperation,\" he said.\n\nClayton, an appointee of President Donald Trump, said the different approach on cooperation would ​benefit shareholders, too. He previously led the Securities and Exchange Commission, a ‌civil regulator, during Trump's first presidential term, and focused on retail investors at the time.\n\nThose retail investors continue to be among his top priorities on white-collar crime issues, he said, noting he has an eye on misconduct in small-cap stocks, private funds and prediction markets. When asked if he foresees ⁠prosecutions in those so-called event contracts, he ​said: \"Yes.\"\n\nClayton also criticized past enforcement of the ​Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 law that bans companies that operate in the U.S. from bribing foreign officials.\n\nThe Justice Department ‍paused the law's enforcement ⁠last year and resumed it with a plan for a more scaled-back approach.

    "description": "An active-duty enlisted member of the US military said their unit was \"pressured\" into seeing Amazon's \"Melania\" documentary about the first lady.",
    "fullText": "It was the story of the weekend: \"Melania,\" Amazon's documentary on first lady Melania Trump, beat expectations at the box office, becoming one of the best-performing documentaries in recent years with an opening weekend gross of $7 million across 1,778 screens. (Whether it makes back its $75 million investment is another story.)\n\nDespite dismal critic reviews, the numbers suggest audiences turned out for \"Melania\" to support the first lady. One advocacy group suggests the reality may be more complicated.\n\nMikey Weinstein, the president and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the nonprofit received reports from eight bases around the world that U.S. military members were being \"pressured\" to see \"Melania.\"\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Weinstein, a former Air Force officer and attorney who said his group is made up of nearly 100,000 current and former members of the U.S. military and represents those who feel pressured or coerced into unconstitutional religious observances. \"They were pressured to see the movie.\"\n\n\"Your military superior, that's not your shift manager at Taco Bell or Starbucks. They have complete and total control over you.\"\n\nIn an email Weinstein shared with Business Insider, an active-duty enlisted member of the US military said they were writing on behalf of a dozen of their unit members and their families who felt \"pressured\" by their unit commander to see the movie. The MRFF did not disclose the name of the person who sent the email.\n\nIn the email, this person said their commander suggested the unit and their family members join him, his wife, and their children at a showing of \"Melania\" at an off-base movie theater.\n\nThe screening was designated as one of the commander's \"Unit Activity Events,\" morale-boosting activities that can range from flag football and barbecues to movie nights, the email said. The military member who sent the email said the unit is required to attend at least three of the four UAEs that are scheduled each month or face a penalty.\n\nAsked if any of the MRFF members who contacted him skipped the movie, Weinstein said: \"Every one of our clients who came to us either went to see it or suddenly got sick.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Department of Defense official told Business Insider, \"There is no Department of War directive requiring service members to see this film, though the film is fantastic.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street is looking to Amazon with high hopes after a rough week in tech, as silver plunges again and bitcoin drops near $65,000.",
    "fullText": "US stocks took sizable hits again on Thursday in a fruitless search for a reprieve from a building tech sell-off as investors awaited Amazon earnings, assessed Alphabet's big AI spending plans, and digested jobs data that signaled fresh weakness in the labor market.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved roughly 1.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost over 1.1%, or more than 500 points.\n\nThe market is in the midst of a full-on tech wipeout, as investors weigh whether some software stocks took too big a beating. The losses have been spurred by worries about AI disruption to established software players — a risk that had been overlooked by investors focused on the fallout from massive AI spending until recently.\n\nWall Street is still digesting the latest batch of corporate earnings, with Big Tech's AI build-out and demand in high focus. Alphabet (GOOG) shares slid, but pared losses, after the Google parent outlined a significant ramp-up in AI investment — to as high as $185 billion — in its quarterly results late Wednesday.\n\nThe countdown is now on to Amazon's (AMZN) report, set for release after Thursday's market close. Eyes are on the all-important AWS cloud unit, expected to deliver a 21% jump in sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market flashed fresh signals of weakness: Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected, and job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020, while a new report found that last month marked the worst January for layoff announcements since 2009. The government's monthly jobs report is due next Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver (SI=F) plunged as much as 17%, erasing all of its two-day recovery as Chinese buyers dumped holdings. Wall Street is debating whether the recent record rally in silver and gold (GC=F) ran too high, too fast — and if a further slump awaits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also plunged to its lowest level since 2024, wiping out all of the gains accumulated during President Trump's second term. The token broke below $63,000 — amid a crisis of confidence.\n\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n\nSilver (SI=F) prices tumbled 14% on Thursday to hover above $75 per ounce, erasing gains from the past two days. Gold (GC=F) futures also slipped to $4,900 per ounce after both metals had risen for a second consecutive day following last Friday’s sell-off.\n\nAnalysts warned that silver’s short-term rebound remains volatile, though they remain bullish on bullion prices over the medium term, despite last week’s dramatic pullback that interrupted a blistering rally over the past year.\n\n\"The widening divergence between gold and silver performance reinforces a recurring theme: silver behaves less like a monetary metal during periods of stress and more like a high-beta hybrid, amplifying both optimism and fear,\" Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's commodity strategy head, wrote on Thursday.\n\n\"History suggests that silver tends to stabilise only once realised volatility falls and speculative positioning is reset — conditions that are not yet fully in place,\" he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\n\nMortgage rates barely budged this week: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged higher to 6.11% from 6.10%, while the 15-year fixed averaged 5.50% ticked up to 5.5% from 5.49% last week.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick and Laura Grace Tarpley note that the 10-year Treasury note, a pricing indicator for 30-year fixed mortgage rates, has hovered above 4.2% since mid-January. However, the spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates has narrowed recently, and the 30-year has resisted a substantial move higher.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nCheck out frequently asked questions about mortgage rates and our mortgage calculator here.\n\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\n\nCheck out the top takeaways from Sozzi and Schwab's conversation here.\n\nIt hasn't been a great day for jobs data, with the delayed JOLTS report serving as the final piece in a trifecta of negative news about layoffs, hiring, and unemployment claims.\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled below $64,000 on Thursday, its lowest level since October 2024.\n\nThe token is down nearly 50% from its all-time high last year, erasing all the gains made during President Trump's second term. Investors had been optimistic that the administration's crypto-friendly policies would lift digital-asset prices.\n\n\"Bitcoin remains in a larger bear-market structure,\" read a 10X Research note on Thursday. \"In the absence of a strong catalyst and with positioning still stretched, downside risks remain elevated.\"\n\nNotably, the firm points to a significant overhang — overexposed bitcoin ETF holders who are underwater, with an estimated average acquisition price near $90,000.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with ether (ETH), which tumbled 13% on Thursday. Investors holding Ethereum ETFs are down approximately 31% from their average cost basis, according to 10X Research data.\n\n\"Under these conditions, attracting incremental allocations from Wall Street investors becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when many existing holders likely regret not reducing exposure at significantly higher levels,\" the note said.\n\nAbsent a significant catalyst, the firm doesn't see a bottom to crypto's bear market until possibly the summer.\n\n\"As we have previously outlined, a cycle low around the FIFA World Cup this summer could mark a more compelling long-term buying opportunity,\" 10X Research analysts said.\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings and announced its CFO will be exiting.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) shares soared as much as 9% as the company said it will begin selling compounded copies of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy pill. The pill from Hims & Hers would cost about $100 less than Novo's, Reuters reported.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) both saw shares tumble about 7% on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks have been hammered in the past few days, accelerating a months-long decline as investors become more fearful of disruption risks posed by new artificial intelligence tools — particularly those from Anthropic.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the market belief that software stocks are losing ground during a call with analysts following the Google parent's earnings report Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe CEO said: \"Look, at least from my vantage point, I definitely see we have very, very good SaaS (software as a service) customers who are leaders in their respective categories.\"\n\nThose customers include Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), and Salesforce (CRM), per Bloomberg data.\n\nPichai continued: \"And what I see the successful companies doing is they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows, be it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it to drive efficiency within their organizations.\"\n\n\"[J]ust like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services.. I think the [software] companies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHis comments echo those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week.\n\nRead more about what's driving fears over AI eating into the competitive moats of SaaS leaders here.\n\nThe performance of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, AWS, will be keenly examined when its earnings report lands later, after Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged last week, in part due to a slowdown in cloud growth.\n\nThis was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.\n\n“It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space,” said David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios. “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”\n\n... Amazon’s results come against a backdrop of anti-software sentiment that’s weighing on the entire tech sector as investors try to sort the winners and losers from the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, invited new questions about when these investments will pay off more substantially.\n\n“It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”\n\nAt the market open, US stocks plunged for a third day as a broad sell-off in tech names continued.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, sinking 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.5%.\n\nUS weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased by more than expected last week, as snowstorms across much of the country may have led more people to file for assistance.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 increased by 22,000 to 231,000 claims, exceeding economists' forecasts, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nContinuing claims, a proxy for the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, increased to 1.84 million.\n\nDistortions from winter weather notwithstanding, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits suggests the labor market remains broadly stable if not cooling gradually.\n\nThough in a sign of cracks appearing in the \"low hire, low fire\" trend that has characterized the labor market for over a year, layoffs jumped in January to their highest level for that month in 17 years, according to Challenger data (scroll down for more on this).\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports:\n\nJeff Bezos came, he saw, he conquered.\n\nMaybe not in the way you'd expect from a onetime financial savior of an iconic newspaper. There are now two Bezos eras at the Washington Post: The first started when he rescued it in 2013. The second began when he saw it gutted, blessing mass layoffs the company executed on Wednesday.\n\n... On social media and in news coverage in the aftermath, Post employees, the labor union, and alumni (myself included) strongly criticized the decision.\n\nOthers have pointed to more recent moves by Bezos.\n\nLeading up to the Post's deep cuts, several media observers highlighted Amazon's enormous budget to produce and market the new documentary \"Melania,\" about first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAmazon's extraordinary spending prompted questions about the movie working as a kind of bribe from Bezos to the White House. (Amazon says they licensed the movie because they think people will love it. The film's Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office numbers have inspired a news cycle of their own.)\n\nBut the splashy Melania rollout provided an ugly contrast to the austerity Bezos was serving down to the Post's newsroom. In the worst light, critics said Bezos was willing to burn money to please the president but was now unwilling to do so for journalism in the public interest.\n\nRead more here in the takeaway from today's Morning Brief.\n\nChinese EV maker Nio (NIO) sent its shareholders a profit alert on Thursday morning, letting them know that the company expects to post its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio said it will see an adjusted profit from operations of 200 million Chinese yuan (approximately $29 million) to 700 million yuan (approximately $100 million).\n\nThe company attributed the profit to sustained sales growth, improved margins from its product mix, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.\n\nNio stock popped 6% in premarket trading.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, as tariff woes sent the beauty group's shares tumbling.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) stock fell over 5% during premarket hours on Thursday after bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below 70,000. Strategy is one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency.\n\nTapestry (TPR) stock rose 5% before the bell. Coach's parent company beat analysts' estimates on revenue and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) US-listed shares rose 5% before the bell on Thursday after announcing plans to issue its first dividend to shareholders, along with a three-year stock buyback program worth $5 billion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled, falling $71,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the leading cryptocurrency was paring deeper overnight losses in the wake of Bessent's comments, after entering the key mid-$70,000 support region.\n\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferré and Grace O'Donnell report:\n\nSnap (SNAP) stock galloped higher after a strong holiday quarter for advertising lifted earnings above Wall Street's estimates.\n\nSnap stock rose 6% before the bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the video messaging app reported revenue of $1.71 billion and earnings per share of $0.03. That beat Wall Street estimates of $1.7 billion in revenue and a $0.03 loss per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise.\n\nThe affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85.\n\nThe stock soared by as much as 8% in premarket trading on Thursdayas the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs.\n\nLast year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow market share and deliver best-in-class growth in beauty, as reflected by our raised fiscal 2026 outlook.\"\n\nRead more about e.l.f.'s quarter from Reuters.\n\nArm Holdings shares fall as licensing sales miss estimates.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock rose 5% before the bell on Thursday following Alphabet's (GOOG) capital expenditure plans, which surpassed analysts' expectations.\n\nGoogle's parent company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of $180 billion, news that is a potential boon to Broadcom, which partners with Alphabet on custom chips.\n\n“That is an incredible number. We are laughing because that number is so good for the Google cohort,” Ben Reitzes, Melius Research head of technology research, told CNBC.\n\nGoogle is not the only company increasing its capex spend to build AI data centers: Oracle (ORCL) is doing the same and raised its forecast to around $50 billion.\n\nGoogle's AI software doesn't just use Nvidia (NVDA) chips, but it also uses its own tensor processing units (TPUs). For Gemini 3, Google used TPUs, which Broadcom helped to make.\n\nSilver (SI=F) fell sharply, wiping out a two-day recovery, as the white metal struggled to find a floor following a historic market rout. Gold (GC=F) also declined.\n\nSpot silver plunged as much as 17% on Thursday, having flickered briefly above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. After a record-breaking rally that appeared to run too far, too fast, the metal has retreated by more than a third from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29.\n\n“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. This has created “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity,” he said.\n\nThe sudden and sharp decline in precious metals also weighed on sentiment in base metals markets, with copper falling more than 1% to slip below $13,000 a ton. Meanwhile, spot gold dropped as much as 3.5% in choppy trading.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) stock fell around 11% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market.\n\nSecond quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87).\n\n\"While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release.",

But on Reddit, some people who already own Whoop 5.0 bands are buying up old 4.0 bands to get a bargain on the subscription price.\n\nThere have been a few posts on this, but perhaps the master of this hack is Redditor u/thelifeofcb, who found Whoop 4.0 bands, new in box, at a T.

This allowed them to extend their existing subscription—they wear a Whoop 5.0—for several years at essentially a $200/year discount.\n\nWhen new Whoop bands are sold through retailers, they come packaged with a one-year subscription. The idea is that you’ll create an account on the app, pair the band you bought through the app, and get credit for a 12-month subscription—since that was the main thing you paid for when you bought the band at full price.\n\nBack in the Whoop 4.0 days, there was only one tier of membership. When tiers were introduced, those subscriptions rolled over to a Peak subscription, the one that currently goes for $239/year. That means a 4.0 device—however much you pay for it—can give you a year-long Peak subscription.\n\nRedditors have found that pairing one of these new Whoop 4.0 devices added a year’s subscription to their accounts, whether they were a new customer or not. That means you can buy a few discount bands, pair them all, and enjoy several years’ worth of discounted membership. That $39 band is thus a $200 discount on each year’s membership. Some say that they received an offer to upgrade to a Whoop 5.0 band if they added two years' worth of membership (paired two bands).\n\nThat $39 price is an unusually good one, but you can still get a significant discount anywhere new Whoop 4.0 devices are sold. For example, Amazon has 4.0 devices right now for $124, which is still about half the price of a Peak subscription. You can find them cheaper on eBay, but I’d be wary of buying a box that may have been opened. I’ll explain that below.\n\nWhile Redditors say this works—and it does fit with my understanding of how subscriptions are paid for and claimed in the app—there are a few pitfalls to beware of.\n\nThe first is that this applies to new-in-box devices that (1) are sold with a subscription, and (2) have never been paired. The hack would not work with a hand-me-down device that has already been used, nor with a new one that has already been paired and its subscription claimed. For example, you can’t pass the same band to a friend and expect it to give both of you a subscription.\n\nThis means you have to be sure the band you buy has not been opened. If a store accepts returns of opened items, they may not realize that the valuable item here—the digital subscription—has already been claimed. If they put it back on the shelf, and you buy it, you’re out the purchase price and you still don’t have a subscription.\n\nThe other issue is just the e-waste that this causes. You’re buying a device just to throw it in the trash. But I’d argue that’s Whoop’s fault, not yours—those devices are obsolete and headed for the landfill (or responsible electronics recycling program, if you can find one) regardless of what you do.",

    "title": "The Top 10 TV Series This Month, According to Streaming Data",
    "description": "It's a really good time to stay inside and watch a ton of television.",
    "fullText": "January 2026's ten most-streamed TV series are a balanced group, including six reality-based dramas and four fantasy/sci-fi hits. One the side of realism, we've got medical drama vérité The Pitt, a pair of spy shows (The Night Manager and Ponies), and a gay hockey romance in Heated Rivalry. The fantasy side includes the post-apocalyptic black humor of Fallout, the suburban supernatural series Stranger Things, and a trip back to Westeros with A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nA more important running theme this month: These shows are all critical darlings, including a couple perfect Rotten Tomatoes 100% winners (The Night Manager and Pluribus) and five other shows above 95% (The Pitt, Fallout, Heated Rivalry, Ponies, and A Knight of Seven Kingdoms). Even the \"worst\" of the bunch, Landman, is sitting at a solid 78%. Good job watching good shows, America!\n\nHere's the full list of the top 10 most-streamed shows of January 2026 across all major streaming services, as compiled by JustWatch.\n\nIf you're into high-stake international espionage, you have to check the most-streamed series this week. The Night Manager is based on John le Carre's best-selling novel and stars Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine, an MI-6 agent whose mission is to infiltrate the inner circle of dangerous arms trader Richard \"Dickie\" Onslow Roper, played by Hugh Laurie. It has been ten long years since the show first premiered, but both seasons of this BBC-made series are available in full as of Feb. 1, so binge it up, man. Stream The Night Manager on Prime Video.\n\nHBO's gritty, hyper-realistic medical drama has earned acclaim from critics and audiences for its relentless pace, following a single 15-hour shift at the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. Starring Noah Wyle as Dr. Michael Robinavitch, The Pitt ditches the \"disease-of-the-week\" format of many medical shows in favor of a study of the toll the modern medical system places on everyone involved. Season one earned five Emmy awards, and judging from the first few episodes, season two might win more. Stream The Pitt on HBO Max.\n\nPost-apocalyptic action-comedy Fallout is like nothing that’s been on TV before. Staying true to the gritty, gruesome, and irreverent spirit of the video games upon which it is based, it follows naive former vault dweller Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) as she leaves her protected bunker to track down her father in the irradiated Wasteland. The show’s standout characters include Lucy’s duplicitous pop (Kyle MacLachlan), conflicted mech-warrior Maximus (Aaron Moten), and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), the walking, talking, noseless, undead remains of a pre-apocalypse Hollywood cowboy. Season one earned a staggering 17 Emmy nominations in 2024, and the just-finished season two earned even greater critical acclaim for its expansion into the iconic ruins of New Vegas. Stream Fallout on Prime Video.\n\nIf you want explicit hockey player-on-hockey player action with a 98% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, HBO's Heated Rivalry is a must-watch. Set against the hyper-masculine, hyper-homophobic world of professional sports, the series brings emotional depth to the story of a years-long secret romance between Canadian \"golden boy\" Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Russian bad boy Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie). Stream Heated Rivalry on HBO Max.\n\nA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms takes fans back to Westeros, 100 years before the events of Game of Thrones. Based on George R.R. Martin’s Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas, the series is less about world-spanning politics and more about smaller, character driven moments in the lives of humble, towering knight Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey) and his diminutive, mysterious squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). It's shorter, lighter, and funnier than its forebears (but not too light—this is still Westeros, after all). Stream Knights of the Seven Kingdoms on HBO Max.\n\nA veritable streaming institution, Stranger Things reached its end with season five. Set in November 1987, the final chapter follows the Hawkins gang in a mission to find and kill Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) while navigating a town under strict military quarantine. From Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) evading a new government threat to Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) unlocking his psychic potential to protect his friends, the series remains an emotional masterclass in supernatural sci-fi horror—despite a divisive finale. Stream Stranger Things on Netflix.\n\nCreator and executive producer Vince Gilligan takes a hard turn from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul with Pluribus, a slow-burn post-apocalyptic sci-fi series starring Rhea Seehorn as Carol Sturka, a stubborn and irascible novelist in Albuquerque who finds herself one of the last 13 individuals on Earth in the wake of viral outbreak that has turned the rest of the species into a hive mind. \"They\" aren't (isn't?) exactly evil, but they are extremely persistent about trying to get the mysteriously immune Carol to join their ranks (as nicely but firmly as possible). Stream Pluribus on Apple TV+.\n\nYellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan's Landman is is a gritty modern Western set in the oil fields of West Texas. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Tommy Norris, a \"crisis executive\" for an oil company who must navigate a law-light landscape of roughnecks, billionaires, and dangerous drug cartels in order to make sure fuel keeps getting dug out of the ground. Stream Landman on Paramount+.\n\nBased on the 2020 novel by Alice Feeney, His & Hers is a twisty mystery thriller series that stars Tessa Thompson as Anna Andrews, a disgraced Atlanta journalist who returns to her small Georgia hometown to cover a brutal murder, only to find her estranged husband, Detective Jack Harper (Jon Bernthal), leading the investigation. As the former couple competes to solve the case, each grows more suspicious that the other is the killer. The six-episode run makes it a great series if you're longing for an engaging drama with a definite conclusion. Stream His & Hers on Netflix.\n\nIn international espionage parlance, \"ponies\" are \"persons of no interest.\" In this case, that Bea (Emilia Clarke) and Twila (Haley Lu Richardson), two American women in Cold War Moscow whose \"normal\" lives are upended when their CIA agent husbands die in a mysterious plane crash. The pair convince the U.S. government to let them try to infiltrate the KGB and find out the truth of what happened, using their ordinariness as the ultimate cover. Boasting a 96% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the eight-episode season balances steamy romance with intense espionage. Stream Ponies on Peacock.",

    "title": "Car Icons Are Disappearing From Google Maps in Android Auto (but You Might Be Able to Fix It)",
    "description": "How to fix disappearing car icons when using Google Maps with Android Auto.",
    "fullText": "Android Auto users are reporting a bug that is making their cars disappear from the road—ok, not literally, but within Google Maps. On both Reddit and Google's own support forums, drivers now say their car icons are sporadically disappearing from their navigation screens while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. Some users have discovered workarounds, but the fixes don't appear to be consistent for everyone. Here's what's happening, and what you can do to try to fix it.\n\nThe news first started popping up six days ago, on a Reddit thread where multiple users reported problems with their car icons disappearing while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. According to these drivers, when the bug was triggered, the map would move around normally, and traffic data and navigation instructions continued to display as expected. However, the icon indicating their car's position would suddenly disappear from their screen, making it difficult to know where exactly they were in comparison to the road. That's not ideal if you're trying to judge when your next turn is coming up.\n\nAccording to the thread's original poster, the issue popped up for them on the Android Auto version 16.1 release, although others mentioned the issue occurring as far back as version 15.9. The bug doesn't appear to happen all the time, but \"reliably\" appears when leaving Google Maps, opening another app in fullscreen, and either returning to Google Maps in fullscreen or pulling it up alongside the new app in a splitscreen view. To get their icon back, the original poster had to force quit Google Maps on their phone, but this wouldn't stop the bug from occurring again in the future. Google itself has not yet offered public comment on the issue, although I've reached out to the company and will update this post when I hear back.\n\nIf you're encountering a disappearing car icon while using Google Maps through Android Auto, there are a few fixes that have worked for community members, although whether they'll work for everyone appears to be inconsistent.\n\nThe timing of this bug appears to line up with the Android Auto v16.1 release, which launched last week. While the bug has been reported appearing on older versions of the app, like Android Auto v15.9, it could be worth trying out another version of Android Auto to see if it clears up the issue. For instance, one user mentioned that installing Android Auto V16.0.66 fixed the issue for them. If you're on an older version, you can update to a newest one from the Android Auto listing on the Play Store. If you're on a newest version and want to try an older one, though, you'll need to uninstall your Android Auto app and manually sideload the older version using a trusted APK file. Because these can be tricky to verify, this might not be the best option for most people.\n\nMultiple users in the original Reddit thread, including the original poster, pointed out that the bug only seems to affect them when using a non-default car icon. Until Google issues a fix, one solution might be to change your car icon back to the standard white arrow within a blue circle. To change your car icon in Google Maps, open the app on your phone while not connected to Android Auto. Start navigating to a location. Tap on your car icon, and swipe left or right to adjust the icon until you land on the default white arrow within a blue circle. The next time you connect your Google Maps app to Android Auto, your car's icon should be updated. Note that this isn't a guaranteed fix. One user on a Google support forum, for instance, said that their arrow icon also disappeared from Google Maps in Android Auto when returning from another app.\n\nIf there is one saving grace to this bug, it's that the circumstances for triggering it seem to be pretty consistent. That means you can largely avoid it if you simply don't leave the Google Maps app once you open it. But while that might be OK for short trips, it's not ideal for longer ones, where you might want to adjust a podcast or playlist during your drive. You can manually restart your Google Maps app on your phone every time the bug pops up, but not only is that annoying, it's possibly dangerous if you're in the middle of a drive.\n\nIf none of the above fixes work for you and you want to retain the ability to exit your fullscreen navigation app without losing your car icon, it might be worth putting Google Maps to bed for now and using an alternative navigation app. Google's own Waze app, for instance, works with Android Auto and does not seem to have this bug right now. Alternative navigation apps do have their own pros and cons, as Waze focuses less on comprehensive mapping and more on real-time crowdsourced traffic information when determining routes. However, it might be worth a shot. If Waze doesn't work for you, other popular navigation apps compatible with Android Auto include Sygic GPS and TomTom - Maps & Traffic (formerly TomTom AmiGo).",

    "title": "Apple's 'Lockdown Mode' Could Stop the Government From Breaking Into Your iPhone",
    "description": "Lockdown Mode saved a journalist's iPhone from the FBI. Do you need it?",
    "fullText": "In January, the FBI made headlines after it raided the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson. It was a shocking case of law enforcement not just overriding one journalist's privacy, but the integrity of the entire news organization. The devices the FBI seized—which included personal devices as well as a Washington Post-issued laptop—contained Natanson's personal contacts, correspondences, and the Slack channels of the Washington Post itself.\n\nBut while the FBI was able to access some of the devices, it was not able to access Natanson's iPhone. That's because the device was in Lockdown Mode, which prevented the FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) from breaking into it. This isn't a setting that is exclusive to journalists: You have this option baked into your iPhone as well, and can choose to turn it on at any time. The thing is, unless you're a high-profile target, you probably don't want to.\n\nLockdown Mode is an option on iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs, designed for users who could be the target of sophisticated cyberattacks. Think politicians, businessmen, activists, and, of course, journalists—really, anyone high-profile that works or takes action in a way that could draw the ire of powerful organizations or governments.\n\nBecause attackers target devices with spyware, the goal of Lockdown Mode is to reduce the attack surface of your device in order to prevent potential cyberattacks from working. Attackers can install spyware on a target's device in a number of ways, through links, attachments, wired connections, and file downloads, the same way you can install malware by clicking a malicious link in an email, or downloading a corrupt extension from the web. Lockdown Mode locks down these vulnerabilities and eliminates as many potential attack routes as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, Lockdown Mode severely impacts a number of functions you may use on your device every day. According to Apple, that includes the following:\n\nMessages: Lockdown Mode will block most message attachment types, other than \"certain images, video, and audio.\" Links and link previews are blocked.\n\nWeb browsing: The feature blocks \"complex web technologies,\" which could impact how certain websites load or function. You may not see certain web fonts, and you may see missing image icons in place of pictures.\n\nFaceTime: Incoming FaceTime calls are blocked, except for contacts you have called within the past 30 days. You can't use SharePlay or take Live Photos in FaceTime calls.\n\nApple services: Invitations to Apple services like invites to manage a smart home are blocked, unless you have previously invited that person. GameCenter will not work, and Focuses will not work \"as expected.\"\n\nDevice connections: Your device needs to be unlocked before it can communicate with another computer. In addition, your Mac also requires your explicit approval before the connection can be made.\n\nWireless connectivity: You won't automatically join non-secure wifi networks, and you will disconnect from existing non-secure wifi networks. Lockdown Mode also blocks 2G and 3G cellular support.\n\nConfiguration profiles: You can't install configuration profiles, and the device can't enroll in Mobile Device Management.\n\nApple makes a point to say that phone calls and \"plain text messages\" will work as normal, however incoming calls won't ring on your Apple Watch. Emergency SOS also will continue to work.\n\nThese restrictions make it much more difficult for a bad actor to install spyware on your device, though it also makes it more difficult to use your device. A shared album invite could contain malware, but by removing the feature entirely, you miss out on photos from friends and family. Any spyware coming from a malicious link or image will be blocked, but if you frequently send photos, videos, and other attachments in Messages, you'll miss out.\n\nThat's why these measures are really designed only for individuals who think they'll be targeted by sophisticated actors. It seems that could include governments secretly installing spyware on targets' devices, or the FBI stealing your device in a raid. It's worth noting that the FBI was able to access Natanson's other devices, including a MacBook Pro that unlocked with her fingerprint. The agency's warrant compelled Natanson to unlock her devices with biometrics if they were enabled. Lockdown Mode could not have prevented that, so it's not clear why the FBI didn't force Natanson to unlock the iPhone in question, too.\n\nIf you understand the restrictions, but still want to try Lockdown Mode, you'll need to be running the following software version on each of the Apple devices you want to use Lockdown Mode with:\n\nApple Watch: watchOS 10 or later\n\nApple says \"additional protections\" are available for iOS 17, iPadOS 17, or macOS Sonoma or later. In addition, you should update your device to the latest software version before turning on Lockdown Mode if you want all the latest protections.\n\nYou can turn on Lockdown Mode on any of your Apple devices, but you must do so individually on each. You'll find the option at the bottom of the \"Privacy & Security\" section in Settings (System Settings on Mac). Hit \"Turn On Lockdown Mode,\" then review the pop-up that appears and choose \"Turn On Lockdown Mode\" again. You'll need to choose to \"Turn On & Restart,\" then enter your device's password or passcode for the feature to take effect.",

    "description": "The FBI is looking into all leads.",
    "fullText": "The investigation continues into the disappearance of Today host Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy Guthrie, but the FBI just made their first arrest related to the case.\n\nFBI Phoenix Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke announced at a press conference on February 5 that a suspect was arrested in connection with the fake ransom note sent to news outlets on February 3, which the FBI later denied the validity of. “We have made one arrest related to an imposter ransom demand, and a complaint will be presented to a magistrate judge later today,” Janke said. “You will get more on that from the FBI and our U.S. Attorney’s office here in Arizona when it becomes available.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie's Sister Recalls Her Mom's Last Movements as Police Address Reports Her Husband Is the Prime Suspect in the Abduction Case\n\nOfficials Reveal if They Think Savannah Guthrie's Mom Is Still 'Alive' After Concerning Evidence Sparked the Involvement of Homicide Detectives\n\nHe continued, “There’s no evidence to connect this to Nancy’s case. It was someone that was trying to profit off it.”\n\nJanke also issued a warning against those planning to offer fake evidence as a way to secure the $50,000 reward for Nancy’s whereabouts. “My next message is to those imposters who are trying to take advantage and profit from this situation. We will investigate and ensure you are held accountable for your actions,” Janke said. “This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well being. You still have the time to do the right thing before this becomes a worse, much worse scenario for you.”\n\nTMZ reported on February 3 that it received an alleged ransom note demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin for the release of Savannah’s mother. According to TMZ, the note was sent on Tuesday morning and included a specific Bitcoin address for the payment to be sent, which the outlet verified was real.\n\nThe FBI’s arrest over the fake ransom note came less than a day after Mary Coleman, an anchor for Arizona’s KOLD 13 News, which also received the note via email, claimed it was “clear after a couple sentences” that it “might not be a hoax.”\n\n“A lot of it is information that only someone who was holding her for ransom would know,” she said in an appearance on CNN on February 4. “Some very sensitive information and things that people who weren’t there when she was taken captive wouldn’t know.”\n\nShe continued, “We immediately sent that information over to the sheriff’s department … One of the detectives did get back to us and asked us for some more information so that they can start searching for an IP address, things of that nature, to try and figure out what people are responsible here.”\n\nColeman added that the note “included a dollar amount, a deadline” and other dteails that only “Guthrie’s abductor might know, so that definitely raised some red flags.”\n\nThe arrest over the bogus note also comes after Savannah and her siblings, sister Annie and brother Camron, posted an Instagram video with a plea to Nancy’s potential abductor. “We too have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,” Savannah said. “As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please, reach out to us.”\n\nSavannah went on to call Nancy “our heart and our home,” before expressing her concern for her mother’s health “She is 84 years old,” Savannah said. “Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,” she said.\n\nShe continued, “On behalf of our family, we want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too. Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She is funny, spunky, and clever. She has grandchildren that adore her and crowd around her and cover her in kisses. She loves fun and adventure. She is a devoted friend. She is full of kindness and knowledge. Talk to her and you’ll see.”\n\nShe ended the video with a message to her mother, “Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God’s precious daughter, Nancy. We believe and know that even in this valley He is with you. Everyone is looking for you mommy, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again. We speak to you every moment and we pray without ceasing and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you.” She captioned the post, “Bring her home.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "A brief video of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking at a church celebration surfaced online this week. It went viral, with millions of views and many comments that focused more on her appearance than on what she was saying.\n\nThe 33-second video, which initially aired on C-SPAN on September 22, 2022, shows Rep. Ocasio-Cortez celebrating the First Baptist Church of Corona for its 100th anniversary. In the video, she talks about the church’s longstanding food pantry program, its employment programs for young people, its pandemic relief efforts, and its service to its diverse immigrant community in Queens.\n\nThe video went viral when someone posted it on X with the caption “Jesus Christ.” It earned over 3 million views. Many of the comments were crude jokes and memes about Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s looks. Some inappropriate jokes and quotes included her picture and made political and socialist jokes.\n\nJesus Christ pic.twitter.com/SvmXVLiLIO https://t.co/WDpEjOGjdW\n\n(@SavinTheBees) February 5, 2026\n\nAmong the comments were mixed views. For example, one person said, “Goddamn it, we’re gonna lose the midterms.” The following comment said, “Call her anything but not ugly.” The following comment said, “It’s beautiful, I’m team AOC 2028.”\n\nThe viral video and comments were distracting many from what Rep. Ocasio-Cortez initially talked about. For example, she spoke about the First Baptist Church of Corona and its role as an anchor in the community under Pastor Patrick H. Young.\n\nThe post Old Church Clip of AOC Goes Viral as Internet Fixates on Her Outfit Instead of Her Words appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.",

    "title": "Why Man Utd are taking their time over manager decision",
    "description": "Some are calling for Michael Carrick to be made permanent Man Utd manager, but the club will not rush a decision.",
    "fullText": "Michael Carrick has made an impressive start to his second stint as Manchester United head coach.\n\nThree games, three wins, with Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta and Marco Silva the managers beaten. A place in the top four - enough to secure a return to the Champions League next season - beckons, barely a month after many feared a second consecutive campaign with no European football.\n\nLittle wonder there are some observers who already think United should give Carrick the job permanently.\n\nMost still caution against - for now.\n\nUnited themselves are staying silent.\n\nWhen they dismissed Ruben Amorim on 5 January, club insiders vowed to run a 'proper process' during which they would assess all suitable candidates. Speaking to people with an understanding of the situation, that has not changed.\n\nThere are some very valid reasons why it might be quite a while before United announce their decision.\n\nMan Utd prepare to honour Munich disaster victims\n\nWhen United sacked Jose Mourinho in December 2018, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was given the job until the end of the season.\n\nIt was hoped the club legend's general positivity could raise spirits.\n\nThe results were spectacular. United won the first eight games of Solskjaer's tenure, including a Premier League match at Tottenham and an FA Cup tie at Arsenal.\n\nThe only defeat in his first 17 games was at home to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League - a result United overturned three weeks later as a Marcus Rashford penalty completed a victory that ranks alongside any in the club's illustrious history.\n\nThree weeks later, Solskjaer was given a three-year contract.\n\nUnited won two and lost eight of their final 12 games.\n\nThat loss of form fuels the argument United blundered in moving too early and that Solskjaer would not have got the job had they waited until the summer.\n\nA different man - Sir Jim Ratcliffe - is running football operations these days, but that historical example alone suggests United are better off waiting.\n\nThe other major reason to delay a decision is because a number of potential candidates who are currently in jobs will become available.\n\nIn the Premier League alone that includes Oliver Glasner, who has already said he will be leaving Crystal Palace, Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola and Fulham's Silva.\n\nYet Glasner is an example of how short-term results can affect long-term thinking.\n\nA Europa League winner at Eintracht Frankfurt, he won Palace the first silverware in their history when they beat Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final. They also won the Community Shield against Liverpool.\n\nBut things have unravelled this season.\n\nGlasner left key players out of Palace's final Conference League game in December. A home draw with Finland's KuPS meant Palace missed out on direct entry to the last 16 and must play Bosnian outfit Zrinjski in the play-offs later this month.\n\nThe KuPS game was in the early part of an ongoing run of 12 games without a win.\n\nThe eight defeats in that sequence include an embarrassing FA Cup loss at National League North outfit Macclesfield. Palace are 15th in the Premier League - nine points above third-bottom West Ham - and it is not certain Glasner will see out the season.\n\nThen there are the international managers.\n\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel spoke to United before and after the 2024 FA Cup final as the club deliberated about Erik ten Hag's future. United have also long been linked with Mauricio Pochettino, who is in charge of the US national side.\n\nThat duo, plus Carlo Ancelotti (Brazil) and Julian Nagelsmann (Germany), are other highly regarded coaches likely to be on United's radar.\n\nBut hiring a national team boss around a major tournament is fraught with issues.\n\nIn 1990, England boss Bobby Robson was referred to by some as a \"traitor\" for agreeing a post-tournament contract with PSV Eindhoven, even though he had been pilloried for the previous two years.\n\nJulen Lopetegui was sacked by Spain two days before the start of the 2018 World Cup after Real Madrid confirmed he would join them after the tournament.\n\nSpeaking to a source with first-hand knowledge of appointing managers and coaches at club and international level, it became clear signing a contract with the likes of Tuchel before the tournament is not advisable.\n\n\"Even if there are private conversations between senior club representatives and a coach at a major country, there is no way that can become a formal agreement pre-World Cup,\" they said.\n\n\"If it came out, it would balloon in the face of whichever coach it was. It would be massively destabilising. It's just not worth it.\n\n\"You can have discreet meetings - they happen all the time in football - but it would be much more beneficial to do groundwork.\n\n\"There are a few issues anyway. If they agreed privately with someone at the end of April, what would happen if Michael Carrick had a fantastic end to the season? Depending on how the World Cup went - good or bad - you must think of the impact it might have on reputation.\n\n\"Manchester United have to let it breathe a little bit.\"\n\nThe counterargument is players want clarity.\n\nDefender Harry Maguire is out of contract in the summer, and United have targets to pursue, with midfielders Elliott Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba high on their list.\n\nIt does not seem unreasonable for those players to ask who their manager would be.\n\nThe uncertainty did not help Ralf Rangnick, who presided over a 2021-22 campaign that unravelled spectacularly - winning just five of the last 19 games, including an FA Cup defeat at home to Championship outfit Middlesbrough.\n\nCarrick does not see the same situation unfolding under him.\n\n\"I've got no concerns,\" he said. \"The lads have been better than you can imagine.\n\n\"We're all aware of the bigger situation and what might happen but as a player, you focus on what's ahead of you and try to achieve what you can.\"\n\nUnited clearly want to get the decision right, but as the demands on managers increase, the time they are given to succeed is reduced.\n\nEven if Carrick were to leave at the end of the season, his 17 games in charge would not even make the top eight of shortest reigns at a Premier League club - and would exceed Ange Postecoglou, who only lasted five games and 39 days at Nottingham Forest this season.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Holders Newcastle United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Manchester City on Wednesday night and a challenging season shows no sign of relenting.",
    "fullText": "Newcastle United players waited impatiently in the tunnel at the Etihad.\n\nIt was three minutes until kick-off and the Carabao Cup holders were desperate to get going as a bemused Kieran Trippier looked around and wondered where his counterparts from Manchester City were.\n\nThere was no sign of Pep Guardiola's team.\n\nThe hosts took their time to emerge from the dressing room, but they quickly left Newcastle in a daze after racing into a 3-0 lead in the second leg of their semi-final.\n\nOn a day chief executive David Hopkinson doubled down on his assertion that Newcastle will be competing for the biggest prizes by 2030, the naive visitors looked a long way off in that first half.\n\nHead coach Eddie Howe certainly did not hold back in the away dressing room as he made a triple change at half-time.\n\n\"I was really annoyed,\" he said.\n\nNewcastle managed to rally after the break and pulled one back through substitute Anthony Elanga as they bowed out with a 5-1 defeat on aggregate.\n\nDespite the loss, those 5,400 supporters in the away end repeatedly chanted \"Eddie Howe's black and white army\", in recognition of the head coach who ended the club's seven-decade wait for a major domestic trophy in this very competition.\n\nBut this has been a challenging season for Newcastle and it shows no signs of relenting.\n\nIn truth, Newcastle have yet to catch fire six months into the campaign.\n\nThat may seem a curious statement.\n\nNewcastle have reached a third EFL Cup semi-final in four years.\n\nHowe's side remain favourites to progress past Qarabag into the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nThey could still get back to Wembley through the FA Cup - even if an awkward fourth-round tie against Aston Villa awaits next week.\n\nBut Newcastle sit in 11th place in the Premier League.\n\nThe players previously spoke among themselves about trying to make history once again by becoming the first Newcastle side to qualify for the Champions League in successive campaigns.\n\nHowever, this travel sick team have only won two away games in the top flight this season.\n\nHowe's men have picked up just 11 points from a possible 36 against those sides currently above them in the division.\n\nThey have dropped 16 points from winning positions.\n\nIt has felt like a season of transition, following the damaging departure of top scorer Alexander Isak, and Howe's response was telling when asked if he could tolerate such a word this week.\n\n\"I can,\" he said. \"Transition from the team is an obvious one because we brought players in from the summer and we lost players in the summer.\n\n\"There was always going to be a change to the team. Now change doesn't have to be negative - it can be positive. We are trying to find that flow and rhythm that we have been searching for all season, really.\n\n\"In terms of the club, it's growing and changing all the time and I think will continue to change in the next few years, probably at a rapid pace at some stage. The club is definitely in transition - but transitioning for the positive in my opinion.\"\n\nThere have certainly been glimpses of what this team could be in recent weeks.\n\nThere was a devastating first-half display against Chelsea, a spirited hour away to Paris St-Germain and a fine opening half an hour or so at Anfield.\n\nBut games are not won in snatches.\n\nIt has been a frustration of the coaching staff that they have lacked the training time during an unrelenting run of fixtures to really work on things and piece it all together like they have during previous sticky spells.\n\nInstead the players have come to rely on meeting rooms, analysis sessions and walk-throughs.\n\nThis is the reality of life at clubs who aspire to fight on multiple fronts, of course, but competing in four competitions was an unprecedented feat for Newcastle going into February.\n\nThe relentless nature of the schedule has had a knock-on effect on the squad - Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Tino Livramento and Fabian Schar are all currently sidelined, while Anthony Gordon hobbled off with a hamstring issue on Wednesday night.\n\nIt has also had an impact on the adaptation of Newcastle's summer signings who, aside from defender Malick Thiaw, are still finding their feet at the club.\n\nThiaw, Jacob Ramsey, Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa all joined in the final fortnight or so of a turbulent window, in which the club operated without a sporting director and missed out on a host of top targets.\n\nNewcastle, remarkably, are still searching for a settled combination in the final third despite spending £179m on forwards.\n\nElanga enjoyed a lively second-half cameo at the Etihad, but Woltemade was substituted at half-time - having failed to score since December - while the rusty Wissa missed a host of good chances in both legs.\n\nIt leaves Newcastle with more questions than answers as they embark on a crunch run of fixtures.\n\n\"Where does that leave our season?\" Howe asked. \"We're still fighting on several fronts.\n\n\"The games are coming thick and fast. There's no let-up for us. We need to get back to winning ways as quickly as possible. It's the only thing that gives you new energy.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Tries: Bielle-Biarrey 2, Jalibert, Ollivon, Attissogbe Cons: Ramos 4 Pen: Ramos\n\nTries: Timoney, Milne Cons: Prendergast 2\n\nRuthless France inflicted more pain on Ireland as the Six Nations holders opened their title defence with a bonus-point victory at a buoyant Stade de France.\n\nHaving crushed Ireland's title hopes in emphatic fashion in Dublin last year, Les Bleus - with returning captain Antoine Dupont pulling the strings - roared into a 22-0 half-time lead following a one-sided first half that was not without controversy.\n\nFrance's first try was scored by the electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey, but only after what appeared to be a forward pass in the build-up.\n\nMatthieu Jalibert and Charles Ollivon also crossed in the first half, before 2025 top try-scorer Bielle-Biarrey's stylish second secured France's bonus point seven minutes after the interval.\n\nAt that point, France looked poised to surpass the 42 points they managed in Dublin last year, but Ireland refused to give in and narrowed the deficit with tries from replacement forwards Nick Timoney and Michael Milne.\n\nThe hosts, however, had the final word when Theo Attissogbe capped a thoroughly satisfying evening for the tournament favourites.\n\nThe Irish leave the French capital bruised and empty-handed and must regroup in time to face Italy in Dublin on 14 February, with France travelling to Wales the following day.\n\nIreland well beaten by France to start Six Nations - reaction\n\nWith an extensive injury list, this was always going to be a big ask for Ireland.\n\nSeverely depleted at both prop positions and without potential gamebreakers like Hugo Keenan and Mack Hansen, Farrell's hand was weakened before he brought his squad back to the scene of their agonising World Cup quarter-final loss to New Zealand in 2023.\n\nBut even if Ireland feel hard done by calls that did not go their way, there is no question they were simply outplayed at times by a scintillating French outfit driven on by a delighted Parisian crowd.\n\nWhile Ollivon's knock-on denied France a second-minute try, Bordeaux speedster Bielle-Biarrey beat Jamison Gibson-Park, rode Sam Prendergast's tap tackle and ghosted past Jacob Stockdale to finish a move that featured a suspected forward pass from Nicolas Depoortere to Yoram Moefana.\n\nThe high-intensity, unstructured nature of the game suited France's fleet-footed backline, but it was an Irish defensive lapse that led to the home side's second try.\n\nAfter Tommy O'Brien was forced to dot the ball down in the Irish in-goal area and concede a scrum, Dupont - making his Test return after suffering a serious knee injury against Ireland 11 months ago - popped the ball to Jalibert for the fly-half to mark his first international appearance since last year's Six Nations with a well-taken try.\n\nWith Ireland already on the ropes, Ollivon surged past Caelan Doris and slid across the whitewash to give the hosts a commanding halfway lead.\n\nIt was also the first time Ireland were held to zero points in a first half since 2020.\n\nWhen Bielle-Biarrey scampered clear for his second - after a Dupont chip and outrageous volley with the outside of his left boot from Thomas Ramos - and France's fourth try, Ireland looked on course to be on the end of one of their heaviest defeats.\n\nBut a gutsy second-half display - that echoed November's chaotic defeat by South Africa - allowed them to at least get a few scores on the board, with Timoney finishing after a line-break from his Ulster team-mate Stuart McCloskey.\n\nThen replacement tight-head prop Milne marked his Six Nations debut when he burrowed over after another McCloskey surge.\n\nA third Irish try would have stirred French nerves but, while Farrell's side applied pressure, France's defence stood firm, allowing their backs to finish with a flourish as Attissogbe crossed in the corner to complete a miserable Stade de France return for Ireland.\n\nWithout established Test veterans Uini Atonio, Gregory Alldritt, Damian Penaud and Gael Fickou, this was a glimpse into France's destructive potential.\n\nFor Ireland, however, they face into a difficult week following their autumn losses to New Zealand and South Africa with another humbling reverse against a fellow member of the world's top five.\n\nFrance: Ramos; Attissogbe, Depoortere, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Dupont (capt); Gros, Marchand, Aldegheri, Ollivon, Guillard, Cros, Jegou, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Mauvaka, Neti, Montagne, Auradou, Meafou, Nouchi, Serin, Gourgues.\n\nIreland: Osborne; O'Brien, Ringrose, McCloskey, Stockdale; S Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Loughman, Sheehan, Clarkson, McCarthy, Beirne, C Prendergast, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: Kelleher, Milne, Bealham, Ryan, Conan, Timoney, Casey, Crowley.\n\nAssistant Referees: Angus Gardner (Aus) & Jordan Way (Aus)\n\nTelevision match official: Ian Tempest (Eng)\n\nFoul play review officer: Richard Kelly (NZ)",

    "fullText": "Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend insists he and his side have learned from their autumn failings before they start their Six Nations campaign against Italy in Rome on Saturday.\n\nBookended by comfortable wins against the United States and Tonga, the Scots threw away a 21-point lead to lose against Argentina and were unable to capitalise on a wave of second-half momentum in their defeat to New Zealand in November.\n\nTownsend will reach his 100th match in charge of the national team during the Six Nations but has faced criticism from some fans and pundits who feel he has taken Scotland as far as he can.\n\nThey finished third in the 2018 tournament - Townsend's first campaign - and have not bettered that in the seven editions since, also coming third in 2023.\n\n\"It's something we definitely have addressed and looked at,\" Townsend said when asked about Scotland's propensity to fall away at the end of matches.\n\n\"A lot of it is on me as a coach. I think the use of the bench and how we bring on players potentially together rather than ones or twos, a real focus on what we do in that final quarter.\n\n\"I'd never seen the team do something like they did [against Argentina] and we just didn't have a response.\n\n\"Every time I've seen this team go behind, we have had a response. So that was disappointing. We learned a lot that day, things that will be really valuable when we go into the Six Nations.\"\n\nPodcast: Townsend speculation & bold team selection\n\nScotland leave out Van der Merwe, Kinghorn & Graham\n\nScotland's Townsend denies signing Newcastle deal\n\nScotland's rising star poised for sliding doors moment\n\nTownsend has named a surprising team for Scotland's Six Nations opener in Italy, leaving out Duhan van der Merwe, Darcy Graham and Blair Kinghorn, while including a strong contingent from in-form Glasgow Warriors.\n\nDespite Glasgow's storming season in both the Champions Cup and United Rugby Championship, Scottish expectations are still relatively low heading into the Six Nations, largely because of the underwhelming autumn series.\n\n\"We want to set out to play a consistent level of rugby close to our best,\" Townsend said when asked what success would look like in this year's tournament.\n\n\"I know if we say we're going to play our best rugby for five games, that's unrealistic, but a consistent level that puts us in positions to win.\n\n\"We believe in our squad. We believe in what they can achieve and what they've done at times for over 80 minutes.\n\n\"We know what we've got and we know we've got this run of games that we've got to attack with real confidence, but we also know all the other teams are saying the same things and they are planning to get three, four or five wins.\n\n\"But that's a great thing about the Six Nations, it's very competitive right now.\"\n\nScotland have lost only one of their past 15 matches against Italy, but that came on their last visit to the Stadio Olimpico in 2024.\n\nThat was another Scottish second-half collapse as the hosts came from behind to win 31-29.\n\nTownsend is not underestimating the Italians as the Scots aim to start well before facing England at Murrayfield and Wales in Cardiff.\n\n\"It's a tough one to play away from home against a team that's been more than competitive,\" Townsend said.\n\n\"We've had some real tough battles with them. They beat us in Rome two years ago. They're getting sell-outs in that stadium now. It's a really noisy atmosphere.\n\n\"They have a cohesive team and players who have played together for a number of years, real talented individuals. We know it's a very tough game.\n\nBefore he brings up his century, Townsend says he never expected to be in the job this long, while insisting his hunger for the role remains.\n\nHe also played down a report suggesting he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nThe 52-year-old added: \"I remember when I first got into coaching and especially when I became a head coach at Glasgow, I thought: 'I'm loving this. I'm going to give it everything and if it doesn't work out, it's not meant to be'.\n\n\"I've tried to have that mindset all the time. It is something I love doing, but I just feel so privileged and lucky to have had the opportunity after the playing career.\n\n\"To get nine seasons and to be coming into 100 [matches in charge], it's above what I would have expected or dreamed of.\"",

    "fullText": "The Saudi Pro League has warned Cristiano Ronaldo \"no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club\" amid doubts over his future at Al-Nassr.\n\nThe Portugal forward, 41, was left out of Al-Nassr's squad for Monday's Saudi Pro League game against Al-Riyadh.\n\nPortuguese outlet A Bola, external reported Ronaldo refused to play, having grown dissatisfied with how the club was being run by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).\n\nBBC Sport has been told former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema's move to league leaders Al-Hilal from Al‑Ittihad earlier this week was the principle reason for Ronaldo's frustration at Al-Nassr.\n\nFrench striker Benzema, 38, scored a hat-trick on his debut for Al-Hilal in a 6-0 win over Al-Okhdood on Thursday.\n\nBoth Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal - the country's most successful club with 19 league titles - are among the teams controlled by the PIF, which also backs Newcastle United.\n\nRonaldo posted a picture of himself back in training on Wednesday, but BBC Sport understands Saudi Pro League officials are unsure if he will play against Al‑Ittihad on Friday.\n\nWhat is going on with Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia?\n\nIn a statement issued to BBC Sport, a Saudi Pro League spokesperson said: \"The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules.\n\n\"Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.\"\n\nRonaldo joined Al-Nassr in 2022 after leaving Manchester United mid-season, becoming the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of £177m, but has only won the Arab Club Champions Cup with them.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner signed a new two-year contract in June 2025.\n\nBefore he agreed the new deal, however, there was speculation he might leave Al-Nassr with a loan move to rivals Al-Hilal among those touted.\n\n\"Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al-Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition,\" added the Saudi Pro League spokesperson. \"Like any elite competitor, he wants to win.\n\n\"But no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club.\n\n\"Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.\"\n\nAl-Nassr only signed Iraq Under-23 midfielder Hayder Abdulkareem in the January transfer window.\n\nAl-Hilal are unbeaten in the league this season and lead with 50 points after 20 games, while Al-Nassr are four points behind in third place, although they have a game in hand.\n\nThe Saudi Pro League spokesperson said: \"The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.\n\n\"The focus remains on football - on the pitch, where it belongs - and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympics athlete, you pick yourself up and try again.",
    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training;  when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

But don't let it distract from what's going on inside the stadium, that's all I'm asking for.\"",

    "fullText": "Jack Draper says he is \"winning by being here\" as he made an emphatic return after a lengthy injury lay-off to help Great Britain take control of their Davis Cup qualifying tie against Norway.\n\nBritish number one Draper has spent five months on the sidelines with a bruised bone in his service arm.\n\nHis comeback was delayed twice by the injury and he missed January's Australian Open to complete his recovery.\n\nHowever, he served well, moved sharply and showed some brutal ball-striking to bear Viktor Durasovic 6-2 6-2 in his first competitive match for 164 days.\n\nSterner tests will await world number 13 Draper, who is ranked 300 places above Durasovic, but he will be relieved to have rattled through a convincing win after a long spell out.\n\n\"Tennis is a bubble, and sometimes you can get distracted that it's all that matters in life,\" the 24-year-old told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.\n\n\"When you have time out, I used it wisely I think to try and make sure that when I try and come back to tennis, that I'm ready to go all the way again.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that I'm on a really good path. I'm winning by being here.\"\n\nCameron Norrie then gave Britain a 2-0 lead with a characteristically gritty 6-4 6-4 win over teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer.\n\nLloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash can wrap up the best-of-five tie for Britain at the earliest opportunity if they triumph in Friday's doubles.\n\nIf not, Draper and Norrie will have to take to the court again for the reverse singles.\n\nThe winner of the tie in Oslo will face either Australia or Ecuador for a place in November's eight-team Finals.\n\nDavis Cup qualifying: GB lead Norway 2-0 after Norrie & Draper win\n\nRaducanu storms into Transylvania semi-finals\n\nEnglishman Draper said he had \"lots of dark moments\" during the injury lay-off that disrupted his breakout season.\n\nDraper had won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French Opens before being impacted by the injury in his left arm.\n\nHe suffered a second-round exit at Wimbledon and played just one match after before ending his season early.\n\nThere were very few signs of rust against Durasovic, with Draper dropping just 10 points on serve, hitting eight aces and winning 88% of first-serve points.\n\nHe produced three glorious passing shots - two off the backhand and one off the forehand - and moved well behind the baseline to suffocate Durasovic.\n\nHe went a quick break up in both sets and did not face a single break point.\n\nDraper was only taken to deuce once, and that was when he served for the match at 5-2 up in the second. A thumping forehand and a long backhand from his opponent was enough to help the Briton wrap up victory in only 61 minutes.\n\n\"I definitely have to be wary of how the injury is progressing,\" Draper added.\n\n\"I wouldn't be back playing again if me and my team weren't really confident that I can start to build back on the tour again.\n\n\"I definitely have to be sensible at times.\"\n\nNorrie later came back from a 4-1 second-set deficit to see off world number 133 Budkov Kjaer.\n\nBudkov Kjaer, a former Wimbledon junior champion, converted just one of his four break opportunities against Norrie.\n\nDraper looked sharp on his return and there was little sign of rust in what turned out to be a very gentle stroll past Durasovic.\n\nThe 24-year-old had support from a vast travelling Lawn Tennis Association team as well as his new coach Jamie Delgado.\n\nPersonal coaches do not usually travel to Davis Cup ties, but this was the first chance Delgado has had to see Draper in action since succeeding James Trotman in the autumn.\n\nDraper and Delgado are scheduled to head to Rotterdam after this tie for the British number one's return to the ATP Tour.\n\nHow much to play, and how often to rest, will be a delicate balance to strike over the next few months.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Ireland's heavy defeat by France to open the Six Nations will only further press questions raised by a lacklustre autumn.",
    "fullText": "On an earlier than usual Six Nations opening night, Ireland fluffed their lines in Paris on Thursday, beginning their 2026 campaign with a resounding 36-14 defeat by France that was as bruising to the ego as it was the body.\n\nThese sides may have won the past four titles in this competition between them but, for the second season in a row, there was only one winner when they went head-to-head.\n\nAn Ireland performance that was described by their head coach Andy Farrell as lacking \"intent\" continued a number of worrying trends from both the autumn and prior.\n\nComing into the game as considerable underdogs, the head coach had tried to reframe the changing narrative as his side now being the hunter rather than hunted.\n\nFor much of the 80 minutes in Paris, they looked like easy prey for superior opposition.\n\n\"It's coming again next week [against Italy],\" former Ireland lock Donncha O'Callaghan told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This Irish team are on the ropes and everyone is coming after them - they might be the hunted again. They have to find the answers because Six Nations rugby is ruthless and they need to stop the rot.\"\n\nRuthless France thrash Ireland in Six Nations opener\n\nFrance comfortably beat Ireland in Six Nations opener\n\nIreland well beaten by France to start Six Nations - reaction\n\nWith Farrell rolling the dice in his selection - dropping James Lowe as well as giving Cian Prendergast a rare start - there were interesting subplots aplenty as the game neared.\n\nSuch was the nature of the Paris performance, however, that few such themes could be given fair scrutiny.\n\nIreland had picked a team to compete in the air but rarely challenged in that regard with the new-look back three of Jamie Osborne, Tommy O'Brien and Jacob Stockdale largely on the periphery.\n\nWhile the loss of both usual starting props to injury, as well as two back-ups on the loose-head side, was unwanted, it gave the opportunity for others to step up and show what they can do, yet the set-piece was rendered a virtual non-factor.\n\nIndeed, Ireland won a scrum penalty in the 45th minute but, such was the lack of pressure elsewhere, it was the first time Les Bleus had drawn a whistle from Karl Dickson.\n\nDiscipline had been a key area to improve after the autumn but, while Ireland did concede only six penalties, they frequently did not get close enough to infringe either, with 38 missed tackles on the night.\n\nIreland's failure to get to grips with the non-negotiables - what Farrell called the \"main part of the game\" - left little point in sifting through much else.\n\n\"I think you make your own luck in this game,\" said Farrell.\n\n\"Without the ball, I thought we lost that battle in the first half. The things like the high ball and winning the scraps on the floor, running through tackles or missing tackles etc - that's the main part of the game.\n\n\"We certainly came off second best in that regard in the first half. Our response was gallant, but that's not what we want to be, we don't want to be a responding team. We needed to show it from the get go.\"\n\nIrrespective of another World Cup quarter-final exit in 2023 - against, it should be remembered, a New Zealand side who produced a brilliant performance on the night - Ireland felt on par with the very best in the game just a little over two years ago.\n\nThey appeared to put paid to any notion of a World Cup hangover when they opened the 2024 Six Nations against France, winning 38-17 against 14 men in Marseille, but it has subsequently been a very different story.\n\nIn the nine games since against the four sides currently above them in the world rankings, Ireland have won two and lost seven.\n\nFive of the losses, and none of the wins, have been by margins of 10 points or more and there were times, especially when 29-0 down early in the second half, when this appeared the widest gap of the lot.\n\nIreland remain admirably consistent in winning the games that they should win. But winning those that they could win increasingly looks like a bridge too far.\n\nFew sides in the world could cope with losing three players in one position, especially one as specialised as loose-head prop.\n\nJeremy Loughman had just five caps before Thursday's game, while Michael Milne's only previous Tests were as a replacement against Georgia and Portugal.\n\nWhile that certainly speaks to Ireland's injury problems, it is worth noting that even before Ireland's loose-head stocks were decimated, Andrew Porter's two primary back-ups, Jack Boyle and Paddy McCarthy, still have just eight caps between them.\n\nThat can be said to be a legacy of the continued reliance on Cian Healy right up to the point of his retirement last year but the situation in not confined to just one position.\n\nInjuries are inevitable. Yet in the main, Ireland's squad - outside their starting XV and a handful of select others - feels underexposed to the highest level of Test rugby.\n\nFor instance, reserve scrum-half Craig Casey has been part of the squad for almost five years and won his 25th cap from the bench in the Stade de France but has never started a Six Nations game against opposition other than Italy - he saw only seven minutes of action on Thursday.\n\nNick Timoney led the resurgence off the bench. The unwaveringly consistent Ulster back row scored his side's first points of the game and led the belated charge at France.\n\nAlmost five years after his debut, and six months beyond his 30th birthday, this was his first Six Nations cap.\n\n\"You could use the excuses and they are there, the injuries, we haven't the depth of squad to go that deep, but there's been a fundamental thought of relying on the Leinster base and for the last few years that hasn't gone as well for the Leinster team,\" said O'Callaghan.\n\n\"You're trying to integrate players and it's just been too much of a gap.\"",

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.
