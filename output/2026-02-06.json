    "fullText": "The Sixers turned in another third-quarter meltdown to waste a good Joel Embiid performance, falling 119-115 to the Los Angeles Lakers in infuriating fashion.\n\nJoel Embiid had just an okay game against the Clippers in Philadelphia’s barnstorming win on Monday, sitting out the second half of a back-to-back against Golden State the next night. It felt a little bit like he owed these guys something, if for no other reason than having the freshest pair of legs. And boy, did he deliver on that, sparking the Sixers early while playing a do-it-all hub on offense for a team that struggled to make shots for most of the night.\n\nWith the Lakers down Jaxson Hayes thanks to his mascot-related suspension — yes, he really is that big of a clown — DeAndre Ayton was the only guy close to like-sized that L.A. could throw at him. But it didn’t especially matter, outside of a few offensive rebounds Ayton pulled down at his expense. Ayton’s on-again, off-again effort is a bad matchup for an opponent who will take any bit of space and rise into a midrange jumper, and Embiid was able to get the shot going within the first five minutes of the game. When that happens, opponents are in jail trying to guard him, as it opens up opportunities to punish reach-ins and drive by jumpy defenders.\n\nOutside of Ayton, the Lakers mixed up coverages and the defender primarily tasked with guarding Embiid. From Jarred Vanderbilt to Maxi Kleber and others across the spectrum, the main theme was a big size advantage for Embiid. On some nights, that might mean deep post catches and a free-throw parade, but with Embiid often operating from the middle of a zone, it meant a lot of jumpers his man could never get close enough to contest. One little jab step, one little body language cue, and the Lakers were falling all over themselves to stay with him, with Embiid rising into lightly-contested shots for the entire first half. 20 easy points at halftime, thank you very much.\n\nEmbiid had some sloppiness with the handle early, but he was killing the Lakers as a playmaker for others, too, punctuating his first half with an outstanding play: Embiid faked a handoff attempt to Tyrese Maxey, drove downhill into the space the Lakers left vacated, and as the defense collapsed on him in the paint, he released the ball to Dominick Barlow for an easy bucket, sending the Sixers into halftime on a high note.\n\nEverything was rolling along until, you guessed it, the third quarter hit. I cannot believe we are this far into the season and still treating the quarter after halftime as an unsolvable Sphinx riddle for the Sixers to solve. Change the opponent, the venue, the players on the floor, nothing really matters. They will find a way to stink it up all the same.\n\nThere was a decided lack of seriousness from the Sixers after they surged to a double-digit lead early in the third, allowing the Lakers to get back into the game with seven turnovers in a single quarter. They were mostly in cruise control until about the halfway point of the third, and then the wheels came off. Nurse resisted turning to his bench as the Sixers held onto a small but mildly comfortable lead, and it all came crashing down in the end-of-quarter stretch, with Maxey battling foul trouble and Embiid resting on the bench.\n\nEnter Quentin Grimes, a mystifying player to watch. His first half was filled with genuinely awesome moments, with Grimes best understanding what needs to be done when Austin Reaves is on the floor. Drawing him in isolation repeatedly, Grimes went right by him to the rim on several different occasions, making Reaves work as he tore up the Sixers on the other end. He also put down his second highlight dunk of the week with a hellacious throwdown over Jake LaRavia, who I presume had a family.\n\nTELL THEM DON’T JUMP, Q!!! 💥🤯pic.twitter.com/K78SL0bJGp\n\n— PHLY Sixers (@PHLY_Sixers) February 6, 2026\n\nThe second half was what we will charitably refer to as an adventure. When Grimes checked into the game for his end-of-third minutes, the game almost immediately flipped in the wrong direction. He had a brutal turnover, a bad foul, and a miscommunication with VJ Edgecombe in quick succession, and the Lakers were surging. His first good play of that stretch, a steal near halfcourt, was nearly botched before order was restored, only for Kelly Oubre to launch a tightly-contested three with close to 20 seconds left on the shot clock. Not the time or the place, particularly when you’re 2/7 at the time, Mr. Oubre.\n\nThis was the first stretch of basketball over the last week where I felt they desperately needed Paul George. In those backup lineups where they try to buy rest for Embiid and Maxey, it tends to be George who emerges as a cooler head, attacking in isolation or offering spacing for VJ Edgecombe to attack in. With George in street clothes, we were back to early-season Sixers hoops, with the Edgecombe/Grimes/Watford/Oubre combo dying for some spacing, plus decision-making, and savvy.\n\nDown two points with 27 seconds left, the Sixers apparently decided they would trap late and concede a basket instead of either defending the play straight up or fouling to play the back-and-forth game. On the ensuing possession with 12 seconds left, Maxey took a ridiculous foul-baiting three and lost them the opportunity for even a chance to tie or win the game.\n\nOne of the dumbest sequences in Sixers history, straight up.\n\nVJ Edgecombe is what I would affectionately refer to as an all-action player, someone who rarely rests on his laurels who helps you win games no matter what the moment requires. Those guys can occasionally cross the line and go careening into the opponent, trying too hard to impact the game while it boomerangs back on them. But he is a rare breed of rookie, constantly playing with 100 percent effort while minimizing his wild moments on both ends of the floor.\n\nIn fact, Edgecombe often cleans up craziness from other players. Joel Embiid had the rare opportunity to throw him a lob on the break, tossing the ensuing pass so high that two VJ Edgecombes stacked on top of one another in a trenchcoat probably wouldn’t have reached the ball. But after making the attempt to meet it at the summit, Edgecombe collected himself quickly and saved it from going out of bounds, ultimately earning the Sixers an extra possession that ended with an Embiid midrange make. These plays are a constant in the Edgecombe experience.\n\nThe Lakers tried to dare the Sixers into beating them with the three-ball with a fair amount of zone, and Edgecombe was the only guy making outside shots to potentially get them out of it. He is slowly starting to figure out the happy medium on the break, darting through traffic for layups and dunks or slowing down to find an open shooter if those easy opportunities aren’t there. Edgecombe was one of their few solid options defending Austin Reaves, who gave L.A. a big lift off the bench, ripping him on a first-half possession before the Sixers got out and scored on the break.\n\nAt least, that was the case for the first half, because Edgecombe ran into a wall and struggled mightily in winning time for Philadelphia. He was a little too much gas without brakes, throwing up some wild attempts inside the arc with no whistles to save him. And even after he made a gigantic steal and hit a three and drew them within three, he and Grimes combined for one of the worst fouls of the season, fouling down three with 35 seconds left when a normal defensive possession would have sufficed.\n\nBut I was much more disappointed in Tyrese Maxey, who had an impactful passing game but a dire attacking performance, letting the Lakers dissuade him from getting past the initial defensive coverage while jacking missed three after missed three on stepback jumpers. Between true zone coverage and some extra bodies in the paint sagging off of questionable shooters, Maxey relied far too much on his jumper on a night where he had nothing going from deep.\n\nCould the Sixers have been more purposeful with their offense to get him rolling? I think so, yes. First play of the game, they ran him off of an Iverson cut to get him a look closer to the basket, and rarely turned to off-ball action to get him looks the rest of the night.\n\nIf not for the lack of incoming players at the trade deadline, we’d have a real opportunity to celebrate Dominick Barlow, who is one of the great organizational success stories of the last two years. Signed to a standard deal on Thursday evening, Barlow rose quickly from an end-of-bench afterthought to an essential piece of this Sixers team.\n\nIt has been a big road trip for Barlow, who brought his standard brand of energy and athleticism to the arena against L.A. One of the high notes of a solid Sixers first half was an end-to-end sequence from Barlow, who came from the weakside to block Rui Hachimura on a deep catch before streaking to the other end, finishing with style for two points after outrunning the entire Lakers team in transition.\n\nHis night was defined by work in and around the dunker spot, with Barlow catching drop-off after drop-off from every available passer.\n\n— In games where an opponent gets a whistle that seems ultra skewed against one team, my dad likes to shout to no one in particular, “It’s like playing the Globetrotters!” It certainly felt like the Harlem Lakers were on the floor on Thursday night.\n\n(All that said, the officials did not win this game for the Lakers. The Sixers happily gave this game away themselves. But Jenna Schroeder is the worst ref in the league and I don’t even think it’s close.)\n\n— That was perhaps the worst Oubre game of his Sixers tenure and a version of him I thought he largely left behind in Charlotte. Embarrassing shot selection, miserable off-ball defense, every negative trait in his profile on full display all at once.",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — Wichita Heights senior Jalihn Timmons has etched his name in history, tying the school’s single-game record that’s gone untouched for nearly 28 years.\n\nTimmons had a standout performance in Heights’ January matchup against Andover Central, scoring 43 points. Thirty-six of his 43 points came in the second-half of the game.\n\n“I told him, ‘You’re getting close to the record of 43 points,'” Head Coach Gary Thomason said. “He kind of looked at me like that little smirk, like, ‘Really, you’re not messing with me, are you?'”\n\n“He told me, like beginning of the fourth quarter, that I was close to it, so I just thought I would go for it,” Timmons said.\n\nThomason says Timmons has always been a fearless scorer.\n\n“He always wants the ball in his hands. Not so much to maybe score all the time, but we know he’s going make a good decision at the end of the day,” said the coach. “It’s really, it’s really fun to coach someone like that who loves the game and just as important, he respects the game too.”\n\nTimmons now holds a place in history alongside CJ Martin, who first set the record in 1998. It was previously held by City League legends Darnell Valentine and Aubrey Sherrod.\n\n“All the hard players that came through the program, it just shows that I really put a lot of work in to be where I’m at,” Timmons said.\n\nNational Baseball Congress honors three new Hall of Fame inductees\n\nEven with such an achievement, Timmons remains humble, giving credit to the guys around him.\n\nHis teammates don’t just feel like family, they’re actually related.\n\nTimmons’ younger brother Jordan Timmons and his first cousin Jorelle Hadley are right there with him on the court.\n\n“We played in a backyard growing up, so yeah, we played a lot with each other growing up throughout the years,” Timmons said.\n\nTogether, the trio is always holding each other accountable. There’s a strong support system around Jalihn, as he navigates his final season.\n\n“One thousand points is on the horizon for him, and he can take these guys into the postseason,” Thomason said.\n\nDespite the historic achievement, Timmons continues to strive for more.\n\n“State championship,” Timmons said. “I feel like that’s something that I really have come close to in the past years, but I just haven’t been able to grasp it yet, and I’m hoping this year me and my team are able to get it done.”\n\nTimmons is committed to the Hutchinson Blue Dragons to continue his basketball career.\n\nIf you would like to nominate a person, team, or sporting event for Competitive Drive, fill out KSN Sports’ online contact form.",

    "description": "Wilson is releasing the newest addition to the legendary Dynapwr family with the 2026 Dynapwr Forged irons, rounding out a revilized lineup.",
    "fullText": "Wilson is rounding out its 2026 releases with a great answer for improving players demanding better from their irons.\n\nWilson’s new Dynapwr Forged irons enter a crowded player’s distance spot in the market, but with a cavity back design and an AI-generated “Variable Face Technology,” they’re making a push toward the top of the category.\n\n“We wanted to build on the success of the previous award-winning model, while taking strides to elevate the performance to the next level,” Ben Hanser, CAD engineer at Wilson Golf, said in a statement. “The new iron is a statement of Wilson’s dedication to innovation and tradition. By combining forged precision with AI-driven design, we’ve created an iron that delivers distance, control and feel in perfect harmony.”\n\nKeep reading below for more on the Dynapwr Forged irons, including my take on the release.\n\nWhile the previous generation Dynapwr Forged irons were super successful, the 2026 models improve on them by adding a new optimized face thickness with the help of AI. This eliminated the need for the power holes of the previous model.\n\nThe variable face thickness helps boost face flex, in turn increasing ball speeds.\n\nDynapwr Forged also has a new KR-CUP face design, which overlaps the face around the sole, enhancing face flex further, particularly on low strikes.\n\nTo help further improve feel in the forged 8620 carbon steel chassis, the cavities in the 3- to 9-iron are filled with urethane to enhance feel.\n\nWhat is it: A player’s distance cavity back iron with a new AI-designed variable face thickness and urethane-filled cavity.\n\nWho it’s for: Players who are advancing their ball striking ability and want something with a more premium feel without sacrificing forgiveness and speed, or moving to something as compact as a hollow-body.\n\nMany people are going to ask if they should choose between the Dynapwr Forged or the Staff Model XB iron. But truthfully, the new Dynapwr Forged perfectly fills a gap between the XB and the standard Dynapwr iron.\n\nThe Dynapwr Forged is clearly in that player’s distance category with entries like the P790, JPX 925 Forged, Ti Fusion and many others for players looking for speed and forgiveness.\n\nThe Dynapwr Forged is going to fall on the larger and faster end of that spectrum, while the XB falls \n\nWhat’s the difference? I believe it depends on your trend. This Dynapwr Forged is great for a player who is improving and needs to build confidence, but also wants to start getting into the more premium feel. In other words, they are a player who is improving, rather than a player looking to recapture lost performance.\n\nYou can still benift from lots of modern technology, like the new varaible face thickness and urethane-filled cavity, but you can also hone in your precision with a more players shape than the Dynapwr irons.\n\nDynapwr Forged gives Wilson a very complete iron lineup with no one left out. Another step toward the restoration of one of golf’s (and sport’s) great brands.\n\nWilson’s new Dynapwr Forged irons are available for pre-order starting Feb. 5 and will arrive at retail locations on Feb. 19.\n\nThe full set will cost $1,199.99 for 5-GW with steel shafts or $1,299.99 for graphite. A 3- and 4-iron are also available through custom.\n\nWant to find the best driver for your game in 2026? Find a club-fitting location near you at True Spec Golf.\n\nThe post Wilson’s 2026 Dynapwr Forged irons add AI-tech to the iconic family appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "It takes more than practice, sweat and grit to build a wrestling dynasty.\n\nThe Juab boys wrestling squad capped off its 10th consecutive state championship Thursday night at the Sevier Valley Center in Richfield.\n\n“It really takes a community to be able to do this and give those kids something to perform for,” coach Joel Holman said. “I think the state wrestling tournament is the greatest sporting event hosted by the (Utah) High School Activities Association. The highs are the highest, and the lows are the lowest.”\n\nJuab racked up 277.5 team points en route to the title, with Canyon View finishing runner-up with 232 points and Morgan in third with 165.\n\nOutside of Juab’s triumph, one of the top stories of the night belonged to Union’s Tucker Roybal, who wrapped up his career with a remarkable fourth individual state title. He won his championship match by technical to finish the year with a 47-1 record.\n\nFor Juab, of the seven wrestlers that advanced to the finals, two earned individual state titles.\n\nKaden Martineau (150) delivered Juab’s first individual title of the tournament with a win by fall over Union’s Rowdy Roybal and Ladd Holman (190) picked up the team’s other individual title, pinning Emery’s Hazen Meccariello in just 48 seconds.\n\n“I came in feeling pretty confident,” Martineau said. “I knew I just had to come in and do my stuff.”\n\nMartineau said being part of the championship team is an incredible experience.\n\n“It’s awesome to be part of this. Everyone here is so electric,” he said. “Wrestling is just part of my life. Without it, I don’t know where I’d be.”\n\nAdded Ladd Holman, the coach’s son: “It was fun for me, but it’s even more fun to be part of the team. It’s special to be here. Wrestling helped me reach some goals, but also deal with some setbacks.”\n\nA junior, this marks his third consecutive state title, and he said the coaching staff, including his dad, are some of his best friends.\n\nThe finals began with Carbon’s Jantz Greenhalgh earning a third-round pin over Juab’s Jack Holman in the 106-pound division. Canyon View’s Jaxten Bowler edged Juab’s Trevor Cowan with a 5–4 decision at 113, while Union’s Grady Roybal won a 17–10 decision over Juab’s Jet Abbott.\n\n“There’s always going to be disappointment, but hopefully they learn not only to do hard things, but to do them with class and integrity,” Joel Holman said. “You represent yourself, your program and your community.”\n\nAt 138, Carbon’s Riker Ohearon defeated Juab’s Drake Johnson by decision.\n\n“What stood out for me is that most everyone on the backside took third place,” Holman said. “I’m proud of the guys who took their loss, shook it off and came back to score points for the team.”\n\nHolman also expressed appreciation for the support the team receives from the Juab community, including donations, countless volunteer hours and a sea of crimson shirts filling the cheering section.\n\n“People know when we’re doing well,” he said. “It’s important because if you feel like no one cares, it’s easy to give up on yourself.\n\n“When you know the community is behind you, watching and wanting you to succeed, you don’t want to let them down.”\n\nBeyond the wins on the mat, Holman said he hopes his athletes understand they represent more than just a high school wrestling team.\n\n“Wrestling teaches the lessons of sports better than any other sport because it’s harder than any other sport,” he said. “Juab is a wrestling town, and now we have kids in the program who have never known Juab not to be a wrestling town.\n\nJantz Greenhalgh, Carbon, So.

    "fullText": "Manchester United are preparing to face Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday as Michael Carrick looks to make it four wins out of four.\n\nIt has been a dream start for the caretaker head coach, with the Red Devils seeing off Manchester City, Arsenal, and Fulham.\n\nThe manner of the wins was also impressive, with the 20-time English league champions playing Pep Guardiola’s side off the park before securing late wins against both London teams.\n\nAhead of Saturday’s crunch tie, Spurs boss Thomas Frank was asked to give his verdict about United under Michael Carrick.\n\nThe under-fire Dane went on to explain the two major differences he has noticed during the pre-match press conference.\n\nHe also added that United possess great individual quality to change games in an instant, highlighting Bruno Fernandes‘ impact as the attacking midfielder.\n\n“I think he has had a great start,” Frank was quoted as saying as per Sky Sports News. “It seems like there was injected a little bit of energy into the team.\n\n“I think it looks like some of the players are in a good place. We know the threats that I also think they posed before from Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, Cunha and Bruno Fernandes, he’s getting this team ticking.\n\n“He has done that the last, I don’t know, four or five years. It has been incredible. It is a threat, it is a challenge, but we are looking forward to it.”\n\nFrank is spot on. The energy put in by the players, both offensively and defensively, has been a joy to behold and is a marked improvement from Ruben Amorim’s time at the club.\n\nSomething plenty of United stars have alluded to in recent interviews.\n\nNot to mention, the legendary midfielder has also revitalised quite a few players who seemed down and out under the former head coach.\n\nKobbie Mainoo is a perfect example of that, while Carrick’s man-management also saw Patrick Dorgu shine in a more attacking role before his untimely injury.\n\nHopefully, the three-time Champions League winners can continue their mid-season revival and exact revenge on the North London side for what had transpired in the Europa League final in the last term.\n\nFeature image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

The Patriots have a chance to pass them this weekend, however, if they’re able to upset the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAccordingly, it figures that either Pittsburgh or New England would have had the best play in Super Bowl history, which legendary broadcaster Al Michaels revealed this week during his appearance on the “Fitz And Whit” podcast.\n\nAl Michaels on James Harrison’s Super Bowl Pick six:\n\n\"You've got James Harrison what, for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history.”#steelers\n\nFitz and Whit pic.twitter.com/MIW81OEahF\n\n— Matthew Luciow (@matthewluciow92) February 5, 2026\n\nMichaels discussed the Steelers’ exciting 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, which featured a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown by Pittsburgh linebacker James Harrison off Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. The play set a Super Bowl record and gave the Steelers a 10-point lead heading into halftime.\n\n“You’ve got James Harrison with, what for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history. A hundred-yard interception return at the end of the half. Crazy, down the sideline, he’s almost getting tackled 15 times,” recalled Michaels, who called the game for NBC.\n\nEven though the play happened 17 years ago, Michaels still remembers it like it was yesterday. So do many Pittsburgh fans, as their team hasn’t won a Super Bowl since.\n\nMore Steelers: Steelers Reportedly Expected To Hire New Outside Linebackers Coach\n\nThe post Al Michaels Claims Steelers Had ‘Greatest Play In Super Bowl History’ appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "NEW HAVEN - The Greenwich boys and girls indoor track and field teams were both winners at the FCIAC championships Thursday night at the Floyd Little Athletic Center.\n\nThe boys won with 112 points, with Danbury next at 66. The girls finished with 116 points, ahead of second-place New Canaan's 65.\n\n\"I think [the girls team] won all four relays, so it was really a team effort,\" Greenwich girls head coach Peter Watson said.\n\nWatson also credited second- and third-place finishes that contributed to the team's success.\n\nCardinals boys head coach Christopher Wallace said the mentality of his athletes coming into the season has really started to pay off.\n\n\"This year is like a culmination of a lot of years of hard work for this team, and they all believe in each other and have each other's backs,\" Wallace said.\n\nGreenwich's 4x200 boys relay squad of Jack Hannafin, David Boside, Daniel Silver and Alexander Yu started the meet by winning in a season-best time of 1:32.35.\n\nYu was also part of the 1,600 sprint medley that finished second with a season-best time of 3:45.85, and the 4x400 that finished third in 3:36.71.\n\n\"This is the best,\" Yu said. \"Last year, I missed my FCIAC time just barely. This year, I'm back. I'm so much better and so much more prepared.\"\n\nThe Cardinals' 4x800 of Michael Yardis, Oliver Eaton, Benjamin Hayes and Ryan Newcomb won gold with a season-best time of 8:16.45.\n\nOn the girls side, Greenwich swept the relays thanks to standout performances from Riley Barber and Eliana Daplyn. Barber was on the 4x200 with Nina Silver, her twin sister Ella Barber and Chloe Culver, and the foursome finished with a season-best time of 1:45.15.\n\n\"I'm really proud of my teammates,\" Riley Barber said. \"Our team is really well-rounded, and I'm just really proud of all of them. They all did really well.\"\n\nBarber was also on the winning 1,600 sprint medley team, along with Daplyn, who was a member of the 4x400 with Gemma Hardwick, Chloe Culver, Margaret McCooe that took gold in a time of 4:09.64.\n\nThe 4x400 got interesting in the third leg when McCooe sensed that she was being passed by another runner. She looked back twice and decided to make her move, which ultimately paid off.\n\n\"The runner was right next to me, and I was going to let her pass, and then maybe try to [pass by her] then, but then I just decided to sprint the last [stretch of the race],\" McCooe said.\n\nAlthough the relays were where the Cardinals took command of the meet, they also had victories elsewhere.\n\nRyan Newcomb won the boys 600 in 1:24.79, and Jacob Mobley won the shot put with a meet record of 51 feet, and a half-inch.\n\nHardwick won the girls 600 in 1:38.45, and Daplyn claimed the 1,000 in 2:58.40.\n\nBoth Greenwich coaches were proud of what they saw, and are expecting more good results next Saturday in states.\n\n\"We're gonna get ready for the CIAC Class LL championship,\" Watson said.  \"We've got a little bit of time to rest. We worked really hard today. We're excited to try and go in and do something special.\"\n\nBoys team results: 1. Greenwich 112; 2. Danbury 66; 3. Ridgefield 42.5; 4. Brien McMahon 36; 5.

    "description": "Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye for 2026 NFL MVP by one vote, 24-23 in the closest MVP race in 22 years, however it was odd first-place nods for Justin Herbert and Josh Allen that might have made the difference.",
    "fullText": "Why Justin Herbert's first-place MVP vote is odd twist to Matthew Stafford victory over Drake Maye originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL was very close to having co-league MVP quarterbacks for the second time ever and first time in 22 years. Instead, the Rams' Matthew Stafford's margin of victory -- one first-place vote -- over the Patriots' Drake Maye (24-23) will go down as the closest decision in league history.\n\nNot since the Colts' Peyton Manning and the late Titans great Steve McNair tied 16-16 and shared MVP in 2003 has there been such a narrow call. Stafford edging Maye was the most expected result at Thursday's Associated Press NFL Honors ceremony, but it still came with controversy considering where the three other first-place votes went.\n\nWhile 47 of the 50 AP voters, which includes national beat reporters and television analysts such as Tom Brady, had a natural split between Stafford and Maye -- much like Josh Allen beating Lamar Jackson for 2024 MVP -- three went in a different direction. Two voters thought Allen should repeat and gave him a follow-up first-place love. But one inexplicably threw away their most valuable vote on Justin Herbert.\n\nMORE:How Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye in closest race since 2003\n\nThere was some logic to Allen's season with the Bills being worthy of some recognition, given it was more efficient than his winning year in many ways. But Herbert's year with the Chargers shouldn't have had a real case.\n\nHerbert wasn't even one of the five finalists \"nominated\" at the 2026 NFL Honors. Stafford, Maye and Allen were joined by Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence and 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who both didn't get any first place votes.\n\nBefore the AP reveals on Friday how all 50 voters ranked their top five from first to fifth, the Herbert voter outed himself -- it was former Pro Football Focus analyst Sam Monson.\n\nI was the Justin Herbert vote.\n\nThe guy had the worst offensive line in the NFL all season and despite that he was working miracles in almost every single game.\n\nStafford's OL became 2/5ths as bad as Herbert's for 5 minutes and he became a turnover howitzer.\n\nHe embodied 'value'.\n\n— Sam Monson (@SamMonsonNFL) February 6, 2026\n\nHerbert did have to deal with a broken-down offensive line with both top offensive tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt going down with season-ending injuries. He was sacked 54 times and the Chargers gave up 60 as a team.\n\nBut Maye also was sacked a ton, 47 times, with his rookie left tackle Will Campbell battling inexperience and injury. Maye led the league in completion percentage (72.0), yards per pass attempt (8.9) and passer rating (113.5). He also rushed for 450 yards.\n\nStafford led the league with his 4,709 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes while averaging 7.9 yards per attempt and rating 109.2.\n\nHerbert's numbers weren't close to either. He averaged 7.3 yards per attempt and rated 94.1. He threw for only 26 TDs with 13 interceptions while passing for fewer than 4,000 yards (3,727 yards). Those kind of mediocre numbers lack both efficiency and profilic nature, two things that count most in the history of the award, with MVP really being \"the best quarterback in the league award\".\n\nMORE:Matthew Stafford says he’s not retiring in 2026 NFL MVP Speech\n\nEvery quarterback that wins MVP has a favorable support system. Herbert might have been let down by his team, but in the end, MVP is an award for individual performance. Had Herbert put up transcendent numbers with those challenges, it's one thing. But one cannot blame Stafford or Maye for having better all-around support systems and taking full advantage.\n\nHerbert didn't deserve that vote, or even a fifth-place one.",

But for whatever reason, they couldn’t keep hold of him and he made the decision to go and play for Liverpool instead and try his luck there, rather than stay at Chelsea where he came through the academy.\n\nSome people will feel that Chelsea have got decent money for a player who was yet to even sign a professional contract, whereas others who are experts on the Blues academy will know that this fee will soon end up looking like an absolutely bargain for a player with a very high ceiling.\n\nRio Ngumoha celebrates scoring for Liverpool.(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to the report, Liverpool must pay an initial fee worth £2.8million — which could rise by a further £4m — for the signing of Rio Ngumoha from Chelsea. This was decided at tribunal.\n\nI think it is safe to say that paying so little for any player in the top leagues these days will be considered a bargain. But for me, I think this fee will soon look like an absolutely bargain of the century for Liverpool – this guy is a superb talent.\n\nChelsea and Strasbourg have had a ridiculous 12 transfers between them in the last two windows. It’s all within the rules, but it’s making people uncomfortable.\n\nJoao Pedro impressed with his performance on Tuesday night, and the highlights show him doing really well against a physical Gunners team.",

The Kings have lost four of five.\n\nJack Eichel and Pavel Dorofeyev each had a goal and an assist for the Golden Knights. Mitch Marner scored a goal for his 799th career point and Ivan Barbashev extended his points streak to five games with two assists.\n\nBarbashev's four-game goal streak, however, ended. Eichel extended his points streak to four games and now has 200 assists in a Golden Knights uniform.\n\nVegas' Adin Hill made 32 saves for his 100th career victory, his most stops since having 34 on March 15, 2025, against Buffalo.\n\nTrevor Moore scored for the Kings and Anton Forsberg stopped 18 shots. Adrian Kempe's eight-game points streak ended.\n\nThe Golden Knights won despite taking six penalties, though one was a fighting major shared by both teams. Los Angeles didn't make Vegas pay, going 0 of 5 on the power play. The last time the Golden Knights committed six penalties was Nov. 20 against Utah, also a 4-1 victory.\n\nKings forward Andrei Kuzmenko took a puck in the face with 1:42 left in the first period and was taken to the locker room.

From veteran stars reaching new heights to emerging talents announcing their arrival, this year’s winners reflected the league’s unique blend of longevity, resilience, and evolution. Together, these awards capture the moments and individuals who shaped the NFL’s narrative over the past season.\n\nMatthew Stafford captured his first NFL MVP award after a remarkable 17th season in the league. He led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes. His performance was a career-high and pivotal in the Rams’ offensive success, showcasing both precision and longevity at age 37. Stafford’s journey from years of underappreciated play in Detroit to peak form in Los Angeles adds a compelling arc to his MVP narrative. Despite his veteran status, he announced intentions to continue playing, hinting at even more chapters ahead.\n\nSmith-Njigba emerged as the league’s top offensive weapon, setting franchise records and finishing with 1,793 receiving yards — the most in the NFL for the 2025 season. His route running, consistency, and ability to create separation made him a matchup nightmare for defenses. He became the focal point of Seattle’s attack and proved he’s more than just a deep threat, becoming a true WR1. His production helped elevate the Seahawks into serious playoff contention.\n\nMyles Garrett’s season will go down in history — he shattered the NFL single-season sack record with 23 and logged 33 tackles for loss. His relentless pass rush and ability to disrupt games earned him Defensive Player of the Year honors for a second time. Garrett’s dominance, even when facing constant double teams, illustrated his evolution into one of the truly elite defenders in the league. His impact extended beyond sacks, as he altered offensive game plans weekly.\n\nMcMillan made an immediate splash in his rookie season, leading all first-year players in receiving and showcasing a polished route tree and natural ball skills. His chemistry with his quarterback and knack for big plays gave the Panthers a reliable and explosive weapon. The award signals the start of a potentially incredible NFL career, with McMillan already displaying pro-caliber instincts. His performance brought excitement to Carolina’s offense and optimism for the future.\n\nSchwesinger arrived as a surprise standout, amassing impressive tackle totals and impact plays that anchored the Browns’ defense. His instincts in coverage and physicality in run support distinguished him from his draft class peers. Winning Defensive Rookie of the Year validated his immediate contribution and hinted at future stardom. His emergence added a dynamic element to Cleveland’s defense.\n\nThuney’s performance as an interior offensive lineman earned him the inaugural Protector of the Year award, emphasizing his role in stabilizing the Bears’ offensive front. His pass protection and run-blocking prowess helped elevate Chicago’s offensive efficiency. Known for his intelligence and technique, Thuney became a leader on the line. This award recognizes the importance of unsung linemen who anchor offensive success.\n\nMcCaffrey’s journey back from significant injury was one of the most impressive stories of the season, finishing with over 2,100 scrimmage yards and 17 touchdowns. His versatility — as a runner, receiver, and team leader — made him indispensable to the 49ers’ offense. The award honors not just statistical excellence but resilience and dedication to rehabilitation. His triumphant return energized teammates and fans alike.\n\nVrabel guided the Patriots through a successful turnaround, leading them to an AFC East title and deep playoff push on his first year with the team. His leadership and game management earned recognition as Coach of the Year by his peers. Vrabel’s emphasis on culture and discipline translated into tangible improvement on the field. The award underscores his impact in transforming the Patriots into a contender.\n\nMcDaniels’ role as Assistant Coach of the Year reflects his influence in shaping the Patriots’ offensive identity and maximizing the talent on the roster. Known for his strategic approach and game-planning acumen, McDaniels helped elevate New England’s execution. His contributions were integral to the team’s success and competitive positioning.\n\nWagner was honored for his exceptional leadership on the field and impactful community service off it. The Walter Payton Man of the Year Award recognizes players who demonstrate commitment to their communities, and Wagner’s efforts have extended well beyond football. His charitable initiatives and mentorship work set a standard for NFL players. The award celebrates character and civic contribution.\n\nTaken as a whole, the complete list of 2026 NFL Honors winners tells the story of a season driven by elite play, leadership, and perseverance. Each awardee left a distinct imprint on their team and, in many cases, the broader direction of the league. As the NFL turns the page to a new season, these honorees stand as benchmarks for excellence and reminders of how special the 2025 campaign truly was.\n\nThe post Complete list of winners in 2026 NFL Honors appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Charlotte Patterson previews tonight’s clash between Sunderland Women and Sheffield United — a big game awaits!",
    "fullText": "A February night under the lights at Eppleton always carries its own kind of electricity, but tonight’s game feels particularly charged.\n\nSunderland Women welcome Sheffield United in a fixture that arrives at a pivotal moment for both clubs, with each navigating the fine margins of a league table where a handful of points separate mid‑table security from the creeping anxiety of a relegation battle.\n\nIt’s the sort of match that can tilt a season’s momentum for better or worse, and the sort of occasion that demands clarity, resilience and a rediscovery of identity. For Sunderland in particular, it feels like a moment to steady the ship, to respond and to remind themselves — and everyone watching — of the football they’re capable of producing.\n\nThe Lasses’ recent run of form has been a frustrating blend of promise and inconsistency, with their loss to Bristol City standing out as a particularly bruising setback. Heading into that match, there was a sense that Sunderland were beginning to stitch together some cohesion, even if results hadn’t always reflected the performances.\n\nSadly, the trip to Bristol unravelled in a way that will have disappointed Mel Reay and her squad.\n\nBristol were sharper in key moments and more decisive in both boxes, and Sunderland struggled to impose themselves in the way they had earlier in the season.\n\nThe defeat wasn’t simply about the scoreline — it was the manner of it as Sunderland looked disjointed, unable to find the rhythm that had defined their best spells of the campaign, and too often second to loose balls and transitional moments.\n\nThe most concerning aspect was the lack of attacking fluency.\n\nEarlier in the season, Sunderland carved teams open with quick combinations, intelligent movement and a willingness to commit bodies forward. Against Bristol, that spark was missing.\n\nPasses that would normally split lines instead drifted into congested areas, wide players found themselves isolated and the midfield — usually a source of control and tempo — struggled to dictate. Bristol capitalised, pressing aggressively and forcing Sunderland into rushed decisions.\n\nIt was the sort of performance that leaves a team not just disappointed but reflective, and with tough fixtures looming Sunderland know they can’t afford to let that result remain in their system.\n\nIf Sunderland’s form has been uneven, Sheffield United’s have been quietly gathering momentum, culminating in a very impressive 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic — a result that, in context, brought far more than just a point. Charlton have been one of the strongest sides in the division — both in terms of form and league position, — and Sheffield’s ability to go toe‑to‑toe with them was a statement of intent.\n\nI watched that match myself and it was impossible not to be struck by the level of intensity and organisation Sheffield brought to the pitch.\n\nThey pressed Charlton relentlessly, especially in the first half, swarming with four or five players at a time whenever Charlton attempted to build from goal kicks. It wasn’t reckless pressing — it was coordinated, intelligent and suffocating.\n\nWhat impressed me most was how consistently Sheffield sustained that pressure.\n\nCharlton aren’t easily rattled yet Sheffield forced them into hurried clearances, misplaced passes and uncomfortable defensive sequences. The energy levels were remarkable, and the tactical discipline even more so.\n\nAs a neutral observer, it was exhilarating to watch; as a Sunderland supporter, it was slightly worrying as Sheffield looked like a side with belief, clarity and a willingness to work for every inch of the pitch, and one player who stood out was former Sunderland midfielder Mollie Rouse.\n\nHer performance was a reminder of the qualities she brought during her time on Wearside: composure, vision and an ability to knit play together with subtle but incisive touches.\n\nAgainst Charlton, she was central to Sheffield’s best moments. Her through balls repeatedly carved open space and her link‑up play helped Sheffield transition from pressing to possession with fluidity. She seemed to anticipate the movement of teammates before the ball even reached her feet, and her presence gave Sheffield a creative axis that Charlton struggled to contain.\n\nThe match itself was intense from start to finish, with both sides trading periods of control and half‑chances, but the closing stages belonged to Sheffield.\n\nThey created two huge opportunities in the dying minutes — chances that, on another day, would’ve secured all three points. The fact that they were still pushing with such conviction so late in the game spoke volumes about their fitness, mentality, and ambition, and it was a performance that’ll have boosted their confidence significantly heading into tonight’s clash.\n\nThe head‑to‑head history between Sunderland and Sheffield United adds another layer of intrigue to this fixture.\n\nSheffield got the better of the Lasses in the League Cup earlier this season, in a result that stung not just because of the defeat itself, but because Sunderland struggled to impose their style on the match, and it was a reminder that Sheffield are more than capable of disrupting Sunderland’s rhythm and exploiting lapses in concentration.\n\nHowever, the league meeting between the sides at the start of the 2025/2026 season told a very different story as Sunderland travelled to Bramall Lane and produced one of their most complete performances in recent memory, dismantling Sheffield 0-4 with a display of free‑flowing, incisive attacking football.\n\nEverything clicked that day: the movement, the passing patterns, the pressing triggers, the confidence in possession.\n\nIt was the sort of performance that set expectations for the season ahead and showcased the attacking identity Sunderland have been striving to recapture. Unfortunately, that brand of football has been harder to find in recent weeks. The contrast between that opening‑day brilliance and the more laboured performances of late is stark, and Friday night offers an opportunity, perhaps even a necessity, to rediscover that spark.\n\nThis match carries weight not just because of form or history, but because of the broader context of the league table.\n\nBoth Sunderland and Sheffield United find themselves amid a cluster of teams separated by only a few points, where a single win can propel a side toward mid‑table comfort and a single defeat can drag them back into relegation battle. It’s a precarious position — one that demands consistency and resilience, and where every point matters, every mistake is magnified and every moment of quality becomes decisive.\n\nFor Sunderland, the urgency is heightened by the fixtures that lie ahead.\n\nTough tests are on the horizon and dropping points at home — especially in a match against a direct competitor, — would place additional pressure on those upcoming challenges.\n\nThe crowd will be expectant, vocal and eager to see a response to the disappointment at Bristol. There’a something about these evening fixtures that often brings out the best in Sunderland teams, and the players will know that this is a moment to rise to the occasion.\n\nThe key for Sunderland will be re‑establishing control in midfield and rediscovering the attacking patterns that defined their early‑season success.\n\nThey need to move the ball with purpose, stretch Sheffield’s defensive shape and avoid being drawn into the chaotic, high‑pressing game that Sheffield executed so effectively against Charlton. If Sunderland can dictate the tempo, they can create the sort of chances that’ve been lacking in recent matches, but if they allow Sheffield to set the rhythm, press aggressively and force turnovers, the match could become uncomfortable very quickly.\n\nDefensively, Sunderland will need to be alert to Sheffield’s transitions.\n\nThe Blades showed against Charlton that they can break with pace and precision — especially when Rouse is given space in which to operate. Sunderland’s defence will need to communicate clearly, track runners diligently and avoid the lapses that proved costly against Bristol. Concentration will be crucial, particularly in the opening stages when Sheffield are likely to press with intensity.\n\nPsychologically, this match is an opportunity for Sunderland to reset.\n\nA win would not only provide valuable points but also restore confidence and momentum. It would demonstrate that the Bristol result was a blip rather than a trend, and that the team remains capable of producing the football that defined their best performances earlier in the campaign.\n\nFor Sheffield, it represents a chance to build on their impressive draw with Charlton and to continue to climb away from the lower reaches of the table — and they’ll arrive with belief, energy, and a clear game plan.\n\nWhat makes this fixture so compelling is that both sides have shown glimpses of their potential but have also struggled for consistency.\n\nBoth have strengths that can trouble the opposition, both sides have vulnerabilities that can be exploited and both teams understand the stakes. It’s the sort of match where the first goal could be decisive, where momentum could swing dramatically and where individual moments of quality may determine the outcome.\n\nAs a Sunderland supporter, there’s a natural desire to see the team respond with conviction, to see the patterns of play that lit up the early weeks of the season and to see the players embrace the occasion. But having watched Sheffield’s performance against Charlton, there’s also an awareness that this will be far from straightforward.\n\nSheffield are organised, hungry, and capable of unsettling even the strongest sides. They won’t come to sit back; instead, they’ll come to compete, to press and to test Sunderland’s composure.\n\nUltimately, tonight feels like a crossroads.\n\nSunderland can either use this match to reassert themselves, to reclaim their identity and to put daylight between themselves and the teams below — or they can allow the uncertainty of recent weeks to linger.\n\nThe choice is theirs, and the stage is set.",

    "title": "Simon Adingra’s Exit Is A Sign Of The Times At Sunderland",
    "description": "\"Loaning out such a high-profile player sends a very strong message in itself”, writes Phil West of Adingra’s departure",
    "fullText": "When Granit Xhaka took what felt like ten Leeds United players out of the game with a sumptuous pass to Simon Adingra, who then composed himself before curling a smart finish beyond the dive of Lucas Perri at the Stadium of Light back in December, was I the only Sunderland fan whose first thought was “Now he’s truly arrived and we’ll see what he can bring to the table if he’s given an extended run in the side”?\n\nAs we eventually shared the spoils with the visitors from Elland Road, that goal really felt like a breakthrough moment for the Ivory Coast international.\n\nTo my mind, it was the perfect response to being omitted from his country’s AFCON squad and as he dropped to his knees in celebration with his teammates surrounding him, I really believed we’d seen something that would kickstart his Sunderland career, putting him back into favour with Régis Le Bris after murmurings about his work rate and defensive diligence.\n\nSadly, things didn’t work out that way.\n\nJust over one month later, Adingra has made a swift Wearside exit after being loaned to Ligue 1 side AS Monaco, with Ecuadorian winger Nilson Angulo set to arrive from Anderlecht as the latest addition to our talented legion of wingmen.\n\nA sharp, ruthless and possibly brutal reversal of fortune? Perhaps. A move that in some ways is justifiable and was needed for both the benefit of the squad and Adingra himself? Many would say yes.\n\nIn the first instance, his summer signing from Brighton was by no means the most ill-advised we could’ve made as we sought pace and dynamism on the flanks ahead of our return to the Premier League.\n\nAs a 2023 AFCON champion and a player who was seemingly highly rated down on the south coast — albeit with a cautionary note sounded about his consistency when the opinions of Brighton fans were canvassed before and after his transfer was completed — I was excited by his arrival on Wearside and was hopeful that he could make a major impact in the red and white stripes.\n\nSadly, despite his goal against Leeds and an assist during our opening-day victory over West Ham, his spell at the Stadium of Light hasn’t lived up to that initial promise and it feels unlikely that he’ll play any further part in what we all hope will be Sunderland’s story of continued progress during 2026 and beyond.\n\nAlthough we’ve at least cushioned any financial blow by virtue of how we’ve structured his loan arrangement, it does represent a rare blip in terms of representing a transfer that didn’t work out as planned — albeit with our strike rate for new signings still more than good enough to deem that particular window a success.\n\nThe speed at which Adingra was moved on surprised me.\n\nAs recently as last weekend, I felt he would be given further opportunities to play his way back into form and prove that he could make the grade at this level, but it also brought into sharp focus the standards being set, the demands placed on our players and the qualities you’re expected to bring to the table.\n\nNowadays, Sunderland is a club where careers can be launched and reputations enhanced, but no new signing will find the going easy and in the quest to establish ourselves as a genuine competitive force at this level, that’s the way it has to be — and occasionally in spite of supporters such as myself who are eager to see players given every opportunity to prove their worth even as their form fluctuates.\n\nIt’s obvious that despite his Gallic charm, level-headed interviews and even-tempered nature, Le Bris is a hard taskmaster.\n\nIn order to earn and retain a place in a team coached by him, you must combine skill, footballing intelligence, physicality, adaptability and perhaps most importantly a willingness to graft for the entirety of the ninety minutes.\n\nAdingra’s profile and style of play — that of a winger who plays off the front foot, was more effective in wide open spaces and for whom tracking back perhaps wasn’t a high priority — has evidently not gelled with the head coach’s ideals and therefore a parting of the ways feels mutually beneficial.\n\nWith any luck, Angulo will prove to be another previously unearthed gem of an addition and we can continue to work on the attacking side of our game during the remaining games of the season, but loaning out such a high-profile player sends a very strong message in itself: talent alone isn’t enough nowadays, and no decision will be shirked if the team can possibly benefit as a result.\n\nThat in itself feels like a bit of a shock given our historical reputation for indulging players who didn’t perform consistently enough, but hopefully Adingra can use this opportunity as a chance to reset and get back into the groove — and the club deserves credit for ensuring that a very talented footballer will be playing at a decent level for the remainder of the campaign.",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona’s women put on a show at the Alfredo Di Stéfano, leaving Real Madrid behind in a 4-0 quarter-final. The win books their place in the Copa de la Reina semifinals.\n\nAlexia Putellas opened the scoring with a towering header from a Caroline Graham Hansen corner, Ewa Pajor scored a brace, and Salma Paralluelo added another goal, with Patri Guijarro pulling the strings in midfield.\n\nThe night started rough. Heavy rain, strong wind, and a boggy pitch made passing tricky, and Madrid came out with intensity, pressing high and trying to force errors. Early interventions from Irene Paredes and Vicky López kept Barcelona afloat, but the real drama came in the 15th minute. Laia Aleixandri collided with Feller and went down clutching her knee. She had to leave on a stretcher, visibly shaken. Aïcha Camara had to come on, but the team kept rolling.\n\nThe opener arrived in the 20th minute. Alexia rose unmarked and sent a header past Misa. She celebrated with her hand to her ear, and suddenly, the game became livelier.\n\nVicky López hit the post, Clàudia Pina’s shots were blocked, and for Madrid, an Athenea del Castillo goal was correctly ruled out for offside. By halftime, Barcelona led 1-0, in a calm but commanding fashion.\n\nAfter the break, the Catalans shifted up a gear. Pajor struck a powerful shot to double the lead, then Salma finished off a perfect through ball from Patri to make it 3-0. Salma sprinted down the left and laid the ball off for Pajor, who controlled with her chest and slotted it coolly to score the fourth and final goal. By the final whistle, Barcelona had accomplished their mission and were onto the next round.\n\nThe other three teams left to compete for the cup are Atlético de Madrid, Tenerife, and Badalona Women.",

    "fullText": "Omar Marmoush has been scoring goals since returning from AFCON. He hit the back of the net in Manchester City’s recent win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Etihad. Marmoush didn’t score in City’s win over Galatasaray or in the brief time he was on the pitch last weekend in Manchester City’s 2-all draw with Tottenham. However, Marmoush bagged a brace against Newcastle United to help Manchester City book their place in this season’s Carabao Cup final with a 3-1 win over Eddie Howe’s side at the Etihad.\n\nWith Marmoush in form, City have another dangerous weapon in the final third. The Egyptian international could be a key player this weekend as Manchester City bid to beat Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday in a crucial Premier League fixture.\n\nMarmoush put in an energetic and lively display against Newcastle. His intelligent movement and interplay with his teammates helped City routinely get at Eddie Howe’s side, as did Newcastle’s approach in the first half. Omar Marmoush bagged a brace, and although both goals could be considered fortunate, the Egyptian international did the work to earn his rewards.\n\nFor Omar Marmoush’s first goal, he combined superbly with Tijjani Reijnders to get behind the Newcastle defence. Marmoush’s backheel to Reijnders and run was superb. He got lucky as his heavy first touch got away from him as Newcastle’s defender Dan Burn reached the ball before Marmoush. But Burn’s clearance hit the Egyptian international before looping over the oncoming Aaron Ramsdale to give City the lead in the seventh minute. It was a fortunate goal, but Marmoush’s movement and interplay with Reijnders created the opening.\n\nFor his second goal, Marmoush showed his goal scoring instincts. Newcastle right-back Kieran Trippier cleared an Antoine Semenyo cross in the air and Marmoush was on hand to head home. Marmoush had a brace inside half an hour and he had his rewards for his intelligent movement and predatory instincts. With Marmoush in form, City have another weapon in the final third. That could be vital for City in their next match against Liverpool.\n\nUp next for Manchester City is a crucial Premier League fixture against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. Pep Guardiola’s side sits six points behind Arsenal, who lead the league. Sunday’s match is a massive one for City, and you do sense that Pep Guardiola’s side cannot afford to drop many more points. Looking at Sunday’s match, the Liverpool defence does look to be an area of their side that City can exploit. If that is the case, Marmoush could have an important role to play at Anfield if he does start.\n\nThe movement and interplay with his teammates that Marmoush adds could unsettle Liverpool’s defence, especially if City has space to operate in the final third. Marmoush should be full of confidence after his brace against Newcastle. If he does start on Sunday, he could be a match-winner for City. Of course, that depends on whether Marmoush starts. I’d expect Erling Haaland to start against Liverpool. Whether or not Semenyo, or Marmoush, or both start with him remains to be seen.\n\nManchester City have a different dynamic in the final third with Omar Marmoush back among the goals. The Egyptian international adds variety and intelligence to City’s attacking play. Whether or not Marmoush starts on Sunday remains to be seen, but if he does, he could have a massive role to play in a huge fixture at Anfield.",

Vrabel – who was a three-time Super Bowl champion in eight seasons as a linebacker with the Patriots from 2001-08 – was asked how he will use that experience as a player to coach against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday.\n\n\"I think I always try to use every experience that I've had over the course of 30 years of experience in this league whether that's as a player as a coach to help the team and to help individual players do their job,\" Vrabel said at his Tuesday press conference.\n\n\"You only have so many opportunities to make a play,\" he said. “You have to be ready.\"\n\nVrabel took advantage of those chances as a player. Will he do the same as a coach?\n\nMORE: Revisting Mike Vrabel's time as a Patriots linebacker\n\nVrabel would become the fifth player to win the Super Bowl as a player and coach. A look at those other four individuals:\n\nFlores was a backup quarterback for the Chiefs when they won Super Bowl 4 against Minnesota. He led the Raiders to victories in Super Bowl 15 and Super Bowl 18 as a head coach. He also was an assistant under John Madden when Oakland won Super Bowl 11.\n\nDitka played in two Super Bowls for the Cowboys – who were 1-1 in those games.

As a coach,  Pederson led Philadelphia to a 41-33 victory against New England in Super Bowl 42.\n\nMORE: Inside Mike Vrabel's playoff record as a coach\n\nThree other individuals have been in the Super Bowl as a player and coach:\n\nReeves played in two Super Bowls for Dallas. He had one carry for seven yards in the 24-3 victory against Miami in Super Bowl 6. Reeves was 0-4 in the Super Bowl as a coach. He led Denver to three Super Bowl appearances (21, 22, 24) and Atlanta to one Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl 33 – a 34-19 loss to Denver.\n\nRivera played for Chicago under Ditka in Super Bowl 20 and won a championship as a player. As a coach, he led Carolina to an appearance in Super Bowl 50. The Panthers lost 24-10 to Denver.\n\nKubiak was a backup quarterback for John Elway in three Super Bowl losses (21, 22, 24) and he was an assistant coach in three Super Bowl victories (29, 32, 33). Kubiak led Denver to the Super Bowl 50 victory against Carolina.\n\nMORE: Complete coaching timeline for Mike Vrabel, from Ohio State to Patriots\n\nVrabel played in four Super Bowls with the Patriots and won three Super Bowls as a player.

    "fullText": "Another pivotal Premier League gameweek awaits, with several sides locked in relegation battles and crucial clashes shaping the title race.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester City headline the round in a fixture that could significantly impact Arsenal’s advantage at the top.\n\nManchester United will look to continue their resurgence under interim boss Michael Carrick, while Spurs aim to halt their inconsistency.\n\nAt the bottom end, multiple six-pointers offer teams a chance to create daylight between themselves and the drop zone. With form fluctuating across the table, this gameweek promises tension, drama, and fine margins.\n\nLeeds will be hopeful of delivering a much-improved performance after a disappointing 4–0 defeat to Arsenal last week.\n\nThe Whites must be sharper in front of goal and defensively disciplined if they are to get a result against Nottingham Forest.\n\nForest were unable to capitalise against an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace side dealing with off-field issues.\n\nWith both teams level on 26 points, this clash represents a potential six-pointer in the relegation battle and should make for a tense encounter.\n\nJaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha are doubts for Leeds, while Anton Stach is ruled out. James Justin has made a full recovery and is expected to be available.\n\nFor Forest, Matz Sels and Callum Hudson-Odoi are doubts, while Neco Williams is suspended.\n\nA last-minute strike from Benjamin Šeško earned Manchester United their third consecutive win since Michael Carrick took charge as interim manager.\n\nThe Red Devils have found their rhythm in attack while maintaining defensive discipline, making them favourites to extend their unbeaten run to six matches when Spurs visit Old Trafford.\n\nTottenham showed resilience by coming back from two goals down against Manchester City last week. Improved second-half performances saw Dominic Solanke score twice to rescue a point.\n\nThat level of intensity will be required again if Spurs are to trouble Carrick’s side.\n\nMicky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, and Dominic Solanke have all been passed fit, while Djed Spence is a doubt.\n\nArsenal will be keen to secure all three points after an entertaining draw in the reverse fixture at the Stadium of Light.\n\nThe Gunners returned to winning ways by dismantling Leeds last week, extending their lead at the top of the table to six points.\n\nThey also booked their place in the League Cup final by completing a semi-final double over Chelsea at the Emirates.\n\nSunderland picked up an important victory against Burnley last week to move back into the top half of the table. It was just the Black Cats’ second win in five games.\n\nMartin Ødegaard is a doubt for Arsenal, while Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino are ruled out through injury.\n\nBournemouth secured a routine 2–0 win over Wolves last week, making it three wins in their last four matches and four games unbeaten.\n\nThe Cherries appear to have adjusted well following Antoine Semenyo’s departure.\n\nAston Villa, meanwhile, were frustrated in a goalless draw against 10-man Brentford despite playing with a numerical advantage from the 42nd minute.\n\nThe dropped points saw Villa fall one point behind second-placed Manchester City and seven behind leaders Arsenal. David Brooks is a doubt for Bournemouth, while Ollie Watkins is a doubt for Villa.\n\nThis is a clash between 18th and 19th on the league table. Burnley failed to extend their unbeaten run to four matches after a tepid 3–0 defeat to Sunderland.\n\nThe Clarets’ performance was disappointing, and Scott Parker will demand a significant response.\n\nWest Ham suffered a second-half collapse last week, surrendering a two-goal lead against Chelsea.\n\nDespite that setback, the Hammers come into this clash as slight favourites based on recent performances. Jean-Clair Todibo remains suspended.\n\nFulham’s defensive frailties were exposed last week when Manchester United snatched all three points courtesy of a last-minute Šeško winner.\n\nPrior to that goal, the Cottagers had shown resilience by fighting back from two goals down to level the match deep into stoppage time.\n\nUnlike Fulham, Everton were beneficiaries of late drama, with Beto scoring in the 97th minute to rescue a point against Brighton.\n\nThe result extended the Toffees’ unbeaten run to four games and lifted them into the top half of the table.\n\nWolves’ brief resurgence has come to an abrupt end following back-to-back defeats.\n\nRob Edwards’ side looked devoid of ideas in their loss to Bournemouth and could face a tough afternoon when Chelsea visit Molineux. Ladislav Krejčí is a slight doubt.\n\nChelsea will be eager to bounce back from their League Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal.\n\nThe Blues have won their last three league matches, with Enzo Fernández and João Pedro shouldering the attacking burden.\n\nFilip Jørgensen, Reece James, and Pedro Neto are doubts, while Jamie Gittens is ruled out long-term with a hamstring injury.\n\nNewcastle exited the League Cup after a heavy 5–1 aggregate defeat to Manchester City.\n\nThe Magpies have also struggled in the league, failing to win any of their last three matches, and European qualification now looks unlikely.\n\nBruno Guimarães and Lewis Miley are doubts, while Anthony Gordon is ruled out with a hamstring injury.\n\nBrentford showed immense resilience to secure a 1–0 win over Aston Villa despite playing more than half the match with ten men. The victory moved the Bees to within five points of fourth-placed Manchester United.\n\nBrighton will be without Yasin Ayari due to a shoulder injury, but Diego Gómez has been passed fit.\n\nThe Seagulls were denied victory by a late Everton equaliser last week, extending their winless run to four matches.\n\nCrystal Palace earned just their second point in five games with a 1–1 draw against Nottingham Forest.\n\nOngoing off-field issues appear to be affecting performances, with the Eagles now sitting 15th, nine points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nLiverpool host Manchester City in the standout fixture of the gameweek at Anfield.\n\nThe Reds will be seeking revenge after a 3–0 defeat in the reverse fixture and will take confidence from their emphatic 4–1 win over Newcastle last week.\n\nJeremie Frimpong remains sidelined, while Joe Gomez faces a late fitness test.\n\nManchester City need a win to keep pace with Arsenal in the title race. Pep Guardiola’s side have won just one of their last five league matches and now sit six points behind the leaders.\n\nA second-half collapse against Spurs last week highlighted recent inconsistencies. Rúben Dias is ruled out, while Bernardo Silva is a doubt.",

    "description": "New court filing sheds considerable light on Gruden's four-year-old civil action.",
    "fullText": "Former Buccaneers and Raiders coach Jon Gruden's lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell continues. And, as Gruden sees it, the potential financial damages will be very significant.\n\nIn a Case Conference Report filed on Wednesday, February 5, Gruden's lawyers revealed that his losses \"total well over $150,000,000.\" The damages flow from, per the Case Conference Report, \"loss of his employment, interference with future employment opportunities, loss of contract value, loss of sponsorships, reputational damage, costs, expert fees, and attorney fees incurred as a result of this dispute.\"\n\nGruden filed the lawsuit roughly a month after his forced resignation from the Raiders, following reports from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times containing emails Gruden had sent and received while employed by ESPN. Those emails had been harvested as part of an investigation regarding the Washington Commanders and former owner Daniel Snyder. Gruden contends that the emails were leaked with the specific goal of prompting the termination of his employment.\n\nThe Case Conference Report was prepared following an \"early case conference\" in which the NFL declined to participate. The league, we're told, contends that discovery in the case has been stayed pending the appeal of a denial of a motion to dismiss under the Nevada anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nIn the Case Conference Report, a copy of which PFT has obtained and reviewed, Gruden's lawyers list in the form of mandatory disclosures the potential witnesses in the case. They include: Goodell, various attorneys from the Paul Weiss law firm, former NFL general counsel Jeff Pash, chief NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, Snyder, former Raiders general counsel Dan Ventrelle, Raiders owner Mark Davis, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, attorney Beth Wilkinson, various attorneys from the Reed Smith firm, Desiree Perez of Roc Nation, former NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith, and Gruden.\n\nThe Case Conference Report does not expressly indicate that any, some, or all of these individuals listed will be deposed by Gruden's lawyers, and it does not mention any current attempts to compel their deposition testimony.\n\nThe Case Conference Report lists several specific NFL teams that have potentially relevant information: the Commanders, Raiders, Cowboys, Patriots, Seahawks, Giants, Jets, and Dolphins. It does not identify any of the reporters from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.\n\nIn a separate portion of the Case Conference Report, Gruden's lawyers list various documents that they contend the NFL should disclose \"immediately.\" The documents include all 650,000 documents generated during Wilkinson's investigation of the Commanders and a so-called \"'Blackmail Powerpoint' presented by Daniel Snyder and/or Reed Smith to the NFL Defendants, containing communications by Roger Goodell and Jeff Pash.\"\n\nThe Case Conference Report also states that no settlement discussions have occurred.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the NFL has filed, or plans to file, a petition for appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the question of whether Gruden should be required to pursue his claims through arbitration controlled by the NFL.\n\nThe case has been pending for more than four years, due mainly to the preliminary skirmishes regarding the arbitration question. At some point, depositions will occur and documents will be obtained — unless the case is dismissed or settled.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Clippers were one of the hottest teams in the NBA heading into the trade deadline, and nobody saw what came next.\n\nAfter rattling off a 16-3 stretch that pulled them from the bottom of the Western Conference standings all the way into play-in position, the front office decided to blow it up.\n\nIn the span of just a few days, the Clippers moved their second- and third-best players, James Harden and Ivica Zubac, turning what looked like a late-season push into a full-blown rebuild on the fly.\n\nThe Clippers now sit at 23-27 on the season and are left with more questions than answers as they head into All-Star Weekend as the host team at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe first domino fell on Tuesday when the Clippers sent 11-time All-Star James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for two-time All-Star Darius Garland and a second-round pick.\n\nHarden had been the engine that kept Los Angeles afloat all season, averaging 25.4 points and 8.1 assists per game while carrying the team through a brutal 6-21 start.\n\nHe was having his best scoring season in six years, so the move caught almost everyone off guard.\n\nBREAKING: The Los Angeles Clippers are trading James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Darius Garland and a second-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Prolific swap of the star point guards. pic.twitter.com/IHhhhabJnX\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 4, 2026\n\nFor the Clippers, though, it was about looking ahead.\n\nGarland is 10 years younger than Harden and is locked into a long-term deal that runs through 2028-29.\n\nHe is recovering from a toe injury that has kept him out since January 14, but when healthy he is a strong scorer and playmaker who averaged 20.6 points and 6.7 assists last season.\n\nClippers president Lawrence Frank said the team is \"trying to get younger while continuing to win,\" and Garland fits that goal on both ends.\n\nThe Clippers were not done there. On Thursday, they sent starting center Ivica Zubac and forward Kobe Brown to the Indiana Pacers in a deal that brought back a big haul of young talent and draft picks.\n\nLos Angeles received Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, two first-round picks and a second-round pick in return.\n\nFULL TRADE DETAILS:\n\nPacers receive:\nIvica Zubac\nKobe Brown\n\nClippers receive:\nBenedict Mathurin\nIsaiah Jackson\n2 1st-round picks\n2nd-round pick pic.twitter.com/iCAvemn9ls\n\n— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) February 5, 2026\n\nZubac had been the longest-tenured Clipper on the roster, having joined the team back in 2019 after being traded from the cross-town rival Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe was putting up 14.4 points and 11.0 rebounds per game this season while shooting over 61 percent from the floor, and he was coming off a career year in 2024-25 that earned him All-Defensive Second Team honors.\n\nThe centerpiece coming back is Mathurin, a 23-year-old wing who has been averaging 17.8 points per game this season and gives Los Angeles the kind of young scoring talent they will need going forward.\n\nThe draft capital is a big part of this, too. The Pacers' 2026 first-round pick is protected 1-4 and 10-30, which means the Clippers only get it if it falls between the fifth and ninth picks.\n\nIndiana currently has one of the worst records in the league, so there is close to a coin flip chance it lands in that range. If it does not, it turns into an unprotected 2031 first-rounder from Indiana, and the Clippers also picked up an unprotected 2029 first from the Pacers.\n\nWhat makes the timing so shocking is that the Clippers had just gone on that incredible 16-3 run and seemed to have real momentum going.\n\nThe Clippers pivoted HARD and turned James Harden and Ivica Zubac into:\n\n- Darius Garland\n- Bennedict Mathurin\n- Two first-round picks, including a potential lottery pick.\n\nHats off to the front office.\n\n— Grant \"Money\" Mona (@Gmona48) February 5, 2026\n\nThey had the oldest roster in the NBA this season with six core players aged 31 or older, and the front office clearly decided that a possible first-round exit in the playoffs was not worth passing up the chance to get younger and stockpile assets.\n\nKawhi Leonard will remain with the team for now, but his future in Los Angeles will be a major talking point this offseason.\n\nFor a franchise that came into the year swinging for the fences with a veteran-heavy roster, this was a pivot that nobody expected, and the ripple effects will be felt for years to come.\n\nFor now, though, it is a new era in Inglewood.",

    "fullText": "World Skeleton champion Shelley Rudman was the star of Team GB Winter Olympics back in 2006 when she was the only one to return with a medal, creating a fever in her Wiltshire village which is still felt by some today.\n\nAs this year's Winter Olympics kicks off in northern Italy, Rudman said she would never have guessed the lasting legacy that bringing home the silver medal would have on Pewsey, where she was born and still lives.\n\nTwo streets are now named after her, Olympic Road and Silver Road, which she says makes her children very proud.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal, my children love the fact they are named after me,\" Rudman added.\n\nVillagers were invested in her success from the start. They played a key role in fundraising to send her to Turin to compete on the ice, and still proudly remember their involvement.\n\nOne of them being Emma Dainton, who along with Colin Harris, canoed a 35-mile route from Pewsey to Bath along the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n\nEmma said: \"It was so quiet on the canal until a swan chased us for a while, and we joked about it and we cheered each other on.\"\n\nDuring the Games, Emma was travelling in Australia and watched the heats on TV with her fellow backpackers.\n\n\"I told them all about Shelley and how I was part of her fundraising team and she was from my village,\" she added.\n\nBack at home, nothing could prepare landlord Jerry Kunkler for the world's media and fans cramming into his Moonrakers pub.\n\n\"My phone kept ringing and ringing, all the local and national media wanted to come to the pub, it was all happening.\n\n\"I had to get up early for breakfast TV and was able to talk to Shelley live from Turin. It was a whirlwind,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Games, Shelley was greeted by a champion's welcome when she arrived home.\n\nLocal newspaper reporter Nigel Kerton organised an open-top bus parade to travel through the village.\n\nNigel recalls how he phoned a bus company to see if it was possible.\n\n\"I had a dream for this to happen. You see football teams do it after cup finals, so why not for Shelley.\n\n\"It left the train station and we could see the crowds building. There must have been thousands there,\" he added.\n\nShelley said she was in disbelief when she returned home and saw how many people had turned up to cheer her home.\n\n\"There were so many friends from school I recognised and just people I saw around the village,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she will always feel grateful to those that supported her and the strong community that Pewsey still has today.\n\n\"It is just stunning around here, there's a great community spirit. I always appreciate what they did for me,\" she added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "fullText": "Wasteful. Disjointed. Beatable. These are not words typically associated with Sonia Bompastor’s Chelsea squad.\n\nThis is the team who bulldozed their way to a domestic treble last season, collecting a record-high Women’s Super League points tally of 60 (from 22 games) along the way. Until December, they were on the longest unbeaten run in league history at 34 matches.\n\nAnd yet, by losing 2-0 to Arsenal at home on January 24 and 5-1 at Manchester City on Sunday, they have made unwanted history.\n\nChelsea had not lost consecutive WSL matches since 2015, a marker of how high their standards have been, but also of how unprecedented the current situation is.\n\nThere were no major departures from the playing squad or coaching staff over the summer. Yes, there have been injuries, but any other WSL manager would still jump at the chance to manage a squad of the quality Bompastor has available.\n\nSo what has changed on the pitch to leave Chelsea vulnerable?\n\nThe main tactical change from last season has been Bompastor’s increased use of a defensive line formed of three centre-backs and two wing-backs.\n\n“It’s more about being unpredictable and being able to play with different systems,” Bompastor said after the first game of the season in September. “I think it brings some good in possession of the ball, some good control, being able to play back three.”\n\nIt is important to note that Bompastor views her setup as a back three, not five. She deploys wing-backs Ellie Carpenter and Sandy Baltimore with heavy attacking involvement, the aim being to add two more wide threats in the final third of the pitch rather than two more defensive bodies.\n\nThe problem with this shape is not that it leaves Chelsea bottom-heavy, but that it leaves them light in the middle.\n\nAttacking full-backs are an aspect of their game that has been increasingly emphasised since Carpenter arrived from French side Lyon, where she played under Bompastor for three seasons, in the summer. The Australian and Baltimore are crucial to Chelsea’s ball progression, and in build-up they tend to move high and wide to try to create overloads on the wings.\n\nWhen they get free, it can yield excellent results — see Carpenter’s superb overlapping run for her goal against Barcelona — but that build-up shape leaves the midfield light.\n\nWith Baltimore and Carpenter playing these advanced roles, the back three often remain deep to provide stability while the midfielders move higher and wider to create combinations with the wing-backs, leaving a gap between Chelsea’s lines for opponents to exploit.\n\nBelow, as Chelsea try to build from the back against Arsenal, Guro Reiten has stepped into the forward line and Wieke Kaptein has also moved up to offer support to Carpenter. Erin Cuthbert is the only holding midfielder, stationed in front of the back three.\n\nAfter Chelsea striker Sam Kerr loses the ball, Arsenal quickly have an overload and can play wide to Beth Mead, who scores the opening goal of that recent 2-0 win.\n\nPart of the problem here is that Baltimore’s advanced position grants Mead space — but in the build-up to the second goal that day, we see how even with all five defensive players back, the way the Chelsea team are set up leaves too much space in the midfield.\n\nAs Arsenal striker Alessia Russo receives a long pass from Katie McCabe, the support runners bypass Reiten, Cuthbert and Keira Walsh to invade the space in front of the Chelsea defensive line.\n\nIf anything, a Chelsea formation some of their fans say is too negative has left them vulnerable by creating gaps in front of their defensive line.\n\nThey are considerably more susceptible to conceding chances on the break this season, as this chart shows:\n\nBompastor said in October that an increase in expected goals (xG) conceded was related to wanting to take “more risks”.\n\nChelsea’s defensive quality means that opponents have not punished their vulnerability most of the time; in the first half of this season, they conceded six goals, the same as in the same period of their title-winning 2024-25 campaign and the lowest figure in the league. Until the seven goals they shipped in losing against Arsenal and Manchester City, the risks in Bompastor’s setup were not backfiring defensively, but the gamble was not paying off in attack.\n\nBompastor has acknowledged multiple times that her side’s failure to put their chances away is costing them.\n\nThe chart below shows how Chelsea’s output has fallen far below expectations based on the chances they have been generating.\n\nThe 1-0 defeat to Everton in December that ended their 34-match unbeaten run was the pinnacle of this — only six of their 30 Chelsea shots in that game were on target.\n\nPart of that is due to injuries.\n\nChelsea have not had an in-form centre-forward: Mayra Ramirez has not featured this season following hamstring surgery in September and will remain out having picked up a calf issue this week, Kerr has not been her previous clinical self since returning that same month after more than a year out recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her knee, and Aggie Beever-Jones and Catarina Macario have had sporadic fitness problems that have limited their output.\n\nWas Bompastor right to hint on Sunday that she would have liked more backing in the summer transfer market? The headline signings of Carpenter and forward Alyssa Thompson mean fans elsewhere in the WSL are unlikely to have much sympathy, but there are other areas where strengthening might have been prudent.\n\nChelsea’s attacks have felt characterised by the pace of Carpenter, Baltimore and Thompson, but been lacking the central creativity to balance them out. Perhaps nobody can match Lauren James’ quality when fit, but they need a deputy to cover for her frequent injuries. Kaptein’s transition into a more attacking role has been impressive, but that is still a work in progress.\n\nIn suffering issues with Kerr, Ramirez, Beever-Jones and Macario, Chelsea have been unlucky in the centre-forward department. That is perhaps an area they could have bought in January to refresh a forward line lacking in confidence. They have historically shown willingness to react in that window — Ramirez was brought in for a then-world record fee after Kerr tore her ACL in January 2024. However, it could be that the number of strikers already on their books made the club more reluctant to splash out again.\n\nStill, Bompastor has a squad of enormous experience and quality to draw on. These players should be more than capable of working with her to solve these tactical issues.\n\nA seventh straight WSL title may be inching out of their reach with City taking prime position, but there are still three other trophies to fight for at home and in Europe this season and if Bompastor can restore Chelsea’s missing confidence, there is no reason they cannot lift them.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "The Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2026 was a competitive one, with Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly, Adam Vinatieri and Roger Craig earning enshrinement. Among those left out: Bill Belichick and Eli Manning.\n\n2027 could be even more competitive. Belichick and Manning be back on the ballot — alongside other 2026 finalists like Frank Gore, Torry Holt and Marshal Yanda — and there will also be a large number of first-time candidates deserving of consideration.\n\nHere are 10 players whose last NFL appearance was in the 2021-22 season.\n\nOne of a few acceptable answers to the question, \"Who is the greatest tight end of all time?\"\n\nNo player caught more passes or posted more receiving yards from Tom Brady than Gronkowski, who was also one of the best blockers at his position and a larger-than-life personality. The only thing that ever limited \"Gronk\" was injuries. When healthy, he was an unstoppable weapon in the hands of some of the NFL's best minds.\n\nThe last running back to win NFL MVP was AD, who sits at fifth in the NFL's all-time rushing list and is one of nine players in history to post 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He came only eight yards short of breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season record in 2012-13.\n\nPeterson was a star from his first snap and kept going until his mid-30s.\n\nThe loudest member of the Legion of Boom was also the best. Sherman made the switch from wide receiver to cornerback in high school and waited until the fifth round of the 2011 NFL Draft to hear his name called.\n\nOne of the largest corners in the league at 6-foot-3 and 195 pounds, Sherman became a paradigm-shifting defensive back in the Seahawks' system and was a central component of their Super Bowl XLVIII team. He was an all-time trash-talker who earned it, regularly shutting down his side of the field.\n\nAside from Manning, the system is usually kind to two-time Super Bowl champion quarterbacks. Roethlisberger's first ring was more a product of Jerome Bettis and the Pittsburgh Steelers defense in his sophomore season, but was overall one of the NFL's most prolific quarterbacks during his 18-year career.\n\nBig Ben retired as the all-time leading passer for one of the NFL's most storied franchises. However, a pair of sexual assault allegations from earlier in his career loomed over his achievements, and there's no telling how that could play out if Spygate was enough to get Bill Belichick off some people's ballots.\n\nOur second of three Steelers offensive stars is also the most mercurial, to put it politely. Brown was on track for an overwhelming case when he turned 30 and still had a standout career, ranking behind only Hines Ward on the Steelers' all-time receiving list.\n\nAnd yet, few stars have crashed out of the NFL as loudly as Brown did, first with the Oakland Raiders, then the New England Patriots, then the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He rose from the sixth round of the 2010 Draft to do some amazing things on the field, but he's going to be remembered for much more than that.\n\nThe third of the Killer B's likely faces the longest odds, considering how short his prime ended up being. Bell was one of the NFL's top backs as a runner and receiver, but an ugly divorce from the Steelers saw him sit out a season then land with the New York Jets. He was never the same after that.\n\nNewton not making the College Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility despite posting one of the greatest seasons in the sport's history was a Belichick-style puzzler. His NFL career was a standout too.\n\nNewton led the 2015-16 Carolina Panthers to a 15-1 record and the Super Bowl, demanding attention every time he stood on the field. Injuries derailed what could have been a strong second act, though, especially with so many other quarterbacks vying for enshrinement.\n\nOffensive linemen usually don't get their due, but Whitworth earned his right to be an exemption with a 16-year career as a dependable blind-side blocker for the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams. He went out on top with the latter against the former at Super Bowl LVI, alongside...\n\nWeddle spent a solid decade as one of the NFL's top safeties for the San Diego Chargers and Baltimore Ravens, earning six Pro Bowl nods and hauling in 29 interceptions in his career. He had a strong case when he first retired in 2020, but his return to the Rams in 2021-22 postseason after a pair of devastating injuries was one of the biggest stories of their Super Bowl title, especially when he didn't let a pec tear stop him from playing every defensive snap.\n\nMack was arguably the best center of the 2010s, earning seven Pro Bowl nods for the Cleveland Browns, Atlanta Falcons and San Francisco 49ers. Between him and Joe Thomas, the Browns had two of the best in the league anchoring their offensive line for seven years, and he helped lead the Falcons to the ill-fated Super Bowl LI with the Falcons.",

    "fullText": "“It makes me sad that women’s football is sexualised and disrespected,” read Liverpool midfielder Marie Hobinger’s victim statement. “No woman, no matter her job, should have to put up with this type of behaviour.”\n\nMangal Dalal, 42, contacted Hobinger, 24, via social media before waiting for her at the side of the pitch after Liverpool’s away game against Manchester City in February 2025. He was handed a two-year restraining order and sentenced to 18 months of community service in January after pleading guilty to stalking the Austria international.\n\nThis is only one example that highlights the growing concerns around the safety of Women’s Super League (WSL) footballers. “There is that fear among players that it could happen to anyone,” Fern Whelan, women’s football equality, diversity and inclusion executive for the Professional Footballers’ Association, tells The Athletic.\n\nDuring the 2025 European Championship, England and Gotham defender Jess Carter spoke out about the racist abuse she received on the internet, later telling the BBC she feared leaving the team hotel. A 60-year-old man pleaded guilty to malicious communications in January. Mark Roberts, the national lead for football policing, called the comments “appalling”.\n\nAt the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, when England reached the final, the Lionesses received fan mail from Australia that contained death threats. The UK football policing unit (UKFPU) conducted a joint investigation, including forensics, with Australian police, but as yet, nobody has been charged.\n\nIn January, Arsenal deleted a video on X and turned comments off on Instagram of new signing Smilla Holmberg promoting ticket sales because of inappropriate sexualised and misogynistic comments. Tottenham Hotspur also turned comments off on their X post announcing the arrival of Matilda Nilden, 19, for the same reason. Some of the replies asked X’s artificial intelligence tool Grok to produce sexualised images of the player.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement for Matilda Nildén to join us from BK Häcken in January, 2026 ✍️\n\n🗞️ https://t.co/bLC1QvkmsS pic.twitter.com/xPUfesurS2\n\n— Tottenham Hotspur Women (@SpursWomen) December 31, 2025\n\n“It is really worrying,” says Whelan. “It’s difficult to manage unless it is stopped at source.”\n\nSome players have spoken about their fear of staying in their own homes after receiving rape and death threats online, Whelan told a Women and Equalities Committee held in the UK Parliament in October. Online abuse of women players, she said, has become “alarmingly worse” and “catapulted” since 2024 to the point where it is becoming “dangerous”.\n\nOther areas of concern for players include the control and management of access on matchdays, their safety when off duty, and the amount of contact they have with fans and the general public via social media.\n\nSome player representatives have put preventative measures in place, such as limiting the number of private drivers who can take a player home, to reduce how widely their addresses are known. Another noted that their players expressed no concern at all about their safety.\n\nThe UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on football has recently launched an inquiry into online harms across the men’s and women’s games. “We are clear that the women’s game faces some specific and heightened risks,” said Fair Game, secretariat to the Football APPG.\n\nThe Athletic has spoken to stakeholders within the game, including WSL Football, which oversees the top two tiers of women’s football in England; data science company Signify; and the PFA and the UKFPU to investigate how safe WSL players feel. The English Football Association was approached for comment, as were all WSL clubs.\n\nIn some incidents detailed below, clubs in question remain anonymous to respect the confidentiality of their security arrangements.\n\nThe message may read: “I know where you park your car”, “I know what car you drive”, or “I know where you live”. Whether genuine or not, such messages force players to judge the level of threat.\n\nWomen’s football is in a period of generational transition. The increased investment and global broadcast exposure have seen a fundamental shift in the game’s profile, especially in England, following the Lionesses’ consecutive European triumphs in 2022 and 2025. All publicity, however, is not good publicity.\n\nHistorically, women’s football has leaned into accessibility — players signing autographs, taking photos and engaging closely with supporters. As the game’s profile has grown, that openness has created tension between connection and safety.\n\n“It is becoming increasingly difficult for elite-level women’s players to embrace fan access to the same levels as has been the case historically,” says Jonathan Sebire, co-founder at Signify, which works across multiple sports and with several WSL clubs to collect, triage and assess the threat online abuse poses to players.\n\nThe majority of online abuse players receive contains sexual elements, according to Signify, including sexualised content of the individual player or their partner. Other categories of online abuse include racist and violent threats, the latter of which often contains a sexualised element. Some abuse, particularly from male online users, centres on the quality of the women’s game, but there is another concern, says Signify, that has increased far more rapidly.\n\n“One of the fundamental differences in the women’s game is there are openly gay players, some of whom are in relationships with other footballers, some of whom are at the same club,” says Sebire.\n\n“We see a large number of young women who look up to these players because of their sexuality. They’re seen as openly gay icons and role models in the sport. It starts with a level of fandom that has sometimes tipped over into fixation, infatuation and developed into something more problematic.”\n\nSuch behaviour is not exclusively linked to sexuality, but most cases known directly to Signify fall into this category.\n\nIn some rare instances, but increasing in occurrence, people have followed players around supermarkets and visited the same bars or restaurants as them. Contact can start online and move offline or vice versa. For example, players have reported people making contact via direct messages online and then seeing them appear in their local surroundings.\n\n“It’s not uncommon,” says Sebire. “If you speak to a group of players, some will almost certainly have experienced it.”\n\nSignify observes that often the behaviour does not involve physical contact or direct interaction. Instead, it centres on attempts to create the appearance of a relationship for others to see — for example, by taking selfies of themselves with players in the background. They then message players later online to suggest a personal connection.\n\n“If they’re doing that every week, that has become an infatuation,” says Sebire. “In most cases, when the club or police warn them and tell them this behaviour is problematic, it stops because they are shocked it has been noticed and received in that way.”\n\nIn other extreme cases, players have suspected a person was tracking their car’s movements, as they appeared wherever the players went. Clubs have sanctioned season-ticket holders, and law enforcement agencies have carried out risk assessments in response.\n\nThe answer, though, is not for women players to simply abstain from social media. “It is not their responsibility; they are just doing their jobs,” says Whelan.\n\nMany women’s players, after all, earn significantly more through off-field commercial deals than via playing contracts. Social media is a critical tool for connecting with fans, building personal profiles, and securing sponsorship income.\n\nIt is also far more likely that women’s players still run their own social media accounts, whereas in the men’s game, certainly among Premier League stars, others tend to manage players’ online profiles. According to Sebire, that is something that needs to and is starting to change.\n\nIt is also very different for a WSL player, who may live a relatively ‘normal’ life, to receive a threatening message than perhaps a Premier League footballer who lives in a house with significant security provisions and perhaps access to a private chef or barber. Premier League clubs also have established onboarding processes for their players, with, for example, security briefings including dedicated services for players’ properties.\n\nThat does not negate the impact of online abuse for a men’s player, but it is important context to consider, even if some WSL players are now household names.\n\n“In some clubs, the infrastructure around women’s teams’ safety is catching up with the men’s game,” says Sebire. “But it has not been universal. Those are fundamentals that have to change for women’s players to feel safe.”\n\nThe nature of the online abuse suffered by women’s players is often different, too. Unlike violent or racist abuse, it does not necessarily fit into a clearly defined category with reporting mechanisms, policies and consequences.\n\nThe Online Safety Act, fully enforced as of 2025, means OFCOM, the UK’s independent regulator for the communications industries, can take action against social media platforms, including removing content or working with law enforcement. But there are nuances to the women’s game that need to be considered.\n\nSome platforms do not recognise a lot of the abuse and threat directed at women because universal language, such as “kitchen” — referring, for example, to the misogynistic phrase ‘Get back in the kitchen’ — is repurposed or not seen as harmful without the necessary context.\n\nThe AI tool Grok is another example. X has now prevented Grok from being used to edit images of real people in revealing clothing after OFCOM launched an investigation in January. The public body Sport England decided to stop using X last month to stay true to its values of the “mission is to ensure sport and physical activity are safe and inclusive for everyone,” it said in a statement. WSL Football had already scaled back its use of X, and some WSL clubs have said they continue to monitor the situation.\n\nAnother growing pain for WSL clubs is the contrast between playing games at the women’s home grounds and the main club’s stadia.\n\nIt is easier for the club to use the same security infrastructure at a Premier League ground when their women’s team plays there, but when switching to smaller grounds, there are different security measures around the pitch, players’ entrance, or car park.\n\n“It’s safer in general to be at the Emirates,” England captain and Arsenal defender Leah Williamson told the New Statesman in December. “You’re more accessible. It’s a five-metre difference (between the players and fans).”\n\nSome players have reported concerns of being repeatedly approached by the same people outside stadiums and hassled as they approach their cars.\n\n“If players make themselves accessible signing autographs in the ground with stewards but are approached once they leave the ground, when do they say: ‘No, this isn’t appropriate?” asks one person. “That feels like an invasion of space.”\n\nSupporter interaction has become increasingly challenging as attendances have increased. WSL Football, WSL clubs and the English Football Association are trying to balance maintaining the game’s unique atmosphere and sense of community while grappling with a rapidly changing landscape.\n\nAhead of the 2024-2025 season, Chelsea changed their player access rules before and after games, citing it was “no longer safe or sustainable” for players to sign autographs or take selfies “in an uncontrolled way”. Many clubs followed suit. Some now have more organised meet-and-greets with season-ticket holders in a controlled environment, while others have close-protection officers pitchside. When on England duty, players walk around the pitch after games but do not stop and sign autographs.\n\n“It would be a shame if it got shut down to the extent that the men’s game has,” says Sebire. “But the risk is there.”\n\nClubs are taking player safety seriously, according to numerous people, and are investing to try to keep players safe. “Everybody is just trying to find a way through,” comments one observer.\n\nWSL Football’s safeguarding standards require that each “club ensures that physical and online environments promote safety and wellbeing while minimising the opportunity for children, adults at risk and players to be harmed and/or exposed to harmful or inappropriate behaviour, materials or content”.\n\nEach club undertakes its own risk assessments and all clubs in the top two leagues have a nominated police officer. WSL Football has its own safety and security working group and regularly engages with the UKFPU and clubs via monthly safety officer meetings.\n\nThe FA and several WSL clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea, London City Lionesses, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, say they have robust security provisions and educational resources. Some employ dedicated safeguarding, player care and close-protection measures, alongside partnerships with external monitoring firms, while others have players escorted at matches and events, administer online safety training, and have formal reporting routes.\n\nThe biggest barrier to prosecution a few years ago was obtaining player statements. “With the national teams, we’ve certainly broken through that,” Chief Constable for Cheshire Police Mark Roberts tells The Athletic.\n\nNow, the UKFPU prepares players by explaining the reporting process proactively, and before tournaments, officers conduct security briefings and education sessions with the England team to offer advice regarding security and online abuse.\n\n“Don’t just delete it, try to keep it,” says Roberts. “We’ll capture it, try to identify the person, ask for a statement, and give the player support. It’s the shock of receiving something and making sure they know what to do. If you debunk the system, hopefully it makes it easier for people to come forward.”\n\nSignify has found that in some of their education sessions, players may understandably find it embarrassing to talk about their experiences, whether it’s the content of the material or that it has affected them. Often, individuals report incidents in private after group sessions.\n\n“If anything is happening in places that no one else can see, tell someone about it because you shouldn’t be dealing with this on your own,” says Sebire. “It’s not OK.”\n\nNikki Doucet, CEO of WSL Football, has spoken with Meta’s global head of safety and the Women’s National Basketball Association about the tools they use. She recently met at UK Parliament with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s Women’s Sport Taskforce, hosted by minister Stephanie Peacock, alongside representatives from OFCOM, the police, and other sports leaders to discuss protections for sportswomen online.\n\n“It is top of the PFA’s agenda, including pushing the clubs to see how we can protect the players better,” says Whelan, adding that online abuse is a “massive barrier” to participation for many young girls and parents.\n\n“It is not football that is the problem; it is the perpetrators behind it all,” she adds. “We have to make sure the people who are looking after the footballers are taking it really seriously. I would hate for it to come to a point where those threats become reality, and then we act.\n\n“Everyone is working hard behind the scenes to find a solution. Clubs are aware of the concerns the players have raised. There is a real shift; players are not going to stand for this. The more we see perpetrators held to account, the more they are emboldened.”\n\nAdditional reporting: Philip Buckingham\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, England, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

They head into the Olympic break on a three-game skid, currently three points out of a Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nVegas, which heads into the break atop the Pacific Division, set a major tone in the first period. After a quiet opening eight minutes from both sides, Jack Eichel, Mark Stone, Pavel Dorofeyev and Mitch Marner all scored for the Golden Knights within five and a half minutes of each other.\n\nThe @GoldenKnights aren't messing around tonight. 👁️👁️\n\nThey're up 4-0 in the first period! pic.twitter.com/ohjiGNYNAc\n\nTrevor Moore managed to get one back for the Kings at the 15:03 mark of the period, providing their only tally of the night.

He becomes just the 39th player in league history to achieve the milestone and only the eighth born outside of North America to do so.\n\nLos Angeles proved otherwise ineffective against Golden Knights' netminder Adin Hill, who saved 32 shots en route to the 100th win of his career. It was the first victory for the nine-year veteran against the Kings in a Knights uniform.\n\nOn the other side of the ice, Anton Forsberg fell to 9-7-5 as his struggles in Las Vegas continue to linger. Across two road starts against the Golden Knights this season, he has allowed nine combined goals, representing two of his three highest goal totals surrendered to opponents this season.\n\nThe Kings were forced to hold their breath regarding the status of Andrei Kuzmenko, who took an inadvertent puck to the face late in the first period of Saturday's loss. He seemed to skate off the ice in a state of discomfort, but was eventually able to return to the contest midway through the second period.\n\nAndrei Kuzmenko leaves the game after taking a redirected puck to the face. pic.twitter.com/b6ZyoANJSU\n\n— Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) February 6, 2026\n\nRecent blockbuster trade acquisition Artemi Panarin was not in the lineup for Los Angeles and is not expected to make his debut with the squad until after the break. He will begin practicing with the team on Feb. 18, looking to ramp up and help the Kings in their second-half push to the postseason.\n\nFive different players will represent Los Angeles at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Italy. Joel Armia (Finland), Adrian Kempe (Sweden), Kevin Fiala (Switzerland), Drew Doughty (Canada) and Darcy Kuemper (Canada) will all make the trip to represent their countries.\n\nKings' hockey will return on Wednesday, Feb. 25th, in yet another battle against the Golden Knights.

    "fullText": "Liverpool have real injury problems right now and one of them will surely force a new transfer strategy.\n\nLiverpool haven't had a good time of it with injuries this season. Giovanni Leoni's knee injury on debut ruled him out for the season and things never really got easier.\n\nAlexander Isak is missing long-term. His season has been a near-nightmare as he battled for fitness only to be rewarded with a leg fracture as soon as he found momentum.\n\nThen there's Conor Bradley. Bradley suffered an awful knee injury against Arsenal last month and it's one that keeps him out for the season at the very least.\n\nBut there's a feeling that he might actually be out longer than that. Sport Scientist Simon Brundish reports that Bradley's rehabilitation time is likely to be around a year in a brilliant analysis of the situation.\n\nIf Brundish is correct - and he typically is - then this will force Liverpool into a chance of plans.\n\nThere is no chance that Liverpool were going to look at right-back options this coming summer. It’s a situation they handled in 2025, signing Jeremie Frimpong to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nHalf the midfield options can play there, too, and it felt like a well-stocked position. Only, it absolutely isn’t.\n\nBradley will be missing for some time and Frimpong has proven unreliable with his own fitness. He’s currently injured for the third time this season.\n\nJoe Gomez, one option there, has a difficult injury history and has been linked with an exit. Curtis Jones has also been linked with an exit as he enters the final year of his contract and he’s been an option at right-back, too.\n\nAnd so with things as they are, Dominik Szoboszlai could end up being the de facto right-back for a lot of next season. That’s not something Liverpool will want.\n\nNot only is he not a natural there but he actively doesn’t want to play as a regular right-back - something that will become an issue as Liverpool try to negotiate a new contract with him. It’s also a move that depletes the midfield further.\n\nThe only real solution seems to be for the club to consider new right-backs. Or at least, players comfortable at operating there, either from midfield or a centre-back position.\n\nThey absolutely won’t have shortlisted many such players but plans have changed.

    "description": "How real is the AI threat to software companies? CNBC put it to the test by vibe-coding a Monday.com replacement.",
    "fullText": "Software, legal services and video games stocks have been selling off in recent weeks on fears that new AI features and tools could wipe them out. But how real is that threat? We decided to find out.\n\nCNBC's Deidre Bosa and I used Anthropic's AI coding tool \"Claude Code\" with the goal of creating a replacement for Monday.com, a project management platform with a $5 billion market cap. We didn't expect to get anywhere — we're not developers and we don't have any coding experience. But we have become adept at vibe-coding tools, which are AI tools that can build functioning apps based on commands in plain English from users, including those with limited technical chops.\n\nWe started out simple, telling Claude to build a project management dashboard similar to Monday, with features like multiple project boards, assigned team members and a status dropdown. It spit out a working prototype in minutes.\n\nWe then asked Claude to research Monday on its own, identify main features and recreate them. It added a number of other features, including a calendar.\n\nThe real magic happened when we connected the clone to an email account, essentially spinning up a customized project manager for our personal lives. The AI found Dee's forgotten calendar invite for a kid's birthday party (which she definitely didn't have a gift for yet) and it added reminders to book tickets for an upcoming trip and sign a waiver for another kid's birthday party.\n\nIt took us under an hour, and had we been paying users, it would have cost something like $5 to $15 in compute credits, depending on how much we went back and forth with the AI agent. As more data centers get built out, that cost could start to come down.\n\nSo which companies should investors worry about? Silicon Valley insiders we talk to say the most exposed names are the ones that \"sit on top of the work\" — tools like Atlassian, Adobe, HubSpot, Zendesk, and Smartsheet, that aren't core to businesses.\n\nThey say cybersecurity stocks like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto are harder to disrupt since they have network effects that no one would want to try to replicate and maintain.\n\nSystems of record may be safer, but not immune. Salesforce, for instance, anchors a business with enterprise data, making it harder to clone with a weekend coding project.\n\nWith the wholesale sell-off in software this year, that may be a chance for investors to separate between the need-to-haves and nice-to-haves.",

    "fullText": "This is Pine Chapel Road. One of the most beautiful spots in the county. The rolling hills, the wildlife, vegetation, the water. Absolutely stunning. It’s kind of my zen place.\n\nThese beautiful rolling hills behind us are used for cattle grazing. There’s nothing about this that doesn’t look healthy, right? And lo and behold, it is absolutely contaminated with the sludge and the PFAS. It’s one of many fields that are toxic in this county.\n\nIt is kind of concerning, isn’t it, to see these guys standing in the water that’s so polluted with PFAS. Poor things have no idea what they’re standing in.\n\nPolyfluoroalkyl, commonly called PFAS.\n\nA contaminant linked to cancer and other illnesses.\n\nFamilies in northwest Georgia have been living with unanswered questions about PFAS.\n\nWater quality experts are raising alarm bells about a dangerous chemical.\n\nI think that PFAS is going to eventually be the front and foremost of health problems here.\n\nI moved here around the age of 5. I’ve basically been here ever since. That’s a good chunk of my life.\n\nI just turned 34 a couple weeks ago and I feel that’s too young to feel how I do physically. What I technically have been diagnosed with is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It’s something that affects you from the second you wake up to the second you go to bed. It makes me feel guilty as a mom that when my kids ask to do something, I have to explain to them I don’t feel well enough to do that. I feel it’s unfair to them.\n\nWe have to be realistic in the fact liver is something you have to have to survive. And if the damage continues, you eventually have to go on a transplant list, and a transplant list is a long wait. My husband and I actually were discussing a will last night. I’ve discussed it a little bit with my daughter. It’s one of those things that when I do discuss it, you can tell it sets panic off in her for a second. She needs to care more. [Laughs]\n\nShe’s young, but just because you’re young doesn’t mean these things don’t scare you. It doesn’t mean that we can’t prepare you for the worst, we can’t discuss this.\n\nI love you. Have a good day. Morning.\n\nI hope for the best for the future, but right now it’s a day at a time.\n\nDYLAN JACKSON, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nDalton is known as the carpet capital of the world. This is a town that lives and breathes the carpet industry.\n\nJASON DEAREN, The Associated Press:\n\nThere are dozens of carpet mills located there. And at these carpet mills, there’s a dyeing process where they put the color on the carpets. Well, when they do that, they also add chemicals.\n\nThe PFAS was in these chemicals that provide stain resistance. So PFAS got into the water because when that washes off the carpets, it ended up going into the drains to the local utility and ultimately ending up in the river water.\n\nFor much of the past year, a consortium of journalists from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The (Charleston) Post and Courier and AL.com in Alabama, along with The Associated Press and FRONTLINE, have been investigating the carpet industry’s use of products that contained chemicals known as PFAS, even amid warnings of their accumulation in human blood and possible health effects.\n\nWe knew already that there was environmental crisis unfolding in northwest Georgia. The story of responsibility and who should be held accountable is basically a finger-pointing game between the chemical industry, the carpet industry and others.\n\nThere’s a couple things I want to check in here. First—\n\nThe team reviewed thousands of pages of documents and court depositions—\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me.\n\n—and interviewed former regulators and industry insiders, as well doctors, scientists—\n\nWe can extract PFAS from the sample—\n\n—and people who have the kinds of illnesses that researchers have linked to PFAS contamination.\n\nDR. KATHERINE NAYMICK, Family physician:\n\nWe think it’s affecting your liver.\n\nWhat took it to the next level for us and what drew our attention is that there were clear lines of accountability for this contamination and a clear need to really understand why things are the way they are up in northwest Georgia.\n\nThe carpet industry has long insisted it’s not to blame for PFAS getting into the environment and argued that chemical companies obscured the risks and assured them that the products they were supplying were safe.\n\nBut the recently reviewed records also show that executives from the two largest carpet companies, Shaw and Mohawk, were getting warnings about potential harms dating back decades.\n\nAnd with little regulation until recently, the team found that for years both the companies and their suppliers were able to legally switch among stain-resistant products that contained different types of PFAS.\n\nWe can’t do this story without industry’s perspective.\n\nBRAD SCHRADE, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nYou want to just update us on where we are with data?\n\nJUSTIN PRICE, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nMost of the testing up in northwest Georgia is completed, but the rest of the state we still are looking at.\n\nDownstream of Dalton and into Alabama, we’ve estimated that there’s approximately hundreds of thousands, 200-plus thousand people who get their drinking water from the surface waters that originate with the Conasauga River.\n\nThe carpet companies say they stopped using any kind of PFAS in U.S. production in 2019. But for years the compounds ended up in the environment and take decades or more to break down. These so-called forever chemicals have routinely tested in the local drinking water at levels the EPA now considers unsafe.\n\nToday, there are lawsuits against both carpet and chemical companies, and uncertainty and feelings of betrayal are boiling across the region.\n\nWe pay for poison in our water.\n\nCommunities are worried about their drinking water, and local governments say the problem is too vast for them to fix alone.\n\nIt really is still a crisis that’s not fully understood.\n\nThe first signs of trouble began coming to light in the late 1990s.\n\nComing up through here, and these suds or foam on the water, whatever you want to call it. That’s about 18 inches tall, hanging out up in there.\n\nI want to show you what happened to this cow’s calf. Right here lays this cow’s calf. It’s about like that other calf up yonder. It’s getting to the point now you can start to smell it.\n\nROB BILOTT, Environmental attorney:\n\nI first learned about it when a farmer from West Virginia called me trying to figure out why his cows were getting sick. And that phone call back in October 1998 led to what has become several decades of research and work now into this family of chemicals we now call PFAS.\n\nRob Bilott is a lawyer whose suits over the years have exposed how chemical companies had research showing PFAS was more dangerous than the public knew.\n\nObviously you’ve seen a lot of internal company documents through your work. When did the companies, 3M and DuPont, makers of these chemicals, really start to know themselves about the health and safety?\n\nI think that’s probably one of the most disturbing aspects of the whole story on PFAS is how far back the makers of these chemicals understood how dangerous these materials were.\n\n“Industry on Parade” visits the $2 million home of a department of the DuPont company.\n\nFrom the 1950s and ’60s, you had the manufacturers understanding if this stuff gets out into the world, it’s not going to break apart. And that led to the companies being concerned about what happens to living things that might be exposed.\n\nAs I’m seeing all these documents, all these studies, all of this information that suggested there was a very dangerous, toxic, carcinogenic material, possibly not only in the water these cows in West Virginia were drinking, but possibly getting into the blood of the entire U.S. population, possibly getting into water all over the country, and nobody knew about it.\n\nMy new cookware is coated with Teflon. Food just slips off easy.\n\nPFAS had become virtually ubiquitous.\n\nWith Scotchgard protector, water beads up.\n\nFrom nonstick pans to raincoats to shoes—\n\nI got a little down my neck, but otherwise, great!\n\nYou need Scotchgard fabric protector. It keeps ordinary spills from becoming extraordinary stains.\n\n—and prized for its ability to protect against stains, which was especially useful in the carpet industry.\n\nCarpet treated with Scotchgard doesn’t absorb dirt, it rejects.\n\nOne of the most popular products was 3M’s Scotchgard.\n\nLook for the Scotchgard label underneath.\n\nSTEVEN AMTER, Environmental scientist:\n\nPFAS chemicals became basically intertwined with carpet manufacture on a deep level since the 1970s and into the ’80s and beyond.\n\nSteven Amter is an environmental scientist who has worked with Rob Bilott on PFAS lawsuits.\n\nCarpets could be hard to clean and they could stain. And what these chemicals promised to do was reduce or eliminate a lot of that, plus make them last for years.\n\n—they had advertisements on television where they poured soil on carpets and they had animals, all kinds of things just to show it’s incredible how you can keep these things now clean much easier.\n\nIt wasn’t until the late ’90s that 3M began informing the carpet industry that the type of PFAS in Scotchgard might accumulate in people’s bodies.\n\nWere there times when the carpet industry knew or strongly suspected that PFAS would cause some sort of problems?\n\nIt was an evolving practice, and that’s very much argued over in lawsuits. Certainly they were given explicit warnings by the late 1990s. They were getting information from the chemical suppliers that were making the chemicals that were then applied to the carpets at carpet mills by the carpet manufacturers.\n\nIn depositions and other court records, the reporters discovered accounts of meetings between 3M and the two main carpet companies in northwest Georgia, Shaw and Mohawk.\n\nWe have these meetings between 3M and Mohawk, Shaw, where basically 3M discloses that they’re finding this stuff building up in the blood of workers and the general public.\n\nIn one meeting in January 1999, a Shaw executive expressed concerns about getting sued, according to notes from a 3M employee.\n\nThey met with a couple executives there, and one said, quote, he “felt plaintiff’s attorneys would be involved immediately.”\n\nWhich, I mean, they weren’t involved immediately, but they were involved about two decades later, almost.\n\nSo one of the major two carpet companies was like, “How is this going to affect our bottom line? We’re going to get sued.”\n\nYeah. They were worried about getting sued.\n\nThat same day, in a meeting at Mohawk, officials there seemed far less worried.\n\n“No real sense of Mohawk problem/responsibility,” the 3M employee noted. “If it’s good enough for 3M, it’s good enough for Mohawk.”\n\n3M continued to reassure the companies that Scotchgard was safe to use. But a year and a half later, the company and the EPA made a dramatic announcement.\n\nThe 3M Company is phasing out some Scotchgard stain repellent products because of concerns about a chemical used in their production. The company says the chemical has been detected at low levels in people and the environment.\n\nA top EPA official at the time said there was no “imminent harm” to consumers during the phase out, but called the chemical compound in the product an “unacceptable technology that should be eliminated to protect human health and the environment from potentially severe long-term consequences.”\n\nThe news didn’t go over well at a meeting with Shaw Industries, the largest carpet company in the country.\n\nBob Shaw, the CEO of Shaw Industries, confronted 3M chemical executives.\n\nSo in that meeting, Bob Shaw picked up a carpet square with the Scotchgard logo on it and said, “This isn’t a logo, this is a target.”\n\n“And I got 15 million of these out in the marketplace, what am I supposed to do about that?” And then he threw that piece of carpet at them and stormed out of the meeting. This chemical on which his company relied, his billion-dollar company, billions of dollars in revenue every year, was now going to be forced to change a key ingredient of their carpet.\n\nYou have to reach out to people who are reluctant to talk.\n\nYou know, having a letter to deliver with your request and your contact information. “I want you to read it. Your input to the story is really important to us.”\n\nNo one from the chemical or carpet industries would agree to on-camera interviews.\n\nIn statements, both Shaw and Mohawk underscored that they had been assured that Scotchgard was safe, and they stopped using the chemical in it after 3M’s disclosures. Shaw said in its statement that PFAS were for “soil and water resistance” and have also been used in “thousands of applications and products.” And a lawyer for Mohawk said they were “relying on and trusting the chemical manufacturers—the inventors of these products—for their expertise.”\n\n3M has said it discontinued making products with any kind of PFAS in 2025. A successor company to DuPont still uses some PFAS compounds thought to be less persistent in the body for products like Teflon.\n\nMuch of the attention around PFAS in the region has been about exposure to it in the environment—especially drinking water—not carpets themselves. In northwest Georgia, the forever chemicals from the carpet mills ended up in the local rivers for years. In 2008, a landmark study at the University of Georgia found that the PFAS levels in one river were “among the highest ever recorded in surface water.”\n\nJESSE DEMONBREUN-CHAPMAN, Coosa River Basin Initiative:\n\nWe’re really water-rich in northwest Georgia. There is a massive network of really special creeks and rivers that weave throughout the entire region. They were transportation networks before we had rail systems and interstates. The indigenous populations had enormous civilizations up and down these rivers before settlers came. These waterways are critical for recreation, for anglers, for paddlers. They’re providing hundreds of thousands of people with drinking water. It’s really hard to overstate the historical impact of how these rivers have shaped the communities across this region.\n\nJesse Demonbreun-Chapman leads an environment protection group that has sued the chemical and carpet companies over PFAS contamination.\n\nSo now these rivers have taken on a new significance because of PFAS.\n\nIt’s not a badge of honor to be known for some of the most contaminated surface water in the country. And it’s certainly something that’s going to keep us very busy for years to come, to try and tease out how to fix this, how to maintain healthy drinking water systems, how to remediate the environment where we know we have contaminated soil and groundwater. So this issue of PFAS contamination looms large over the entire region of northwest Georgia.\n\nYou can’t see it. You can’t smell it. It doesn’t have a taste. So being told that you live in an area that has contaminated drinking water is a shock to people that came here for an environment that they felt was pristine.\n\nOur reporting in northwest Georgia has brought us before numerous people whose drinking water is contaminated, whose land is contaminated, whose food is contaminated, yet when they go to the doctor or they go to their local officials or their water district and ask, “What can we do about this? How can we get this out of our—”, there’s no answers for them.\n\nIt’s difficult to definitively connect people’s specific illnesses to the chemicals, and there are an estimated 15,000 varieties of PFAS. Little is known about the health effects of most of them. But research has been linking high levels of some types of PFAS in the body to cancers, immune disorders and diseases of the liver and thyroid.\n\nDANA BARR, Prof., Emory University:\n\nThe levels are pretty high in northwest Georgia. We’ve compared them to the general U.S. population, and their values are much higher than the general U.S. population.\n\nDana Barr is an environmental health researcher who’s tested the blood of almost 200 residents in the region.\n\nTwenty-four percent of them had levels that were above that level of high risk of health outcomes, and 74% were in that moderate risk area. And so what we want to do with these people is try to figure out how they’re being exposed, how they’re being the most exposed, and try to reduce those exposures over time. This is a community that—They just live there. They were exposed because of just the surrounding conditions.\n\nWhat do we know about the medical effects PFAS has on the human body?\n\nSo PFAS had been linked to a lot of different diseases, including thyroid hormone disruption, endocrine disruption in general. Cancers like kidney and testicular cancer. And then also alterations in lipid content in the blood as well.\n\nThat stain resistance, the thing that made them successful as a product for the chemical companies that made them, are the same reason that they’re persistent in the environment?\n\nOnce they get into people, they actually bind to albumin, which is a protein that’s in your blood. And the albumin is reabsorbed in your gut, and so it keeps circulating. So it’s not eliminated like a lot of chemicals are.\n\nIs there nothing that can be done in terms of treating or mitigating after it’s already been found in someone’s blood?\n\nThere is nothing that has been shown to be effective yet. We have ideas and we’re pursuing those right now.\n\nI reached out to my doctor. It’s like silence. They don’t know what to do or how to handle it.\n\nOne of the people in Dana Barr’s study is a hair salon owner named Dolly Baker.\n\nYeah, Jason’s my reporting partner.\n\nDana from Emory called me and she was on her vacation and said that she just wanted to talk about my results. Mine was over 1,300. High is 20, and the next highest one below me was 200 something, I believe. And she said, “I don’t want to alarm you, but we’re just trying to figure out what could be causing this.”\n\nHad you ever had any health problems or anything before?\n\nI did have to start taking thyroid medicine last year for the first time.\n\nWhat’s it like knowing that you have this inside your body and that you can’t really do much yet to address that?\n\nI feel like—I don’t know, almost like there’s a blanket over me, smothering me, that I can’t get out from under and that it’s just, you’re trapped, I guess is the best way to describe it.\n\nThyroid issues are among the conditions linked to PFAS.\n\nLisa Martin is another one of the study participants with a thyroid issue.\n\nShe spent 20 years working at Mohawk as an inventory manager.\n\nI was very healthy, active, perfect bill of health. And within just half a dozen years of working in the carpet industry, my health started to decline. We couldn’t figure out why. I ended up having autoimmune disease, had to have my thyroid removed.\n\nDid you work closely with people who were applying these PFAS chemicals to carpet? Did they have any sense of the risks that they faced?\n\nThey did not. They didn’t have a clue. The first plant that I worked at was in Dalton, and we had a dye house up there. My first shock came when we would walk for exercise around this facility, which is a huge facility. But as we would walk out back in the waterways, you could see what color they had been dyeing that day. It was just accepted. It was just the culture. So I became complacent about what I was seeing and I just—I didn’t say anything, which is—it’s my fault.\n\nNo. I was familiar with Scotchgard, that we used it. I knew that we used it. I knew that we used stain resistance on our products, but I did not understand the PFAS element to the degree that I do now.\n\nMohawk said in its statement that they weren’t aware of any instance where PFAS was directly discharged into the environment and that it has always complied with wastewater regulations.\n\nExperience a whole new era in style and beauty for your home. Stainmaster carpet: always stylish, always beautiful.\n\nAccording to Shaw and Mohawk, they received assurances from the chemical companies that these alternative products didn’t contain the types of PFAS that accumulate in the body and were not as persistent in the environment.\n\nBut still, the carpet makers were worried about new PFAS research that was starting to emerge.\n\nI have an email between Werner Braun, the head of the Carpet and Rug Institute, that lobbying group for the carpet industry.\n\nIt says, quote, “The troubling issue for me in this report is a determination that this is carcinogenic in rats.”\n\nSo that’s showing that as early as in 2002, the carpet industry knew of an animal study that was showing carcinogenic nature of these chemicals.\n\nAround 2003, DuPont disclosed that trace amounts of the chemical that caused cancer in rats was in fact in their Stainmaster carpet protector. But DuPont insisted it was an unintentional byproduct and still safe.\n\nThe carpet companies would continue to use Stainmaster for another five years before dropping the chemical in it, too, as part of another EPA-negotiated phase out.\n\nThe Carpet and Rug Institute and its former head, Werner Braun, declined to be interviewed.\n\nIn a statement, the group said it evaluates its products to reflect “science, innovation and customer expectations,” and that the carpet industry’s conduct was, and continues to be, appropriate and lawful.\n\nIn their statements, Shaw and Mohawk again pointed the blame at the manufacturers for misleading them.\n\nAround that time, the EPA approached the carpet industry seeking to test their facilities for PFAS.\n\nThe EPA was starting this priority review, and in 2003, one of the things they wanted to do was focus on, “Let’s go get some samples from the water supply in these areas.” And one of the areas they had targeted was carpet manufacturing.\n\nThe carpet companies refused to allow the testing, citing confidentiality concerns, and told the EPA to ask the local water authority, Dalton Utilities, which also refused, saying there wasn’t an agreed-on, scientifically sound testing method.\n\nSTEVEN AMTER, Co-author, The Polluters:\n\nThe carpet industry completely declined to have their wastewater sampled. And I would also add that Dalton Utilities was asked if they would allow sampling from them as an alternative to the carpet companies allowing sampling, and to quote, Dalton Utilities didn’t just say no, they said, “Hell, no.”\n\nDalton Utilities is the agency responsible for providing drinking water to the people of Dalton, but it’s also responsible for treating the wastewater that comes from the mills in Dalton.\n\nDalton is a carpet company town, and the local utility there, some 80, 85% of the wastewater that takes in comes from the carpet industry. Historically, carpet industry executives and former executives have made up a part of its board.\n\nNo one from Dalton Utilities would agree to an interview. In a statement, it said its board was never influenced by carpet executives, and it didn’t know there was PFAS in the wastewater until 2009.\n\nThe utility is currently suing the carpet and chemical companies. In the suit, it said its wastewater treatment process cannot screen out PFAS chemicals. Dating back to the ’80s, it has run a system that filters some contaminants from the carpet companies wastewater and then sprays it out over thousands of acres it owns on the outskirts of Dalton.\n\nThe thing that was a lightbulb moment for me was the land application. That’s a big concentration of PFAS for a long time, and every time it rains it just flows off that site into the environment.\n\nYeah, so this is the LAS, the land application system. The boundaries are in black here. And then the Conasauga River, you can kind of see moves its way down along the western boundary of the LAS.\n\nOne expert in a lawsuit against carpet and chemical companies said that the land application system will be a perpetual source of contamination for a hundred years, at least.\n\nThe LAS is at the center of several lawsuits. So the utility, through a lawyer, told us that we would be able to take a tour like normal that they offer, but we wouldn’t be able to ask any questions on the record. Going there for the first time was a bit surreal.\n\nEverywhere you look, you can see some form of transportation of water from the waste treatment facilities, eventually into the sprinkler heads that spray the forest with the treated wastewater, and they rely on the land and the soil to absorb that water and remove many of the remaining contaminants that might still be in the wastewater.\n\nThe problem is that PFAS are chemicals that do not break down in the environment. They don’t biodegrade for decades, and you could look at a tree, you could look at soil, any of the spray heads, and fully expect that if you were to test that for PFAS, it would be there, and it would be there in high quantities.\n\nIn the course of our investigation of Dalton Utility’s role in PFAS contamination, I was told I should talk to Scott Gordon. Gordon was involved in inspecting issues with Dalton Utilities’ land application system as far back as 2000.\n\nSCOTT GORDON, Fmr. inspector, EPA enforcement division:\n\nWhen you got out on site, each one of those risers—pipes—with the sprinkler heads on top looked like it had a wig on top, there were so many carpet fibers on the spray itself. And then when as you’re walking around those areas, it felt like you were walking on shag carpet.\n\nYeah. There was that much carpet fibers in the material they were spraying. And all of those pipes going up, and the sprinkler heads, weren’t stabilized at all. Any limb that came along and knocked them over, a deer running through the pasture knocks them over. So when we got on site, we saw lots of just flowing wastewater going down the sides of the hills into the creeks and eventually into the river.\n\nThey were putting this wastewater onto land that was draining directly into the river, which people used for drinking water?\n\nCorrect. And this is a very, fairly large utility, so they were discharging between 20 and 25 million gallons a day to this land application system.\n\nDalton’s filtering system has been cited in lawsuits as one of the main sources of PFAS contamination in the region.\n\nThe utility has said it is looking for new technology that can treat or remove PFAS.\n\nBut the forever chemicals have spread far down the regional riverways, where in Alabama, places like Gadsden have been impacted.\n\nGadsden is about a hundred miles west of Dalton, of the carpet capital, and they get their drinking water from the Coosa River.\n\nEarly 2016, state officials sent out a memo saying, “We are concerned about the PFAS levels in eight water systems.” And Gadsden was one. And so that really set alarm bells off in Gadsden, where they said, “What is this? Where’s this coming from?” And so they were kind of able to conclude that the PFAS was coming from the carpet companies.\n\nWithin a few months, Gadsden decides to sue the chemical manufacturers, as well as the carpet companies.\n\nIt was the first time a carpet maker had been sued over its role in PFAS contamination.\n\nWhat we learned in our reporting is the lawsuit was sort of what they felt like was the only avenue to get any kind of funds or recourse to address the PFAS problem.\n\nI’m good, how are you? Don’t get up.\n\nFred Zackery, he’s a native of Gadsden. He lived away for many years, but he returned to Gadsden and he started doing a radio show called “Introspection.”\n\nWell, good afternoon, my friends, and welcome again to “Introspection.” We’re coming to you live from the village of Gadsden on the banks of the Poison Coosa. And we’re going to be talking about poison water. There is no mistaking—\n\nAbout 10 years ago, when PFAS started to become an issue in Gadsden, he really rededicated his radio show to water quality.\n\nThe contaminants were not flowing from the county. They came downriver from Dalton, Georgia, and those carpet plants upriver.\n\nI think part of Fred Zackery’s frustration is city government has not moved quickly enough, has not met the moment well enough and has just left the people of Gadsden to deal with this contamination issue.\n\nWe’re in need of leadership in this community, and you can’t keep talking about the, “Oh, well, they won’t let you.” Nobody ever let me do anything. Do it because you see it needs to be done.\n\nSince the lawsuit in 2016, six other drinking water systems in Alabama have sued the carpet and chemical companies, alleging PFAS has contaminated their water supply.\n\nGadsden’s suit ended in 2022 with a confidential settlement.\n\nThe city has been trying to reduce the PFAS in the water, including using a carbon filtering system. It recently broke ground on a new high-tech treatment plant that is set to open in 2027.\n\nIt’s sad that it’s taken so long for this to materialize. We shouldn’t have had to wait on a settlement to do this. Bond issues, a whole lot of ways you could have done this. So I want to give great credit where it’s due, but we are still being poisoned while this is being built, and nobody’s talking about establishing a medical facility where we can do testing of citizens to see what level of PFAS, if any, that they have in their system. It’s just not proactive so far as the citizens are concerned.\n\nIn 2025, on average, Gadsden’s water contained more than twice the EPA’s recommended level of the two key PFAS compounds that had historically been used by the carpet industry.\n\nNone of Gadsden’s elected officials would be interviewed about the PFAS situation and the frustration people like Fred Zackery have with how the city has responded.\n\nThe head of Gadsden’s water authority, Chad Hare, said they are doing all they can to address residents’ concerns.\n\nDo you hear from residents that are still frustrated with the level of PFAS in the water, even with the carbon filters?\n\nCHAD HARE, Gadsden Water Board:\n\nAs we get phone calls, we answer the questions the best that we can, and we provide every bit of the information that we have. As far as all of our sampling, all of our monitoring is provided to the public on the website.\n\nOur responsibility is to meet all state and federal regulations. We’re water treatment professionals, and so we take that very seriously.\n\nSo the state requires some water systems to test for PFAS. However, because the EPA has not made their guidelines enforceable, there are not really any limits in Alabama. So even if their drinking water tests above these guidelines established by the EPA, they are still not in violation of Alabama’s water quality rules because the EPA has not said those guidelines are enforceable.\n\nIn 2024, after decades of studying the issue, the EPA finally issued drinking water regulations for some of the PFAS compounds they’d flagged over the years, though they don’t take effect until 2031.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said it is committed to combatting PFAS contamination. It noted that during the first Trump administration it issued a nationwide PFAS action plan and said it is now working to help public water systems around the country.\n\nIt also said it intends to rescind and reevaluate restrictions put on some PFAS compounds under the Biden administration and implement a PFAS testing strategy that doesn’t create an undue burden for industry, and protects human health and the environment.\n\nBETSY SOUTHERLAND, EPA, 1984-2017:\n\nEPA can only act as quickly as the law allows them to, and so again—\n\nBetsy Southerland is the former director of the EPA’s water protection division and spent more than 30 years at the agency. She has become a vocal critic.\n\nIf the agency knew that there was a concern with toxicity in 2000, can you just help explain to people who have this in their bodies or are drinking it in their water why the agency takes so long?\n\nAt the time, the Toxic Substances Control Act that we were working under at EPA was very weak. All the onus was on EPA to prove that there was an existing chemical causing a problem before they could take action. So we were really hamstrung at the time. That current law did not allow EPA to do bans or restrictions of chemicals unless there was enormous evidence.\n\nSome people we’ve talked to have said that this was a failure of accountability at every level, from the local utility to the state to EPA. Do you agree with that?\n\nSo I do agree with that because in this particular case, there were ways we could have been more aggressive at EPA, and again, but because of the limitations of that Toxic Substances Control law, we could have been more aggressive in offering technical assistance to get the states to do things.\n\nEven today, she says, when there are concerns a chemical might be unsafe, the agency has to go through a seven-year process before it can actually impose a ban or restrictions.\n\nAnd meantime, the industry can continue using these chemicals?\n\nWhat it means for public health is that, again, we’re left to our own devices. We can buy a filter for our drinking water, we can get an HVAC for our house, but we’re not going to get helped by the federal government at all. So unless your state is one of those states that’s out there actively working on it, you’re just going to continue to be exposed in what you eat, drink and breathe.\n\nSTEVEN AMTER, Environmental scientist:\n\nSome of them didn’t bioaccumulate in animals as much. Some of them had early data showing less toxicity. But in all cases, when they were making these moves, they didn’t have a great deal of actual data to back it up. So this was done somewhat with a hope and a prayer.\n\nThe carpet industry eventually stopped using products with the short-chain PFAS in 2019, amid a growing body of research raising questions about their toxicity.\n\nThe carpet industry says regulators from Dalton Utilities all the way up to the EPA never restricted their use of these chemicals. What do you say to that?\n\nI think that’s true. The regulatory system can be very slow to respond, especially when it doesn’t have information. And basically the regulatory system did not have any really usable information on PFAS chemicals until 2000.\n\nIs it fair to expect private industry to act before the government regulators do?\n\nAbsolutely, because government regulations are not designed to prevent every harm, especially ones it doesn’t know about. They’re designed to facilitate stopping known harms or putting in place a system where industry can make that call. That’s the basis for so much environmental regulation, that there’s industry responsibility.\n\nI would say that the failure really began with a lukewarm federal response and cascaded down from there. We never had a very robust federal response into the use of these chemicals, how they were allowed to move in the environment, how they were able to be sold in terms of commerce. And as a result, that was a message. That was signaling to states, “This isn’t a big deal yet.” That’s signaling to local communities, “This isn’t a big deal.”\n\nAnd how do you think Georgia is doing in regulating these chemicals?\n\nI think Georgia, like most states, is terribly behind. While I understand being reluctant to get too far out ahead of EPA and federal regulations, I think that there was certainly enough information to begin addressing this if lawmakers and leadership within the state of Georgia wanted to address this problem.\n\nToday, the state is grappling with another concern: how the ongoing lawsuits might impact some of its largest employers.\n\nREP. KASEY CARPENTER, (R) Georgia House of Representatives:\n\nWe are now in the posture that we’re all going to be suing each other, and when that happens, nobody wins.\n\nState legislator Kasey Carpenter, who represents Dalton, has been trying to get support for a bill that would limit lawsuits against the carpet industry.\n\nThis legislation is no laughing matter. It’s about protecting 50,000 jobs in northwest Georgia and hundreds of thousands across the state.\n\nCritics say it would actually harm residents already coping with the area’s PFAS contamination.\n\nThe bill you introduced that would have shielded carpet companies and other PFAS receivers who caused PFAS pollution from legal liability, why did you bring that bill forward?\n\nBecause I think that it’s important to focus litigation on the people that are at fault. I tell people all the time, when we found out asbestos caused cancer, nobody sued the home builder that put it in your house. You went straight to the asbestos manufacturers. And that’s, I see PFAS as being the next asbestos for the United States. It’s important to focus that litigation on the chemical manufacturers, who knew it was not safe and who misled everybody who used it.\n\nThese lawsuits in particular are a lifeline for a lot of your constituents who are worried about their health. Why did you propose a bill that in some ways would make it harder to get answers?\n\nI don’t think so. I think that it just basically said, let’s focus on the chemical companies.\n\nDR. KATHERINE NAYMICK, Family physician:\n\nOK. I just wanted to start to check all of my patients’ levels, and follow everybody.\n\nWe think it’s affecting your liver. You were found to have moderate fatty liver disease. Now, the good thing is that before we checked these, I already had you on a program of changing your diet, decreasing the amount of meat.\n\nCertainly not taking any more fast foods and filtering your water.\n\nThere was a new study and it does talk about fatty liver disease and this relationship to what it’s doing to cause hepatic cancer. I’m going to watch your liver enzymes really closely, and at the first indication that they go up—hopefully they won’t, with everything that we’re trying to do to prevent it. We just want to keep an eye on everything.\n\nI would like to see if we can, because I just know that it’s so new, we’re all just kind of like, what can we do, and can we figure out a solution to mitigate the damage that’s been done?\n\nEvery single part of the regulatory framework that should have addressed this compound essentially left somebody else to handle it. In the end, no one has. We’re left with drastic contamination in this region, and these aren’t the only communities that are facing this problem.\n\nI tell everybody that asks me about this, we’re in an ultramarathon. This is not a sprint. This is going to require immense amount of resources, research and development, and direct leadership at every level to address the extent of this contamination.",

    "description": "On the earnings call, analysts pushed CEO Andy Jassy for assurances on future returns from this capex boom.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Thursday it plans a staggering $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, sparking concern that the AI spending boom has entered an even more bubbly stage.\n\nThe company's capex forecast was more than $50 billion above Wall Street expectations. That left some analysts uneasy about whether these huge investments will pay off.\n\n\"The strong long-term return on investing capital — I think that's the debate in the market today,\" Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at Evercore ISI, said during a conference call with Amazon executives following the results. \"So could you give us a little bit more insight into how you think investors will be able to see that?\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said new AI capacity is being monetized as quickly as it is deployed, calling it \"a very unusual opportunity,\" and argued that AI adoption is accelerating customers' shift to the cloud. He added that AWS' experience forecasting demand helps limit wasted capacity.\n\n\"This isn't some sort of quixotic top-line grab,\" Jassy said during the call. \"We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital.\"\n\nJassy's comments did little to calm investors. Amazon shares fell more than 10% in extended trading after the company detailed its outsized spending plans. A profit forecast also missed Wall Street expectations, adding to ROI concerns.\n\nBig Tech's AI infrastructure buildout has entered a new, breathtaking phase in recent days. On Wednesday, Google said it expects capex of $175 billion to $185 billion in 2026, well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Meta and Microsoft also raised capex.\n\nDuring Thursday's Amazon earnings call, other analysts pressed for assurances around returns on investment. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth asked Jassy whether the company had \"financial guardrails\" in place for the spending plan.\n\nJassy said AI represents an \"extraordinarily unusual opportunity\" that could reshape the scale of AWS and Amazon. He said the company's in-house chips, Trainium and Graviton, are on track to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year and added that its partnership with Anthropic has gone \"very well.\"\n\n\"We see this as an unusual opportunity, and we are going to invest aggressively here to be the leaders like we've been the last number of years,\" Jassy said.\n\nJassy described the AI market as \"barbelled,\" with heavy spending by leading AI labs on one end and productivity-focused enterprise uses on the other.\n\nHe said the middle — enterprise production workloads and new AI-native businesses — remains early but could become \"the largest and the most durable\" source of demand as costs fall and adoption broadens.\n\n\"The lion's share of that demand is still yet to come in the middle of that barbell, and that will come over time,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Global markets slid hard on Friday as losses spread across tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals, reinforcing fears that investors have moved into a \"sell everything\" mindset.\n\nMuch of the pressure is coming from tech, as doubts grow over whether the AI boom that powered recent gains can live up to expectations.\n\n\"A session of pure carnage overnight as the rotational flows noted in yesterday's note — out of tech and into cyclical morphed into a 'sell everything' mentality across stocks, crypto and commodities,\" Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia, wrote on Friday.\n\nIn Asia, South Korea's tech-heavy Kospi plunged and briefly triggered a trading halt after the index dropped 5%.\n\nHeavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were among the hardest hit, dragging the market lower as investors rushed to cut exposure to technology stocks.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell as much as 2.1% as China's major tech names moved lower, reflecting weaker risk appetite and ongoing pressure on the sector.\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 also declined, tracking the global selloff, while Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses ahead of a general election this week.\n\nCryptocurrencies fell alongside equities, extending a week of heavy losses as investors continued to reduce risk.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $64,500 after falling about 10% over 24 hours.\n\nThe selling also swept through commodities, with silver remaining under intense pressure following last week's violent breakdown.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $71.20 per troy ounce. It had hit a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\n\"Silver's attempt to stabilise after last week's historic rout has so far proven short‑lived,\" Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a Thursday note, pointing to renewed selling and technical resistance that triggered reversals.\n\nHansen also pointed to fresh selling from China, including disruption around China's only pure-silver fund after it traded far above its underlying value and was later suspended, leaving investors locked in as it repeatedly hit limit-down moves.\n\nHe added that near-term price action in silver is likely to be driven more by market mechanics and positioning than by macroeconomic headlines, given the extreme volatility still coursing through the market.\n\nThe latest moves underscore how quickly sentiment has shifted across asset classes.\n\n\"Investors are questioning their commitment to the pillars that have underpinned markets over the past six months: AI, crypto, and precious metals.

    "title": "Hollywood superagent and investor Michael Ovitz praised Jeffrey Epstein and was invited to his island, files reveal",
    "description": "Michael Ovitz, cofounder of CAA and a tech investor, praised Jeffrey Epstein's \"outstanding multiple talents\" in one email to the disgraced financier.",
    "fullText": "Michael Ovitz, the cofounder of powerhouse Los Angeles talent agency Creative Artists Agency and a prolific tech investor, effusively praised Jeffrey Epstein and made arrangements to meet him at his New York home and off the coast of St. Barts, newly released files reveal.\n\nThe disgraced financier invited Ovitz to his private Caribbean island in 2012 and said he knew Ovitz \"well\" in emails to a Microsoft executive and his publicist, Peggy Siegal. In 2013, Ovitz emailed Epstein, lauding his \"outstanding multiple talents,\" with Epstein emailing Ovitz, \"great to see you smiling again,\" later that year.\n\nA spokesperson for Ovitz denied that he was on anything more than cordial terms with Epstein.\n\n\"Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did not know each other well, no matter what Mr. Epstein said to Peggy Siegal. They had very limited interaction and correspondence,\" a spokesperson for Ovitz told Business Insider. \"When Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did correspond, Mr. Ovitz was cordial.\"\n\nOvitz co-founded CAA in 1975, where he represented stars like Tom Cruise and Robert De Niro, leaving the firm in 1995 for a stint as president of Disney. The superagent later built deep links to Silicon Valley: he has invested in hundreds of startups, and has served as an advisor to the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nOvitz is also a senior advisor to Palantir and has recently invested in AI startups, including the Google-backed AI studio Promise and the image generator Black Forest Labs, where he serves as an advisor.\n\nDocuments released last week by the Justice Department from its investigation into Epstein provide a deeper look at his ties to Ovitz. It's not the first time Ovitz's name comes up in relation to Epstein: in 2023, Ovitz was subpoenaed by the US Virgin Islands as part of its lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase for banking with Epstein. That lawsuit has since been settled.\n\nThe new material shows communication between Ovitz and Epstein in the early and mid-2010s — after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor, but before his 2019 arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges — which ended with his death by suicide in a jail cell.\n\nIn a 2010 email exchange, Ovitz wrote to Epstein, \"hope you are well\" and \"been a while\" after a dinner with Jes Staley, the former Barclays CEO who later came under close scrutiny for his Epstein dealings.\n\n\"Had dinner with Jes last night and your ears should still be burning,\" Ovitz wrote, adding that he and Epstein should get together.\n\nJPMorgan Chase declined to comment to Business Insider for this article.\n\nIn February 2012, Epstein planned to see Ovitz at an undisclosed location, according to a Google Calendar reminder. A few months later, in April, Ovitz emailed Epstein that he would drop by the financier's Manhattan home for a drink, writing, \"would love to see you.\"\n\nIn December 2012, after learning that Ovitz was wintering in St. Barts in the Caribbean, Epstein invited him to his private island, Little Saint James, writing, \"will you be near my island, come visit.\"\n\nOvitz declined, saying his boat was stuck in St. Barts after he dropped a rudder. He told Epstein his boat was located about 500 yards from the yacht Al Mirqab, owned by former Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani — which Epstein said he was visiting at the time — and suggested Epstein could stop by. The potential meetup didn't take place, Ovitz's spokesperson told Business Insider after publication.\n\nIn a January 2013 email, Ovitz wrote to Epstein that he and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, had been \"raving about you and your outstanding multiple talents.\" Sinofsky had been relying on Epstein to negotiate his Microsoft exit at the time.\n\nSinofsky later asked Epstein in an email if he knew Ovitz, whom he had just met at Andreessen Horowitz, and Epstein replied, \"very very well.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Epstein emailed Ovitz again, writing, \"great to see you smiling again.\"\n\nIn 2014, Andrew Farkas, a real estate magnate who co-owned a marina with Epstein in St. Thomas, also asked Epstein for an introduction to Ovitz to discuss naming a new performing arts degree at Harvard University.\n\nEpstein's most recent reference to Ovitz in the files is from 2017, when Epstein emailed his publicist Siegal that he knew Ovitz \"WELL.\"\n\nThe Epstein files are full of recognizable names who had correspondence with him, and some of the content is anodyne. The latest documents have caused headaches for some of the movers and shakers whose names appear on them.\n\nOn Wednesday night, powerhouse lawyer Brad Karp stepped down from the chairmanship of his firm, Paul Weiss, saying his ties to Epstein had become a \"distraction\" for it. Prominent longevity influencer Peter Attia publicly apologized for his crude email exchanges with Epstein and stepped down as chief science officer for a protein bar company.\n\nOvitz's CAA has become one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies. The firm rose to prominence by driving ever-higher actor paydays by demanding larger box-office cuts for stars like Brad Pitt.\n\nCAA served as an inspiration for Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz when they built Andreessen Horowitz, which prides itself on being founder-friendly.\n\n\"An important part of A16z's origin story, which you may already know, is that we were founded by Marc & Ben to be 'CAA for the tech industry,'\" reads the firm's website.\n\nBesides his involvement with A16z, Ovitz also chairs the VC firm Treville Capital Group and announced last year that he was launching his own startup, SoundPatrol, that uses AI to fight copyright infringement in music.",

    "description": "The rivaling AI companies pushed GPT-5.3-Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, and had back-to-back appearances on a tech and business podcast.",
    "fullText": "The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic intensified this week.\n\nThe two companies released dueling new AI models on Thursday and had back-to-back podcast appearances on \"TBPN.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model that the company says would improve performance on office productivity and coding tasks, with an expanded \"context window\" that allows it to work through longer documents and more complex projects in a single session.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI punched back with its own new coding-focused model called GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company says runs faster, uses fewer computing resources, and can generate and manage complex software from English instructions. The new version also comes alongside a stand-alone Codex desktop app.\n\nBoth Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and Sholto Douglas, one of Anthropic's leading researchers, appeared on the \"TBPN\" podcast in back-to-back chats with show host John Coogan and Jordi Hays.\n\n\"I think we will be heading towards a workflow where a lot of people just feel like they're managing a team of agents,\" said Altman. \"And as the agents get better, they'll keep operating at a higher and higher level of abstraction.\"\n\nDouglas, who appeared in the subsequent timeslot, told Coogan and Hays that users have been comparing previous Anthropic and OpenAI models, and they have noticed some key differences.\n\n\"The OpenAI models were a bit better at trying really, really, really hard on tough problems, but the Anthropic models were much faster and so forth,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"And so they worked on speed while we worked on making the models much, much better at really, really tough problems,\" Douglas added of the Opus 4.6.\n\nThe latest release is part of a long-running competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, dating back to 2021, when a group of OpenAI researchers left to form Anthropic, aiming to develop safer and more controlled AI systems.\n\nThis week, Anthropic's launch of industry-specific plugins triggered a stock market sell-off as Wall Street worried about AI's impact on software.\n\nAnthropic also took a subtle shot at OpenAI with a series of ads released this week, including one that will air during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe ads feature unnamed humanized AIs dropping ads in the middle of their advice, alongside the promise that its model, Claude, will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI announced in January that ads are coming to ChatGPT for users of the free version.\n\nAltman subsequently hit back, calling Anthropic \"dishonest\" and defending ChatGPT as a product that brings AI \"to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.\" He also clarified that the ads will be \"clearly labeled\" to differentiate themselves from the chatbot's answers to queries.\n\n\"We are not stupid. We respect our users. We understand that if we did something like what those ads depict, people would rightfully stop using the product,\" Altman told the \"TBPN\" podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"Our first principle with ads is that we're not going to put stuff into the LLM stream,\" Altman added. \"That would feel crazy dystopic, like a bad sci-fi movie.\"",

I'm speaking for the Guthrie family. Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you. We haven't heard anything directly. We need you to reach out, and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward,\" Camron said.\n\nHe then reiterated the family's request for proof that their mother is in the captor's custody.\n\n\"But first, we have to know that you have our mom. We want to talk to you, and we are waiting for contact,\" Camron said.\n\nA post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)\n\nGuthrie's mother, Nancy Guthrie, has been missing since Sunday. She was last seen at her home in Tucson, Arizona. Officials told NBC Nightly News on Monday that they believe she was \"taken out of her home against her will.\"\n\nThe video comes a day after Savannah, Camron, and their sister, Annie, issued a joint plea for their mother's safe return.\n\n\"Everyone is looking for you, Mommy, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again,\" Savannah said in Wednesday's video. \"We speak to you every moment. And we pray without ceasing, and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you, Mommy.\"\n\nIn a statement uploaded to the sheriff department's X account on Wednesday, Nanos said investigators \"have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case,\" and cautioned the public against \"the sharing of unverified accusations or false information.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the sheriff's department released a timeline with new details, noting that Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera was disconnected and later detected a person, though no video was available. Sheriff Chris Nanos also confirmed that the blood found on the porch belonged to her.",

    "description": "Microsoft AI CEO says vibe coding is lowering the barrier to building apps, raising questions about how defensible software will be.",
    "fullText": "Mustafa Suleyman says vibe coding is rapidly lowering the barrier to building apps, a shift that could put traditional software at risk.\n\nThe Microsoft AI CEO said in an episode of the \"Exponential View\" podcast published Thursday that AI tools now make it possible for anyone to quickly start launching code and apps.\n\n\"It is so accessible now,\" said Suleyman. \"You can watch a three-minute video, get spun up, launch one of these things.\"\n\n\"You can create an app, a web app in seconds,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman said people don't need deep technical skills to get started. Instead, they can learn by experimenting, watching, and doing.\n\nThe AI can \"build something that you may have thought was never possible,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless you push these things to their edges and explore the boundaries, you won't really understand the magic, or what they're kind of bad at.\"\n\n\"Everyone's got to get stuck into that motion,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman also said he has vibe-coded a system that tracks the DJs he wants to see, coming concerts and festivals, and then matches those events with his travel schedule. What used to be manual work now runs automatically in a spreadsheet that updates throughout the year.\n\nSuleyman's comments come as investors grow increasingly anxious that AI tools and agents could wipe out entire categories of software.\n\nThat fear flared this week after Anthropic said it was adding legal-focused capabilities to its Cowork assistant. The tools would allow AI to review legal documents and track compliance — work typically done by legal software.\n\nMarkets didn't take it lightly. Shares of legal-software companies in Europe and the US fell sharply on Tuesday, before the selling spread across the wider software sector and into tech.\n\nOpenAI triggered a similar sell-off months earlier after rolling out internal AI-powered software-as-a-service tools.\n\nMany of the tools now unsettling the tech sector were built using AI coding tools.\n\nAI personal assistant OpenClaw was created with the help of AI, while Moltbook — a viral, Reddit-style forum for AI agents — was entirely vibe-coded.\n\nAnthropic also said last month that it built its Cowork assistant using Claude.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Anthropic's product manager, Felix Rieseberg, wrote on X. During a livestream, Rieseberg said his team put Cowork together in just over a week, thanks to Claude.\n\nTech leaders and developers have also said that such a turnaround is becoming the norm.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the developer behind OpenClaw, said in an episode of \"Behind the Craft\" podcast published last week that AI now lets developers \"build everything.\"\n\nOpenAI's chair, Bret Taylor, said in an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published last week that building software quickly through vibe coding will soon feel routine rather than novel.\n\nBut the real question, Taylor said, is what software still matters.\n\nInstead of dashboards, browser forms, and traditional apps, he expects AI agents to become the dominant software interface.\n\n\"Who's making those agents is the question,\" he said. \"Will you buy those agents off the shelf or build them yourself?\"",

    "description": "The firm said it recently tested the software with Singapore's air force, where a chopper crew used an ISR drone to find a target in the rainforest.",
    "fullText": "Airbus is trialing new software that allows helicopter crews to control a team of drones while the chopper flies at high speeds.\n\nThe company recently tested the technology, called HTeaming, in trials with an H225M helicopter operated by Singapore's air force and defense science and technology agency, said Victor Gerin-Roze, head of UAS business in the Airbus helicopters division.\n\n\"We were completely controlling the drone from the helicopter. For us, it's of course unique. Today, what we performed is a world first,\" Gerin-Roze told reporters on Thursday at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nThe software is part of Airbus' contribution to the surging industry for drone wingmen, which the world's biggest aircraft manufacturers are betting will be the future of air warfare.\n\nThe latest HTeaming trials were held in January and involved a simulated mission, tasking a Singaporean H225M crew with finding and rescuing a stranded pilot in the rainforest.\n\nAirbus said it first deployed one of its uncrewed aerial systems, the 7-foot-long surveillance drone Flexrotor, to locate and identify the pilot.\n\nThe drone, which can fly at speeds of up to 85 miles per hour, then fed real-time data to a handheld tablet on board the H225M helicopter. The crew used that information to find and rendezvous with their rescuee, Airbus said.\n\nGerin-Roze said the Flexrotor and H225M were flying several kilometers apart during the mission, but they can remain connected at distances up to 20 kilometers, or roughly 12.4 miles.\n\n\"One of the big challenges was to keep the data link stable,\" Gerin-Roze said.\n\nAirbus used a modem and four antennae to keep the helicopter and drone connected during the mission, as both aircraft were \"flying in different directions with different altitudes,\" Gerin-Roze added.\n\nThe HTeaming software, announced in June 2025 at the Paris Airshow, is still in early development. Airbus said it last tested the system with one of its lighter helicopters, the H-135, with the Spanish Navy in May of that year.\n\nThe French aviation giant hopes that HTeaming will eventually help create a system that lets its customers fly a mixed fleet of automated fighters, recon drones, and wingmen.\n\nAirbus is designing HTeaming to work with other firms' drones, allowing customers to mix its helicopters with third-party uncrewed aircraft.\n\nThe tablet, hefty but light enough to use on your lap, is designed to allow helicopter crews to receive drones' video feeds, issue commands to the vehicles, and control the trajectory of their payloads.\n\nThe company is experimenting with other drone payloads, such as for data communications.\n\nWhen asked if HTeaming has been developed to issue attack orders to drones that might carry weapons, Gerin-Roze said the company is exploring that option.\n\n\"To start the development, we do it without one, but as we said, stay tuned for this year,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Taiwanese airline Starlux is set to fly a new Airbus A350 variant that will expand its number of business-class seats by over 50%.\n\nThe seven-year-old startup is introducing 18 new A350-1000s to its fleet, with the first delivered in January.\n\nIts A350-1000 configuration offers 40 business-class seats, up from 26 on Starlux's current A350-900s.\n\nThe new aircraft adds 30 economy-class seats, bringing the total to 270 in coach. The rest of its A350-1000 offerings are unchanged from the A350-900, with 36 premium economy seats and four first-class suites.\n\nStarlux showcased its new plane at the Singapore Airshow this week, and Business Insider went aboard for a look.\n\nIt's known regionally for selling business-class tickets on short and medium-haul flights at roughly $1,500.\n\nSome of its longer routes, such as San Francisco to Taipei, can offer regular round-trip business-class fares as low as $2,600.\n\nSince launching flights in 2020, the Taiwanese airline has increasingly leaned on premium seat offerings, a trend among full-service carriers as market prices for economy seats have generally fallen.\n\nThe light under the passenger seat number changes from green to red when do-not-disturb mode is activated.\n\nCabin crew typically open and close the doors for passengers, but an emergency latch on the inside also allows the sliding panel to come loose.\n\nEssentially, that means the seat elevates the head and feet over the rear for better posture, so the passenger's body resembles a \"W.\"\n\nIf a passenger has two windows next to their seat, they can dim the second with a remote.\n\nThese seats have no overhead luggage compartments; instead, they feature a personal closet for each passenger. They're lined with leather, while business class seats are made of fabric.\n\nThere is no curtain or wall separating Starlux's business and first-class areas.\n\nIn-flight entertainment is available for every seat, with an extendable screen for those sitting in the front rows.\n\nChatting with a passenger across the aisle may prove more difficult on the A350-1000.\n\nThe new plane is also scheduled to begin flying Starlux's Phoenix route this summer. Starlux flies to 31 destinations, with five routes to the US.",

    "fullText": "Coach and Kate Spade designers have added AI to their design workflow.\n\nOn a Thursday earnings call, CEO Joanne Crevoiserat was asked how and where Tapestry is investing in AI.\n\nShe answered that Coach and Kate Spade's designers now use AI in their day-to-day work, but the design process starts with hand-drawn sketches.\n\n\"So there is still a human and a need for design eye, right,\" Crevoiserat said. \"They do a sketch. But what AI helps is they can iterate on that sketch.\"\n\n\"They can do color multipliers. They can make design tweaks, much faster than we could in the past,\" she added.\n\nShe said AI tools have sped up the supply chain and product development timelines, which then drive the company's growth.\n\nCoach and Kate Spade are both known for their affordable luxury handbags, popular with aspirational luxury shoppers.\n\nTapestry isn't the only fashion company that's invited AI into its design studios.\n\nA designer for the fashion label Alice + Olivia told The Wall Street Journal in January that she sees AI as a \"creativity explosion,\" and that the brand's recent collection featured tarot-card-inspired prints generated with AI tools like Leonardo AI and Adobe Firefly.\n\nAn IT and tech director for LVMH told the Journal in June that design teams in the French luxury giant are using AI to generate mood boards for inspiration.\n\nSmaller independent designers are also using AI in their processes. Business Insider reported in September that Jasline Ang, a silk designer in Singapore who worked at Goyard and Louis Vuitton, uses ChatGPT and Midjourney to create visuals for her social media campaigns. However, Ang said the tools have not been helpful in her artmaking itself.\n\nTapestry reported second-quarter revenue of $2.5 billion, a 14% increase from the same period last year. The company's stock rose more than 10% after the strong earnings. It's up 95% in the past year.\n\nCoach's sales contributed heavily to the company's success in the last quarter, rising about 25% year over year. Crevoiserat said this was driven by Coach's Tabby handbag collection, which is popular with Gen Z customers, Tapestry's target audience.\n\nHowever, Kate Spade reported a 14% drop in revenue in the last quarter compared to last year, to $360 million. Crevoiserat said this was because there had been a deliberate attempt to reduce Kate Spade's promotional activity.",

    "description": "As digital nomads flock to Da Nang, Vietnam, questions arise about rising rents, local impact, and the city's evolving status as a remote work hub.",
    "fullText": "\"In this video I will show you why I think Da Nang, Vietnam, is clearly the best city for digital nomads,\" Joose the Nomad says, his baby-blue eyes sparkling as he addresses his 80,000 YouTube subscribers.\n\nThe video cuts to a sweeping aerial of Da Nang's skyscraper-studded coastline before lingering in slow motion on Joose running shirtless on the beach.\n\n\"He shows the beach, the fitness studio, and some boring Westerner-focused food that doesn't really represent the city,\" Ngô Xuân Thảo tells me over a bubbling hotpot after I show her the video.\n\nNgô, 38, is from Hue, 62 miles northeast of Da Nang. She works online as a translator and speaks near-perfect English. Her experience of this city, she tells me, is vastly different than his: It's a city with rapidly rising rents and a cost of living that's outpacing wages.\n\nThe gap between Joose's sun-soaked version of Da Nang and Ngô's experience as a local trying to make rent captures a tension playing out across the city — one that raises a broader question about who benefits as Da Nang becomes a magnet for digital nomads.\n\nDa Nang — described by The New York Times as \"the Miami of Vietnam\" in its \"52 Places to Go in 2019\" list — has become the digital nomad community's latest outpost in Southeast Asia. Vietnam was included again in the Times' 2026 list, as international attention grows alongside high-end developments, including Southeast Asia's first Nobu Hotel scheduled to open later this year.\n\nI went to see whether the city is on its way to becoming the next Chiang Mai, Thailand or Bali, Indonesia, places where digital nomads have settled en masse, driving up living costs, contributing to congestion, and accelerating gentrification — trends I've watched firsthand during more than a decade of living in Hanoi, Vietnam, as a travel writer.\n\nVietnam has not introduced a long-stay visa to lure digital nomads like Thailand, but that hardly seems to matter.\n\nNomads.com, an online digital nomad community of nearly 40,000 people, listed Da Nang as Southeast Asia's fastest-growing digital nomad hot spot in 2025. Most nationalities can apply online for three-month e-visas without trouble.\n\nAuthorities seem eager to ride the wave: Nomad Fest in March 2025 actively courted digital nomads, and state-sanctioned local media regularly spotlight the city's growing popularity with remote workers.\n\nBut who exactly is the wave lifting?\n\nNgô moved here in early 2025, drawn by the city's work-life balance, a rare promise in urbanizing Vietnam. Big cities like Hồ Chí Minh City brim with opportunity but face mounting urban and environmental strain. Small cities like Hue remain largely unscathed by Vietnam's urban development, but they lack good jobs.\n\nNgô hoped that Da Nang struck the right balance — until she discovered the cost of living.\n\nBefore she started working online, Ngô says she received decent in-person job offers for international NGOs paying 12,000,000 Vietnam Dong, or $455, a month. The studio apartment she found cost her more than half of that. \"If I want a separate bedroom, then I have to pay at least 12,000,000. How can I afford that?\"\n\nNgô's landlord raised her rent after she spent a few months in the city center, prompting her to move 20 miles south to Hoi An, where she found rents to be 30% cheaper.\n\nFor many digital nomads earning international salaries, however, $455 a month in rent is a steal.\n\n\"Landlords rent out apartments short-term because they think they can keep raising the prices every few months,\" she says. \"The digital nomads are one reason. Landlords assume that foreigners will pay more.\"\n\nI drive a rented motorbike over Da Nang's iconic Dragon Bridge, the city's showpiece infrastructure project, and cruise along the 6-mile-long, palm-studded beachside boulevard.\n\nI'm heading to Hana's Coworking, a new workspace popular with digital nomads. After arriving, I edge past a beaming security guard and weave through the lower floors, thick with dust and the clatter of construction.\n\nUpstairs, the chaos gives way to calm. Where I meet Hana Nguyễn — the founder — the scene is an oasis of quiet productivity. Coders, marketers, and other nomads sit in ergonomic chairs, tapping at their keyboards and gazing out at the swaying trees on the street below. \"Now this room is full,\" Nguyễn tells me. \"That's why I'm expanding to the second floor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic, Nguyễn, 36, began spending time with digital nomads and opened a coworking room on an unused hotel floor. The idea took off, and soon she convinced her parents to convert their family home into an office for remote workers.\n\nTurns out, it wasn't a beaming security guard who greeted me at the entrance — it was Nguyễn's father.\n\nNguyễn, who moved to the neighborhood with her family in her teens, says digital nomads' presence in Da Nang is \"good for the city, the community, and jobs.\"\n\n\"Some foreigners even hire Vietnamese for online work — designers, translators, assistants.\" When I asked her if rising rent prices have become a problem, she dismissed it as a minor issue driven mainly by short-term tourism, and besides, she said, \"we just find different places to stay,\" referring to other Vietnamese residents.\n\nMarkos Korvesis, a career coach who organizes digital nomad events around the world, including Da Nang's annual Nomad Fest, said he has seen neighboring apartments turned into Airbnbs, with owners charging up to $100 a night.\n\n\"In a building I stayed in for many months, the prices were increasing because of tourists, not nomads,\" he tells me.\n\nAccording to data from analytics platform AirDNA, between March 2022, when Vietnam reopened its borders after the COVID-19 pandemic, and November 2025, the number of Airbnb and Vrbo listings in Da Nang increased by 43.8%. And while average nightly rates have fallen from their peak in 2023, they still sit 17.6% above 2022 levels.\n\nWithout an official digital nomad visa, the city government has no way to track which foreigners are working remotely, but it's safe to assume they make up only a small fraction of the millions of annual visitors.\n\nAccording to local media, Da Nang received close to 2 million international visitors in 2023 — and more than 7 million last year.\n\n\"Digital nomadism does definitely gentrify, that was very clear in Medellín, Portugal, everywhere,\" says Daniel Schlagwein, who researches digital work at Chulalongkorn University and the University of Sydney.\n\n\"But it gentrifies along the same trajectory as the broader visitor economy,\" he says.\n\nIn Chiang Mai, Schlagwein found that many locals actually preferred this kind of visitor.\n\n\"Digital nomads work during workdays in their coworking spaces just like locals, they stay longer, and they spend their money more widely in local restaurants and rentals,\" he said.\n\n\"They are not crowding temples every day like mass-package tourist groups or partying on a Tuesday night like backpackers.\"\n\nSipping a cappuccino, I take in the cosmopolitan café. A Vietnamese couple canoodles in the corner; Dutch tourists browse bags of coffee; and the approachable woman in front of me works quietly on her laptop. After we strike up a conversation, I learn she taught yoga online in Asia and Europe before arriving in Da Nang.\n\n\"I think Da Nang has the right mix of nomads, tourists, and locals,\" Tsering Yangzom, 37, told me. \"Here, people who live and work as foreigners seem more connected — like there's still a sense of balance.\"\n\nAside from the possible issue of rising rents, Da Nang does, for now at least, feel like a city in equilibrium.\n\nOther hot spots like Bali offer a template — or a warning — about how long that can last.\n\n\"At first I was really against the digital nomads, but now I see there are two kinds,\" says Gus Dark, a Balinese artist and cultural commentator known for his satirical illustrations.\n\n\"The first are people who come to work remotely but treat Bali like a screensaver — just a beautiful backdrop. They don't engage with the community. The second are those who connect with the culture and genuinely want to explore the island. Some of them seem to care about Bali even more than the Balinese.\"\n\nAs Da Nang's relationship with digital nomads is still being written, perhaps the outcome depends on who chooses to come.\n\nKnowing that Joose the Nomad now lives in Bali, I ask Gus Dark what kind of digital nomad this YouTuber might be. \"These kinds of influencers rarely appear on the local scene,\" he says with a laugh. \"So I don't really give them much attention.\"",

    "description": "Early reports indicate that Russian forces are encountering trouble organizing troops at the tactical level after the Starlink changes.",
    "fullText": "SpaceX moved to cut off Russian access to Starlink this week, disabling connectivity over Ukraine while maintaining a whitelist of approved Ukrainian terminals.\n\nThe new measure has spurred excitement among Ukrainian officials and pundits close to the war, who have said that Russian troops were increasingly using Starlink to guide long-range strikes and coordinate forces.\n\n\"The enemy reports a mass Starlink blackout among Russian units at the front,\" wrote Serhii Sternenko, the leader of a major Ukrainian crowdfunding organization for combat drones, on Thursday.\n\n\"If this is true, then the Ukrainian army will regain its advantage in communications, and the enemy will have a number of problems with controlling troops at the tactical level,\" he added.\n\nSerhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov, an advisor on drone warfare for Ukraine's defense ministry, wrote that the move had disrupted Russian ground assaults in some frontline areas.\n\n\"The enemy doesn't even have a problem on the fronts. The enemy has a catastrophe,\" he wrote on Telegram.\n\nDue to US sanctions after the Kremlin's full-scale invasion began in 2022, SpaceX doesn't sell Starlink terminals to Russia.\n\nBut Ukrainian troops have long raised concerns that Moscow's troops were acquiring terminals from the black market, with Kyiv saying it's found the US tech in downed reconnaissance drones.\n\nPressure for SpaceX to curb Russian access reached a fever pitch last month, as Ukrainian defense officials said they'd begun seeing Starlink terminals on long-range strike drones.\n\nCutting off the Kremlin's forces from Starlink, however, has been more complicated than simple geofencing. Ukrainian troops also use Starlink, so disabling access in contested regions would have affected Kyiv's operations.\n\nThat appears to be changing with the new whitelist. For the last few days, Ukraine's defense ministry and Telegram influencers have been calling on troops to quickly register their terminals under the country's DELTA battlespace management system.\n\nThe access restrictions are likely to extend to civilian areas far from the front lines, due to concerns of Starlink being used to guide the Russian Shahed-type attack drones targeting cities.\n\nBusinesses must apply for access via an online portal, while civilians were told to bring all their private Starlink terminals to administrative centers along with a national ID.\n\nThe whitelist is updated every day, said Ukraine's defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov.\n\n\"We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that were included in the whitelist is already working,\" he wrote on Thursday.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, urged Ukrainian users to join the whitelist.\n\n\"Important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine,\" he wrote on social media on Thursday.\n\nThe connectivity changes have also been reported to cut Starlink access for terminals traveling faster than 75 kilometers per hour, or roughly 46 miles per hour, in an effort to shut down attack-drone guidance.\n\nIt's not yet clear exactly how the new Starlink measures will affect the war, but early reports from Russia and Ukraine indicate the move is already affecting the battlefield.\n\nRybar, a prominent Telegram channel run by a Russian military blogger, wrote on Thursday that the Starlink restrictions would \"temporarily slow down\" Moscow's combat operations.\n\nThe channel, which had until this week been calling on its followers to donate or fund Starlink terminals for Russian troops, also wrote on February 1 that the Kremlin needed to start developing \"domestic equivalents\" of communication systems for the front lines.\n\nRybar downplayed the impact on Russian operations, saying that the Starlink whitelist could also play to the Kremlin's advantage.\n\n\"If the system is hacked, such a list would give Russian troops the geolocation of numerous Ukrainian Armed Forces positions,\" he wrote in a separate post.\n\nRoman Alekhin, another Russian military blogger, raised concerns on Thursday that Russian forces may not have ready alternatives to Starlink and might instead temporarily rely on fiber optics for frontline communications.\n\n\"This is all very bad, especially considering the huge need for communications at the front,\" he wrote.\n\nUkrainian Telegram channels, meanwhile, hailed the outage as a potential significant blow to Russian forces.\n\n\"The enemy even installed terminals on tanks to adjust fire online,\" Sternenko wrote. \"There will be no more. This is just the beginning.\"\n\nThe Wild Hornets, a Ukrainian drone maker, posted a photo it said showed the wreckage of a Russian Gerbera decoy drone that bore a vulgarity-laden message directed at Musk.\n\nStill, some Ukrainian forces also reported being affected by the outages.\n\n\"It was found out from our troops that there were problems with those who did not promptly submit lists for private Starlinks,\" wrote Beskrestnov, the Ukrainian drone advisor. \"The processing process is ongoing.\"\n\nFedorov, who was confirmed as Ukraine's new defense minister last month, thanked SpaceX and Musk for introducing the Starlink measures.\n\n'Thanks to the first steps taken in recent days, no Ukrainians have been killed by Russian drones using Starlink — and that is priceless,\" he wrote.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.",

    "description": "The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since Presiden...",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to office and sought to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nHigh-level military communication was suspended in late 2021, as tension between Moscow and Washington rose ahead of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump then campaigned for a second term on promises that he would swiftly end the fighting. Many of his proposals for peace have heavily favored the Kremlin, including requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.\n\nThe restored communication channel “will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,” the U.S. European Command said in a statement. The agreement emerged from a meeting between senior Russian and American military officials in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who is the commander in Europe of both U.S. and NATO forces, was in Abu Dhabi, where talks between American, Russian and Ukrainian officials on ending the war entered a second day.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow escalated its attacks on Ukraine’s power grid in an apparent effort to deny civilians power and to weaken public support for the fight, while hostilities continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.\n\nThe resumption of the military hotline marks an effort to ease tensions that soared after the start of the war and to avoid collisions between Russian and U.S. forces.\n\nIn one such incident in March 2023, the American military said it ditched an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Black Sea after a pair of Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on it, and then one of them struck its propeller while flying in international airspace.\n\nMoscow has denied that its warplanes hit the drone, alleging that it crashed while making a sharp maneuver. The Kremlin said its aircraft reacted to a violation of a no-fly zone Russia has established in the area near Crimea.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly voiced concern about intelligence flights by the U.S. and other NATO aircraft over the Black Sea, and some Russian officials charged that the American surveillance flights helped gather intelligence that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian targets.\n\nNATO members have been increasingly worried about intrusions into allied airspace. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO’s response.\n\nIn September, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland’s airspace, prompting NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since the full-scale invasion. Later that month, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia’s airspace.\n\nRussia, Ukraine exchange prisoners following talks\n\nThe delegations from Moscow and Kyiv were joined Thursday in Abu Dhabi by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council chief, who was present at the meeting.\n\nThey were also at last month's talks in the same place as the Trump administration tries to steer Russia and Ukraine toward a settlement.\n\nOfficials have provided no information about any progress in the discussions.\n\nFollowing the talks on Thursday, however, Russia and Ukraine said they carried out a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it brought 157 Russian servicemen back from Ukrainian captivity, as well as three Russian nationals captured during Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Ukrainian officials said 150 Ukrainian servicemen and seven civilians returned from Russian captivity.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the released Russian soldiers are currently in Belarus, getting medical assistance, before being taken back to Russia “for treatment and rehabilitation.”\n\nUkrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that among the 150 service members who returned from Russian captivity, 18 were \"illegally sentenced by Russia.” He said that “overall, those released are in a difficult psychological condition, and some are critically underweight.”\n\nZelenskyy says 55,000 Ukrainian troops killed in the war\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died since Russia’s invasion. “And there is a large number of people whom Ukraine considers missing,” he added in an interview broadcast late Wednesday by French TV channel France 2.\n\nThe last time Zelenskyy gave a figure for battlefield deaths, in early 2025, he said 46,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.\n\nZelenskyy has repeatedly said his country needs security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe to deter any postwar Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainians must feel that there is genuine progress toward peace and “not toward a scenario in which the Russians exploit everything to their advantage and continue their strikes,” Zelenskyy said on social media late Wednesday.\n\nLast year saw a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties compared with 2024, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nAlmost 15,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and just over 40,000 wounded since the start of the war through last December, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops have lost access to their Starlink satellite internet terminals on the front line, Ukrainian Economic Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Thursday, after Ukraine asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have consequently lost command-and-control capabilities and navigation for drones, and assaults have stopped in many sectors, according to Fedorov’s adviser Serhii Beskrestnov. Russian officials made no immediate comment.\n\nUkraine is registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.\n\nAlso, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said during a visit to Kyiv that he agreed with Zelenskyy to develop the joint production of ammunition at plants in their countries.\n\nZelenskyy said Poland plans to increase supplies to Ukraine of liquefied natural gas, and the countries are exploring an exchange of weaponry, with Kyiv possibly receiving Polish MiG fighter jets and Warsaw receiving Ukrainian drones.\n\nRussia fired 183 drones and two ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Three people were injured, officials said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight over several regions, the Azov Sea and Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nThis story corrects an earlier version that said Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2016. The annexation happened in 2014.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "The chaos is mostly a tech-stock phenomenon. The equal-weight S&P 500 is actually at a record high.",
    "fullText": "S&P 500 futures were flat-to-up this morning before the markets opened in New York, a sign that traders may be temporarily sated after the carnage they wreaked in the stock markets over the past few days. The index fell 0.51% yesterday, closing at 6,882, after spending much of the previous month flirting with the 7,000 level.\n\nMarkets were flat or down globally this morning, with the worst performer being South Korea’s KOSPI, which lost 3.86%.\n\nThe damage came from the tech and software sector, as investors began to realize that the promise of AI won’t always be sunshine and roses. Until recently, the markets had assumed that companies would be buoyed by the massive amount of capex (capital expenditure) going into AI, and that AI would generate new efficiencies and higher productivity that would ultimately result in higher revenues and earnings per share. Over the past few days, however, traders have reacted to the notion that AI also has the power to destroy the revenues of companies reliant on selling traditional software that can be replaced by AI.\n\nWhat signals indicate the tech correction may continue?\n\nWhy are retail traders buying during market dips?\n\nHow is equal-weight S&P performing versus cap-weighted?\n\nWhat caused the $1 trillion software market selloff?\n\nAs much as $1 trillion was wiped off the market cap of software companies yesterday, according to Bloomberg. Alphabet closed down nearly 2% yesterday and lost a further 2.53% overnight after revealing on its earnings call that it planned to double AI capex. The beatdown on Alphabet shares came despite better-than-forecast revenue growth that indicates the company’s advertising sales are in no way being cannibalized by consumer adoption of AI, including its own Gemini AI chatbot and its AI Mode in Google Search.\n\nThat’s a problem because until very recently the performance of the S&P 500 was governed by the heavy weight of tech stocks, like Alphabet, within it. “By the end of 2025, the 10 largest companies accounted for nearly 41% of the S&P 500’s total weight,” according to RBC Wealth Management.\n\nBut the chaos is mostly a tech-only phenomenon, the data says. The equal-weight S&P 500—a notional index that values each of the 500 companies equally rather than by total market cap—is actually at a record high this morning because the non-tech companies inside it are doing rather well.\n\n“Tech stocks are being squeezed sharply, but a lot of broader indices are still holding up for the most part,” Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank told clients this morning. There were “363 advancers in the S&P 500 [yesterday], which was actually the most in two weeks.”\n\nPeople are buying stocks, just not tech stocks.\n\nSo who is behind this selective buying? Retail traders who love to buy the dip, is one theory, according to Axios. Retail buyers—ordinary folks trading their own accounts—used to be referred to as “the dumb money” among the institutional investors of Wall Street because they historically waited too long to jump into bull markets and sold too late into bear markets, the opposite of what you’d want to do.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that demands made by Democrats for new restrictions on federal immigration officers are “unrealistic” and warned that the Department of Homeland Security will shut down next week if they do not work with Republicans and the White House.\n\nDemocrats say they will not vote for a DHS spending bill when funding runs out unless there are “dramatic changes” at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies in the wake of the fatal shootings of two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nThe Democratic leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, released an expanded list of 10 detailed proposals on Wednesday night for restraining President Donald Trump’s aggressive campaign of immigration enforcement. Among the demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use of force standards and a stop to racial profiling.\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump last week agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated from a larger spending measure and extended at current levels for two weeks while the two parties negotiate. The deal came after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans agreed that new restrictions were necessary.\n\nBut with nearly a week gone, a shutdown is becoming increasingly likely starting Feb. 14 as Republicans have been cool to most of the Democrats’ requests.\n\n“This is not a blank check situation where Republicans just do agree to a list of Democrat demands,” said Thune, R-S.D. “The only way to get reforms to ICE is to agree to a bill.”\n\nAs of now, Thune said, “we aren’t anywhere close to having any sort of an agreement.”\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., said he is “astounded to hear” Republicans say his party’s proposals were political or unworkable.\n\n“It’s about people’s basic rights, it’s about people’s safety,” Schumer said. If Republicans do not like the ideas, he said, “they need to explain why.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries, D-N.Y., have made several demands, including no masks for officers, judicial warrants and better federal coordination with local authorities. The list they released Wednesday added several new items, including a stricter use-of-force policy, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nDemocrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it's verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nThey also want an end to racial profiling, saying DHS officers should be prohibited from stopping, questioning or searching people \"based on an individual’s presence at certain locations, their job, their spoken language and accent or their race and ethnicity.”\n\nFor officers conducting immigration enforcement, Democrats say that in addition to officers taking off their masks and showing identification, DHS should regulate and standardize uniforms and equipment to bring them in line with other law enforcement agencies.\n\nSchumer called it a “gut check moment for Congress\" as the immigration enforcement operations have rocked Minneapolis and other U.S. cities. But Republicans were dismissive.\n\nWyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican senator, said the demands are “radical and extreme” and a “far-left wish list.”\n\nSen. Katie Britt, who is helping lead negotiations, said the list is “a ridiculous Christmas list of demands\" and warned that time is running out before the deadline.\n\n“I encourage them to talk to the White House,” she said. “We only have one week left.”\n\nThune has also encouraged Democrats and the White House to talk. It is unclear whether they are or whether Democrats would be willing to back down on any of their demands.\n\nSome Republicans have demands of their own, including adding legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said it is up to Republicans to ensure the government doesn't shut down because they are in charge.\n\n“The American people want this abuse to stop,” Murphy said.\n\nSome look to limit shutdown pain\n\nOther lawmakers are searching for options to prevent another partial shutdown.\n\nOne idea being floated is to essentially fund some of the other agencies within DHS -– the Coast Guard, airport operations under TSA and disaster assistance from FEMA.\n\n“Why not take that off the table?” said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, whose state is in need of FEMA funds from recent disasters.\n\n“If it doesn’t look like they can get it done,” he said about the immigration enforcement overhaul. “I really think they should look at a la carte funding of agencies.”\n\nSome Democrats have said they agree, but Thune said Thursday that splitting apart the DHS appropriations bill to single out ICE would “defund law enforcement.”\n\nSplitting the bill would mean essentially cutting ICE loose by allowing it to go without its routine federal funding because the agency already has such a robust budget from Trump’s tax and spending cut bill from last year.\n\nICE is expected to receive about $10 billion in the annual appropriations bill, a fraction of the $175 billion-plus for homeland security for the administration’s mass deportation agenda.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped to $67,000 per token on Thursday, falling to its lowest level since 2024 as selling pressure intensified.\n\nThe token extended losses from the prior session after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled that the US government would not step in to support the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nBitcoin fell to as low as $67,073 apiece early Thursday, continuing Wednesday's slump that followed Bessent's comments.\n\nThe decline was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\nWhat are analysts saying about Bitcoin's support levels?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop to $67,000 Thursday?\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed year-to-date in 2024?\n\nWhat did Treasury Secretary Bessent say about crypto?\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower on Thursday only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply last weekend to notch its fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement last Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nAfter bitcoin earlier broke through the key support level at $73,000, 10X Research strategists wrote that \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully.\"\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin has slipped to roughly $70,000 on February 5 — about 20% below the estimated $87,000 cost to produce a single coin — as hashrate declines, shrinking margins, and a broader market rout drag miner profitability to its lowest point in 14 months.\n\n– Bitcoin is trading near $71,000, roughly 20% below its estimated all-in production cost — a gap that has historically only appeared during bear markets.\n\n– The Miner Profit and Loss Sustainability Index has sunk to 21, a level not seen since November 2024, after daily mining revenue briefly touched $28 million.\n\n– A difficulty adjustment expected on February 8 could cut mining difficulty by around 14%, throwing a lifeline to operators still running machines.\n\nCryptoQuant data puts the network hashrate near 970 exahashes per second, down 12% from a peak of roughly 1.1 zettahashes per second in October — the steepest slide since China’s 2021 mining ban.\n\nThe downturn traces back to early October, when Bitcoin was trading near $126,000. The largest derivatives liquidation event on record kicked off a sell-off that has yet to find a floor. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has since fallen to zero.\n\nThe financial strain on miners has intensified sharply in recent weeks. Daily Bitcoin mining revenue plunged from roughly $45 million to a yearly low of $28 million in late January, driven by a combination of falling prices and severe US winter storms that forced large operators to curtail production.\n\nOutput from the largest publicly traded miners dropped from roughly 77 Bitcoin per day to just 28 over the same period, according to CryptoQuant.\n\nAverage block times have drifted to roughly 11.6 minutes, well above the protocol’s 10-minute target, reflecting the volume of hashpower that has gone offline.\n\nThe Miner Profit and Loss Sustainability Index has slid to 21, confirming that revenues are failing to cover costs for a significant portion of the network. Older models, including the Antminer S19 XP+ and MicroBT M60S, are no longer profitable at current difficulty and standard electricity rates of $0.08 per kilowatt-hour.\n\nEven newer S21-series machines are approaching their shutdown price range of $69,000 to $74,000, as previously reported.\n\nThe next Bitcoin difficulty retarget, projected for February 8, is estimated to cut mining difficulty by approximately 14% to around 121 trillion, down from the current 141.67 trillion.",

    "fullText": "Reducing plastic use is a priority for many restaurants, but it's not always so straightforward. A move by McDonald's to introduce a \"reusable\" mixing spindle for its McFlurry drew the ire of an employee and sparked debate on whether it did more harm than good.\n\nThe employee shared a photo of the new spindle to the r/McDonaldsEmployees subreddit in a post titled \"I'd like to point out this McBull****.\"\n\nThey poked holes in the company's initiative by pointing out that the old spindles fulfilled two roles as both spindle and de facto spoon given to the customer. They called that old scheme \"simple\" and \"genius.\"\n\nThe big flaw with the new initiative was replacing the spindle as a serving utensil was a plastic spoon wrapped in more plastic. They questioned whether that was actually an upgrade, while alluding to the inconvenience of employees now having to clean the reusable spindles throughout the day.\n\n\"I already can see problems with this,\" a commenter wrote. They worried employees would mistakenly give out the spindle, and customers would complain about that switch.\n\nA user theorized: \"The spindle spoon is heavier and more plastic? But I agree, it's all posturing.\"\n\nOther commenters said their locations had unwrapped wooden spoons, which could certainly result in a measurable decrease in plastic usage. Potential cost savings on cheaper plastic were another working theory.\n\nSingle-use plastics contribute significantly to environmental pollution, often ending up in landfills. From there, they can produce potent gases like methane. Microplastics from these plastics can also leach out and enter ecosystems, as well as food and water sources.\n\nSome of the biggest contributors to plastic pollution are chain restaurants, and while they're taking initiatives aimed at reducing their waste, it's important that those steps are actually effective.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMcDonald's has taken steps to address its plastic usage. By the end of 2024 over 90% of its primary guest packaging was sourced from renewable, recycled or certified sources, per its corporate website.\n\nFor McFlurries, it'd be nice to see if the company was more transparent in revealing how the shift reduced plastic usage. Another move could be offering more eco-friendly options than wrapped plastic spoons at its restaurants.\n\nFinding alternatives to plastic is a continuing project for researchers and entrepreneurs around the globe. Reuse-and-return schemes are a proposed way to save plastics from going straight to the landfill.\n\nConsumers can reduce their usage of single-use plastics and put pressure on businesses to find alternatives while being more transparent about so-called sustainable moves.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A routine fuel stop turned into a national political flashpoint after a gas station employee refused service to federal immigration agents, igniting a debate that now reaches far beyond politics and squarely into the automotive and fuel retail space.\n\nThe incident unfolded at a Speedway gas station in Minneapolis when Border Patrol agents attempted to refuel government vehicles during official operations.\n\nAccording to video footage that quickly spread online, a man identifying himself as the store’s manager denied service and stated bluntly that he did not support ICE, adding that no one at the store did either. The agents were told to leave without being allowed to purchase fuel.\n\nWithin hours, the encounter became a lightning rod. Critics accused the business of politicizing a basic commercial service, while supporters framed the refusal as a form of protest.\n\nBut for the automotive and fuel industries, the episode raises deeper questions about neutrality, safety, and the evolving role of gas stations in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nFuel stations occupy a unique position in American infrastructure for the simple fact that they aren’t simply retail outlets. They are essential service points relied upon by private motorists, commercial fleets, emergency responders, and, yes, government agencies like ICE.\n\nDenying fuel is not equivalent to refusing a cup of coffee or retail merchandise. Vehicles without fuel do not operate, and in the case of law enforcement or emergency services, that reality carries serious implications.\n\nIndustry experts note that while private businesses generally retain the right to refuse service, gas stations historically operate under an expectation of political neutrality. Fleet contracts, fuel cards, and government supply agreements are built on reliability, not ideology.\n\nOnce a station is perceived as selectively serving customers based on political or occupational identity, that reliability comes into question.\n\nThe fallout for Speedway and its parent companies has been swift. Calls for boycotts surfaced almost immediately, with critics warning that the brand risks alienating everyday drivers who view fuel access as nonpartisan.\n\nOthers warned of reputational damage that could ripple across franchise networks, where individual store decisions can reflect on national brands regardless of corporate policy.\n\nThere is also a safety dimension that automotive analysts are watching closely. Federal agents often refuel during active operations or long-distance deployments. Forcing vehicles to reroute in search of fuel introduces delays and unpredictability.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last month that he was finally prepared to drop his freeze on billions of dollars in funding for a major New York infrastructure project.\n\nBut there was a condition: In exchange for the money, Schumer had to agree to rename New York’s Penn Station and Washington’s Dulles International Airport after Trump.\n\nThe startling offer, which was described by two people familiar with the conversation, was swiftly rejected by Schumer, who told the president he didn’t have the power to deliver on such an unorthodox request.\n\nIn the weeks since, Trump has continued to withhold the more than $16 billion earmarked for the long-planned Gateway project connecting New York and New Jersey through a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River.\n\nThe two states are now suing the Trump administration over the freeze, alleging in a complaint filed earlier this week that the funding suspension is unlawful.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe episode, first reported by Punchbowl, offers a fresh window into Trump’s ever-expanding effort to secure an outsized place in American history — and to do so in part by branding nearly everything around him with his own name.\n\nSince returning to the White House, the president has introduced a slew of initiatives bearing the Trump name, including the Trump Gold Card offering a high-priced path to citizenship, the TrumpRx website offering lower-priced prescription drugs, and a new Trump-class battleship meant to solidify his era of “peace through strength” foreign policy for years to come.\n\nTrump in recent months has set his sights on even bigger targets: Adding his name first to the US Institute of Peace and then, even more controversially, to Washington’s iconic Kennedy Center.\n\nStill, Trump’s offer to Schumer would have represented perhaps his most audacious move yet, an apparent attempt to leverage the future of a massive infrastructure project to fulfill his own personal wishes.\n\nThe commission in charge of the Gateway tunnel has warned that it will soon have to shut down work on the project and lay off roughly 1,000 workers if the Trump administration does not release the funding it needs.\n\nThe tunnel’s construction predates Trump’s return to office, with the federal government on the hook for a significant portion of the funding needed to complete it. But Trump moved to halt the project late last year, a decision that Democratic officials in New Jersey and New York have argued was politically motivated.\n\nSchumer has since played a central role in trying to negotiate the unfreezing of the funding. Yet despite that priority, there’s little that the Democrat could conceivably do on his own to put Trump’s name on either Penn Station or Dulles Airport.\n\nWhile some conservative lawmakers have already introduced legislation to rename Dulles as the “Donald J. Trump International Airport,” it’s so far gained little traction.\n\nThe legislation has not advanced in the GOP-controlled Congress, and as a result remains unlikely to pass.",

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.1%.\n\nThe overnight moves followed a sharp sell-off during Thursday’s regular session, led once again by technology stocks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have now slipped into negative territory for 2026.\n\nAnd after the bell, Amazon (AMZN) added to the gloom. Shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading after the company posted earnings per share that missed Wall Street estimates and projected capital expenditures of $200 billion for the year, raising concerns about the extent of AI spend.\n\nThe risk-off tone extended beyond equities. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued sliding, touching levels not seen since 2024, while silver (SI=F) resumed its decline after a recent surge fueled by retail investor interest. Strategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by bitcoin's sell-off, sending shares down.\n\nEarnings also drove Reddit (RDDT) upward after reporting a quarterly earnings beat, issuing upbeat guidance, and announcing a stock buyback program. Roblox (RBLX) shares also surged. Looking ahead, investors will focus on earnings from Toyota (TM) and Philip Morris (PM), due before Friday’s opening bell.\n\nMeanwhile, the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week following the resolution of the federal government shutdown.

    "fullText": "Having won only one of their past six Premier League games and drawn 2-2 at Tottenham after being 2-0 up, can second-placed Manchester City get back on track at Liverpool on Sunday?\n\n\"I wouldn't rule City out of anything at the moment\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\n\"But the way they folded in the second half against Tottenham was a real worry.\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 25 is Gladiators star Apollo, real name Alex Gray, who supports Newcastle.\n\nBefore becoming a Gladiator, the 6ft 6in Gray played Premiership rugby for three teams and also American Football for NFL side Atlanta Falcons.\n\nHe is part of Channel 5's Big Game Night NFL coverage and they are live on Super Bowl Sunday on 8 February from 22:30 GMT.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own Premier League predictions below - and for the Super Bowl too!\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nThe NFL's influence can be seen in the Premier League through the kind of choreographed corner routines that are now commonplace, and Apollo can understand why Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has shared ideas with Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay.\n\nApollo told BBC Sport: \"While football is quite a free-flowing game you do have these set-pieces and if you need some inspiration of how to make things happen then the NFL is a good place to look at, because that's what they do all day every day - not just on offence but on defence as well.\n\n\"What you are always trying to get in the NFL is mismatches, and that's exactly the same in football for some of the big guys coming in and trying to put the ball in the back of the net with a header or whatever.\n\n\"The level of detail that goes into that in the NFL is incredible. I remember my days there in training camp would start with breakfast at 7.30am and some days you wouldn't leave the meeting rooms until 11pm.\n\n\"We were only on the field for two hours max and in the gym for another hour, and the rest would be meetings and analysis.\n\n\"The scrutiny on every individual is so high so I can see why other sports would look at that and try to implement it themselves to find some weakness in the opposition armour. Arteta must have been thinking it is a way to help his team win games.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Apollo - aka Alex Gray - were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.\n\nI am at this game and we are getting to the stage where it really matters how the teams fighting relegation do in their head-to-head-battles like this.\n\nI think the bottom two, Wolves and Burnley are down, but you don't know what West Ham will do from here.\n\nThere are signs they may click, so with Leeds and Nottingham Forest both on 26 points, this is big for both of them.\n\nFrom a Leeds point of view, their home form has carried them a lot this season.\n\nThey got walloped at Elland Road by Arsenal last weekend but they just have to put that behind them for this game because, as the season has gone on, they have proved they can be competitive.\n\nForest's away form is actually better than their home form - they have picked up 14 points on the road compared to 12 at the City Ground, in the same number of games.\n\nSean Dyche's side were comfortable with 10 men in the draw against Crystal Palace last time out and they have won their past two away games, against Brentford and the Hammers. Overall, they are unbeaten in four league games, which is the longest they have gone without losing all season.\n\nAs you can see, I've looked into all the stats for you - but will my research help me get my prediction right? Probably not.\n\nThis is going to be a very tight affair and Forest won't worry about having much possession, but scoring goals has been a bigger problem for them because they have missed Chris Wood badly - only Wolves have scored fewer than them.\n\nForest have brought in 6ft 7in striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli to try to fill the gap left by Wood's long-term knee injury but he has not been in great form in Serie A this season.\n\nSo, after a great deal of thought, I am going to back Leeds at home - although now I've said that it will probably end up as a 1-1 draw.\n\nApollo's prediction: When I looked at the fixtures I was thinking about who in the Gladiators supports who. Two of the guys, Giant and Hammer, are big Forest fans so I am going for a Leeds win here. It should be a good game though. 3-2\n\nManchester United were slightly fortunate to beat Fulham last time out. A draw would have been about right.\n\nStill, it was big for Benjamin Sesko to get their winner and I have got to say he put it away very nicely, especially because he should have scored with a header earlier in the game.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, produced a great comeback against Manchester City. I've talked about how much I rate Dominic Solanke and when he is up for Spurs, they are in a much better place as a team.\n\nThere is a danger of getting carried away with United under Michael Carrick, and I am expecting Solanke to score again here, but it still feels like United will find a way to win it.\n\nApollo's prediction: Tottenham have an affinity with the NFL and I've been to a couple of games there so I am backing them here. 0-1\n\nLosing back-to-back home league games against Everton and Brentford has been a real killer for Aston Villa, who have so many injuries to contend with in their midfield.\n\nAfter a long wait for a win, Bournemouth have now won three of their past four league games - and I make them favourites at home here.\n\nVilla thumped the Cherries 4-0 at Villa Park in November, and I have got a lot of their players in my Fantasy team, but this is going to be a very different game.\n\nI've gone for 2-1 wins in my first two games and I don't really want to go for that scoreline again here, but I feel like I have no choice. I do think Villa will score - Morgan Rogers is always dangerous and Tammy Abraham is a clever signing up front - but Bournemouth will edge it.\n\nApollo's prediction: It's great for Villa to be in a title race. 1-2\n\nI am not going to say 2-1 for this one. Instead it will be another Arsenal clean sheet - they have already kept 12 in their first 24 league games, two more than any other team.\n\nIt's a shame Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka is not fit to face his old club at the Emirates. When he played for the Black Cats against Arsenal in their draw at the Stadium of Light, they were the first team I saw who really rattled the Gunners.\n\nXhaka's experience has helped to glue together a Sunderland side with a lot of young players this season, but they coped all right without him against Burnley on Monday.\n\nThis is a much tougher game for them, obviously, and Sunderland's away form is nowhere near as strong as it is at home.\n\nArsenal swept Leeds aside 4-0 last weekend, when everyone thought they were having a bit of a blip.\n\nThey showed their strength in depth at Elland Road, when they lost Bukayo Saka in the warm-up, and I can see them winning comfortably this time too.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is very easy for me because Legend and Fire both support Arsenal and are real die-hard fans - Legend even has a cannon tattoo - so being absolutely honest I would love Sunderland to win, and do it for the north-east! 0-2\n\nI think Burnley are down but this is their chance to prove me wrong.\n\nThey need it to be - they are at home, against a team one place above them in the table, so this is their big chance to end their long wait for a win.\n\nI just don't see it happening for the Clarets, though.\n\nAs I said earlier, I am not sure which West Ham side will turn up but they have shown some improvement recently, especially in attack.\n\nI don't think the Hammers will keep a clean sheet because they have had only one all season - the fewest by any top-flight team - but I don't see Burnley beating them.\n\nApollo's prediction: My cousins are lifelong Burnley fans and season-ticket holders so if I didn't back them here, I'd be in a lot of trouble. The former NFL player, JJ Watt, is a co-owner of the club too, so for the NFL links and family ties, it's got to be a home win. 2-1\n\nEverton asked about Fulham forward Harry Wilson on deadline day.\n\nHe has been a revelation this season and they won't be looking forward to facing him on Saturday.\n\nThe Toffees have got something after falling behind in their past three league games, including the last-gasp equaliser against Brighton that saw poor David Moyes booked for his celebration - there is no way you should get a yellow card for that.\n\nThis is going to be another close game and it smells of another 2-1 to me, but I am not going to go down that road again this week.\n\nInstead, I'm going for a different scoreline but sticking with a narrow Fulham win. Marco Silva will feel his side deserved something from Old Trafford and it will be him celebrating at the final whistle this week, not Moyes.\n\nApollo's prediction: We don't like draws in the NFL but this might up all-square. 1-1\n\nChelsea were accused of being too negative in their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal in midweek, but I can't see that being the case here.\n\nI was far too optimistic about Wolves last week when I said they would draw with Bournemouth and I am not making the same mistake this time.\n\nThe games have been coming thick and fast for Chelsea and I actually admire their manager Liam Rosenior for the way he changed things up in their 3-2 comeback win over West Ham after being 2-0 down.\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards has probably got one eye on preparing for next season in the Championship, and his side will be one step nearer to that after this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: I went to a couple of Chelsea games when I lived in London and they will get the job done here. 1-2\n\nYou just wonder how much Newcastle have got left in the tank after their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday.\n\nThe Magpies have a few injuries to contend with too, with Anthony Gordon the latest player to be sidelined, so they will have to dig deep and hope Bruno Guimaraes is back fit in time for this game.\n\nBrentford got one heck of a win last time out at Villa, and their manager Keith Andrews deserves a lot of credit for getting that result despite being down to 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nThe Bees are always so well organised at the back, and how Eddie Howe's side try to break them down will be the key to this one.\n\nAs good as Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade is with his back to goal, he doesn't run in behind.\n\nDoing that, and attacking with pace, is how Eddie Howe's side look the most dangerous - Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga will have to do that here, and I fancy Yoane Wissa to score against his former club.\n\nApollo on why he supports Newcastle: I am from a small town in County Durham - my grandmother went to school with Sir Bobby Robson - so I had the choice of Newcastle, Sunderland or Middlesbrough. I know it is absolute blasphemy to say this, but I like to see all the north-east clubs do well.\n\nNewcastle are my team though, because that's who I went to watch first - I went to see them against Ipswich in 2000, and Alan Shearer scored a couple - and it is my city as well. I played rugby for them and I lived there. It's a fantastic place and it's even better when the team is going well.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is going to be a Newcastle win, it's just a case of how much. Brentford's performance coach Ben Ryan used to coach me for England Sevens, then he went to Fiji and got a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, so it would be nice to get one over him as well. 3-1\n\nPalace have brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen, and kept Jean-Philippe Mateta, so Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has got some options up front.\n\nI normally predict a draw in this game, and it ended up 0-0 at Selhurst Park in November. This time, though, I fancy Brighton.\n\nThe Seagulls didn't quite get over the line against Everton, but them conceding late on actually won me some points. I am going for them to keep a clean sheet here though.\n\nApollo's prediction: Palace to edge it. 0-1\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola starts with Omar Marmoush up front ahead of Erling Haaland after his two goals against Newcastle in midweek, but their attack looks strong anyway with Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo in the team.\n\nThe same applies to Liverpool, who have got a striker in form in Hugo Ekitike, while Florian Wirtz is playing with confidence too.\n\nCity will have moments where they will create chances, but Liverpool are going to have opportunities at the other end as well - there will be a few goals in this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is the 'Super Bowl' game of the weekend in the Premier League so I've gone for an NFL-type score as well as a football one. 22-31 (2-3)\n\nSuper Bowl, Levi's Stadium 23:30 GMT\n\nI haven't got a clue about the NFL and I never played gridiron - my nose would be too big and would stick out of the helmet - but I am going for the Seahawks to down the Patriots on Sunday.\n\nSeattle is a really nice place and I played in their stadium for Celtic, so they get my backing here... although that's probably bad news for them, going by how I've done at predictions this season.\n\nApollo's prediction: The Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Aden Durde, was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program that took me to Atlanta. If he gets a Super Bowl, it would be the biggest accomplishment from someone from Britain in the NFL. 21-18\n\nFor the second successive week, the outcome went to the final game.\n\nChris, the BBC readers and AI were all level on 80 points going into Monday's match between Sunderland and Burnley, with his guest - boxer Francesca Hennessy - on 40 points.\n\nChris and Francesca went for a 1-0 Black Cats victory, the BBC readers thought they would win 2-0, while AI picked a 1-1 draw.\n\nSunderland were 2-0 up after 32 minutes but the BBC readers' hopes of an outright win were scuppered when Chemsdine Talbi scored their third goal, 18 minutes from time.\n\nThat meant Chris and the BBC readers tied for victory - they both managed six correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 matches in week 24, for a total of 90 points.\n\nAI managed five correct results with one correct score for a tally of 80 points, while Francesca also managed five correct results but with no exact scores, leaving her on 50 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "To coincide with the start of his new podcast series, Gareth Rhys Owen looks at the role Louis Rees-Zammit is playing in the changing face of rugby in Wales.",
    "fullText": "To coincide with the start of his new podcast series on BBC Sounds, Gareth Rhys Owen investigates if Louis Rees-Zammit, who quit rugby to pursue his American Football dream, can now, after his return, help Welsh rugby through its current nightmare.\n\nAs the Six Nations returns, Welsh rugby finds itself in a familiar place.\n\nHope, doubt, expectation and anxiety – all bundled together, all competing for space. It os the rhythm of this championship. But this year, one name cuts through more than most.\n\nRees-Zammit at full-back for Wales against England\n\n'No bigger game' - Rees-Zammit on England v Wales rivalry\n\nA few months ago, I found myself in a BBC meeting room pitching a different podcast.\n\nThat shift was not accidental. It reflected something broader.\n\nAt 25, Rees-Zammit has already lived several sporting lives. A meteoric rise in Welsh rugby. A global profile built on speed, confidence and comfort in front of the camera. Then the decision that stopped people mid-scroll: leaving rugby to try his hand in the NFL.\n\nIt was bold. It was ambitious. And crucially, it was very him.\n\nThe American chapter did not unfold like a Hollywood script. The NFL is unforgiving, complex and not designed for outsiders to stroll in and succeed. But when Rees-Zammit returned to Wales, what struck me was not disappointment. It was attention.\n\nAt Rees-Zammit's first press conference after coming home, the room buzzed. Clips of him speaking and training flew across social media. One short video hit a million views across our Instagram and TikTok accounts.\n\nBecause Welsh rugby has always understood heroes – but it has not always understood reach.\n\nPrevious generations of players sold something deeper than popularity. Sir Gareth Edwards and Shane Williams did not just excite crowds, they embodied belief, identity and collective pride. They did not need to think about platforms or algorithms.\n\nRees-Zammit lives in a different sporting world.\n\nHe is comfortable in spaces rugby traditionally avoided. He understands how athletes are now consumed, not just on terraces but on phones. He does not apologise for that. And that is precisely why he divides opinion.\n\nSome see style over substance. Others see evolution.\n\nTo explore that divide, I spoke to journalists, fans and fellow broadcasters. One who has spent decades covering Welsh rugby and, like many of his generation, asked a fair question: what is actually new here?\n\nBut when I took the same conversation on to the streets of Cardiff, the response was striking.\n\nFans, particularly younger ones, see Rees-Zammit as a bridge between rugby and a wider audience. Between tradition and modern sport. Between a game fighting for relevance and a generation that consumes it differently.\n\nThey do not see him as a problem. They see him as an opportunity.\n\nRees-Zammit left NFL after 'wasting his talent'\n\nWhy is it so hard to break into the NFL?\n\nThat is where the Six Nations comes back into focus.\n\nThis competition has always been about more than results. It is about narrative, momentum and belief. The stories that carry teams through February and March.\n\nWelsh rugby needs those stories again.\n\nIt needs reasons for people to care, not just about outcomes but about direction. About where the game is heading and who is carrying it there.\n\nRees-Zammit does not have to be the answer to every question. But he does represent a version of Welsh rugby that is not shrinking from the modern world. One that is not embarrassed by popularity. One that understands visibility is not the enemy of authenticity.\n\nThat does not mean tradition disappears. It means it adapts.\n\nSaturday, 7 February, 16:40 GMT\n\nLive audio commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru and on the BBC Sport website alongside live text commentary.\n\nAnd maybe that is the real tension playing out right now. Not whether Louis Rees-Zammit belongs in Welsh rugby, but whether Welsh rugby is ready to fully embrace what players like him represent.\n\nAs the Six Nations begins, that question feels unavoidable.\n\nBecause this is no longer just about one player's career path. It is about how Welsh rugby tells its story, who it wants listening and how it plans to compete, not just on the pitch but in the wider sporting conversation.\n\nThat is the heart of Golden Boy: Louis Rees-Zammit, a series that uses his journey as a lens to explore the changing face of Welsh rugby, its pressures, its possibilities and its future.\n\nAs Wales prepare to start another Six Nations campaign against England on Saturday, it feels like the right moment to ask those questions.\n\nAnd Rees-Zammit, whether by design or instinct, is right at the centre of them.",

    "description": "Ski jumping has been pushed into the spotlight after a whistleblower uncovered a cheating scandal that involves, of all things, crotch manipulation.",
    "fullText": "MILAN — Adrian Livelten hunched over a sewing machine last March on the eve of the men’s ski jumping competition at the Nordic World Ski Championships.\n\nThe suit technician for Norway’s national ski jumping team brazenly made alterations to suits belonging to the country’s two top contenders after those suits had already passed inspection. Livelten did this in plain view of Norway ski jumping head coach Magnus Brevik, seated in a chair halfway across the room.\n\nWhat neither Livelten nor Brevik realized at the time was that someone was recording them in secrecy from behind a curtain, someone who intended to distribute the video far and wide the following day. The damning footage shared by the anonymous whistleblower shook the sport of ski jumping, bringing out into the open the cheating that happened behind closed doors.\n\nWhen officials from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) seized suits belonging to reigning Olympic champion Marius Lindvik and fellow Norwegian Johann André Forfang, they found rules violations that initially went unnoticed during the competition. Stiffer, non-elastic thread had been sewn into the suits to pull down the crotch area during flight, increasing the surface area and creating more aerodynamic lift in a sport where inches can be the difference between medaling and missing the podium.\n\n\"Probably the most shocking part was that it was Norway because they’ve always been considered one of the more standup teams,” said Johnny Spillane, the first American to medal in the sport of Nordic combined, which consists of ski jumping and cross-country skiing. \"Everyone is going to push the limits. That hasn't changed and that probably will never change, but this was deliberately altering a suit after it had been tested in order to cheat. This was the most blatant cheating I've heard of.\"\n\nThe Norway cheating scandal highlighted two irrefutable facts about the crotch-obsessed sport of ski jumping on the precipice of the 2026 Winter Olympics. There is, as Finnish coach Petter Kukkonen put it last April, “a culture of cheating” in ski jumping. And the battleground between unscrupulous teams and rule-upholding regulators is often below the belt.\n\nMale ski jumpers must wear tight-fitting suits that are no more than 4 centimeters larger than their body measurements at any point. Most national teams seek to find every millimeter they can because a bigger, baggier suit catches more wind and provides more lift during flight than a smaller one does.\n\nFittingly, the most advantageous place to enlarge a ski jumper’s suit is the crotch area. Adding just a centimeter of fabric to the circumference of that part of a suit increases flight distance by approximately 2.8 meters — or more than 9 feet — according to a study published by Frontiers in Sports and Active Living in October 2025.\n\nAthletes chasing that competitive advantage have resorted to trickery when having their body dimensions measured prior to a competition. The more they reduce the distance between their inseam and the floor when FIS equipment controllers record their body measurements, the lower regulators will allow the crotch of their suit to hang while airborne.\n\nIn November 2020, Kukkonen told Finland’s leading tabloid newspaper that athletes were stuffing dish cloths and sponges in their underwear during body measuring. In a recent appearance on the Skirious Problems podcast, Austria’s Mika Vermeulen revealed that when he competed in nordic combined earlier in his career, veterans told him before his first body measuring, “It’s very important to tape your c*** back.”\n\nVermeulen later described ski jumpers putting modeling clay in their underwear to lower their crotch-to-floor measurement by five centimeters.\n\n“People used to cheat a f*** ton,” Vermeulen said.\n\nSalacious stories like those were already pushing ski jumping out of the margins and into the mainstream entering these Olympics. Then the German tabloid Bild sparked further curiosity in January when it reported that ski jumpers have worn condom-like sleeves filled with hyaluronic acid to enlarge themselves before measurement.\n\n“When I read that article, all I could do was shake my head,” USA Ski Jumping and Nordic Combined sport director Anders Johnson said. “If that is really what other people were doing previously, I can't believe that that's how far people have taken it.”\n\nOn Thursday, the alleged scandal went to the top of the performance-enhancing food chain when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was asked about it just 24 hours before the Opening Ceremony of the 2026 Olympics.\n\n\"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that [an enlarged crotch area in their suits] could improve performance,” WADA president Witold Banka said. “If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"\n\nCheating in ski jumping isn’t a new phenomenon. Athletes have been pushing boundaries and exploiting loopholes ever since the sport’s governing body began setting rules restricting how far they can fly.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Austrian national team unveiled suits that were highly permeable in the front but did not allow air to pass through in the back. The resulting parachute effect helped Austrian jumpers take gold and silver in the men’s large-hill event at the 1976 Winter Olympics. Seventeen-year-old Austrian prodigy Toni Innauer set a world record the following month and then bettered it two days later.\n\nThe success of those suits inspired copycat attempts, some well-executed, others not so much. Former American ski jumper Jeff Hastings recalls an early 1980s competitor who “put a garbage bag in the back of his suit to try to get the ‘76 Austrian effect.”\n\n“Everybody could hear him up there rustling like crazy,” Hastings said. “It wasn’t even effective but he was just trying to get a little advantage.”\n\nDetailed rules governing the air permeability of ski jumping suits soon went into effect, but that didn’t deter athletes eager to find even the slightest competitive advantage. Retired ski jumpers have admitted to coating the back of their suits with hairspray or slathering on wood glue in an effort to reduce air flow, improve lift and fly longer.\n\n“You name it, people have tried it,” Spillane said.\n\nAs the sport’s deep-pocketed superpowers stopped buying suits from third-party manufacturers and started hiring sophisticated specialists to produce them in-house, new opportunities to cheat have materialized over the past 10-15 years. Teams sought to gain an advantage by creating custom suits for athletes that exceeded their body measurement by as much as possible without resulting in a disqualification.\n\nThe ideal place to add material is where the legs converge, according to Dr. John Goff, visiting physics professor at the University of Puget Sound and author of the book Gold Medal Physics. The crotch area of the suit is naturally stretched wide with a jumper’s legs in a “V” position during flight. It’s also close to the body’s center of gravity, helping an athlete gain lift without sacrificing control.\n\n“The crotch region, where the legs part, is kind of a sharp transition point,” Goff said. “If you can put some kind of material there to smooth that out, you can reduce the turbulence and increase the lift for the skier. That can have a pretty big influence on the flight.”\n\nFor FIS regulators seeking to prevent teams from gaining an advantage, the process starts with athletes stripping down to their underwear. Athletes must have their body dimensions measured before competitions in the presence of an FIS equipment controller, a team official and a qualified doctor or nurse.\n\nSince 2023, those measurements have sometimes been taken with the help of a 3D body scanner. Before then, it was always a manual process. As American Nordic Combined skier and 2018 Olympian Ben Berend once detailed in a blog post, that made the crotch measurement part of this process particularly awkward.\n\n“The process consists of standing with your feet 40 cm apart wearing nothing but underwear,” Berend wrote in 2016. “Then a metal rod is moved up as high as possible until it hits your junk. The measurement is essentially junk to floor in centimeters.”\n\nThe intrusiveness doesn’t end once the measuring process is over. Athletes also must endure what FIS described in a 2023 memo as a “visual crotch area inspection.” A supervising doctor or nurse checks the athlete “for any irregularities in the genital area” — in other words an artificial prosthesis in the athlete’s underwear that could reduce the crotch-to-floor measurement.\n\nAs a result of stories like the ones shared by Kukkonen and Vermeulen, the process is fraught with suspicion that national teams are finding ways to bypass the rules.\n\nA friend recently sent Hastings a screenshot of one of the world’s top-ranked ski jumpers in mid-flight last year.\n\n“The crotch on his suit practically came down to his knees,” Hastings said. “I’m exaggerating a little bit, but it looked like he had a diaper on.”\n\nBetween suspicious images like that one, unconfirmed gossip about which teams were cheating and the knowledge of how much difference a little extra fabric can make, Johnson admits it creates a toxic culture.\n\n“If one team starts cheating, then two or three start doing it,” Johnson said. “Once you have the best nations in the world doing it, then everyone kind of has to follow suit. It just spreads like wildfire and then once it does, it’s really hard to get back.”\n\nThe chicanery mostly occurred in secret until the anonymous whistleblower shined a spotlight on Norway’s dishonesty and turned the birthplace of ski jumping into a symbol for everything wrong with the sport. Austria, Slovenia and Poland filed formal protests against the Norwegians during the World Championships and called for their results to be annulled.\n\n“This is doping, just with a different needle,” former German Olympic champion Jens Weissflog told the German newspaper Bild at the time.\n\nLindvik and Forgang claimed ignorance, insisting they never would have jumped had they known their suits were rigged. When their coaches backed them, the Norwegian ski jumpers received suspensions of just three months, enabling them to return in time for the 2025-26 World Cup season and the Olympics, where the men’s competition begins on Feb 9.\n\nThe penalty was harsher for Livelten, Brevik and Norway assistant coach Thomas Lobben, each of whom confessed to being part of the conspiracy. On January 15, an independent ethics panel backed the FIS’s request for a punishment strong enough to serve as a deterrent against future cheating, suspending the trio for 18 months apiece.\n\n“In (the panel’s) view, now is indeed the appropriate time to put down a clear marker to what is not acceptable,” the panel’s scathing ruling read.\n\nFor many in American ski jumping circles, the Norway cheating scandal entangled close friends. In 2022, USA Ski Jumping signed a formal partnership with the Norwegian national team for the current Olympic cycle to hold joint training camps and coaching clinics and to collaborate on sports science.\n\nWhile Johnson doesn’t condone what Norway did, he also bristles at how the Norwegians have become “the scapegoat for a much broader issue within our sport.”\n\n“There has been a lot of hypocrisy from other nations,” Johnson said. “I don’t have any personal beef with any of these teams, but it was incredibly disappointing for me to see the response from some of the nations. I think everyone needs to take a look at themselves in the mirror. No one can say they were fully clean. They can only claim they are because they didn’t get caught.”\n\nEmbarrassed by the Norway scandal, FIS has since hired new equipment control coordinators and introduced sweeping reforms for the 2025-26 season. The changes include increased use of 3D scanners for pre-event body measurements, more precisely defined rules for how suits can be cut and shaped and more training for equipment controllers who oversee pre- and post-jump inspections.\n\nHarsher sanctions can now be issued for rules violations during 3D measurement or for the manipulation of a suit after it has passed inspection. Athletes disqualified for an equipment violation during a competition will receive a yellow card. A further transgression will result in a red card and suspension from the following event.\n\nTo Johnson and many others in the ski jumping community, the most notable change is one that has gone unmentioned in any FIS press release.\n\nIn the past, Johnson found that “it was much easier for FIS to discard or disqualify athletes from smaller nations because they didn’t have that political pull in the sport.” This year, highly ranked jumpers from prominent nations have been cited for equipment violations, athletes like Slovenia’s Timi Zajc, who was tied for second place at an event in Germany earlier this winter when he was disqualified for suit violation.\n\n“This year, it doesn’t seem to matter if you’re from Austria or Slovenia or Poland or the United States,” Johnson said. They’re enforcing the rules for everyone.”\n\nAs the world’s top ski jumpers prepare to showcase their talents on the Olympic stage this month, the obvious question is whether the competition will be fair. Will the threat of stricter rules and tougher punishments be enough to deter cheaters? Or will the pursuit of Olympic glory tempt some countries to try to skirt the rules?\n\n“Going into this Olympics, I have a lot more faith and trust in the system,” Johnson said, “but I still have my reservations that teams are really going to be in compliance, that they’re not going to be trying something new.”",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher Tanner Scott revealed he wants L.A. to re-sign reliever Evan Phillips.\n\nThe Dodgers non-tendered the veteran reliever earlier in the offseason due to the injury he sustained. Rather than paying him for a whole season — which he wouldn’t pitch much in after undergoing Tommy John surgery — the Dodgers released him into the free agency pool.\n\n“I do talk to Evan quite often,” Scott said at DodgerFest on Saturday. “I mean, we’ll see where it goes. I like the guy and hope he comes back.”\n\nPhillips and Scott had history before the Dodgers, playing together on the Baltimore Orioles from 2018-20 and reuniting after the Dodgers signed Scott ahead of 2025.\n\nPhillips pitched just seven games for the Dodgers last season before his injury, but had a fantastic run to kick off the year. He didn’t allow a run through 5.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe Dodgers will certainly consider bringing Phillips back, as he is a great weapon to have in the bullpen.\n\nHe had a 2.22 ERA through 201 appearances with the Dodgers, and never allowed a run for the Dodgers in the postseason. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman addressed the idea of bringing him back earlier in the offseason.\n\n“We had a number of back and forth discussions with Evan and his free agent,” Friedman said. ” It is challenging with him coming off surgery so he is going to take some time and look to sign after he throws off the mound when his rehab allows. Evan has been a big part of our past success and we will continue the conversation about bringing him back. We respect that he is taking this time to decide what is best for him and his family.”\n\nEvery team in baseball could use an arm like Phillips, and the Dodgers would likely have a leg up on the rest of the league if they were to move for the right-hander later in the season.\n\nThe post Tanner Scott Wants Dodgers to Bring Back Free Agent Reliever appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "Days before Super Bowl LX, the Seattle Seahawks suddenly have an injury concern on the defensive side of the football\n\nStandout rookie safety Nick Emmanwori, a critical component of the Seahawks secondary and a contender for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, injured his ankle on Wednesday during practice ahead of Super Bowl LX. According to the pool practice report, Emmanwori was “limited in practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury that he suffered during practice.”\n\nAs the report notes, Emmanwori “walked off the field on his own shortly before 4 p.m. Several players and coaches went over to comfort him before he left.”\n\nAsked about the situation after practice, Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald stated that the safety “had an ankle today, we brought him in to look at it, and we’ll kind of go from here and figure out what are the next steps?”\n\nThe rookie safety is a key contributor to Seattle’s defense, the top scoring unit in the NFL. He has lined up all over the field for the Seahawks, spending most of his time down in the box but he has also seen time in the slot, on the outside, and even as a deep safety. His ability to be a stout defender against the run while holding up in coverage allows Seattle to rely on their sub defensive packages, while still being able to slow down opposing rushing attacks.\n\nHe was spotted walking under his own power into the team hotel following practice, but with a noticeable limp:\n\nPlease be alright Nick pic.twitter.com/8TUnAuiqy1\n\n— ᴅᴏxx ⚡️ (@new_era72) February 5, 2026\n\nHis health will be a huge story to follow ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\nUpdate (Thursday evening): Emmanwori did not practice on Thursday due to the ankle injury:\n\nS Nick Emmanwori did not practice because of his ankle injury. https://t.co/J7upYXE0Ne\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 6, 2026",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are (sort of) getting healthier ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\nRobert Spillane, who has been dealing with an ankle injury that not only contributed to him missing four games at the conclusion of the regular season but caused him to exit early during an AFC Championship victory over the Denver Broncos, returned to practice for the first time in two weeks on Thursday.\n\nHarold Landry III, who returned to practice this week after previously missing time with a knee injury, saw his status go the other way as he was once again sidelined.\n\nSpillane has insisted that he’ll be ready to go for the Super Bowl, doubling down despite conflicting words over the last couple of days. Landry, who did not play in the conference championship game, said he was confident in his ability to play earlier this week, though missing practice after previously returning isn’t a great sign.\n\nDrake Maye, who suffered a shoulder injury during that same game, was previously listed as a limited participant on the injury report but remained a full participant for the second consecutive day.

    "title": "BYU’s defense is to blame for 3 consecutive losses. What’s gone wrong?",
    "description": "Since the start of Big 12 play, the Cougars have been among the league’s worst defensive squads.",
    "fullText": "BYU’s offense did its job Wednesday night.\n\nYes, the Cougars turned the ball over too much, but they also shot 50% from the field, 43% from 3-point range and scored 92 points, which is all typically more than enough offensive firepower to capture road wins in the Big 12.\n\nBut instead of picking up a much-needed, stabilizing Quad 1 victory at Oklahoma State, BYU found itself on the wrong end of a memorable 99-92 upset, as the Cougars’ defense completely whiffed against the Cowboys.\n\nBYU offered little resistance against the Cowboys, who drove downhill all night to score 52 points in the paint — something a frustrated Kevin Young repeatedly mentioned to reporters following the loss, and an increase of more than 20 points from BYU’s previous season average of paint points allowed.\n\nIn the second half alone, Oklahoma State scored 58 points at a blistering average of 1.57 points per possession. Every time the Cowboys had the ball after halftime, they ended up 1.57 points richer, with BYU only stopping them 24.3% of the time.\n\nAccording to the defensive analytics provided by StatBroadcast, neither AJ Dybantsa nor Richie Saunders, two typically solid defenders, recorded a single defensive stop against Oklahoma State. Every time the Cowboys targeted Dybantsa or Saunders, they scored.\n\nBYU’s remaining starters weren’t much better on the defensive end. When Rob Wright III, Kennard Davis Jr. and Keba Keita were on the floor, Oklahoma State averaged 153.4, 148.8 and 146.8 points per 100 possessions each, respectively.\n\n“Our defense, it was terrible,” Young said after the loss. “They had 52 points in the paint. They scored at will. We couldn’t keep anyone in front of us, and it was just a layup fest.”\n\nYoung later added, “We couldn’t guard the ball. We got too spread out. That’s way too many, you know, 52 points in the paint, it’s not good, right? And then attention to detail, that’s something that our team has struggled with ... but more than anything, just our one-on-one defense was abysmal.”\n\nWednesday’s letdown was the loudest example of BYU’s most troubling recent trend — a widespread defensive plunge.\n\nAs noted by broadcaster Greg Wrubell on X, the Cougars ranked No. 17 nationally in KenPom’s defensive efficiency metric back on Jan. 5. Just a month later, BYU has plummeted 25 spots to No. 42.\n\nBYU's KenPom offensive and defensive efficiency ratings on--\n\nJan. 5:\n10th AdjO\n17th AdjD\n\nFeb. 5:\n10th AdjO\n42nd AdjD\n\n— Greg Wrubell (@gregwrubell) February 5, 2026\n\nBeing the country’s 42nd-best defensive team may appear fine on paper, especially considering BYU ranked No. 82 at the end of last season. But the Cougars’ defensive results since the start of Big 12 play, which spurred the 25-spot slide, are cause for major concern.\n\nBYU is allowing Big 12 opponents to score 83.4 points per game, ranking 13th out of 16 teams in the conference. The only teams behind the Cougars are Kansas State, Arizona State, and Utah, who are all far outside of the NCAA Tournament conversation.\n\nFor comparison, top-10-ranked Houston, Iowa State and Arizona are all allowing Big 12 averages of 63.3, 67.7 and 71.9 points each, respectively — quite the gap from BYU’s 83.4 mark.\n\nIn their current three-game losing skid, the Cougars have surrendered 275 points (91.67 per game), with Arizona, Kansas and Oklahoma State combining to make 61.9% of their 2-point baskets.\n\nDuring BYU's 3 game losing streak, they have allowed opponents to shoot 61.9% from 2 point range.\n\nFor the entire season, the worst defense in 2pt% allowed in the nation is 62.5% by Chicago St.\n\n61.9% would be the 2nd worst in the nation.\n\n— CougarStats (@CougarStats) February 5, 2026\n\nBYU has to figure out a way to get stops, disrupt opposing rhythm and guard without fouling so often. The Cougars can’t rely on their offense to bail them out of shootouts every night — look at how that’s gone the past three games.\n\nDuring nonconference play, BYU enjoyed various flashes of defensive brilliance, albeit against lesser competition than the current Big 12 gauntlet.\n\nThe Cougars don’t need newfound brilliance, but if they can’t quickly figure out some sort of improvement to yield defensive respectability, their postseason ceiling becomes dramatically lower. Defense will determine how far BYU plays into March.\n\n“... We’re just going through it right now,” Young said. “We’ve just got to lick our wounds and just work, work, work and figure out what each guy individually can do to help the team right now.”",

    "fullText": "A Los Angeles Superior Court judge denied UCLA’s attempt to force a lawsuit over its potential move from the Rose Bowl into arbitration.\n\nIn a ruling issued Tuesday, Judge Joseph Lipner rejected UCLA’s motions to compel arbitration and stay the case, clearing the way for the breach-of-contract lawsuit to proceed in court.\n\n“The court DENIES the motions to compel arbitration. The Court DENIES the motions to stay proceedings,” according to the minute order. “UCLA also filed a motion to quash deposition subpoenas and enter a protective order. The Court DENIES UCLA’s motion to quash.”\n\nIn addition to UCLA’s request, the judge also denied similar arbitration motions filed by Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC and StadCo LA LLC, both entities affiliated with SoFi Stadium.\n\nThe City and the Rose Bowl Operating Company welcomed the decision, saying the ruling clears the way for the case to move forward in court.\n\n“For more than forty years, UCLA has benefited from a unique partnership with the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl, a partnership that was memorialized in a carefully negotiated contract that extends through 2044,” the statement said. “That agreement was the foundation for hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer-backed investments made to modernize and preserve one of the most iconic sports venues in the world. In return, UCLA made a clear and binding commitment to play its home football games at the Rose Bowl through 2044 and expressly waived any right to terminate that commitment early, and we are confident that a court will agree.”\n\nUCLA is currently in a legal battle with the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Operating Company. The city and the company sued the prestigious university to prevent the university from breaking its lease. UCLA is under contract with the Rose Bowl through 2044.\n\nThe post Judge Forces Arbitration in Multi-Million Dollar Rosel Bowl Lawsuit appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "With the transfer portal window now closed, the full picture of roster movement is clear. Many programs saw heavy losses because of coaching changes. Others dealt with exits due to playing time or system changes. Some schools managed the damage quickly. Others now face long rebuilds. Here is a breakdown of the schools with the most transfer portal departures. (Via CFB)\n\nCal fired Justin Wilcox and hired Tosh Lupoi from Oregon. That move triggered roster turnover. A total of 35 players entered the portal. The Bears kept their most important player in quarterback Jaron Kaewe Sagapolutele. He impressed as a freshman in 2025. Cal added 31 new transfers to stabilize the roster. Keeping the starting quarterback helped limit the impact.\n\nAuburn made a coaching change by firing Hugh Freeze. That decision caused major exits. The biggest loss was wide receiver Cam Coleman, who transferred to Texas. Other departures included Kayin Lee, Kensley Louidor Faustin, Horatio Fields, Amaris Williams, Xavier Chaplin and Malik Blocton. New coach Alex Golesh rebuilt quickly. He added 39 transfers, including 13 from USF. Quarterback Byrum Brown followed Golesh and is expected to lead the offense.\n\nFlorida State finished 5-7 in 2025 and placed 13th in the ACC. That season led to heavy movement. A total of 36 players entered the portal. Key exits included Earl Little Jr., Lawayne McCoy, Randy Pittman, Edwin Joseph and Justin Cryer. Mike Norvell responded by adding 22 transfers. Quarterback Ashton Daniels and running back Tre Wisner are set to lead the offense in 2026.\n\nMichigan State fired Jonathan Smith and hired Pat Fitzgerald. The coaching change caused 37 players to leave. Losses included Makhi Frazier, Aisea Moa, Chance Rucker, Aidan Chiles and Nick Marsh. Quarterback Alessio Milivojevic stayed and finished the season as the starter. The Spartans added 28 transfers. Wide receiver KK Smith and center Trent Fraley were key additions.\n\nArkansas fired Sam Pittman during the season and hired Ryan Silverfield from Memphis. That move led to 38 portal entries. Jaheim Singletary and Jac’Qawn McRoy were among the top departures. Silverfield rebuilt fast by adding 41 new transfers. Arkansas ranked eighth in the On3 Team Transfer Portal Rankings. New players included Steven Soles from Kentucky and Jasper Parker from Michigan.\n\nMississippi State also had 38 players leave. Jeff Lebby enters his third year as head coach. The Bulldogs lost several starters, including Jayvin James to Alabama and Zack Owens to Missouri. Jayven Williams transferred to BYU, while Kedrick Bingley Jones went to Alabama. Quarterback KaMario Taylor stayed and is expected to start in 2026. Mississippi State added 24 transfers, including seven offensive linemen. Wide receiver Marquis Johnson joined from Missouri.\n\nWest Virginia continued reshaping its roster under Rich Rodriguez. The Mountaineers lost 44 players to the portal and added 34 new ones. Quarterback Michael Hawkins transferred from Oklahoma and is expected to start. Experience was lost on the offensive line with Donovan Haslam heading to Tennessee. Wide receiver Cam Vaughn transferred to Miami. The program remains in rebuild mode.\n\nPenn State fired James Franklin in October. That move opened the door for mass departures in January. A total of 46 players left the program. New coach Matt Campbell kept linebacker Tony Rojas and cornerback Daryus Dixson. Several players followed Franklin to Virginia Tech. Twelve Penn State players transferred to Blacksburg, including quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer and tight end Luke Reynolds.\n\nIowa State saw 54 players enter the portal after Matt Campbell left for Penn State. His exit ended a long era with the Cyclones. Top players who left included Rocco Becht, Benjamin Brahmer, Marcus Neal and Jeremiah Cooper. Campbell brought 23 Iowa State players with him to Penn State. Jimmy Rogers was hired from Washington State to replace him. He added 48 new players to stop the losses. Replacing that level of talent will be difficult.\n\nOklahoma State led the nation with 64 transfer portal exits. Mike Gundy was fired three games into the 2025 season. That move opened a 30 day portal window for players. A second window in January raised the total even higher. New coach Eric Morris arrived from North Texas and rebuilt the roster fast. He added 54 new transfers. Quarterback Drew Mestemaker and running back Caleb Hawkins followed him from North Texas. Notable losses included Wendell Gregory, Jaylen Lloyd and Noah McKinney.\n\nThe transfer portal changed the direction of many programs this cycle. Coaching changes caused the largest waves of exits. Oklahoma State and Iowa State were hit the hardest. Penn State and West Virginia also saw major losses. Other teams balanced departures with strong transfer classes. How well these schools recover will shape the 2026 season.\n\nThe post Schools with highest college football transfer portal departures appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — On Jan. 9, freestyle skier Eileen Gu posted on Instagram a “Day in my life” video commemorating the one-month countdown to the Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\nGlimpses of Gu brushing her teeth, eating breakfast, riding a ski lift, practicing tricks on a giant airbag, cooling down with a 5 kilometer run, talking to the media, completing a doping test and reading a book while she’s in a hyperbaric chamber were all stuffed into a 29-second Instagram reel.\n\nWithin 10 days, it generated more than a million views.\n\nSo it’s probably no coincidence that Gu, the American-born dual gold medal winner who chose to compete for China in 2019, was the fourth highest-paid female athlete of 2025.  According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of her $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nWhile sponsorships have always been crucial to the earning potential of Olympic athletes, who generally aren’t raking in huge sums of prize money, financial success no longer hinges on whose image lands on the Wheaties box.\n\nNow most of it happens on social media, where the line between Olympic athletes and influencers has been blurred — usually to the benefit of their pocketbooks as this Winter Games draws close.\n\n“The number of Olympians who have become more popular and made money in the Olympics has grown exponentially,” said Doug Shabelman, the CEO of Chicago-based Burns Entertainment, a firm that matches celebrities and athletes with marketing opportunities. “Now everybody, whether you win or lose, can be an influencer. Before you had to win gold medals, you had to do something special. Now social media has leveled the playing field, and the marketability of these athletes is 365 days a year.”\n\nGu is among the handful of Olympic athletes at the top of that food chain along with the likes of Simone Biles and Lindsey Vonn. It’s no surprise given Gu’s success in the sport and her endorsement potential in China, which likely played at least some role in her choice to represent her mother’s homeland rather than the more crowded American market.\n\nBut you don’t need to be the most successful winter sports athlete in a country of 1.4 billion people to leverage social media for endorsement dollars.\n\nTake freestyle skier Alex Ferreira. Once a year, he puts on a prosthetic mask, a gray wig and fake facial hair to make him look like a skiing has-been, goes to the slopes with a film crew, talks trash to younger skiers and shocks crowds as executes Olympic-level tricks.\n\nThe character, “Hot Dog Hans,” was inspired by Kyrie Irving’s portrayal of streetball legend “Uncle Drew.” Though it started out as a one-time gag a few years ago, Ferreira realized within 15 minutes of his first day in costume that it was something he could draw out into a multi-episode series of short films.\n\nThe full Hans skits now generate hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube, with the clips drawing millions on Instagram. And while it may have started as a fun distraction, it has become a high-profile example of how an Olympic athlete who is not particularly famous in the mainstream world can find a niche that leads to dollars.\n\n“We’re in this day and age where your main job is to compete, learn new tricks, go to these contests and win them,” Ferreira said. “But the other half of the business is gaining sponsors, so you need to create content as well. I’m a professional skier, but I’m also an influencer in a way. Basically, when you think the job is over, you have to get back and get on the computer and start cranking out content. When I started, it was much less than that.”\n\nThough the content game does require more time outside of traditional training and media obligations, it keeps many athletes in the mix during those four-year gaps between Olympics when they don’t get as much mainstream attention. And then, once an Olympics begins, you never really know what’s going to hit.\n\nOne of the biggest social media stars of the Paris Games was Henrik Christiansen, a Norwegian swimmer who did not finish better than 20th in any of his three events but went viral for videos about chocolate chip muffins in the athletes’ village. The “Muffin Man” now has more than 500,000 followers on TikTok and is still trading off the joke. One of his most popular recent videos from last October shows him whisking cocoa powder into a mixing bowl trying to replicate a recipe he’s watching on television.\n\n“I’m 56, and our generation, we still look at it like, ‘We want to see the winners and the great stories,’” Shabelman said. “But a different generation has different things they’re more interested in, and there are so many different avenues now, so many different ways to get your story and your personality out that it changed the game in a big way on the marketing side.\n\n“It’s not just the winners anymore. Engagement on social media with fans is so important to marketers because they don’t just want to see how many people look at videos. They want to see who’s engaging, who has that accessibility and who has something that other people don’t.”\n\nIt also helps that Olympic sports, particularly in the winter, have great visuals that lend themselves to social media. Whether it’s a striking costume being worn by a figure skater, a gravity-defying trick on a snowboard or simply the backdrop of a snow-capped mountain, Winter Olympians don’t necessarily have to stretch far outside their comfort zone to create eye-catching content.\n\nMany of Gu’s posts, for instance, have nothing to do with sports and fall more into the category of modeling or a peek into the lifestyle of a rich, young woman who travels the world like a true celebrity and hangs out with other celebrities. They are slickly produced and undeniably targeted to demographics that are not watching the Freestyle Ski World Cup.\n\n“We are still a society that does value attractiveness and different elements that we all have come to know about people who are endorsers,” Shabelman said. “But then you also add on being really good at building great content, you have a lot of (famous) friends you might tag in a post and that might get you even more followers.”\n\nThough not every Olympic athlete handles their social media as seriously or professionally as Gu, it’s now just a fact of life that maximizing endorsement potential — which is what keeps many of these Olympians going in sports that don’t offer big prize money — often runs through Instagram or TikTok.\n\n“Content creation is what’s happening right now,” snowboarder Jamie Anderson said. “It’s bigger than almost anything. There are YouTubers making more money than NFL players. So it really doesn’t matter what I think about it, it’s happening. You kind of have to move with the waves. It’s definitely the future of marketing and sports. Times have changed quick.”",

    "description": "Listen to Falcons president Matt Ryan indirectly prove why the Bears are being cheated out of compensatory picks for Ian Cunningham.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears have seen several departures in the front office and coaching staff this offseason, including assistant general manager Ian Cunningham taking the Atlanta Falcons' GM job.\n\nIt's a departure several years in the making as Cunningham was always primed for a promotion, and the consolation prize for Chicago was always going to be two third-round compensatory picks (one for two consecutive NFL drafts). But, at least right now, the Bears aren't slated to receive comp picks for Cunningham given Matt Ryan is the Falcons' President of Football Operations and Cunningham wouldn't be the main guy in charge.\n\nBut from everything that we've heard, Cunningham would be the guy steering the ship in Atlanta, which means Chicago should be receiving comp picks following his loss (via the Rooney Rule). But don't take it from me. Hear it straight from the mouth of Ryan, who explains that Cunningham will be in charge of the roster, which indicates a promotion and would warrant compensatory picks.\n\n#Falcons president Matt Ryan says GM Ian Cunningham will be the one driving the ship and in charge when it comes to the draft and free agency.\n\n(🎥 @NFLonCBS) pic.twitter.com/i9jg4OKM1K\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) February 5, 2026\n\n\"Ian's in charge,\" Ryan told NFL on CBS. \"Ian's in charge of (free agency and the NFL draft). I'm looking forward to learning about this. I said it the other day in Ian's presser, I've never sat in a draft meeting. Monday's going to be the first time I'm sitting in a draft meeting, so I've got a lot to learn. Sitting, observing, being a fly on the wall. If there's something Ian has a question about or something I can help with, I'm all ears and I'm happy to share my opinion. But Ian is driving this boat, and he is the one leading us moving forward.\"\n\nThe NFL typically awards compensatory picks in early-to-late March, so nothing is official right now. And if the Bears want to appeal the league's potential stance on no comp picks for Cunningham, this video of Ryan describing how Cunningham will indeed be running the Falcons would certainly help Chicago's case.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Matt Ryan's comments prove Bears are getting cheated out of comp picks",

    "fullText": "Yongin FC may be new to the K League stage, but they appear ready to upset the old guard. Backed by a city hall with deep pockets, Yongin have snapped up several big-name free agents. Is this a recipe for success, or are Yongin about to become an expensive retirement home?\n\nThe most important thing to understand is that Yongin FC are a brand-new club. They have never played a competitive match of football. Yongin are a K League 2 side because the local city hall applied for membership and met the minimum requirements set out by the governing body.\n\nThey boast a training centre and a modern 35,000-capacity stadium that has already hosted international football, AFC Champions League fixtures, and K League matches. Not to mention, they have assembled a playing squad dripping with experience.\n\nFormer Gwangju striker Gabriel returns to Korea after an unsuccessful spell in Japan. At 24, the Brazilian forward is at an ideal age, especially given his prior K League experience. He scored eight goals and provided five assists in 33 matches during the 2024 season. The powerful striker has the physique and attributes to excel in K League 2.\n\nAside from his military service with Sangmu, Kim Bo-sub has been with Incheon United since his teens. A two-time K League 2 champion, he has over 200 appearances across multiple positions. Korean clubs value versatile, two-footed players, and Kim fits that mould perfectly.\n\nKim Min-woo will aim to bring all his experience to Mireu Stadium.\n\nKim Min-woo is another highly experienced, multi-position free agent to sign on for the Yongin project. He also brings 23 Korea Republic caps, along with experience in Japan, China, and domestically with Suwon Bluewings and Ulsan HD. However, he failed to make a significant impact after returning to Suwon last summer.\n\nWhen Portuguese goalkeeper Emanuel Novo signed on New Year’s Day, he did something no foreign goalkeeper had done in the 21st century: he registered with a K League club. The 26-year ban on foreign goalkeepers is officially over. Novo has played in Portugal, Saudi Arabia, and Romania, and will face competition from former Incheon United keeper Hwang Seong-min.\n\nAt 37, Shin Jin-ho’s best days may be behind him, but he can still have a very positive impact on the squad. When players gather for the first time, they will see a midfielder with 430 career appearances, two K League 1 titles, and AFC Champions League experience.\n\nAside from a stint in the Arabian Gulf, Shin has represented Pohang, Ulsan, FC Seoul, Incheon United, and Sangmu. He arrives from Seongnam with a K League 2 trophy and proof that he can still perform at this level.\n\nTwenty-one-year-old striker Lee Gyu-dong joins on loan from K League 1 champions Jeonbuk Hyundai. Born in neighbouring Suwon, he spent 2024 on loan with the Bluewings.\n\nLee Gyu-dong represents Jeonbuk U-18.\n\nInterestingly, that period coincided with Suwon’s temporary move to Yongin due to pitch repairs at Big Bird. As a result, Lee is already familiar with Mirue Stadium, having played five matches there. He scored twice for Suwon as their promotion bid ended early, and his impact in Yongin should be stronger.\n\nAre Yongin primed for an immediate playoff push?\n\nWhen Ko Jeong-woon guided Gimpo FC from the semi-professional K3 League into K League 2 in 2022, expectations were low. Gimpo had always been competitive in K3—never champions, but regularly finishing in the top three—yet the step up was seen as too big for a small, city-owned club on the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.\n\nInstead, Gimpo exceeded expectations. Their debut season ended with an eighth-place finish (out of 11), followed by a heartbreaking playoff defeat to Gangwon FC the following year.\n\nProgress has since stalled, but Yongin appear to be attempting something similar. “Very, very rich” was how one rival club official described Yongin to me. 2026 is the perfect time to enter K League 2 with lofty ambitions. Two teams earn automatic promotion, with another qualifying via the playoffs. A fourth promotion place is also possible, depending on where Gimcheon Sangmu finish in K League 1.\n\nLooking across the 17 squads, Yongin are arguably a top-five team on paper. What a story that would be.\n\nIt isn't Yongin's fault, but there is'new club fatigue' amongst K League 2 fans. On the surface, Yongin offer nothing we haven't seen before - a new club with a very small fan base, an oversized stadium with a running track, and a club based in Gyeonggi, a region of the country now completely over-represented at this level.\n\nWhat sets Yongin apart is their ambition. Every club will talk about winning the league, earning promotion and eventually to qualify for continental football. It all feels a little hallow. Yongin are different. They recruited Anyang's team manager, who has experience building a squad to escape K League 2. And, aside from the players mentioned above, 34-year-old Suk Hyun-jun is also in the squad.\n\nSuk is a 15-times Korean international, who's played for Ajax Amsterdam, FC Porto, and Al-Ahli. Suk's time is coming to an end, but look out for another striker, Jardel, who has been capped by Guinea-Bissau, and former Seoul E-Land defender Kwak Yun-ho. Yongin's ambitions are clear. Can they break the understandable new club fatigue?",

    "fullText": "Open Source Policy Summit 2026 European tech leaders are waking up to the risk of the US simply turning off their IT services.\n\nThe Register FOSS desk attended the 2026 Open Source Policy Summit in Brussels last week. The tone of the event was distinctly different to that of the same event three years ago. We encountered new notes of determination, expressed forcefully by Finnish MEP Aura Salla:\n\nIn case some listeners didn't see the problem with that:\n\nThe US could turn us off inside one hour.\n\nThe Reg has quoted Salla before. She has been making this point for a while, with increasing directness, but just over a year into Donald Trump's second term as president of the United States, it continues to grow in importance.\n\nAs we covered in October last year, one of the leaders in this effort is the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which switched away from Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook to Open-Xchange and Mozilla Thunderbird. The head of Schleswig's Chancellery and Minister for Digital Transformation, Dirk Schrödter, gave a keynote saying: \"We are free; now everyone must follow.\"\n\nHe noted that although it had saved the state government money, it wasn't without cost. The process had required significant expenditure, but that was good for European businesses that had helped the state in its transition. We liked his summary of the status quo:\n\nWe're in the habit of exporting public money out of Europe, and importing dependencies.\n\nIn a later panel on \"Open Source and Economic Security,\" he noted that digitization in Germany can be difficult, partly due to its state-level IT management and strategy. He recommended a pragmatic approach:\n\nDon't look at the big mountain in the distance. Look at concrete steps you can take to start.\n\nSo, for now, Schleswig is still running Windows, but has replaced Microsoft Office with LibreOffice on \"nearly 100 percent\" of machines. It's using Thunderbird for email, calendars, and contacts, talking to Open-Xchange on the back end, alongside the Matrix-based Element for chat and Nextcloud for collaboration.\n\nOther speakers on the same panel made the point that FOSS doesn't mean free of charge, but spending money with European companies means benefits to European economies – keeping more of the EU's vast public spending inside the EU. As Leontina Sandu put it: \"We spend 0.4 percent of EU money on software licenses. It's a lot – public sector spending is half of the EU's GDP.\" Blogger Markus Sandelin estimates that the EU spends over €200 million a year just on Microsoft 365 licenses.\n\nCompanies working on open source in Europe, of course, stand to profit significantly from this. Thales's Daniel Glazman put it more bluntly: \"Open source will succeed when we forget the word 'cost.'\" IBM's Jochen Friedrich shared a pithy one-line summary of how Europe needs to transform its economies away from old heavy industries and into open \n\nThe Eclipse Foundation's Mike Milinkovich echoed Salla's earlier point that Microsoft effectively had a kill switch over Office 365, but pointed out that the company has more such controls: it also owns GitHub. As he put it, \"more or less every company and organization in Europe pulls from GitHub, because it uses JavaScript and Maven, so this applies to them too.\"\n\nPortuguese professor Mario Campolargo flipped the equation around. Any part of the EU paying for software should be sharing the code it's paying for:\n\nIf the money is public, the code should be public.\n\nOf course, this isn't just a European problem. It applies just as much to the nearly 200 countries of the United Nations. A short item, oddly described as an \"intervention,\" talked about the upcoming UN Open Source Week 2026 and the UN Open Source Principles – including that the city of Barcelona just adopted them.\n\nTo most people working with FOSS, they probably seem simple and reasonable, but having the UN on board adds considerable clout, and spelling them out is the sort of thing that reassures technophobic politicians:",

Build whatever you like, from your next startup to an alternative Counter-Strike. Sign up and build your first app in minutes\nGPT 5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6 shipped within minutes of each other. How well do they compare building a multiplayer Counter-Strike?\nWe tried and found out. Here's how the gameplay feels:\n\nAnd if you're curious, you can play it yourself:\n\nGPT 5.3 Codex's attempt: https://53strike.vercel.app/\nClaude Opus 4.6's attempt https://46strike.vercel.app/\n\nWe have a full recording of us building it here.\nHere's what surprised us:\nBoth models were a leap over any previous generation\nYou can compare the results with our last benchmark. These models made much more realistic maps on the first try. Their weapons were better. And they got much more right on the first shot. Codex had some issues with accounting for HP under respawns, and Claude has some issues spawning inside obstacles. But a simple paste got them fixing it. At no point did they get stuck and require guidance.\nGPT 5.3 Codex was much faster than Claude\nIn just about every prompt GPT 5.3 Codex finished in about half the time. This could be because of the harness: We noticed Claude Code did much more upfront research than Codex.\nClaude Opus 4.6 performed better on 5/6 prompts\nBut perhaps the upfront research came to good use, because Claude Opus 4.6 beat out GPT 5.3 Codex on all prompts but one (and the last one was a tie).\n\nGPT 5.3 CodexClaude Opus 4.6FrontendBoxes + Physics🥈🥇Gun + Creativity🥈🥇Sounds + Animations🥈🥇BackendMultiplayer🥈🥇Maps🥈🥇Bonus🤝🤝\nClaude drew more interesting maps. Claude made a nicer weapon. The gameplay UI was much nicer on Claude's first try.\nBoth models struggled a bit with physics\nAt this point, neither model had issues drawing out the UI, setting up the backend, or getting caught up in bugs from three.js. The frontier now seems to be about physics.\nFor example, Claude generated maps where players could end up stuck. Here's Claude's \"inferno valley\" and \"nuke zone\" produced 4-wall obstacles in the center:\n\nThere would be no way for users to leave. Codex also had trouble with direction. The enemy's \"point of view\" was coming out from the back of their had, rather than the front.\nWith both models you could shoot through obstacles. Claude Opus 4.6 at least made it so you couldn't walk through the obstacles -- but with Codex you could.\nWith either one, it was fun to build and play!",

    "description": "Docker ships with an undocumented API for spawning isolated microVMs. Here's how to use it for more than just AI agents.",
    "fullText": "Docker ships with an undocumented API for spawning microVMs. We reverse-engineered it and built the open-source Sandbox Agent SDK to allow orchestrating coding agents inside of them.\n\nDocker & containers are the standard for how we’ve been running backends. Recently, more workloads have been moving to sandboxes for untrusted code execution, which Docker is not suitable for.\n\nWith the launch of Docker Sandboxes, Docker quietly shipped an undocumented API for microVMs that can power sandboxes.\n\nThis looks promising to be a unified way of managing sandboxes on your own infrastructure using microVMs, just like Docker did for containers 10 years ago. (Today it only supports macOS/Windows. Requires nested virtualization.)\n\nDocker Sandboxes (launch post) are Docker’s solution for running AI coding agents safely. Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini need to run arbitrary code, install packages, and modify files. MicroVMs let them run --dangerously-skip-permissions without being dangerous.\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a glorified docker run command, but under the hood Docker is using a completely different technology: microVMs.\n\nContainers are what most developers know and love when they run docker run. They provide basic file system, network, and process isolation between the host machine.\n\nHowever, it’s a common misconception that containers are good enough for running untrusted code (AI agents, user-submitted scripts, multi-tenant plugins).\n\nIn order to achieve better security, products like AWS Lambda, Fly.io, and most sandbox providers use microVMs for lightweight virtual machines with separate kernels for better security. It’s lighter than a full virtual machine, but does not carry as much overhead. This is considered the gold standard of isolating user code. There are many other documents that better describe microVMs & Firecracker if you’d like to read more.\n\nThis is why Docker built Sandboxes on microVMs instead of containers while remaining compatible with Docker containers.\n\nThis opens up use cases that containers can’t safely handle:\n\ndocker sandbox run is strictly limited to Docker’s whitelisted agents: Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Kiro, and Cagent. It currently does not let you run your own Docker containers.\n\nSo naturally, I went down the rabbit hole to see if I could reverse engineer the underlying microVM API in order to run any code I’d like inside of sandboxes.\n\nDocker’s sandboxd daemon manages all of the virtual machines and listens on ~/.docker/sandboxes/sandboxd.sock.\n\nThe VM name follows the pattern {agent_name}-vm. socketPath is your per-VM Docker daemon, which we’ll use in the next step.\n\nNormally all containers share /var/run/docker.sock. Anyone with socket access can see and control every other container.\n\nSandboxes flip this. Each microVM gets its own Docker daemon at ~/.docker/sandboxes/vm/<name>/docker.sock for maximum isolation. Containers run like normal inside the microVM, but are completely isolated from the host and other VMs.\n\nTo target different daemons, we will need to override the Unix socket path using curl --unix-socket ... or docker --host unix://....\n\nNew VMs are completely isolated from the host, so we need to manually load images we’ve built into the VM.\n\nWe do this by building, archiving, and loading the image into the VM like this:\n\n$VM_SOCK is the socketPath from the earlier step.\n\nNow the fun part: we can finally run our image and work with it like any other Docker container.\n\nmicroVMs route outbound traffic through a filtering proxy at host.docker.internal:3128. Your container needs these env vars:\n\nThe proxy does man-in-the-middle on HTTPS (hence NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0) for network policy enforcement. For production use, install the CA certificate from ca_cert_path in the VM response instead of disabling TLS verification.\n\nWorkspace syncs at the same absolute path, so volume mounts just work:\n\nDocker Sandboxes require Docker Desktop 4.58+ on macOS or Windows. Linux is not supported since Docker Desktop uses platform-specific virtualization (Apple Virtualization.framework on macOS, Hyper-V on Windows).\n\nThe raw microVM API is powerful, but building a production agent orchestration system on top of it requires handling:\n\nWe built the Sandbox Agent SDK to handle all of this. It wraps the microVM API and provides a simple interface for spawning and interacting with AI coding agents:\n\nSee the full guide on deploying with Docker Sandboxes.\n\nDocker’s microVM API opens up secure isolation for any workload, not just the handful of agents Docker officially supports. Whether you’re building an AI coding assistant, running untrusted user code, or isolating multi-tenant plugins, the /vm API gives you the primitives to do it safely.\n\nThe API is undocumented and subject to change, but it works today on Docker Desktop 4.58+. If you’re building something with it, we’d love to hear about it.",

    "fullText": "Transfer of subjects of acclaimed film about inhumane prison conditions described as ‘straight-up retaliation’\n\nThe Alabama prison system has moved three well-known incarcerated activists who supported a 2022 prison strike and were featured in an Oscar-nominated documentary about the troubled system to isolated cells with little contact with others, family members and attorneys said.\n\nFamily members of the three men said they fear for their loved ones’ safety and are concerned the moves to solitary confinement are a form of retaliation for outspokenness about problems within the prison system. Robert Earl Council, Melvin Ray and Raoul Poole were transferred two weeks ago from their existing prisons to solitary confinement at the Kilby correctional facility outside Montgomery, their lawyers said. The transfers come as some groups have encouraged a new prison labor strike this year.\n\n“This is straight-up retaliation,” said Julie Sledd, who is close to Poole and spoke to the Associated Press about his situation. “They’ve all three been very involved in standing up for the rights of incarcerated citizens.”\n\nCouncil, Ray and Poole were featured in The Alabama Solution, a documentary about the state prison system that relied heavily on cellphone footage from inmates. The film has been nominated for an Academy Award in the documentary category.\n\nSledd said she had been able to talk to Poole once since the transfer and he told her the men are being held in separate cells on an isolated and closely guarded floor.\n\n“Since their arrival, the men have been cut off from contact with their families and are being held in isolation with no contact with other prisoners or prison staff except for a small group of guards and supervisors,” lawyers representing the three men said in a statement.\n\nThe attorneys said the prison system did not provide a reason for the move and said the restrictions “far exceed standard administrative segregation protocols”.\n\n“Given [the Alabama department of corrections’] decade-long documented history of excessive force against prisoners and its pattern of retaliation against these specific individuals – including a prior 2021 incident in which four guards nearly killed Robert Council – their attorneys fear for the activists’ safety and well-being,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe Alabama department of corrections cited security concerns as the reason the men were moved, but did not elaborate.\n\n“The transfer of inmates is based on intelligence that they are engaged in activity that is detrimental to the safety and security of the facilities and the public,” prison officials said in an statement emailed by a spokesperson, Kelly Betts.\n\nThe statement added that “all inmates are safe, secure and receiving regular meals and other services as needed”, and that they have had legal visits and phone service.\n\nEarnestine Council said on Wednesday that she had received little information about her son and had not been able to speak with him. Ann Brooks, Ray’s mother, said she had not been able to reach her son, although he was able to make one call to his brother.\n\n“I don’t know what is going to happen or what could happen,” Brooks said.\n\nThe moves come as some have pushed for a new prison labor strike this year similar to one in 2022 that drew national attention. Thousands of Alabama inmate workers went on strike that year, refusing to work in prison kitchens, laundries and factories to protest against conditions in the state lockups.\n\nSeveral inmates told the AP that prisons had recently reduced the amount of food and other items they can buy each week at the prison commissary, a move that could prevent items from being stockpiled ahead of any strike.\n\nThe prison system said in a statement that food service had been contracted out to a new vendor, Aramark, but did not elaborate.\n\n“We’re really concerned because they’ve had retaliation and abuse in response to all of their activism,” said Andrew Jarecki, director of The Alabama Solution.\n\n“It’s particularly ironic that these men who are incredibly brave – and frankly, scholars – and have learned the law and have been leaders and always observe nonviolent means of protest, are always met with violence by authorities.”",

    "fullText": "The Royal Government of Bhutan has moved over $22 million in BTC out of sovereign wallets over the past week alone, drawing attention from the crypto community.\n\nOne transaction, 5 days ago, was directly sent to addresses linked to market maker QCP Capital, Arkham data revealed. The moves align with Bhutan’s periodic sales of BTC since it began mining the crypto in 2019.\n\n“From our observations, Bhutan periodically sells BTC in clips of around $50M, with a particularly heavy period of selling around mid-late September 2025,” Arkham wrote.\n\nBesides, the Himalayan Kingdom’s crypto portfolio has gone down more than 70% from its $1.4 billion peak to $412 million, following market depreciation.\n\nPer Bitcoin Treasuries, Bhutan remains the seventh-largest government Bitcoin holder.\n\nBhutan has been mining Bitcoin since 2019 and saw more than $765 million in BTC profit.\n\n“They mined most of their BTC before the halving in 2024, and tapered heavily after that,” said the Arkham report. “This is because the cost to mine a single Bitcoin roughly doubled, which made mining less efficient.”\n\nFurther, the nation seems to have mined 8,200 BTC in 2023 alone, making it the heaviest mining year. It approximately mined 1800 BTC in 2022 and 300 BTC in 2024.\n\nThe BTC transfers from the government wallet in the past week come after Bitcoin has been slumping to $70,000. The largest crypto has tumbled 7.36% over the last 24 hours, outpacing the broader crypto market’s 6.39% fall.\n\nDespite the heavy transfers, blockchain data analysts note that they are more likely to be internal reallocation or custodial arrangements rather than liquidation. The country’s wallet balances remain largely unchanged.\n\nBhutan has made similar mass wallet moves in the past without triggering market crashes.\n\nRead original story Bhutan Quietly Sells Over $22M in Bitcoin, Triggers Speculation Over Possible Sell-Offs by Sujha Sundararajan at Cryptonews.com",

    "fullText": "A defenseless toddler was almost run over — twice — after the child tumbled out of an SUV when the car door suddenly flew open.\n\nAccording to Fullerton, Calif., police, the vehicle was making a turn when the front passenger door opened and a 19-month-old baby fell onto the roadway. The mom, who’s been identified as Jacqueline Hernandez, 35, of La Habra, Calif., then stopped short, nearly causing the car behind her to rear-end her, per New York Post.\n\nA video released by police shows another car almost running over the tyke, but its driver managed to slam on the brakes just feet away from the baby.\n\nHernandez is then seen running around to the passenger side to pick up the child.\n\nPolice were only alerted to the incident when a witness came forward and reported it. The information enabled them to identify the mother. Hernandez was then arrested on suspicion of felony child abuse, the Fullerton police said in a statement.\n\nThe toddler was injured in the fall but was expected to make a full recovery after being treated at a hospital.\n\n“Why was the baby in the front seat, and not in a car seat in the back buckled up,” asked one commenter on Instagram.\n\nUnder California law, children under 2 need to be placed in a rear-facing car seat, and until age 8, children must ride in the back seat.\n\n“This made me sick to my stomach,” another viewer commented on Instagram. “So happy the baby will make a full recovery.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie’s Brother Issues New Emotional Plea for Missing Mom as First Ransom Deadline Passes\n\nPatrick Mahomes Sr. Reportedly Remains in Jail, Could Face 10-Year Sentence for Violating Probation\n\nKaroline Leavitt ‘Can’t Guarantee’ ICE Agents ‘Won’t Be Around a Polling Location’ During Elections\n\nThis story California Woman Arrested on Felony Child Abuse After 19-Month-Old Baby Tumbles Out of SUV first appeared on National Enquirer.

    "fullText": "Tech has been clobbered by a broad rotation taking place in 2026, and the latest sell-off in software stocks has only added to the pain. Yet, on the other end of that pain has been a $24 billion gain for short-sellers.\n\nThe software rout took off this week, but some of the biggest names in tech have been struggling all year, battling both micro and macro forces that have hurt demand for high-flying AI plays.\n\nFor short-sellers betting against these stocks, the last six weeks have been a windfall. A report from data analytics firm S3 Partners reveals that short-sellers have netted billions in paper profits as they bet tech would drop from nosebleed levels.\n\nThe firm noted that while short sellers have been betting against some of the biggest names in software all year, they have been increasing their bearish positions recently as conditions shifted and volatility surged.\n\n\"U.S. Software stocks have generated $24 billion in MTM PNL for short sellers YTD, while the market capitalization of the sector has declined by $1 trillion,\" the firm's report reads.\n\nS3 highlighted several software stocks that short sellers have been increasingly betting against\n\nOf the software stocks on the list, Microsoft stands out, the firm said, because of the way short-seller behavior around it has changed amid its sharp decline this year.\n\n\"Historically, MSFT behaves like a reversal stock, with shorts covering on the way down,\" S3 noted. \"Now it is trading like a momentum-driven, distressed name, with shorts increasing into weakness.\"\n\nWhile the AI trade has faced intensifying scrutiny lately, the firm sees the widespread bearish trade as specific to software stocks, as short interest in the overall Magnificent 7 and the Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, has been flat.\n\nS3 maintains, though, that hedge funds are focused on increasing their short positions in large-cap tech, even as many sector leaders have already logged big declines.\n\n\"Contagion is visible across short books, with AVGO and AMZN seeing short-interest increases of 15% and 10%, and AVGO down 10% YTD,\" he stated.",

    "description": "The lake scene between Sophie and Benedict in \"Bridgerton\" season 4 is changed from the book. Here's why that's a good thing.",
    "fullText": "Mr. Darcy and Anthony Bridgerton, please welcome Benedict Bridgerton to the \"emerging out of a lake\" hall of fame.\n\nThere are a few monumental scenes straight from the pages of Julia Quinn's books that fans demanded be included in the Netflix adaptation. You know the ones — remember the carriage scene from season three? Or the mirror scene that ended up being the longest sex scene in the show's (steamy) history? Or maybe you're more of a Kanthony fan, which means you were eagerly anticipating a certain bee sting.\n\nThis season's monumental scene was known by the fans as \"the lake scene.\" It's a big moment for Benedict (Luke Thompson) and Sophie (Yerin Ha), the leads of season four. They've fully warmed up to each other after a few days at My Cottage, and it's become difficult to ignore the simmering tension between them.\n\nSo, when Sophie accidentally comes upon a nude Benedict taking a swim in the lake in episode three … well, you can guess what happens next.\n\nIt would seem these two have decided to wade into deeper waters..for now. pic.twitter.com/3gvGiXkhXd\n\nBut it actually goes down quite differently in Quinn's book, \"An Offer From a Gentleman.\"\n\nIt's a short (but impactful) scene in the show.\n\nAfter recovering from a fever brought on by injuries he sustained while protecting Sophie's honor — long story — Benedict and Sophie are spending time at Benedict's (charming, if inaccurately named) My Cottage so he can recuperate.\n\nWhile taking a walk, Sophie accidentally spots a naked Benedict taking a swim in the lake. Of course, he promptly spots her and begins teasing her for ogling.\n\nBut it takes a turn when Sophie blurts out she \"can't help but notice\" Benedict, wherever he is. The two share a passionate kiss before Benedict backs away, apologizing.\n\nThe two then go their separate ways, with Benedict (as usual) being charmed by Sophie's awkwardness.\n\nThe lake scene occurs in chapter 11, about 40% of the way through the book — and it's a much longer encounter.\n\nFirst of all, the kiss is a lot more intense, lasts a lot longer, and has some more flirty banter, including Sophie accidentally calling Benedict by his first name (which he loves) and telling him that she doesn't normally do this kind of thing.\n\nWhere it gets a bit dicey, though, is that this is when Benedict asks Sophie to be his mistress after deducing that she's been lying about her parentage.\n\nAs she does when he makes this offer in episode four, Sophie says no. We don't know how Benedict will react to this refusal in the show, but we can be almost certain that it won't be what his literary counterpart does: Blackmail Sophie into working for his mother.\n\nYes, you read that right. When Sophie refuses to be Benedict's mistress, he tells her she can either work for Violet or he'll report her to the police for stealing from him.\n\nUnderstandably, Sophie is furious about this — and actually punches Benedict in the face when he says she's \"not being intelligent\" — but ultimately accepts the offer to work at Bridgerton House.\n\nOf the many changes \"Bridgerton\" showrunner Jess Brownell has made from the source material, this is one we're quite relieved about.\n\nIn the book, Benedict isn't trying to be slimy when he does this. Ultimately, he's trying to protect Sophie from having to navigate the world on her own (and he's basically accepted the fact that he loves her and can't live without her), but that doesn't make it any less icky to read.\n\nInstead, the show has actually leaned into the tricky power dynamic between Benedict, a member of the Ton, and Sophie, a maid. Soon after the lake scene in the show, he has a conversation with Mrs. Crabtree, one of the caretakers of his cottage, who warns him that the inherent power imbalance between him and Sophie means that a relationship between them can never truly be equal.\n\nIt's a surprising bit of reality from an otherwise fantastical show.\n\nThe mistress offer comes a bit later during what's been dubbed the \"staircase scene\" — a show invention — after Benedict has seen that a friend of his has a mistress he's truly fallen in love with, and, by all accounts, the two seem happy. Benedict is genuinely trying to make it work with Sophie as best as he can.\n\nBut we'll have to wait until part two on February 26 to see how Sophie responds.",

    "fullText": "With President Donald Trump standing awkwardly behind him, a Democratic congressman used his prayer at the National Prayer Breakfast to urge Trump to “think of families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nSpeaking at the bipartisan Washington, D.C., event on Thursday shortly after Trump gave a rambling address, Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) offered a prayer for “the future of this nation,” and asked God to “lead this president into greater levels of compassion.”\n\nNews: Minneapolis Mayor Shreds ‘Thoughts And Prayers’ Over School Shooting: Kids ‘Were Literally Praying’\n\nJackson, the son of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, said, “Today, we remind him that the lives of millions of people are in his hands, and that he has the power to turn mourning into dancing or to reduce the country into a cosmic elegy of chaos and suffering.”\n\nJackson continued by calling on Trump to be “mindful of the poor” and “be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening on farms in the Midwest, in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nHe added that “we are all Americans, all made in the image of God, and that none of us are free unless all of us have our freedoms protected.” (Watch video at the end of the story.)\n\nWhen the prayer finished, Trump shook Jackson’s hand and appeared to say, “Great words.”\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nDuring his address, the Republican president said he didn’t know “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”\n\nThe plea to Trump came amid weeks of chaos in Minnesota as a result of his administration’s immigration crackdown, with the president’s rhetoric helping to sow discord.\n\nPolitics: Hillary Clinton Pulls No Punches In Fiery Response To GOP Congressman\n\nThe president has baselessly accused the state of harboring thousands of violent undocumented immigrants, calling them the “worst of the worst.”\n\nAgainst a backdrop of protests against the influx, federal agents have shot dead two U.S. citizens ― 37-year-old Renee Good and Alex Pretti, also 37 ― in separate incidents.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it is scaling back immigration operations around Minnesota by withdrawing about 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal officers sent to the state.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News later that day, Trump admitted he could have adopted “a little bit of a softer touch” in the region.\n\nwow -- with Trump standing behind him, a man (not sure who he is) offers this prayer: \"We pray that he would be mindful of the poor and that he would be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.\" pic.twitter.com/toJk9vIboF\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter Setting Minneapolis Ablaze, Trump Now Appears Interested In Dampening The Flames\n\nJD Vance Won't Apologize For Amplifying Smears Against Alex Pretti\n\nTrump's Border Czar Announces 700 Immigration Officers To Immediately Leave Minnesota",

    "fullText": "Tesla is only a few months away from its planned Roadster demo, and it might be getting a fresh new logo to boot.\n\nThe automaker filed two new trademark applications on Tuesday with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. One of the filings shows a sleek design featuring three minimalist lines that appear to form a vehicle.\n\nThe second application is for the styling of the name. The company submitted protections for \"Roadster\" in an all-caps styling with a stretched shape and segmented letters.\n\nPer both filings, the logos haven't yet been used on commercial vehicles.\n\nTrademark attorney Josh Gerben wrote in a blog post that companies often file trademark applications on an \"intent to use basis\" ahead of a public launch.\n\n\"By filing early, Tesla locks in a nationwide priority date, preventing third parties from attempting to register the same or confusingly similar marks after the logos are publicly announced,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe electric-car maker ramped up work on the Roadster last summer, Business Insider previously reported. Designs for the Roadster that were seen by insiders last year showed a two-seater with butterfly doors. At the time, a source with knowledge of the issue said the vehicle was at least two to three years from production.\n\nElon Musk has hyped up the revamped Roadster over the past few months. He has said the vehicle will be able to fly.\n\nIn a January interview, Musk said \"if safety is your number one goal, don't buy the Roadster,\" adding that it would be the \"best of the last of the human-driven cars.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO said during the company's third-quarter earnings call that the new Roadster will be unveiled on April 1, joking that April Fools' Day will give him \"some deniability.\"\n\n\"I could say I was just kidding,\" he said.\n\nHe had previously said Tesla planned to unveil the vehicle by the end of 2025.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "I tried six brands of store-bought tater tots from Sonic, Ore-Ida, Cascadian Farm, McCain, Signature Select, and Alexia Foods to find the best ones.",
    "fullText": "Tater tots, potato puffs, potato rounds, potato barrels — these crispy, slightly snacks go by many names.\n\nThey've followed me from the middle-school cafeteria to late-night study sessions in college and always hit the spot.\n\nTo find the best, easy-to-make frozen tots, I reviewed the offerings from six brands: Sonic, Signature Select, Ore-Ida, Alexia Foods, McCain, and Cascadian Farm.\n\nFor consistency's sake, I bought the most basic flavor from each brand and followed each package's cooking instructions.\n\nHere's how I'd rank the store-bought tater tots from my least favorite. to my top pick.\n\nMy expectations for the Sonic tots were already low because I don't love the fast-food chain. However, even when I put my bias aside, they still disappointed me.\n\nI baked the tots at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 18 minutes. When I pulled them out of the oven, they looked crispy and brown.\n\nUnfortunately, the crispiness was all these tots had to offer.\n\nThough the outer texture was good, the tater tots didn't have much flavor. I thought the soft interior kind of just tasted like plain, undercooked potato.\n\nOre-Ida created the original Tater Tot and owns the trademark, so I expected the brand to set the standard for the rest of the potato-based snacks.\n\nI cooked them in the oven at 425 degrees for 25 minutes until golden brown.\n\nIf you love the thin, crispy fries at the bottom of a takeout bag, these tots are probably for you. They had the crispiest texture of all the brands I tested.\n\nBut even though they were supposedly seasoned according to the package, I didn't think these had much flavor. Compared to some of the others, they left something to be desired.\n\nI had high expectations for Cascadian Farm's organic spud puppies because I have enjoyed other frozen products from the brand.\n\nOut of the bag, these tots were a darker shade of brown than Sonic or Ore-Ida. The color only deepened when I baked them at 450 degrees for 18 minutes.\n\nThey almost felt and tasted like a lighter version of tater tots — they definitely weren't as greasy as some of the other brands I tried.\n\nThe spud puppies were decently crispy, but unfortunately, I found the flavor a little underwhelming.\n\nMcCain offers a quicker-cooking bag of frozen tots. I baked them at 425 degrees for 12 minutes.\n\nThey were less crispy than some of the others, but I still enjoyed the texture.\n\nDespite what the packaging said, the taters didn't appear to be heavily seasoned. When I tried them, though, I tasted a hint of onion.\n\nThe flavor almost reminded me more of a latke. Unfortunately, this is a tater-tot comparison, not a latke review; otherwise, I would've ranked these higher.\n\nAlexia Foods' seasoned tater tots have flavors listed on the packaging — roasted garlic, cracked black pepper, sour cream, and chives — so I was hopeful.\n\nI baked them in the oven at 425 degrees for 18 minutes. These puffs were crispy, herby, and had a good russet-potato flavor.\n\nWithout question, Alexia Foods ranked first on my list. The light garlic and pepper flavors set them apart from the other options.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 5, 2025, and most recently updated on February 5, 2026.",

    "title": "I asked an insider what went wrong at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post",
    "description": "After Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013, the billionaire was considered a model owner. Not anymore. I asked an insider what happened.",
    "fullText": "Lots of people are angry at Jeff Bezos because of the massive cuts he's ordered at his Washington Post. But a decade ago, Bezos was widely celebrated for his ownership of the Post, which he had bought for $250 million in 2013.\n\nUnder Bezos' ownership, the Post made huge investments in tech and staff. And readers loved the results — especially during the first Trump era, when the paper turned profitable.\n\nNow things are very different: The Post says it has been losing gobs of money for the past few years, and Bezos has made a series of moves interpreted as a shift toward Trump — which spurred reader revolts, which made things even worse. And all of that led to this week's cuts.\n\nI talked to Erik Wemple, a New York Times media reporter who previously worked at the Post for 14 years, to try to reconcile the two eras of Bezos and the Post, and to get a sense of what might happen next. You can hear our entire chat on my Channels podcast; what follows is an edited excerpt from our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: What shape was the Post in when Bezos bought it in 2013?\n\nErik Wemple: The Graham family, which had owned the Post forever, was an amazing steward for the paper. But they had to scale back their newsroom, because the internet had blown holes in classified ads. Classifieds used to be huge at The Washington Post.\n\nAt the time Bezos bought it in 2013, it was not dysfunctional. These were really good journalists, but the paper was in a bit of a funk. It wasn't a reclamation project, but it had seen better days.\n\nIt was faded when he bought it.\n\nCorrect. And when Bezos came in 2013, he really wowed the staff. We all asked him questions. He answered those questions with tremendous enthusiasm and competence. He seemed really energized by this.\n\nWhat did he think he was going to do?\n\nWhen he came in, he was energetic, but deferential on the particulars of running the newspaper. He's like, \"You know what? I'm not in this business, but I do know how to organize discussions about the future of a business.\" And that's what he did. I was in one of them; it was really remarkable.\n\nHe had these things that he believed in. He was important in guiding conversations. And it was really remarkable because he backed it up with money. He invested in the newspaper. He invested in political coverage, big time. Investigative went up. International got a huge, huge boost. And the technology did too.\n\nThis is exactly what you want from your billionaire tech owner: Give us a bunch of money. Improve our tech. Also, stay away. Don't tell us what to do.\n\nThat was exactly the sentiment. And one of the things you mentioned in there is really worth pausing on for a second, which is the lack of intervention, the lack of meddling. He just sort of looked on. And the newsroom really, really, really roared. Especially in the first Trump period.\n\nSo not only does this produce great journalism, it seems like it becomes a business success story — the paper becomes profitable again. Then, after Trump left the White House, there was a lot of hand-wringing about what happens after the Trump bump. People expected audiences to decline across lots of different publications, and that happened, so it makes sense that the Post would struggle a bit. But the numbers you hear about the reported losses — $77 million in 2023, $100 million in 2024 — are staggering. I still don't understand how you can swing to losses like that just because your traffic goes down. What am I missing?\n\nOne of the things that has been reported and pretty well substantiated is they may have over-indexed on staff growth. They vaulted up over a thousand in early 2021, up to 1,100. So I think they got ahead of themselves, and they had to pair that back. That's one of the things.\n\nAnother consideration is that the digital advertising market sort of dried up, so that was a big deal.\n\nIt's all somewhat of a mystery, but I don't doubt that there are meaningful losses.\n\nCan this just be as simple as the Post overhiring? Lots of companies have done that — the tech guys did during the pandemic.\n\nNo, I don't think so. Especially if you look at the more recent past, when they tinkered with the opinion side and shot themselves in the foot.\n\nIn October 2024, the Post announced it would not be endorsing a candidate in the presidential election. And that happened after the Washington Post editorial board had drafted an editorial in favor of Kamala Harris. And hell broke loose — a subscription desertion of hundreds of thousands.\n\nThat's an astonishing number. I remember thinking that it couldn't be real.\n\nThe cause and effect could not have been more direct. People said, \"No way. I'm not giving my money to this organization.\"\n\nThe Post has continued to do lots of news reporting that is critical of the Trump administration. Which made me curious about this line in editor Matt Murray's explanation of the cuts this week. He praises the work the paper has done, and then points out problems, and says \"even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\"\n\nIt almost sounds like what David Ellison and Bari Weiss say about remaking CBS News. Does that mean we should expect the Post's news reporting to change in some sort of ideological way?\n\nIf Matt Murray or any of his top editors had actually edited that memo, they would've asked for specifics. And they would've put a big question mark alongside that and ask, \"What the hell are you talking about here? Why are you speaking in such elliptical language? Why are you trying to whisper to the newsroom some message that you're not willing to articulate?\"\n\nWe need to ask him exactly what he's saying. I think that that is coded language, and I think that could be political.\n\nIt's a strange thing for the executive editor to be saying. It's almost as if he's asking for some force to adjust the newsroom cadence and its sensibility — when he has the power to do that.\n\n(Editor's note: The Post's PR department on Thursday afternoon referred Business Insider to an interview Murray had with The Wall Street Journal: \"You have to be where users are,\" he said. \"We have to do great journalism that people engage with.\" He said that included an effort to \"talk to a lot of different kinds of people and reflect the full diversity of life,\" the Journal reported.)\n\nWhy does Jeff Bezos own The Washington Post? It seems to be nothing but a headache for him the last few years. It doesn't seem like it helps him curry favor with Donald Trump. It's not like he's using it to buy the \"Melania\" documentary for $75 million. What is the upside for him, and why does he continue to own it, do you think?\n\nErik Wemple: I have no idea. That is something all of us in the media trade have been trying to figure out. It is entirely a black box.\n\nMany years ago, he seemed to be deriving a great deal of satisfaction from this. There was a close bond between The Washington Post Establishment and Bezos. I'm pretty sure it isn't as strong as it once was.\n\nSo I think that the enjoyment he got from his association with his institution has probably faded.\n\nBut in 2024, he said, \"We saved The Washington Post once, and we're going to save it a second time.\" So there's another challenge, right? I guess that that would be something that he would derive some pleasure from. And I would imagine that if he wanted to get really involved and engaged, the way he was back in 2013-2015, the newsroom would welcome that.\n\nA lot of the success stories we hear about in digital media these days are specifically publications that are focused largely or entirely on Washington, DC: Politico, Axios, Punchbowl, Semafor. Some of them have direct DNA from The Washington Post. Is there any chance of the Post reclaiming any of that, either through an acquisition or just by focusing on Washington and policy?\n\nThey have this Washington Post Intelligence thing now, which is sort of akin to that. But I don't know if there are new streams of revenue opening up at the Post. And I think that that's one of the reasons that the staff is so disaffected and so disappointed in the current management — they don't see any sort of progress towards new business.\n\nI think they're seeing cuts. And also a fair amount of silence. I don't think that they're getting the feedback from management that they deserve.",

    "fullText": "A California man whom an FBI official slammed as a \"total imposter\" was arrested and charged Thursday over allegations that he sent a fake ransom demand for Nancy Guthrie, the mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.\n\n\"Did you get the bitcoin were [sic] waiting on our end for the transaction,\" Derrick Callella texted two family members of Nancy Guthrie on Wednesday, following reports of a ransom demand tied to the elderly woman's disappearance that listed a Bitcoin wallet address, his criminal complaint said.\n\nThe complaint, filed in Arizona federal court, said Callella admitted to sending the messages. It was not immediately clear whether Callella had retained an attorney.\n\nAuthorities believe the 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie was taken from her ranch-style home just outside Tucson, Arizona, in the Catalina Foothills five days ago.\n\nFBI Phoenix's special agent in charge, Heith Janke, announced the arrest on Thursday at a press conference over Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.\n\nThe FBI official said the arrest was related to an \"imposter ransom demand\" for the woman. \"It was someone that was trying to profit from it — a total imposter,\" Janke said.\n\nJanke also issued a message to anyone involved in Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, urging them to \"do the right thing.\"\n\n\"This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well-being,\" Janke said.\n\nThe FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance, Janke announced.\n\nAuthorities said that an additional ransom letter regarding Nancy Guthrie, sent to local and national media outlets, is being taken \"seriously.\"\n\nThat note made a monetary \"demand\" for 5 p.m. local time Thursday, said Janke.\n\n\"If a transfer wasn't made, then I think a second demand was for next Monday,\" Janke said, declining to provide other specifics.\n\nAn Apple Watch and a floodlight were also mentioned in ransom letters, Janke said.\n\n\"We're not going to go into specifics. It's very important that we keep this investigation moving forward, and we don't want to put more facts out there that others then can use to try to profit from this,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities revealed new details around the timeline of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance on Thursday and confirmed that the blood discovered on the elderly woman's porch belonged to her.\n\nNancy Guthrie was dropped off at her home by her family just before 10 p.m. on January 31. At 1:47 a.m. MST the next day, the woman's doorbell camera disconnected, police said.\n\nAt 2:12 a.m., the doorbell software detected a person on the camera, but there was no available video footage, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said during the Thursday press conference. Minutes later, Nancy Guthrie's pacemaker app showed a disconnect from her phone.\n\nHer family checked in on her at 11:56 a.m. and called 911 shortly after, police said.\n\nNanos said that Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera had also been removed. No suspects or persons of interest have yet been identified in the case, the sheriff said.\n\nOn Wednesday, in an emotional video post alongside her siblings, Savannah Guthrie pleaded to her mother's possible abductors to \"please reach out to us.\"\n\n\"We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk,\" the famed NBC anchor said, adding, \"We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.\"\n\nNancy Guthrie suffers from physical ailments and requires daily medications that, if not taken every 24 hours, could have life-threatening consequences.\n\n\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" Nanos said.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors plan to increase incentives for companies that cooperate during criminal investigations, including ​promises not to prosecute them, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan said ‌on Thursday.\n\nJay Clayton's remarks at an industry conference come as the Justice Department is scaling back ‌corporate crime enforcement and refocusing on immigration and drug cases under the Trump administration.\n\nWhat new incentives will prosecutors offer cooperating companies?\n\nHow is Justice Department changing corporate crime enforcement?\n\nWhich sectors will face increased white-collar crime scrutiny?\n\nWhat are Clayton's criticisms of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?\n\nCompanies need to know there is a specific benefit to cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in rooting out wrongdoers, Clayton said at the Securities Enforcement Forum in ⁠New York.\n\nThat includes offering companies ‌so-called non-prosecution agreements, or NPAs -- deals which Democrats have criticized in the past.\n\n\"Our approach is going to be: let's ‍get an NPA signed as quickly as possible that calls for continued cooperation,\" he said.\n\nClayton, an appointee of President Donald Trump, said the different approach on cooperation would ​benefit shareholders, too. He previously led the Securities and Exchange Commission, a ‌civil regulator, during Trump's first presidential term, and focused on retail investors at the time.\n\nThose retail investors continue to be among his top priorities on white-collar crime issues, he said, noting he has an eye on misconduct in small-cap stocks, private funds and prediction markets. When asked if he foresees ⁠prosecutions in those so-called event contracts, he ​said: \"Yes.\"\n\nClayton also criticized past enforcement of the ​Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 law that bans companies that operate in the U.S. from bribing foreign officials.\n\nThe Justice Department ‍paused the law's enforcement ⁠last year and resumed it with a plan for a more scaled-back approach. Clayton criticized the law for putting the U.S. at ⁠a disadvantage to other countries and penalizing companies instead of targeting individual wrongdoers.\n\n\"I hate corruption ‌of foreign officials,\" Clayton said. \"I hate the FCPA as applied.\"",

    "description": "An active-duty enlisted member of the US military said their unit was \"pressured\" into seeing Amazon's \"Melania\" documentary about the first lady.",
    "fullText": "It was the story of the weekend: \"Melania,\" Amazon's documentary on first lady Melania Trump, beat expectations at the box office, becoming one of the best-performing documentaries in recent years with an opening weekend gross of $7 million across 1,778 screens. (Whether it makes back its $75 million investment is another story.)\n\nDespite dismal critic reviews, the numbers suggest audiences turned out for \"Melania\" to support the first lady. One advocacy group suggests the reality may be more complicated.\n\nMikey Weinstein, the president and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the nonprofit received reports from eight bases around the world that U.S. military members were being \"pressured\" to see \"Melania.\"\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Weinstein, a former Air Force officer and attorney who said his group is made up of nearly 100,000 current and former members of the U.S. military and represents those who feel pressured or coerced into unconstitutional religious observances. \"They were pressured to see the movie.\"\n\n\"Your military superior, that's not your shift manager at Taco Bell or Starbucks. They have complete and total control over you.\"\n\nIn an email Weinstein shared with Business Insider, an active-duty enlisted member of the US military said they were writing on behalf of a dozen of their unit members and their families who felt \"pressured\" by their unit commander to see the movie. The MRFF did not disclose the name of the person who sent the email.\n\nIn the email, this person said their commander suggested the unit and their family members join him, his wife, and their children at a showing of \"Melania\" at an off-base movie theater.\n\nThe screening was designated as one of the commander's \"Unit Activity Events,\" morale-boosting activities that can range from flag football and barbecues to movie nights, the email said. The military member who sent the email said the unit is required to attend at least three of the four UAEs that are scheduled each month or face a penalty.\n\nAsked if any of the MRFF members who contacted him skipped the movie, Weinstein said: \"Every one of our clients who came to us either went to see it or suddenly got sick.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Department of Defense official told Business Insider, \"There is no Department of War directive requiring service members to see this film, though the film is fantastic.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street is looking to Amazon with high hopes after a rough week in tech, as silver plunges again and bitcoin drops near $65,000.",
    "fullText": "US stocks took sizable hits again on Thursday in a fruitless search for a reprieve from a building tech sell-off as investors awaited Amazon earnings, assessed Alphabet's big AI spending plans, and digested jobs data that signaled fresh weakness in the labor market.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved roughly 1.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost over 1.1%, or more than 500 points.\n\nThe market is in the midst of a full-on tech wipeout, as investors weigh whether some software stocks took too big a beating. The losses have been spurred by worries about AI disruption to established software players — a risk that had been overlooked by investors focused on the fallout from massive AI spending until recently.\n\nWall Street is still digesting the latest batch of corporate earnings, with Big Tech's AI build-out and demand in high focus. Alphabet (GOOG) shares slid, but pared losses, after the Google parent outlined a significant ramp-up in AI investment — to as high as $185 billion — in its quarterly results late Wednesday.\n\nThe countdown is now on to Amazon's (AMZN) report, set for release after Thursday's market close. Eyes are on the all-important AWS cloud unit, expected to deliver a 21% jump in sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market flashed fresh signals of weakness: Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected, and job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020, while a new report found that last month marked the worst January for layoff announcements since 2009. The government's monthly jobs report is due next Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver (SI=F) plunged as much as 17%, erasing all of its two-day recovery as Chinese buyers dumped holdings. Wall Street is debating whether the recent record rally in silver and gold (GC=F) ran too high, too fast — and if a further slump awaits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also plunged to its lowest level since 2024, wiping out all of the gains accumulated during President Trump's second term. The token broke below $63,000 — amid a crisis of confidence.\n\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n\nSilver (SI=F) prices tumbled 14% on Thursday to hover above $75 per ounce, erasing gains from the past two days. Gold (GC=F) futures also slipped to $4,900 per ounce after both metals had risen for a second consecutive day following last Friday’s sell-off.\n\nAnalysts warned that silver’s short-term rebound remains volatile, though they remain bullish on bullion prices over the medium term, despite last week’s dramatic pullback that interrupted a blistering rally over the past year.\n\n\"The widening divergence between gold and silver performance reinforces a recurring theme: silver behaves less like a monetary metal during periods of stress and more like a high-beta hybrid, amplifying both optimism and fear,\" Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's commodity strategy head, wrote on Thursday.\n\n\"History suggests that silver tends to stabilise only once realised volatility falls and speculative positioning is reset — conditions that are not yet fully in place,\" he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\n\nMortgage rates barely budged this week: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged higher to 6.11% from 6.10%, while the 15-year fixed averaged 5.50% ticked up to 5.5% from 5.49% last week.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick and Laura Grace Tarpley note that the 10-year Treasury note, a pricing indicator for 30-year fixed mortgage rates, has hovered above 4.2% since mid-January. However, the spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates has narrowed recently, and the 30-year has resisted a substantial move higher.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nCheck out frequently asked questions about mortgage rates and our mortgage calculator here.\n\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\n\nCheck out the top takeaways from Sozzi and Schwab's conversation here.\n\nIt hasn't been a great day for jobs data, with the delayed JOLTS report serving as the final piece in a trifecta of negative news about layoffs, hiring, and unemployment claims.\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled below $64,000 on Thursday, its lowest level since October 2024.\n\nThe token is down nearly 50% from its all-time high last year, erasing all the gains made during President Trump's second term. Investors had been optimistic that the administration's crypto-friendly policies would lift digital-asset prices.\n\n\"Bitcoin remains in a larger bear-market structure,\" read a 10X Research note on Thursday. \"In the absence of a strong catalyst and with positioning still stretched, downside risks remain elevated.\"\n\nNotably, the firm points to a significant overhang — overexposed bitcoin ETF holders who are underwater, with an estimated average acquisition price near $90,000.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with ether (ETH), which tumbled 13% on Thursday. Investors holding Ethereum ETFs are down approximately 31% from their average cost basis, according to 10X Research data.\n\n\"Under these conditions, attracting incremental allocations from Wall Street investors becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when many existing holders likely regret not reducing exposure at significantly higher levels,\" the note said.\n\nAbsent a significant catalyst, the firm doesn't see a bottom to crypto's bear market until possibly the summer.\n\n\"As we have previously outlined, a cycle low around the FIFA World Cup this summer could mark a more compelling long-term buying opportunity,\" 10X Research analysts said.\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings and announced its CFO will be exiting.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) shares soared as much as 9% as the company said it will begin selling compounded copies of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy pill. The pill from Hims & Hers would cost about $100 less than Novo's, Reuters reported.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) both saw shares tumble about 7% on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks have been hammered in the past few days, accelerating a months-long decline as investors become more fearful of disruption risks posed by new artificial intelligence tools — particularly those from Anthropic.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the market belief that software stocks are losing ground during a call with analysts following the Google parent's earnings report Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe CEO said: \"Look, at least from my vantage point, I definitely see we have very, very good SaaS (software as a service) customers who are leaders in their respective categories.\"\n\nThose customers include Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), and Salesforce (CRM), per Bloomberg data.\n\nPichai continued: \"And what I see the successful companies doing is they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows, be it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it to drive efficiency within their organizations.\"\n\n\"[J]ust like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services.. I think the [software] companies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHis comments echo those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week.\n\nRead more about what's driving fears over AI eating into the competitive moats of SaaS leaders here.\n\nThe performance of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, AWS, will be keenly examined when its earnings report lands later, after Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged last week, in part due to a slowdown in cloud growth.\n\nThis was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.\n\n“It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space,” said David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios. “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”\n\n... Amazon’s results come against a backdrop of anti-software sentiment that’s weighing on the entire tech sector as investors try to sort the winners and losers from the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, invited new questions about when these investments will pay off more substantially.\n\n“It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”\n\nAt the market open, US stocks plunged for a third day as a broad sell-off in tech names continued.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, sinking 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.5%.\n\nUS weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased by more than expected last week, as snowstorms across much of the country may have led more people to file for assistance.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 increased by 22,000 to 231,000 claims, exceeding economists' forecasts, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nContinuing claims, a proxy for the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, increased to 1.84 million.\n\nDistortions from winter weather notwithstanding, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits suggests the labor market remains broadly stable if not cooling gradually.\n\nThough in a sign of cracks appearing in the \"low hire, low fire\" trend that has characterized the labor market for over a year, layoffs jumped in January to their highest level for that month in 17 years, according to Challenger data (scroll down for more on this).\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports:\n\nJeff Bezos came, he saw, he conquered.\n\nMaybe not in the way you'd expect from a onetime financial savior of an iconic newspaper. There are now two Bezos eras at the Washington Post: The first started when he rescued it in 2013. The second began when he saw it gutted, blessing mass layoffs the company executed on Wednesday.\n\n... On social media and in news coverage in the aftermath, Post employees, the labor union, and alumni (myself included) strongly criticized the decision.\n\nOthers have pointed to more recent moves by Bezos.\n\nLeading up to the Post's deep cuts, several media observers highlighted Amazon's enormous budget to produce and market the new documentary \"Melania,\" about first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAmazon's extraordinary spending prompted questions about the movie working as a kind of bribe from Bezos to the White House. (Amazon says they licensed the movie because they think people will love it. The film's Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office numbers have inspired a news cycle of their own.)\n\nBut the splashy Melania rollout provided an ugly contrast to the austerity Bezos was serving down to the Post's newsroom. In the worst light, critics said Bezos was willing to burn money to please the president but was now unwilling to do so for journalism in the public interest.\n\nRead more here in the takeaway from today's Morning Brief.\n\nChinese EV maker Nio (NIO) sent its shareholders a profit alert on Thursday morning, letting them know that the company expects to post its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio said it will see an adjusted profit from operations of 200 million Chinese yuan (approximately $29 million) to 700 million yuan (approximately $100 million).\n\nThe company attributed the profit to sustained sales growth, improved margins from its product mix, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.\n\nNio stock popped 6% in premarket trading.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, as tariff woes sent the beauty group's shares tumbling.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) stock fell over 5% during premarket hours on Thursday after bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below 70,000. Strategy is one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency.\n\nTapestry (TPR) stock rose 5% before the bell. Coach's parent company beat analysts' estimates on revenue and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) US-listed shares rose 5% before the bell on Thursday after announcing plans to issue its first dividend to shareholders, along with a three-year stock buyback program worth $5 billion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled, falling $71,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the leading cryptocurrency was paring deeper overnight losses in the wake of Bessent's comments, after entering the key mid-$70,000 support region.\n\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferré and Grace O'Donnell report:\n\nSnap (SNAP) stock galloped higher after a strong holiday quarter for advertising lifted earnings above Wall Street's estimates.\n\nSnap stock rose 6% before the bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the video messaging app reported revenue of $1.71 billion and earnings per share of $0.03. That beat Wall Street estimates of $1.7 billion in revenue and a $0.03 loss per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise.\n\nThe affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85.\n\nThe stock soared by as much as 8% in premarket trading on Thursdayas the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs.\n\nLast year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow market share and deliver best-in-class growth in beauty, as reflected by our raised fiscal 2026 outlook.\"\n\nRead more about e.l.f.'s quarter from Reuters.\n\nArm Holdings shares fall as licensing sales miss estimates.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock rose 5% before the bell on Thursday following Alphabet's (GOOG) capital expenditure plans, which surpassed analysts' expectations.\n\nGoogle's parent company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of $180 billion, news that is a potential boon to Broadcom, which partners with Alphabet on custom chips.\n\n“That is an incredible number. We are laughing because that number is so good for the Google cohort,” Ben Reitzes, Melius Research head of technology research, told CNBC.\n\nGoogle is not the only company increasing its capex spend to build AI data centers: Oracle (ORCL) is doing the same and raised its forecast to around $50 billion.\n\nGoogle's AI software doesn't just use Nvidia (NVDA) chips, but it also uses its own tensor processing units (TPUs). For Gemini 3, Google used TPUs, which Broadcom helped to make.\n\nSilver (SI=F) fell sharply, wiping out a two-day recovery, as the white metal struggled to find a floor following a historic market rout. Gold (GC=F) also declined.\n\nSpot silver plunged as much as 17% on Thursday, having flickered briefly above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. After a record-breaking rally that appeared to run too far, too fast, the metal has retreated by more than a third from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29.\n\n“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. This has created “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity,” he said.\n\nThe sudden and sharp decline in precious metals also weighed on sentiment in base metals markets, with copper falling more than 1% to slip below $13,000 a ton. Meanwhile, spot gold dropped as much as 3.5% in choppy trading.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) stock fell around 11% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market.\n\nSecond quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87).\n\n\"While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release.",

    "title": "Redditors Have Figured Out a Way to Save Hundreds on a Whoop Subscription",
    "description": "You'll have to be lucky at discount shopping, but cheap Whoops are out there.",
    "fullText": "I’ve always said there’s no good reason to buy an older model Whoop band, since the company will give you the latest model for free when you subscribe. But on Reddit, some people who already own Whoop 5.0 bands are buying up old 4.0 bands to get a bargain on the subscription price.\n\nThere have been a few posts on this, but perhaps the master of this hack is Redditor u/thelifeofcb, who found Whoop 4.0 bands, new in box, at a T. J. Maxx store for $39 each, and bought several. This allowed them to extend their existing subscription—they wear a Whoop 5.0—for several years at essentially a $200/year discount.\n\nWhen new Whoop bands are sold through retailers, they come packaged with a one-year subscription. The idea is that you’ll create an account on the app, pair the band you bought through the app, and get credit for a 12-month subscription—since that was the main thing you paid for when you bought the band at full price.\n\nBack in the Whoop 4.0 days, there was only one tier of membership. When tiers were introduced, those subscriptions rolled over to a Peak subscription, the one that currently goes for $239/year. That means a 4.0 device—however much you pay for it—can give you a year-long Peak subscription.\n\nRedditors have found that pairing one of these new Whoop 4.0 devices added a year’s subscription to their accounts, whether they were a new customer or not. That means you can buy a few discount bands, pair them all, and enjoy several years’ worth of discounted membership. That $39 band is thus a $200 discount on each year’s membership. Some say that they received an offer to upgrade to a Whoop 5.0 band if they added two years' worth of membership (paired two bands).\n\nThat $39 price is an unusually good one, but you can still get a significant discount anywhere new Whoop 4.0 devices are sold. For example, Amazon has 4.0 devices right now for $124, which is still about half the price of a Peak subscription. You can find them cheaper on eBay, but I’d be wary of buying a box that may have been opened. I’ll explain that below.\n\nWhile Redditors say this works—and it does fit with my understanding of how subscriptions are paid for and claimed in the app—there are a few pitfalls to beware of.\n\nThe first is that this applies to new-in-box devices that (1) are sold with a subscription, and (2) have never been paired. The hack would not work with a hand-me-down device that has already been used, nor with a new one that has already been paired and its subscription claimed. For example, you can’t pass the same band to a friend and expect it to give both of you a subscription.\n\nThis means you have to be sure the band you buy has not been opened. If a store accepts returns of opened items, they may not realize that the valuable item here—the digital subscription—has already been claimed. If they put it back on the shelf, and you buy it, you’re out the purchase price and you still don’t have a subscription.\n\nThe other issue is just the e-waste that this causes. You’re buying a device just to throw it in the trash. But I’d argue that’s Whoop’s fault, not yours—those devices are obsolete and headed for the landfill (or responsible electronics recycling program, if you can find one) regardless of what you do.",

    "title": "The Top 10 TV Series This Month, According to Streaming Data",
    "description": "It's a really good time to stay inside and watch a ton of television.",
    "fullText": "January 2026's ten most-streamed TV series are a balanced group, including six reality-based dramas and four fantasy/sci-fi hits. One the side of realism, we've got medical drama vérité The Pitt, a pair of spy shows (The Night Manager and Ponies), and a gay hockey romance in Heated Rivalry. The fantasy side includes the post-apocalyptic black humor of Fallout, the suburban supernatural series Stranger Things, and a trip back to Westeros with A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nA more important running theme this month: These shows are all critical darlings, including a couple perfect Rotten Tomatoes 100% winners (The Night Manager and Pluribus) and five other shows above 95% (The Pitt, Fallout, Heated Rivalry, Ponies, and A Knight of Seven Kingdoms). Even the \"worst\" of the bunch, Landman, is sitting at a solid 78%. Good job watching good shows, America!\n\nHere's the full list of the top 10 most-streamed shows of January 2026 across all major streaming services, as compiled by JustWatch.\n\nIf you're into high-stake international espionage, you have to check the most-streamed series this week. The Night Manager is based on John le Carre's best-selling novel and stars Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine, an MI-6 agent whose mission is to infiltrate the inner circle of dangerous arms trader Richard \"Dickie\" Onslow Roper, played by Hugh Laurie. It has been ten long years since the show first premiered, but both seasons of this BBC-made series are available in full as of Feb. 1, so binge it up, man. Stream The Night Manager on Prime Video.\n\nHBO's gritty, hyper-realistic medical drama has earned acclaim from critics and audiences for its relentless pace, following a single 15-hour shift at the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. Starring Noah Wyle as Dr. Michael Robinavitch, The Pitt ditches the \"disease-of-the-week\" format of many medical shows in favor of a study of the toll the modern medical system places on everyone involved. Season one earned five Emmy awards, and judging from the first few episodes, season two might win more. Stream The Pitt on HBO Max.\n\nPost-apocalyptic action-comedy Fallout is like nothing that’s been on TV before. Staying true to the gritty, gruesome, and irreverent spirit of the video games upon which it is based, it follows naive former vault dweller Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) as she leaves her protected bunker to track down her father in the irradiated Wasteland. The show’s standout characters include Lucy’s duplicitous pop (Kyle MacLachlan), conflicted mech-warrior Maximus (Aaron Moten), and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), the walking, talking, noseless, undead remains of a pre-apocalypse Hollywood cowboy. Season one earned a staggering 17 Emmy nominations in 2024, and the just-finished season two earned even greater critical acclaim for its expansion into the iconic ruins of New Vegas. Stream Fallout on Prime Video.\n\nIf you want explicit hockey player-on-hockey player action with a 98% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, HBO's Heated Rivalry is a must-watch. Set against the hyper-masculine, hyper-homophobic world of professional sports, the series brings emotional depth to the story of a years-long secret romance between Canadian \"golden boy\" Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Russian bad boy Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie). Stream Heated Rivalry on HBO Max.\n\nA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms takes fans back to Westeros, 100 years before the events of Game of Thrones. Based on George R.R. Martin’s Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas, the series is less about world-spanning politics and more about smaller, character driven moments in the lives of humble, towering knight Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey) and his diminutive, mysterious squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). It's shorter, lighter, and funnier than its forebears (but not too light—this is still Westeros, after all). Stream Knights of the Seven Kingdoms on HBO Max.\n\nA veritable streaming institution, Stranger Things reached its end with season five. Set in November 1987, the final chapter follows the Hawkins gang in a mission to find and kill Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) while navigating a town under strict military quarantine. From Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) evading a new government threat to Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) unlocking his psychic potential to protect his friends, the series remains an emotional masterclass in supernatural sci-fi horror—despite a divisive finale. Stream Stranger Things on Netflix.\n\nCreator and executive producer Vince Gilligan takes a hard turn from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul with Pluribus, a slow-burn post-apocalyptic sci-fi series starring Rhea Seehorn as Carol Sturka, a stubborn and irascible novelist in Albuquerque who finds herself one of the last 13 individuals on Earth in the wake of viral outbreak that has turned the rest of the species into a hive mind. \"They\" aren't (isn't?) exactly evil, but they are extremely persistent about trying to get the mysteriously immune Carol to join their ranks (as nicely but firmly as possible). Stream Pluribus on Apple TV+.\n\nYellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan's Landman is is a gritty modern Western set in the oil fields of West Texas. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Tommy Norris, a \"crisis executive\" for an oil company who must navigate a law-light landscape of roughnecks, billionaires, and dangerous drug cartels in order to make sure fuel keeps getting dug out of the ground. Stream Landman on Paramount+.\n\nBased on the 2020 novel by Alice Feeney, His & Hers is a twisty mystery thriller series that stars Tessa Thompson as Anna Andrews, a disgraced Atlanta journalist who returns to her small Georgia hometown to cover a brutal murder, only to find her estranged husband, Detective Jack Harper (Jon Bernthal), leading the investigation. As the former couple competes to solve the case, each grows more suspicious that the other is the killer. The six-episode run makes it a great series if you're longing for an engaging drama with a definite conclusion. Stream His & Hers on Netflix.\n\nIn international espionage parlance, \"ponies\" are \"persons of no interest.\" In this case, that Bea (Emilia Clarke) and Twila (Haley Lu Richardson), two American women in Cold War Moscow whose \"normal\" lives are upended when their CIA agent husbands die in a mysterious plane crash. The pair convince the U.S. government to let them try to infiltrate the KGB and find out the truth of what happened, using their ordinariness as the ultimate cover. Boasting a 96% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the eight-episode season balances steamy romance with intense espionage. Stream Ponies on Peacock.",

    "title": "Car Icons Are Disappearing From Google Maps in Android Auto (but You Might Be Able to Fix It)",
    "description": "How to fix disappearing car icons when using Google Maps with Android Auto.",
    "fullText": "Android Auto users are reporting a bug that is making their cars disappear from the road—ok, not literally, but within Google Maps. On both Reddit and Google's own support forums, drivers now say their car icons are sporadically disappearing from their navigation screens while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. Some users have discovered workarounds, but the fixes don't appear to be consistent for everyone. Here's what's happening, and what you can do to try to fix it.\n\nThe news first started popping up six days ago, on a Reddit thread where multiple users reported problems with their car icons disappearing while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. According to these drivers, when the bug was triggered, the map would move around normally, and traffic data and navigation instructions continued to display as expected. However, the icon indicating their car's position would suddenly disappear from their screen, making it difficult to know where exactly they were in comparison to the road. That's not ideal if you're trying to judge when your next turn is coming up.\n\nAccording to the thread's original poster, the issue popped up for them on the Android Auto version 16.1 release, although others mentioned the issue occurring as far back as version 15.9. The bug doesn't appear to happen all the time, but \"reliably\" appears when leaving Google Maps, opening another app in fullscreen, and either returning to Google Maps in fullscreen or pulling it up alongside the new app in a splitscreen view. To get their icon back, the original poster had to force quit Google Maps on their phone, but this wouldn't stop the bug from occurring again in the future. Google itself has not yet offered public comment on the issue, although I've reached out to the company and will update this post when I hear back.\n\nIf you're encountering a disappearing car icon while using Google Maps through Android Auto, there are a few fixes that have worked for community members, although whether they'll work for everyone appears to be inconsistent.\n\nThe timing of this bug appears to line up with the Android Auto v16.1 release, which launched last week. While the bug has been reported appearing on older versions of the app, like Android Auto v15.9, it could be worth trying out another version of Android Auto to see if it clears up the issue. For instance, one user mentioned that installing Android Auto V16.0.66 fixed the issue for them. If you're on an older version, you can update to a newest one from the Android Auto listing on the Play Store. If you're on a newest version and want to try an older one, though, you'll need to uninstall your Android Auto app and manually sideload the older version using a trusted APK file. Because these can be tricky to verify, this might not be the best option for most people.\n\nMultiple users in the original Reddit thread, including the original poster, pointed out that the bug only seems to affect them when using a non-default car icon. Until Google issues a fix, one solution might be to change your car icon back to the standard white arrow within a blue circle. To change your car icon in Google Maps, open the app on your phone while not connected to Android Auto. Start navigating to a location. Tap on your car icon, and swipe left or right to adjust the icon until you land on the default white arrow within a blue circle. The next time you connect your Google Maps app to Android Auto, your car's icon should be updated. Note that this isn't a guaranteed fix. One user on a Google support forum, for instance, said that their arrow icon also disappeared from Google Maps in Android Auto when returning from another app.\n\nIf there is one saving grace to this bug, it's that the circumstances for triggering it seem to be pretty consistent. That means you can largely avoid it if you simply don't leave the Google Maps app once you open it. But while that might be OK for short trips, it's not ideal for longer ones, where you might want to adjust a podcast or playlist during your drive. You can manually restart your Google Maps app on your phone every time the bug pops up, but not only is that annoying, it's possibly dangerous if you're in the middle of a drive.\n\nIf none of the above fixes work for you and you want to retain the ability to exit your fullscreen navigation app without losing your car icon, it might be worth putting Google Maps to bed for now and using an alternative navigation app. Google's own Waze app, for instance, works with Android Auto and does not seem to have this bug right now. Alternative navigation apps do have their own pros and cons, as Waze focuses less on comprehensive mapping and more on real-time crowdsourced traffic information when determining routes. However, it might be worth a shot. If Waze doesn't work for you, other popular navigation apps compatible with Android Auto include Sygic GPS and TomTom - Maps & Traffic (formerly TomTom AmiGo).",

    "title": "Apple's 'Lockdown Mode' Could Stop the Government From Breaking Into Your iPhone",
    "description": "Lockdown Mode saved a journalist's iPhone from the FBI. Do you need it?",
    "fullText": "In January, the FBI made headlines after it raided the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson. It was a shocking case of law enforcement not just overriding one journalist's privacy, but the integrity of the entire news organization. The devices the FBI seized—which included personal devices as well as a Washington Post-issued laptop—contained Natanson's personal contacts, correspondences, and the Slack channels of the Washington Post itself.\n\nBut while the FBI was able to access some of the devices, it was not able to access Natanson's iPhone. That's because the device was in Lockdown Mode, which prevented the FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) from breaking into it. This isn't a setting that is exclusive to journalists: You have this option baked into your iPhone as well, and can choose to turn it on at any time. The thing is, unless you're a high-profile target, you probably don't want to.\n\nLockdown Mode is an option on iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs, designed for users who could be the target of sophisticated cyberattacks. Think politicians, businessmen, activists, and, of course, journalists—really, anyone high-profile that works or takes action in a way that could draw the ire of powerful organizations or governments.\n\nBecause attackers target devices with spyware, the goal of Lockdown Mode is to reduce the attack surface of your device in order to prevent potential cyberattacks from working. Attackers can install spyware on a target's device in a number of ways, through links, attachments, wired connections, and file downloads, the same way you can install malware by clicking a malicious link in an email, or downloading a corrupt extension from the web. Lockdown Mode locks down these vulnerabilities and eliminates as many potential attack routes as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, Lockdown Mode severely impacts a number of functions you may use on your device every day. According to Apple, that includes the following:\n\nMessages: Lockdown Mode will block most message attachment types, other than \"certain images, video, and audio.\" Links and link previews are blocked.\n\nWeb browsing: The feature blocks \"complex web technologies,\" which could impact how certain websites load or function. You may not see certain web fonts, and you may see missing image icons in place of pictures.\n\nFaceTime: Incoming FaceTime calls are blocked, except for contacts you have called within the past 30 days. You can't use SharePlay or take Live Photos in FaceTime calls.\n\nApple services: Invitations to Apple services like invites to manage a smart home are blocked, unless you have previously invited that person. GameCenter will not work, and Focuses will not work \"as expected.\"\n\nDevice connections: Your device needs to be unlocked before it can communicate with another computer. In addition, your Mac also requires your explicit approval before the connection can be made.\n\nWireless connectivity: You won't automatically join non-secure wifi networks, and you will disconnect from existing non-secure wifi networks. Lockdown Mode also blocks 2G and 3G cellular support.\n\nConfiguration profiles: You can't install configuration profiles, and the device can't enroll in Mobile Device Management.\n\nApple makes a point to say that phone calls and \"plain text messages\" will work as normal, however incoming calls won't ring on your Apple Watch. Emergency SOS also will continue to work.\n\nThese restrictions make it much more difficult for a bad actor to install spyware on your device, though it also makes it more difficult to use your device. A shared album invite could contain malware, but by removing the feature entirely, you miss out on photos from friends and family. Any spyware coming from a malicious link or image will be blocked, but if you frequently send photos, videos, and other attachments in Messages, you'll miss out.\n\nThat's why these measures are really designed only for individuals who think they'll be targeted by sophisticated actors. It seems that could include governments secretly installing spyware on targets' devices, or the FBI stealing your device in a raid. It's worth noting that the FBI was able to access Natanson's other devices, including a MacBook Pro that unlocked with her fingerprint. The agency's warrant compelled Natanson to unlock her devices with biometrics if they were enabled. Lockdown Mode could not have prevented that, so it's not clear why the FBI didn't force Natanson to unlock the iPhone in question, too.\n\nIf you understand the restrictions, but still want to try Lockdown Mode, you'll need to be running the following software version on each of the Apple devices you want to use Lockdown Mode with:\n\nApple Watch: watchOS 10 or later\n\nApple says \"additional protections\" are available for iOS 17, iPadOS 17, or macOS Sonoma or later. In addition, you should update your device to the latest software version before turning on Lockdown Mode if you want all the latest protections.\n\nYou can turn on Lockdown Mode on any of your Apple devices, but you must do so individually on each. You'll find the option at the bottom of the \"Privacy & Security\" section in Settings (System Settings on Mac). Hit \"Turn On Lockdown Mode,\" then review the pop-up that appears and choose \"Turn On Lockdown Mode\" again. You'll need to choose to \"Turn On & Restart,\" then enter your device's password or passcode for the feature to take effect.",

    "description": "The FBI is looking into all leads.",
    "fullText": "The investigation continues into the disappearance of Today host Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy Guthrie, but the FBI just made their first arrest related to the case.\n\nFBI Phoenix Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke announced at a press conference on February 5 that a suspect was arrested in connection with the fake ransom note sent to news outlets on February 3, which the FBI later denied the validity of. “We have made one arrest related to an imposter ransom demand, and a complaint will be presented to a magistrate judge later today,” Janke said. “You will get more on that from the FBI and our U.S. Attorney’s office here in Arizona when it becomes available.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie's Sister Recalls Her Mom's Last Movements as Police Address Reports Her Husband Is the Prime Suspect in the Abduction Case\n\nOfficials Reveal if They Think Savannah Guthrie's Mom Is Still 'Alive' After Concerning Evidence Sparked the Involvement of Homicide Detectives\n\nHe continued, “There’s no evidence to connect this to Nancy’s case. It was someone that was trying to profit off it.”\n\nJanke also issued a warning against those planning to offer fake evidence as a way to secure the $50,000 reward for Nancy’s whereabouts. “My next message is to those imposters who are trying to take advantage and profit from this situation. We will investigate and ensure you are held accountable for your actions,” Janke said. “This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well being. You still have the time to do the right thing before this becomes a worse, much worse scenario for you.”\n\nTMZ reported on February 3 that it received an alleged ransom note demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin for the release of Savannah’s mother. According to TMZ, the note was sent on Tuesday morning and included a specific Bitcoin address for the payment to be sent, which the outlet verified was real.\n\nThe FBI’s arrest over the fake ransom note came less than a day after Mary Coleman, an anchor for Arizona’s KOLD 13 News, which also received the note via email, claimed it was “clear after a couple sentences” that it “might not be a hoax.”\n\n“A lot of it is information that only someone who was holding her for ransom would know,” she said in an appearance on CNN on February 4. “Some very sensitive information and things that people who weren’t there when she was taken captive wouldn’t know.”\n\nShe continued, “We immediately sent that information over to the sheriff’s department … One of the detectives did get back to us and asked us for some more information so that they can start searching for an IP address, things of that nature, to try and figure out what people are responsible here.”\n\nColeman added that the note “included a dollar amount, a deadline” and other dteails that only “Guthrie’s abductor might know, so that definitely raised some red flags.”\n\nThe arrest over the bogus note also comes after Savannah and her siblings, sister Annie and brother Camron, posted an Instagram video with a plea to Nancy’s potential abductor. “We too have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,” Savannah said. “As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please, reach out to us.”\n\nSavannah went on to call Nancy “our heart and our home,” before expressing her concern for her mother’s health “She is 84 years old,” Savannah said. “Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,” she said.\n\nShe continued, “On behalf of our family, we want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too. Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She is funny, spunky, and clever. She has grandchildren that adore her and crowd around her and cover her in kisses. She loves fun and adventure. She is a devoted friend. She is full of kindness and knowledge. Talk to her and you’ll see.”\n\nShe ended the video with a message to her mother, “Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God’s precious daughter, Nancy. We believe and know that even in this valley He is with you. Everyone is looking for you mommy, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again. We speak to you every moment and we pray without ceasing and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you.” She captioned the post, “Bring her home.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "A brief video of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking at a church celebration surfaced online this week. It went viral, with millions of views and many comments that focused more on her appearance than on what she was saying.\n\nThe 33-second video, which initially aired on C-SPAN on September 22, 2022, shows Rep. Ocasio-Cortez celebrating the First Baptist Church of Corona for its 100th anniversary. In the video, she talks about the church’s longstanding food pantry program, its employment programs for young people, its pandemic relief efforts, and its service to its diverse immigrant community in Queens.\n\nThe video went viral when someone posted it on X with the caption “Jesus Christ.” It earned over 3 million views. Many of the comments were crude jokes and memes about Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s looks. Some inappropriate jokes and quotes included her picture and made political and socialist jokes.\n\nJesus Christ pic.twitter.com/SvmXVLiLIO https://t.co/WDpEjOGjdW\n\n(@SavinTheBees) February 5, 2026\n\nAmong the comments were mixed views. For example, one person said, “Goddamn it, we’re gonna lose the midterms.” The following comment said, “Call her anything but not ugly.” The following comment said, “It’s beautiful, I’m team AOC 2028.”\n\nThe viral video and comments were distracting many from what Rep. Ocasio-Cortez initially talked about. For example, she spoke about the First Baptist Church of Corona and its role as an anchor in the community under Pastor Patrick H. Young.\n\nThe post Old Church Clip of AOC Goes Viral as Internet Fixates on Her Outfit Instead of Her Words appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.",

    "title": "Why Man Utd are taking their time over manager decision",
    "description": "Some are calling for Michael Carrick to be made permanent Man Utd manager, but the club will not rush a decision.",
    "fullText": "Michael Carrick has made an impressive start to his second stint as Manchester United head coach.\n\nThree games, three wins, with Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta and Marco Silva the managers beaten. A place in the top four - enough to secure a return to the Champions League next season - beckons, barely a month after many feared a second consecutive campaign with no European football.\n\nLittle wonder there are some observers who already think United should give Carrick the job permanently.\n\nMost still caution against - for now.\n\nUnited themselves are staying silent.\n\nWhen they dismissed Ruben Amorim on 5 January, club insiders vowed to run a 'proper process' during which they would assess all suitable candidates. Speaking to people with an understanding of the situation, that has not changed.\n\nThere are some very valid reasons why it might be quite a while before United announce their decision.\n\nMan Utd prepare to honour Munich disaster victims\n\nWhen United sacked Jose Mourinho in December 2018, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was given the job until the end of the season.\n\nIt was hoped the club legend's general positivity could raise spirits.\n\nThe results were spectacular. United won the first eight games of Solskjaer's tenure, including a Premier League match at Tottenham and an FA Cup tie at Arsenal.\n\nThe only defeat in his first 17 games was at home to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League - a result United overturned three weeks later as a Marcus Rashford penalty completed a victory that ranks alongside any in the club's illustrious history.\n\nThree weeks later, Solskjaer was given a three-year contract.\n\nUnited won two and lost eight of their final 12 games.\n\nThat loss of form fuels the argument United blundered in moving too early and that Solskjaer would not have got the job had they waited until the summer.\n\nA different man - Sir Jim Ratcliffe - is running football operations these days, but that historical example alone suggests United are better off waiting.\n\nThe other major reason to delay a decision is because a number of potential candidates who are currently in jobs will become available.\n\nIn the Premier League alone that includes Oliver Glasner, who has already said he will be leaving Crystal Palace, Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola and Fulham's Silva.\n\nYet Glasner is an example of how short-term results can affect long-term thinking.\n\nA Europa League winner at Eintracht Frankfurt, he won Palace the first silverware in their history when they beat Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final. They also won the Community Shield against Liverpool.\n\nBut things have unravelled this season.\n\nGlasner left key players out of Palace's final Conference League game in December. A home draw with Finland's KuPS meant Palace missed out on direct entry to the last 16 and must play Bosnian outfit Zrinjski in the play-offs later this month.\n\nThe KuPS game was in the early part of an ongoing run of 12 games without a win.\n\nThe eight defeats in that sequence include an embarrassing FA Cup loss at National League North outfit Macclesfield. Palace are 15th in the Premier League - nine points above third-bottom West Ham - and it is not certain Glasner will see out the season.\n\nThen there are the international managers.\n\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel spoke to United before and after the 2024 FA Cup final as the club deliberated about Erik ten Hag's future. United have also long been linked with Mauricio Pochettino, who is in charge of the US national side.\n\nThat duo, plus Carlo Ancelotti (Brazil) and Julian Nagelsmann (Germany), are other highly regarded coaches likely to be on United's radar.\n\nBut hiring a national team boss around a major tournament is fraught with issues.\n\nIn 1990, England boss Bobby Robson was referred to by some as a \"traitor\" for agreeing a post-tournament contract with PSV Eindhoven, even though he had been pilloried for the previous two years.\n\nJulen Lopetegui was sacked by Spain two days before the start of the 2018 World Cup after Real Madrid confirmed he would join them after the tournament.\n\nSpeaking to a source with first-hand knowledge of appointing managers and coaches at club and international level, it became clear signing a contract with the likes of Tuchel before the tournament is not advisable.\n\n\"Even if there are private conversations between senior club representatives and a coach at a major country, there is no way that can become a formal agreement pre-World Cup,\" they said.\n\n\"If it came out, it would balloon in the face of whichever coach it was. It would be massively destabilising. It's just not worth it.\n\n\"You can have discreet meetings - they happen all the time in football - but it would be much more beneficial to do groundwork.\n\n\"There are a few issues anyway. If they agreed privately with someone at the end of April, what would happen if Michael Carrick had a fantastic end to the season? Depending on how the World Cup went - good or bad - you must think of the impact it might have on reputation.\n\n\"Manchester United have to let it breathe a little bit.\"\n\nThe counterargument is players want clarity.\n\nDefender Harry Maguire is out of contract in the summer, and United have targets to pursue, with midfielders Elliott Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba high on their list.\n\nIt does not seem unreasonable for those players to ask who their manager would be.\n\nThe uncertainty did not help Ralf Rangnick, who presided over a 2021-22 campaign that unravelled spectacularly - winning just five of the last 19 games, including an FA Cup defeat at home to Championship outfit Middlesbrough.\n\nCarrick does not see the same situation unfolding under him.\n\n\"I've got no concerns,\" he said. \"The lads have been better than you can imagine.\n\n\"We're all aware of the bigger situation and what might happen but as a player, you focus on what's ahead of you and try to achieve what you can.\"\n\nUnited clearly want to get the decision right, but as the demands on managers increase, the time they are given to succeed is reduced.\n\nEven if Carrick were to leave at the end of the season, his 17 games in charge would not even make the top eight of shortest reigns at a Premier League club - and would exceed Ange Postecoglou, who only lasted five games and 39 days at Nottingham Forest this season.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Holders Newcastle United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Manchester City on Wednesday night and a challenging season shows no sign of relenting.",
    "fullText": "Newcastle United players waited impatiently in the tunnel at the Etihad.\n\nIt was three minutes until kick-off and the Carabao Cup holders were desperate to get going as a bemused Kieran Trippier looked around and wondered where his counterparts from Manchester City were.\n\nThere was no sign of Pep Guardiola's team.\n\nThe hosts took their time to emerge from the dressing room, but they quickly left Newcastle in a daze after racing into a 3-0 lead in the second leg of their semi-final.\n\nOn a day chief executive David Hopkinson doubled down on his assertion that Newcastle will be competing for the biggest prizes by 2030, the naive visitors looked a long way off in that first half.\n\nHead coach Eddie Howe certainly did not hold back in the away dressing room as he made a triple change at half-time.\n\n\"I was really annoyed,\" he said.\n\nNewcastle managed to rally after the break and pulled one back through substitute Anthony Elanga as they bowed out with a 5-1 defeat on aggregate.\n\nDespite the loss, those 5,400 supporters in the away end repeatedly chanted \"Eddie Howe's black and white army\", in recognition of the head coach who ended the club's seven-decade wait for a major domestic trophy in this very competition.\n\nBut this has been a challenging season for Newcastle and it shows no signs of relenting.\n\nIn truth, Newcastle have yet to catch fire six months into the campaign.\n\nThat may seem a curious statement.\n\nNewcastle have reached a third EFL Cup semi-final in four years.\n\nHowe's side remain favourites to progress past Qarabag into the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nThey could still get back to Wembley through the FA Cup - even if an awkward fourth-round tie against Aston Villa awaits next week.\n\nBut Newcastle sit in 11th place in the Premier League.\n\nThe players previously spoke among themselves about trying to make history once again by becoming the first Newcastle side to qualify for the Champions League in successive campaigns.\n\nHowever, this travel sick team have only won two away games in the top flight this season.\n\nHowe's men have picked up just 11 points from a possible 36 against those sides currently above them in the division.\n\nThey have dropped 16 points from winning positions.\n\nIt has felt like a season of transition, following the damaging departure of top scorer Alexander Isak, and Howe's response was telling when asked if he could tolerate such a word this week.\n\n\"I can,\" he said. \"Transition from the team is an obvious one because we brought players in from the summer and we lost players in the summer.\n\n\"There was always going to be a change to the team. Now change doesn't have to be negative - it can be positive. We are trying to find that flow and rhythm that we have been searching for all season, really.\n\n\"In terms of the club, it's growing and changing all the time and I think will continue to change in the next few years, probably at a rapid pace at some stage. The club is definitely in transition - but transitioning for the positive in my opinion.\"\n\nThere have certainly been glimpses of what this team could be in recent weeks.\n\nThere was a devastating first-half display against Chelsea, a spirited hour away to Paris St-Germain and a fine opening half an hour or so at Anfield.\n\nBut games are not won in snatches.\n\nIt has been a frustration of the coaching staff that they have lacked the training time during an unrelenting run of fixtures to really work on things and piece it all together like they have during previous sticky spells.\n\nInstead the players have come to rely on meeting rooms, analysis sessions and walk-throughs.\n\nThis is the reality of life at clubs who aspire to fight on multiple fronts, of course, but competing in four competitions was an unprecedented feat for Newcastle going into February.\n\nThe relentless nature of the schedule has had a knock-on effect on the squad - Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Tino Livramento and Fabian Schar are all currently sidelined, while Anthony Gordon hobbled off with a hamstring issue on Wednesday night.\n\nIt has also had an impact on the adaptation of Newcastle's summer signings who, aside from defender Malick Thiaw, are still finding their feet at the club.\n\nThiaw, Jacob Ramsey, Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa all joined in the final fortnight or so of a turbulent window, in which the club operated without a sporting director and missed out on a host of top targets.\n\nNewcastle, remarkably, are still searching for a settled combination in the final third despite spending £179m on forwards.\n\nElanga enjoyed a lively second-half cameo at the Etihad, but Woltemade was substituted at half-time - having failed to score since December - while the rusty Wissa missed a host of good chances in both legs.\n\nIt leaves Newcastle with more questions than answers as they embark on a crunch run of fixtures.\n\n\"Where does that leave our season?\" Howe asked. \"We're still fighting on several fronts.\n\n\"The games are coming thick and fast. There's no let-up for us. We need to get back to winning ways as quickly as possible. It's the only thing that gives you new energy.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL in the British amateur game with the London Warriors.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Tries: Bielle-Biarrey 2, Jalibert, Ollivon, Attissogbe Cons: Ramos 4 Pen: Ramos\n\nTries: Timoney, Milne Cons: Prendergast 2\n\nRuthless France inflicted more pain on Ireland as the Six Nations holders opened their title defence with a bonus-point victory at a buoyant Stade de France.\n\nHaving crushed Ireland's title hopes in emphatic fashion in Dublin last year, Les Bleus - with returning captain Antoine Dupont pulling the strings - roared into a 22-0 half-time lead following a one-sided first half that was not without controversy.\n\nFrance's first try was scored by the electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey, but only after what appeared to be a forward pass in the build-up.\n\nMatthieu Jalibert and Charles Ollivon also crossed in the first half, before 2025 top try-scorer Bielle-Biarrey's stylish second secured France's bonus point seven minutes after the interval.\n\nAt that point, France looked poised to surpass the 42 points they managed in Dublin last year, but Ireland refused to give in and narrowed the deficit with tries from replacement forwards Nick Timoney and Michael Milne.\n\nThe hosts, however, had the final word when Theo Attissogbe capped a thoroughly satisfying evening for the tournament favourites.\n\nThe Irish leave the French capital bruised and empty-handed and must regroup in time to face Italy in Dublin on 14 February, with France travelling to Wales the following day.\n\nIreland well beaten by France to start Six Nations - reaction\n\nWith an extensive injury list, this was always going to be a big ask for Ireland.\n\nSeverely depleted at both prop positions and without potential gamebreakers like Hugo Keenan and Mack Hansen, Farrell's hand was weakened before he brought his squad back to the scene of their agonising World Cup quarter-final loss to New Zealand in 2023.\n\nBut even if Ireland feel hard done by calls that did not go their way, there is no question they were simply outplayed at times by a scintillating French outfit driven on by a delighted Parisian crowd.\n\nWhile Ollivon's knock-on denied France a second-minute try, Bordeaux speedster Bielle-Biarrey beat Jamison Gibson-Park, rode Sam Prendergast's tap tackle and ghosted past Jacob Stockdale to finish a move that featured a suspected forward pass from Nicolas Depoortere to Yoram Moefana.\n\nThe high-intensity, unstructured nature of the game suited France's fleet-footed backline, but it was an Irish defensive lapse that led to the home side's second try.\n\nAfter Tommy O'Brien was forced to dot the ball down in the Irish in-goal area and concede a scrum, Dupont - making his Test return after suffering a serious knee injury against Ireland 11 months ago - popped the ball to Jalibert for the fly-half to mark his first international appearance since last year's Six Nations with a well-taken try.\n\nWith Ireland already on the ropes, Ollivon surged past Caelan Doris and slid across the whitewash to give the hosts a commanding halfway lead.\n\nIt was also the first time Ireland were held to zero points in a first half since 2020.\n\nWhen Bielle-Biarrey scampered clear for his second - after a Dupont chip and outrageous volley with the outside of his left boot from Thomas Ramos - and France's fourth try, Ireland looked on course to be on the end of one of their heaviest defeats.\n\nBut a gutsy second-half display - that echoed November's chaotic defeat by South Africa - allowed them to at least get a few scores on the board, with Timoney finishing after a line-break from his Ulster team-mate Stuart McCloskey.\n\nThen replacement tight-head prop Milne marked his Six Nations debut when he burrowed over after another McCloskey surge.\n\nA third Irish try would have stirred French nerves but, while Farrell's side applied pressure, France's defence stood firm, allowing their backs to finish with a flourish as Attissogbe crossed in the corner to complete a miserable Stade de France return for Ireland.\n\nWithout established Test veterans Uini Atonio, Gregory Alldritt, Damian Penaud and Gael Fickou, this was a glimpse into France's destructive potential.\n\nFor Ireland, however, they face into a difficult week following their autumn losses to New Zealand and South Africa with another humbling reverse against a fellow member of the world's top five.\n\nFrance: Ramos; Attissogbe, Depoortere, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Dupont (capt); Gros, Marchand, Aldegheri, Ollivon, Guillard, Cros, Jegou, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Mauvaka, Neti, Montagne, Auradou, Meafou, Nouchi, Serin, Gourgues.\n\nIreland: Osborne; O'Brien, Ringrose, McCloskey, Stockdale; S Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Loughman, Sheehan, Clarkson, McCarthy, Beirne, C Prendergast, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: Kelleher, Milne, Bealham, Ryan, Conan, Timoney, Casey, Crowley.\n\nAssistant Referees: Angus Gardner (Aus) & Jordan Way (Aus)\n\nTelevision match official: Ian Tempest (Eng)\n\nFoul play review officer: Richard Kelly (NZ)",

    "fullText": "Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend insists he and his side have learned from their autumn failings before they start their Six Nations campaign against Italy in Rome on Saturday.\n\nBookended by comfortable wins against the United States and Tonga, the Scots threw away a 21-point lead to lose against Argentina and were unable to capitalise on a wave of second-half momentum in their defeat to New Zealand in November.\n\nTownsend will reach his 100th match in charge of the national team during the Six Nations but has faced criticism from some fans and pundits who feel he has taken Scotland as far as he can.\n\nThey finished third in the 2018 tournament - Townsend's first campaign - and have not bettered that in the seven editions since, also coming third in 2023.\n\n\"It's something we definitely have addressed and looked at,\" Townsend said when asked about Scotland's propensity to fall away at the end of matches.\n\n\"A lot of it is on me as a coach. I think the use of the bench and how we bring on players potentially together rather than ones or twos, a real focus on what we do in that final quarter.\n\n\"I'd never seen the team do something like they did [against Argentina] and we just didn't have a response.\n\n\"Every time I've seen this team go behind, we have had a response. So that was disappointing. We learned a lot that day, things that will be really valuable when we go into the Six Nations.\"\n\nPodcast: Townsend speculation & bold team selection\n\nScotland leave out Van der Merwe, Kinghorn & Graham\n\nScotland's Townsend denies signing Newcastle deal\n\nScotland's rising star poised for sliding doors moment\n\nTownsend has named a surprising team for Scotland's Six Nations opener in Italy, leaving out Duhan van der Merwe, Darcy Graham and Blair Kinghorn, while including a strong contingent from in-form Glasgow Warriors.\n\nDespite Glasgow's storming season in both the Champions Cup and United Rugby Championship, Scottish expectations are still relatively low heading into the Six Nations, largely because of the underwhelming autumn series.\n\n\"We want to set out to play a consistent level of rugby close to our best,\" Townsend said when asked what success would look like in this year's tournament.\n\n\"I know if we say we're going to play our best rugby for five games, that's unrealistic, but a consistent level that puts us in positions to win.\n\n\"We believe in our squad. We believe in what they can achieve and what they've done at times for over 80 minutes.\n\n\"We know what we've got and we know we've got this run of games that we've got to attack with real confidence, but we also know all the other teams are saying the same things and they are planning to get three, four or five wins.\n\n\"But that's a great thing about the Six Nations, it's very competitive right now.\"\n\nScotland have lost only one of their past 15 matches against Italy, but that came on their last visit to the Stadio Olimpico in 2024.\n\nThat was another Scottish second-half collapse as the hosts came from behind to win 31-29.\n\nTownsend is not underestimating the Italians as the Scots aim to start well before facing England at Murrayfield and Wales in Cardiff.\n\n\"It's a tough one to play away from home against a team that's been more than competitive,\" Townsend said.\n\n\"We've had some real tough battles with them. They beat us in Rome two years ago. They're getting sell-outs in that stadium now. It's a really noisy atmosphere.\n\n\"They have a cohesive team and players who have played together for a number of years, real talented individuals.

I'm going to give it everything and if it doesn't work out, it's not meant to be'.\n\n\"I've tried to have that mindset all the time. It is something I love doing, but I just feel so privileged and lucky to have had the opportunity after the playing career.\n\n\"To get nine seasons and to be coming into 100 [matches in charge], it's above what I would have expected or dreamed of.\"",

    "fullText": "The Saudi Pro League has warned Cristiano Ronaldo \"no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club\" amid doubts over his future at Al-Nassr.\n\nThe Portugal forward, 41, was left out of Al-Nassr's squad for Monday's Saudi Pro League game against Al-Riyadh.\n\nPortuguese outlet A Bola, external reported Ronaldo refused to play, having grown dissatisfied with how the club was being run by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).\n\nBBC Sport has been told former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema's move to league leaders Al-Hilal from Al‑Ittihad earlier this week was the principle reason for Ronaldo's frustration at Al-Nassr.\n\nFrench striker Benzema, 38, scored a hat-trick on his debut for Al-Hilal in a 6-0 win over Al-Okhdood on Thursday.\n\nBoth Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal - the country's most successful club with 19 league titles - are among the teams controlled by the PIF, which also backs Newcastle United.\n\nRonaldo posted a picture of himself back in training on Wednesday, but BBC Sport understands Saudi Pro League officials are unsure if he will play against Al‑Ittihad on Friday.\n\nWhat is going on with Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia?\n\nIn a statement issued to BBC Sport, a Saudi Pro League spokesperson said: \"The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules.\n\n\"Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.\"\n\nRonaldo joined Al-Nassr in 2022 after leaving Manchester United mid-season, becoming the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of £177m, but has only won the Arab Club Champions Cup with them.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner signed a new two-year contract in June 2025.\n\nBefore he agreed the new deal, however, there was speculation he might leave Al-Nassr with a loan move to rivals Al-Hilal among those touted.\n\n\"Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al-Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition,\" added the Saudi Pro League spokesperson. \"Like any elite competitor, he wants to win.\n\n\"But no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club.\n\n\"Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.\"\n\nAl-Nassr only signed Iraq Under-23 midfielder Hayder Abdulkareem in the January transfer window.\n\nAl-Hilal are unbeaten in the league this season and lead with 50 points after 20 games, while Al-Nassr are four points behind in third place, although they have a game in hand.\n\nThe Saudi Pro League spokesperson said: \"The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.\n\n\"The focus remains on football - on the pitch, where it belongs - and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympics athlete, you pick yourself up and try again.",
    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training;  when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "fullText": "Jack Draper says he is \"winning by being here\" as he made an emphatic return after a lengthy injury lay-off to help Great Britain take control of their Davis Cup qualifying tie against Norway.\n\nBritish number one Draper has spent five months on the sidelines with a bruised bone in his service arm.\n\nHis comeback was delayed twice by the injury and he missed January's Australian Open to complete his recovery.\n\nHowever, he served well, moved sharply and showed some brutal ball-striking to bear Viktor Durasovic 6-2 6-2 in his first competitive match for 164 days.\n\nSterner tests will await world number 13 Draper, who is ranked 300 places above Durasovic, but he will be relieved to have rattled through a convincing win after a long spell out.\n\n\"Tennis is a bubble, and sometimes you can get distracted that it's all that matters in life,\" the 24-year-old told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.\n\n\"When you have time out, I used it wisely I think to try and make sure that when I try and come back to tennis, that I'm ready to go all the way again.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that I'm on a really good path. I'm winning by being here.\"\n\nCameron Norrie then gave Britain a 2-0 lead with a characteristically gritty 6-4 6-4 win over teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer.\n\nLloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash can wrap up the best-of-five tie for Britain at the earliest opportunity if they triumph in Friday's doubles.\n\nIf not, Draper and Norrie will have to take to the court again for the reverse singles.\n\nThe winner of the tie in Oslo will face either Australia or Ecuador for a place in November's eight-team Finals.\n\nDavis Cup qualifying: GB lead Norway 2-0 after Norrie & Draper win\n\nRaducanu storms into Transylvania semi-finals\n\nEnglishman Draper said he had \"lots of dark moments\" during the injury lay-off that disrupted his breakout season.\n\nDraper had won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French Opens before being impacted by the injury in his left arm.\n\nHe suffered a second-round exit at Wimbledon and played just one match after before ending his season early.\n\nThere were very few signs of rust against Durasovic, with Draper dropping just 10 points on serve, hitting eight aces and winning 88% of first-serve points.\n\nHe produced three glorious passing shots - two off the backhand and one off the forehand - and moved well behind the baseline to suffocate Durasovic.\n\nHe went a quick break up in both sets and did not face a single break point.\n\nDraper was only taken to deuce once, and that was when he served for the match at 5-2 up in the second. A thumping forehand and a long backhand from his opponent was enough to help the Briton wrap up victory in only 61 minutes.\n\n\"I definitely have to be wary of how the injury is progressing,\" Draper added.\n\n\"I wouldn't be back playing again if me and my team weren't really confident that I can start to build back on the tour again.\n\n\"I definitely have to be sensible at times.\"\n\nNorrie later came back from a 4-1 second-set deficit to see off world number 133 Budkov Kjaer.\n\nBudkov Kjaer, a former Wimbledon junior champion, converted just one of his four break opportunities against Norrie.\n\nDraper looked sharp on his return and there was little sign of rust in what turned out to be a very gentle stroll past Durasovic.\n\nThe 24-year-old had support from a vast travelling Lawn Tennis Association team as well as his new coach Jamie Delgado.\n\nPersonal coaches do not usually travel to Davis Cup ties, but this was the first chance Delgado has had to see Draper in action since succeeding James Trotman in the autumn.\n\nDraper and Delgado are scheduled to head to Rotterdam after this tie for the British number one's return to the ATP Tour.\n\nHow much to play, and how often to rest, will be a delicate balance to strike over the next few months.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Ireland's heavy defeat by France to open the Six Nations will only further press questions raised by a lacklustre autumn.",
    "fullText": "On an earlier than usual Six Nations opening night, Ireland fluffed their lines in Paris on Thursday, beginning their 2026 campaign with a resounding 36-14 defeat by France that was as bruising to the ego as it was the body.\n\nThese sides may have won the past four titles in this competition between them but, for the second season in a row, there was only one winner when they went head-to-head.\n\nAn Ireland performance that was described by their head coach Andy Farrell as lacking \"intent\" continued a number of worrying trends from both the autumn and prior.\n\nComing into the game as considerable underdogs, the head coach had tried to reframe the changing narrative as his side now being the hunter rather than hunted.\n\nFor much of the 80 minutes in Paris, they looked like easy prey for superior opposition.\n\n\"It's coming again next week [against Italy],\" former Ireland lock Donncha O'Callaghan told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This Irish team are on the ropes and everyone is coming after them - they might be the hunted again. They have to find the answers because Six Nations rugby is ruthless and they need to stop the rot.\"\n\nRuthless France thrash Ireland in Six Nations opener\n\nFrance comfortably beat Ireland in Six Nations opener\n\nIreland well beaten by France to start Six Nations - reaction\n\nWith Farrell rolling the dice in his selection - dropping James Lowe as well as giving Cian Prendergast a rare start - there were interesting subplots aplenty as the game neared.\n\nSuch was the nature of the Paris performance, however, that few such themes could be given fair scrutiny.\n\nIreland had picked a team to compete in the air but rarely challenged in that regard with the new-look back three of Jamie Osborne, Tommy O'Brien and Jacob Stockdale largely on the periphery.\n\nWhile the loss of both usual starting props to injury, as well as two back-ups on the loose-head side, was unwanted, it gave the opportunity for others to step up and show what they can do, yet the set-piece was rendered a virtual non-factor.\n\nIndeed, Ireland won a scrum penalty in the 45th minute but, such was the lack of pressure elsewhere, it was the first time Les Bleus had drawn a whistle from Karl Dickson.\n\nDiscipline had been a key area to improve after the autumn but, while Ireland did concede only six penalties, they frequently did not get close enough to infringe either, with 38 missed tackles on the night.\n\nIreland's failure to get to grips with the non-negotiables - what Farrell called the \"main part of the game\" - left little point in sifting through much else.\n\n\"I think you make your own luck in this game,\" said Farrell.\n\n\"Without the ball, I thought we lost that battle in the first half. The things like the high ball and winning the scraps on the floor, running through tackles or missing tackles etc - that's the main part of the game.\n\n\"We certainly came off second best in that regard in the first half. Our response was gallant, but that's not what we want to be, we don't want to be a responding team. We needed to show it from the get go.\"\n\nIrrespective of another World Cup quarter-final exit in 2023 - against, it should be remembered, a New Zealand side who produced a brilliant performance on the night - Ireland felt on par with the very best in the game just a little over two years ago.\n\nThey appeared to put paid to any notion of a World Cup hangover when they opened the 2024 Six Nations against France, winning 38-17 against 14 men in Marseille, but it has subsequently been a very different story.\n\nIn the nine games since against the four sides currently above them in the world rankings, Ireland have won two and lost seven.\n\nFive of the losses, and none of the wins, have been by margins of 10 points or more and there were times, especially when 29-0 down early in the second half, when this appeared the widest gap of the lot.\n\nIreland remain admirably consistent in winning the games that they should win. But winning those that they could win increasingly looks like a bridge too far.\n\nFew sides in the world could cope with losing three players in one position, especially one as specialised as loose-head prop.\n\nJeremy Loughman had just five caps before Thursday's game, while Michael Milne's only previous Tests were as a replacement against Georgia and Portugal.\n\nWhile that certainly speaks to Ireland's injury problems, it is worth noting that even before Ireland's loose-head stocks were decimated, Andrew Porter's two primary back-ups, Jack Boyle and Paddy McCarthy, still have just eight caps between them.\n\nThat can be said to be a legacy of the continued reliance on Cian Healy right up to the point of his retirement last year but the situation in not confined to just one position.\n\nInjuries are inevitable. Yet in the main, Ireland's squad - outside their starting XV and a handful of select others - feels underexposed to the highest level of Test rugby.\n\nFor instance, reserve scrum-half Craig Casey has been part of the squad for almost five years and won his 25th cap from the bench in the Stade de France but has never started a Six Nations game against opposition other than Italy - he saw only seven minutes of action on Thursday.\n\nNick Timoney led the resurgence off the bench. The unwaveringly consistent Ulster back row scored his side's first points of the game and led the belated charge at France.\n\nAlmost five years after his debut, and six months beyond his 30th birthday, this was his first Six Nations cap.\n\n\"You could use the excuses and they are there, the injuries, we haven't the depth of squad to go that deep, but there's been a fundamental thought of relying on the Leinster base and for the last few years that hasn't gone as well for the Leinster team,\" said O'Callaghan.\n\n\"You're trying to integrate players and it's just been too much of a gap.\"",

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.
