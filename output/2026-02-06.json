    "fullText": "The Premier League have confirmed the updated squad lists for the remainder of the 2025/26 season, with Arsenal making few changes to the senior squad list.\n\nWith no first-team signings in January, there was no one to add, though perhaps it’s worth noting that Mikel Merino remains on the list despite his long-term injury. So he’ll be eligible to play if and when he returns to fitness.\n\nOn the u21 list, Arsenal have added Evan Mooney and Jaden Dixon after their January moves from St. Mirren and Stoke City. So both will be eligible for Premier League action if called upon.\n\nThe good news with Mooney is that he’s joined before the end of the season in which he turned 18. That means if he spends the next three full seasons with Arsenal he’ll gain homegrown status, something he wasn’t eligible to get whilst playing in Scotland.\n\nIn the meantime, Mooney can be named in the unlimited u21 list, so he’ll never need to use up a non-homegrown senior squad spot.\n\nBack on the squad lists, Ethan Nwaneri has been named on Arsenal’s u21 list despite going out on loan. As mentioned, there’s no limit to the number of u21 players you can include, so there’s no negative consequence to leaving a player on there whilst on loan.\n\nMax Dowman isn’t included on the list, but he’s still eligible to play. The u21 list published by the Premier League only includes players on professional contracts and scholarship deals, and Dowman is still currently too young to begin his scholarship.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has urged fans to be patient with club-record signing Nick Woltemade now the rest of the Premier League is getting to know the German striker's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWoltemade made a fine start to his time in English football following his pre-season arrival from Stuttgart for a fee of £69 million ($94 million) with six goals in his first 11 games for northeast side Newcastle.\n\nBut the goals have dried up for the 23-year-old, who has failed to find the back of the net in his last 12 appearances\n\n\"He is young, (it's) a new league,\" Howe said of Woltemade in the build-up to Saturday's match at home to seventh-placed Brentford -- four positions above Newcastle in the table.\n\n\"He started so well and I think everybody expected that to continue but I think that is very difficult to do, as much as we wanted that to happen for him.\n\n\"He is getting to grips with the challenges of the Premier League -- the speed, the intensity and the physicality.\n\n\"And of course teams are getting to know him as well and I think that is the biggest challenge for him. Teams understand his game and what he wants to do so he has to find solutions the other way.\n\n\"You have to keep ahead of the other teams so there is work for him to do but I think he has done everything with such a great attitude and great way. That is the biggest thing for me he needs to do to be successful.\"\n\nNewcastle go into Saturday's match after the League Cup holders' defence of their first major domestic trophy in 70 years ended on Wednesday as Manchester City completed a 5-1 aggregate semi-final win.\n\nThat defeat at the Etihad Stadium led to intense social media speculation that the 48-year-old Howe had taken Newcastle as far as he can amid suggestions he could replace Thomas Tuchel as England manager after the World Cup.\n\nNewcastle, however, are just seven points off the top five and still involved in the Champions League -- they face Azerbaijani side Qarabag over two legs for a place in the last 16 later this month -- and the FA Cup.\n\nHowe, responding to all the commentary about his future at St James' Park, said: \"That's a surprise to me. I give my best to the football club every single day, to all the players and the staff. I try to be the best version of myself to inspire the team to win games.\n\n\"That's my only thought. I don't tend to look too far ahead, but I try to prepare and plan for the club to move forward in every sense. My individual future isn't really relevant.\n\n\"Who knows? I don't know my length of time here, I've got no idea. I just try to do my best every day until told differently.\"",

It will be Roebuck’s first appearance since starting the wing over the All Blacks in November.\n\nA setback for Feyi-Waboso is nonetheless a real shame for a player in excellent form for Exeter. The 23-year-old wing started all four of England’s games in November, scoring against Fiji and Argentina to help extend their winning run to 11 matches.\n\nRegular captain Maro Itoje will begin the match against Wales from the bench, with hooker Jamie George skippering the starting side.",

    "fullText": "Jeremy Jacquet will only be the beginning of Liverpool's summer arrivals.\n\nThe Reds have already agreed a deal for him to join the club in July. He's going to be an important addition in a key role where Liverpool are lacking depth.\n\nBut Jacquet is not the only arrival expected to walk through the doors at Anfield. Nor is he the only centre-back arrival expected to be coming to Liverpool in the summer.\n\nThe reality is that Ibrahima Konate could be on his way out as his contract expires and he's yet to extend. Joe Gomez is the subject of interest from several clubs and almost left to join AC Milan last summer.\n\nWith his contract expiring in 2027, it's a possibility Liverpool let him go as well.\n\nThis would require another addition at the back, and there is an obvious solution. Someone who can bring both experience and quality at the same time, while also not costing a lot of money for the Reds.\n\nThe obvious solution and who we think is going to be Liverpool's next transfer agreement after Jacquet is Marcos Senesi.\n\nHis contract expires in the summer, meaning he will be a free agent. He already has a lot of experience in the Premier League and he's also versatile, capable of playing in a number of different roles across the back four.\n\nMost importantly, Arne Slot knows him well. Senesi worked together with him at Feyenoord during the 2021/22 season before he departed the Dutch side.\n\nGiven Liverpool are going to have two very young centre-backs in Jacquet and Giovanni Leoni, bringing in Senesi makes a lot of sense.\n\nHe'll be 29-years-old by the time the summer comes rolling around. The Argentine is not someone Liverpool would normally look at. The club always has a long-term vision.\n\nBut sometimes you have to break your policy. James Milner, Wataru Endo and others are an example of this.\n\nWhen you're trying to build squad depth, having a player like Senesi, who is older and more trusted with a lot of experience under his belt is important.\n\nEspecially, if you're going to lose Konate and Gomez.\n\nIt's also important to mention that Senesi is an underrated player. He's been a key pillar for Bournemouth over the last couple of years and has often been their unsung hero.\n\nWhile Dean Huijsen and Ilyia Zabarnyi got most of the praise last season, Senesi more than played his part in a successful season for the Cherries.\n\nSo, this is a deal that just makes sense on so many levels. After Jacquet, we expect Senesi will be the next signing to walk through the doors at the AXA training centre.",

    "fullText": "Former Juventus midfielder Alessio Tacchinardi criticises Teun Koopmeiners, Lois Openda and Edon Zhegrova following the Old Lady’s Coppa Italia exit: ‘They add nothing, and Juve have a terrible month ahead.’\n\nJuventus faceda  Coppa Italia exit on Thursday, losing 3-0 against Atalanta in Bergamo.\n\nFormer Juventus midfielder Tacchinardi examined the game during SportMediaset’s post-match show, blaming the Old Lady’s reserves and focusing particularly on three players.\n\nEPA PHOTO EFE/MIGUEL RIOPA/MK-hh\n\n“The result was too harsh for Juve, because they put in a very good performance,” Tacchinardi said via Tuttosport.\n\n“They created a lot before the penalty, which, for me, was nonexistent. They are playing great football, but paid a high price because they were unable to finalise their attacks. After all, who wins is right.”\n\nJuventus coach Luciano Spalletti argued after the match that his players made the wrong decisions in the key moments of the game, contrary to Atalanta, who were clinical and converted most of their chances.\n\nJonathan David started the match in Bergamo last night, but failed to find the net. The Canada striker has been in good form in recent weeks, scoring four times in his last five Serie A appearances.\n\n“I think Juventus wanted a striker with different characteristics because he wants the ball inside the box and he fights, but it’s not enough, and he’s still shy up there,” Tacchinardi said.\n\nTURIN, ITALY – DECEMBER 02: Teun Koopmeiners of Juventus controls the ball while under pressure from Oier Zarraga of Udinese Calcio during the Serie C match between Ternana Calcio and Juventus Next Gen at Allianz Stadium on December 02, 2025 in Turin, Italy. (Photo by Valerio Pennicino/Getty Images)\n\n“Juventus have many tough games coming up, and David and Openda are not increasing their level. I see a player who puts in commitment, but is struggling. Juventus’ reserves are struggling, but Spalletti can’t use only 11 players and needs everyone to improve. Koopmeiners, Openda and Zhegrova are adding nothing, but Spalletti needs them because he has a terrible month ahead.”\n\nThe Serie A giants will host Lazio in their next Serie A match on Sunday before visiting Inter the following week.\n\nBefore the end of February, they’ll also meet Galatasaray twice in the Champions League play-off and host Como in Serie A.\n\nEven March won’t start softly as their first game next month will be away at Roma.",

    "fullText": "After just six races into the 2025 F1 season, Jack Doohan was replaced by Franco Colapinto at Alpine and started to fade from the scene soon after.\n\nColapinto’s pointless debut year did little to shift Alpine’s view, and by January, they had cut ties altogether so Doohan could look elsewhere.\n\nHe was linked with a move to Super Formula, but that didn’t pan out either. Three crashes at the same Suzuka corner during testing didn’t help his cause.\n\nThe 23-year-old has now been named Haas reserve driver for 2026, joining Ryo Hirakawa in the role. The target is clear: a path back onto the F1 grid. Recent remarks from team principal Ayao Komatsu about Esteban Ocon might provide exactly the kind of motivation Doohan needs to seize that chance.\n\nSpeaking to Motorsport Italia about Ocon’s first season with the team after his move from Alpine, Komatsu didn’t shy away from sharing some critical thoughts.\n\n“If you look purely at the sporting result, without going into the details, certainly no one is satisfied with Esteban’s sporting result last year,” Komatsu said.\n\n“He was the teammate of a rookie. Yes, an extraordinary rookie, but he still has 10 years of F1 behind him. He’s a race winner, he’s been on the podium. So we expected more from him.”\n\nIt wasn’t all on Ocon though. The team boss admitted there were issues on their side as well.\n\n“And obviously it’s not entirely his fault, it’s a 50-50 situation. Sometimes it’s the team: we weren’t able to give him a car he felt comfortable with, especially in qualifying.”\n\nThe problems seemed to hit harder at certain tracks than others. Komatsu pointed to Baku as a clear example.\n\nOllie Bearman happens to be one of Haas’ most successful drivers ever and won seven races over two seasons before joining Red Bull for 2026 where he continued his form by winning another three races.\n\nBut despite that context for Ocon, things are never simple in Formula 1 and there are always multiple reasons why things go wrong between both driver and team.\n\nOcon ended the 2025 F1 drivers’ championship in 15th place, three points and two spots behind rookie teammate Oliver Bearman.\n\nIt’s not a great look, especially as he was the only experienced driver to finish behind a rookie teammate over a full season, with Liam Lawson’s short stint at Red Bull being the only exception.\n\nEven more concerning was his form towards the end of the year. Ocon scored points in just five of the final 13 races, and if that trend continues into next season, Haas might start looking seriously at Jack Doohan as an alternative.\n\nOcon also expressed frustration with his car during an interview in Abu Dhabi. He said: “There’s a lot of instability. I feel like I don’t know how to drive anymore, like I can’t put a lap together. It’s been unmanageable for many races.”\n\nHe continued: “We can’t solve the problems, and the car doesn’t suit my driving style, so… we’re just slow. We’re very, very far from where we should be.”\n\nThis could be a make-or-break season for Ocon, with Komatsu potentially already considering Doohan as his successor if things don’t improve quickly.\n\nChristian Horner explains why Daniel Ricciardo never won a title at Red Bull\n\nLando Norris received a message from David Beckham after winning the F1 world title\n\nZak Brown says he would ‘love’ to work with Fernando Alonso on one project when he quits F1",

    "fullText": "Chelsea and Enzo Maresca parted ways after the manager reportedly clashed with club officials over how injuries were being managed.\n\nThe ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, had already built a reputation for this sort of thing. One example came before Thomas Tuchel was sacked when he was denied entry into the dressing room.\n\nAs for Maresca, despite winning two trophies in his previous campaign, it did not end much better. Reports pointed to ongoing disagreements over player injuries and medical decisions as the main cause.\n\nThere were even suggestions that a staff member was assigned to oversee how returning players were being reintroduced into matches.\n\nThe constant back-and-forth eventually led to the two sides splitting up.\n\nAnd the situation still seems to be troubling Maresca.\n\nMaresca, speaking at a recent awards event, hinted that he plans to remain in England.\n\nWhile at the same event, he also addressed some recent FIFA findings regarding injuries at Chelsea (per FCInter1908).\n\n“What do I think about the fact that we play too much? Either you adapt or you don’t train or you don’t play a player. The reality is that there are more and more games: with Chelsea playing in the Club World Cup we didn’t take holidays, retirement, everything is a consequence,” the Italian manager said.\n\n“A few days ago a FIFA study came out that indicated Chelsea and PSG as the teams with the most injuries, coincidentally the finalists of the World Cup. In short, either you adapt or you struggle.”\n\nMaresca’s concerns about player fatigue appear to be supported by recent data. He pointed to their run to the 2025 Club World Cup final as having a clear impact on squad fitness.\n\nThe Howden Men’s European Football Injury Index tracked 23 injuries for Chelsea between June and October 2025, representing a 44% rise from the previous season.\n\nMaresca often spoke about how fixture congestion was affecting his team, including an occasion when he was without seven or eight players for a match against Liverpool.\n\nThe recent addition of Jamie Gittens to an already extensive list brings everything into clearer focus.\n\nChelsea vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers preview, kick-off time, how to watch, and team news\n\nJamie Redknapp claims Liam Rosenior is misusing Chelsea’s best player",

    "fullText": "Travelling to Twickenham to face England has provided Welsh fans with some magic memories over the years.\n\nJPR Williams rampaging through the Red Rose defence, Adrian Hadley gliding over, Scott Williams' rip and rampage to Triple Crown glory and Gareth Davies and Dan Biggar breaking English hearts in their own World Cup in 2015.\n\nBut in 2026, the landscape looks very different.\n\nThere is continued discontent in Welsh rugby with Steve Tandy's side arriving in south-west London this weekend with faint hope of a positive result from fans, but little expectation from most observers.\n\nThis week's build-up to the Six Nations opener has been a sideshow to Welsh rugby's ongoing, deep-rooted crisis. The latest issue is the potential disappearance from professional rugby of Ospreys.\n\nWelsh rugby has given the nation much delight in the past, with famous victories and Grand Slam memories, but for many the life is now slowly being sucked out of the game in Wales.\n\nSo how has a nation that topped the world rankings less than seven years ago fallen so far, so quickly?\n\nEngland v Wales - your guide to the Six Nations date\n\nSix Nations preview & BBC pundit predictions\n\nWhat impact might 'unprecedented' Six Nations schedule have?\n\nOspreys have previously been the saviour of Welsh rugby at Twickenham.\n\nEighteen years ago, Wales travelled to face England in a Six Nations opener which was also Warren Gatland's first game in charge.\n\nThe New Zealander had spent less than two weeks with his new squad and famously went for familiarity, making the historic decision to start 13 Ospreys.\n\nCardiff flanker Martyn Williams and Scarlets wing Mark Jones, the current Ospreys head coach, were the exceptions.\n\nThe policy worked as Wales won 26-19 on their way to a Grand Slam. They were also Grand Slam winners in 2012 and 2019, with a further Six Nations title in 2013 and two World Cup semi-finals during that period.\n\nOspreys provided a large number of Gatland's players during his first stint in charge, as they became the most successful side since the inception of regional rugby 23 years ago, claiming four league titles between 2003 and 2012.\n\nThey produced Shane Williams, who won World Rugby's player of the year in 2008, while Ospreys' record appearance holder Alun Wyn Jones is also the world's most-capped international.\n\nThat is before you mention former star players such as Gavin Henson, Mike Phillips, Tommy Bowe, James Hook, Justin Marshall, Jerry Collins, Justin Tipuric, Adam Jones and Ryan Jones.\n\nThere are eight Ospreys players in the current squad and four involved against England this weekend, while Tandy himself is a former player and coach at the region.\n\nBut a rich recent history is now being threatened.\n\nPollock out to ruffle Six Nations feathers\n\nWales' Prem talent has England 'scratching heads'\n\nMan for man we're ready to stand up - Macleod\n\nAlun Wyn Jones was part of the Twickenham triumphs of 2008, 2012 and 2015 and was Wales' captain when they were top of the world.\n\nThis week he found himself sitting in a council meeting in Swansea - alongside current and former players - discussing whether Ospreys would still be a top-tier side after next year.\n\nThe news that Ospreys owners Y11 Sport and Media have been named as the preferred bidder by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) to buy rivals Cardiff, who went into administration in 2025, sent shockwaves through Welsh rugby.\n\nWith the WRU committed to cutting a men's professional side, Ospreys' existence is in doubt.\n\nThe region covers proud rugby areas like Swansea, Neath, Aberavon, Maesteg and Bridgend, and there has been widespread criticism of the WRU's plans from current players, coaches and staff, who say they have been left in the dark.\n\nThere has been political condemnation, petitions and protests from supporters and former players, public meetings and threats of legal action from Swansea Council.\n\nAs a result the proposed restructure of the Welsh game has attracted the most headlines in a troubled Six Nations build-up, tied in with a fascination about why Welsh rugby has fallen into the abyss.\n\nEnglish, French and Irish journalists and broadcasters have been travelling to Wales to try to establish the reasons for the Welsh game being in such a state.\n\nIn previous years, the prospects for a Six Nations opener against England at Twickenham, now called the Allianz Stadium, would have filled airwaves and column inches.\n\nOn this occasion, the match has not been mentioned in Wales as much as the off-the-field issues affecting Welsh rugby.\n\nThe belief in a huge gulf between the rivals has led to alarmingly few giving Tandy's team a hope against an England side who embarrassed Wales 10 months ago with a 10-try, 68-14 demolition victory in Cardiff.\n\n'No bigger game' - Rees-Zammit on England v Wales rivalry\n\nRees-Zammit at full-back for Wales against England\n\nWales are 'damaged', but dangerous - Genge\n\nThe need for change is evident even if people vehemently disagree on how it should be achieved, with no fans wanting to lose their team.\n\nWales topped the world rankings briefly in 2019 and won the Six Nations title two years later.\n\nIt has been an alarming decline since, except for a run to the 2023 World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nThe slump is the result of the almost collective retirement of a golden generation of players.\n\nThe WRU lack of investment in the professional sides in recent years and the pathway intended to develop the next raft of stars has also contributed.\n\nWales men have lost 21 out of their past 23 internationals, with their only victories coming against Japan.\n\nThe various defeats included an unprecedented 18-match Test losing sequence and record home losses against England, Argentina and South Africa.\n\nWales have not won a Six Nations match since March 2023, when they beat Italy in Rome, with a record of 11 successive defeats resulting in two winless tournaments and consecutive Wooden Spoons.\n\nWales have not won a home Six Nations game since defeating Scotland in February 2022.\n\nIt is the Principality Stadium stage where Wales' plight could be most visible during the next six weeks. Wales have home matches against France, Scotland and Italy, with ticket sales slow.\n\nMore than 50% of Welsh rugby's turnover comes from revenue from Wales men's internationals.\n\nFans walking away could hit the Welsh game in the pocket. But walking away they are and rugby is no longer the be-all and end-all in Welsh sport.\n\nLast month, a parliamentary committee looking into the state of Welsh rugby was told by WRU chair Richard Collier-Keywood that the body retains the support of the fans.\n\nThat raised more than a few eyebrows, while Collier-Keywood is facing the prospect of a vote of no-confidence at a potential extraordinary general meeting with current faith and trust in the governing body questionable.\n\nThe union says it is trying to transform the struggling Welsh game by making hard decisions, including the loss of a professional side.\n\nIt argues two critical elements needed to sustain four strong teams are in short supply: enough money and quality players.\n\nThere are those who doubt the rationale behind losing a team and many who believe the union lacks the capability and knowledge to oversee the huge project.\n\nThe WRU's continued silence is also a problem, with no interviews given for the last few months by the hierarchy.\n\nThere have only been statements, prompting accusations of little transparency or clarity levelled at the governing body.\n\nThe continued controversies are not exactly setting up Wales' players to succeed.\n\nSwansea Council say they 'were told Ospreys wouldn't exist'\n\nOspreys fans ramp up protest against WRU and Y11\n\nWRU accused of 'malicious cultural vandalism'\n\nFormer Wales and British and Irish Lions centre Jamie Roberts is one of the 12 WRU board members.\n\nHe is one of the nation's most decorated players in the professional era but is now known for his union role.\n\nSo Roberts was part of the board that voted for the culling of one region and for Ospreys' owners to take over Cardiff, decisions which could contribute to ending Ospreys' time as a professional side.\n\nOspreys fans made their feelings known at a peaceful, but forceful, protest before last week's derby against Dragons in Bridgend, where Roberts was working as a television pundit and was booed by home supporters.\n\nThe move prompted one Welsh commentator to remark: \"Sport is meant to be fun. Welsh rugby is just so toxic.\"\n\nYou cannot accuse Welsh rugby of being boring, but it does not bring much enjoyment right now.\n\nWhether that can start to change this weekend, in Tandy's first Six Nations game in charge as Wales aim to build on some positive aspects of the previous autumn, remains to be seen.\n\nTandy has experienced a baptism of fire since starting as he aims to rekindle a struggling side, while navigating off-the-field problems that are not of his making.\n\nIf he could somehow deliver a win over England and provide one of the biggest upsets in Welsh rugby history - what a catalyst that could be.\n\nThe same problems would remain, but that glimmer of hope would return. How Welsh rugby needs it.",

    "fullText": "Kings' Artemi Panarin has a mascot problem with jersey number 72 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nArtemi Panarin got the contract extension he was seeking upon his trade to the Los Angeles Kings from the New York Rangers.\n\nBut the jersey number he wants? That's complicated.\n\nPanarin wants to wear 72, which is the number he wore in Chicago.\n\nIt's already taken with the Kings, though... by the mascot!\n\nThe mascot's name is Bailey. He's named for the late scout, Garnet 'Ace' Bailey.\n\nSupposedly, Bailey wears 72 to represent the ideal or average temperature in Los Angeles.\n\nThe team is leaning in to the dispute:\n\nPanarin, I’m listening… pic.twitter.com/5q7NuCkotM\n\n— Bailey LA Kings (@BaileyLAKings) February 6, 2026\n\nMORE: How Connor McDavid is to the Oilers what Josh Allen is to the Bills\n\nClearly, the number a mascot wears doesn't actually determine what Panarin can or can't do. The mascot isn't on the official roster or on the ice during games, so there's no true logistical issue for the hockey team.\n\nIt does make sense for the Kings to at least have some fun with this. They could do a new number reveal for Bailey, if they want, and make a whole promotional deal about it.\n\nIt seems highly unlikely that Panarin wouldn't get the number he wants just because of a mascot.\n\nEither way, the Kings have some time to work through this. With the Olympic break now on hand, they can goof around on this front for a couple weeks before having to unveil Panarin on the ice.\n\nBlues' huge asking price for Robert Thomas revealed\n\nDougie Hamilton's contract is a big problem\n\nFlames make up their mind on trading Blake Coleman\n\nSabres face tricky reality on Alex Tuch trade\n\nMattias Samuelsson is doing something no other D-man in the NHL is doing",

    "fullText": "The reserve team of Girona FC travels to the Catalan capital with the aim of earning points in a very demanding visit to Narcís Sala, where UE Sant Andreu is always one of the toughest opponents in the Segona RFEF.\n\nThe Girona B arrives after losing three points in the last play of the match against Reus. The visit to Sant Andreu comes at a crucial moment in the season, where every point away from home is golden to aim for a higher position in the standings and to move away from the relegation zone.\n\nFor their part, Sant Andreu arrives as one of the favorites to achieve promotion, strong at home and accustomed to imposing their rhythm in decisive matches. Additionally, they will have the support of their fans, who always make matches difficult for opposing teams.\n\nThe new signing, Javi González, who scored a goal on his debut, stated:\n\n‘We will try to earn the three points, we know it will be very difficult, but we will work all week to fight for it.’\n\nIn the last encounter between the two teams, it was the first leg match, where the Girona team won 2-1 in Vidreres against the quadribarrat team and will try to repeat it this Sunday at 6:00 PM.

    "fullText": "Eddie Howe says he is surprised by talk of him leaving Newcastle.\n\nFollowing Newcastle United’s Carabao Cup exit as they lost 5-1 on aggregate to Manchester City, there has been speculation that he may leave the club at the end of the season.\n\nAsked about the comments ahead of Newcastle’s clash against Brentford, Howe shut down the talk of an exit.\n\n“That’s a surprise to me. I give my best to the football club every single day, to all the players and the staff,” he said.\n\n“I try to be the best version of myself to inspire the team to win games. That’s my only thought.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t tend to look too far ahead, but I try to prepare and plan for the club to move forward in every sense. My individual future isn’t really relevant.\n\n“Who knows? I don’t know my length of time here, I’ve got no idea. I just try to do my best every day until told differently,” he concluded.\n\nHowe’s side are now four games without a win, having lost to Liverpool at Anfield in between their two-legged defeat at the hands of City, as well as a loss to Aston Villa at the end of January.\n\nNewcastle have dropped down to 11th in the table, but a win could see them leapfrog Brentford in seventh. They have struggled with injuries this season, and will be without Anthony Gordon at St James’ Park as the winger came off injured in the semi-final second leg.",

    "fullText": "The NBA MVP race is beginning to take real shape, with clear frontrunners separating themselves as the season moves past its midpoint. Betting odds now reflect not just raw statistics, but team success, narrative momentum, and nightly impact across the league. From established superstars to rising faces driving unexpected contenders, the MVP conversation is deeper than it first appears.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander sits comfortably atop the MVP futures market after back-to-back elite seasons and leading Oklahoma City to one of the league’s best records. His scoring prowess and all-around impact have triggered MVP buzz, and he’s continued to show growth as a facilitator and defender. The narrative around SGA as a legitimate back-to-back MVP contender has only strengthened as the Thunder emerge as a true title contender. Voters often reward both team success and statistical dominance, and he delivers on both fronts.\n\nNikola Jokić remains one of the most uniquely dominant players in NBA history — a perennial MVP presence with a rare combination of scoring, playmaking and rebounding for a center. Even with Denver not topping the standings, his efficiency and court vision keep him squarely in the award conversation. Jokic’s ability to influence winning in so many statistical areas makes him irresistible to a certain slice of voters. His experience and broad skill set mean he can surge late if Nuggets’ team performance improves.\n\nLuka Dončić continues his MVP-caliber rise in Los Angeles, producing gaudy scoring, assist and rebound numbers night after night. His March and April performances often define MVP narratives, and if he carries the Lakers deep into the standings, his odds will tighten. Dončić’s marketability and high-usage role give him a real story appeal with voters — a flashy star leading an iconic franchise. Sustained excellence and healthy availability position him as the most compelling challenger behind the favorites.\n\nCade Cunningham has steadily climbed MVP boards by turning Detroit into an unexpectedly strong team in the East. His balance of scoring, playmaking, and defensive improvement has transformed the Pistons into a top-tier squad. While Pistons’ overall reputation may lag behind some contenders, Cunningham’s leadership is undeniable. Should Detroit continue exceeding expectations, he stands to benefit significantly in MVP voting.\n\nJaylen Brown’s MVP case hinges on Boston’s success and consistency as a top East seed while carrying increased offensive responsibility. A gifted two-way wing, Brown’s metrics often reflect efficient scoring and defensive impact. If he sustains high usage with balanced efficiency and Celtics stay elite, his narrative will improve. Voters may reward his often underappreciated contributions if Brown becomes the clear focal point of a championship-level team.\n\nTyrese Maxey’s odds are long primarily due to team context — a 76ers squad that has struggled for consistency — but his individual production has been impressive. Known for his scoring outbursts and clutch shooting, Maxey can light up the stat sheet any night. For MVP consideration, sustained team success is critical, which currently limits his market position. Still, as a budding star, Maxey’s profile could rise if Philly shifts toward a more impactful regular season.\n\nAnthony Edwards has the raw star talent to climb MVP boards — elite scoring, athleticism and flair for big moments — but his MVP odds reflect team inconsistencies and limited playoff expectations. If Minnesota makes a leap into the top echelon of the West, his value proposition improves dramatically. Edwards’ personality and highlight-level scoring give him a narrative edge, but MVP voters typically balance that with team success. Watch for late-season surges to flip his standing.\n\nJalen Brunson’s MVP floor rests more on his excellence than his current team’s record position — the Knicks’ defensive identity doesn’t always translate to traditional MVP narratives. As a steady veteran leader with efficient scoring and playmaking, Brunson ticks many boxes, though sustaining this into MVP consideration requires Knicks to inch into elite territory. His narrative hinges on exceeding expectations with a gritty, team-first profile.\n\nDonovan Mitchell’s MVP odds reflect Cavs’ standing as competitive but not among the league’s elite, limiting his case despite strong perimeter scoring. Known for explosive offense, Mitchell still needs a breakout franchise season to garner MVP traction. If Cleveland shocks top franchises and Mitchell pushes them, his narrative could shift. Right now, he represents a long-shot with scoring appeal but modest MVP viability.\n\nKawhi Leonard’s MVP odds are more symbolic than realistic — injuries and limited availability make sustained MVP candidacy unlikely. When healthy, he’s a two-time Finals MVP and perennial All-Star with elite two-way impact. However, MVP awards rarely go to players with restricted games, especially given Clippers’ middling results. Leonard’s narrative is better suited to playoff impact than regular-season hardware.\n\nWhile the odds suggest a favorite, the MVP race is far from settled, especially with months of high-leverage basketball still ahead. Late-season surges, injuries, and shifts in the standings can dramatically reshape voter perception. As history has shown, the final stretch often decides who turns elite production into league-wide recognition.\n\nThe post NBA MVP odds as of February 6, 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich are reportedly keeping a close eye on Inter Milan defender Yann Aurel Bisseck as they begin shaping their future plans at the back.\n\nAccording to reports from German outlet Sport1, via FCInterNews, the Bavarian giants have added Bisseck to their shortlist of potential defensive reinforcements.\n\nAt this stage, however, there have been no direct contacts with either the player or Inter, with Bayern still in the monitoring phase as they evaluate multiple profiles.\n\nThe Bundesliga champions are exploring centre-back options despite receiving a positive signal from Dayot Upamecano over a contract renewal.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 09: Yann Aurel Bisseck of FC Internazionale looks on during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SS Lazio at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on November 09, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nWith that situation moving in the right direction, Bayern are still keen to strengthen and refresh their defensive department, particularly with an eye on the long term.\n\nBisseck’s name has emerged alongside another highly rated youngster, Luka Vuskovic. The 18-year-old is currently at Hamburg on loan from Tottenham Hotspur and is considered one of the most promising defensive talents in Europe.\n\nFor Bayern, this is very much a phase of information gathering rather than active negotiation. For Inter, meanwhile, interest from one of Europe’s biggest clubs underlines Bisseck’s growing reputation after establishing himself as a reliable option in Simone Inzaghi’s defensive rotations.\n\nWhether Bayern’s interest develops into something more concrete will likely depend on how their internal renewal talks and summer priorities evolve in the coming months.",

    "title": "Inside the Milan Olympic Village: Real beds, free tech and other athlete perks",
    "description": "The Olympic Village in Milan offers plenty of perks and amenities for athletes, including free food, stress plants and beds that are not made of cardboard.",
    "fullText": "The Olympic Village rises above the security fences that surround it, a collection of structures both temporary and permanent where the athletes will reside over the next two-plus weeks at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nOut on the sidewalk and behind barriers, lookie-loos crane their necks for a peek at the competitors, while pin traders mill through the churning crowd in hopes of making a souvenir swap.\n\nBut what’s it like inside the Village, where the medal hopefuls work out, mingle and relax before some of the biggest moments of their young lives?\n\n“The best part is the food,” said Micah Moore, bobsledder from Trinidad and Tobago, echoing what people have said for centuries about Italy. “Nutrition is so important. And everything you see is free.”\n\nAh, yes, gratis. That’s a common theme in the Olympic Village, where corporate sponsors of the Games have gotten creative with their free goods and services — and swag bags — for the athletes.\n\nThere are multiple rooms devoted to gaming, with virtual-reality glasses over here, and “Call of Duty” over there, and overstuffed chairs and couches everywhere. There are the typical role-playing video games, along with virtual tennis and dirtbike riding, but conspicuously absent are any winter sports. Organizers explain the rooms are meant to be an escape from that all-encompassing world.\n\nSpeaking of escapes, Corona Cero — the non-alcoholic version of that beer — has constructed a pair of round, glass-roofed wooden structures that feel like part-ski lodge, part-yurt and are filled with plants and comfortable seats and soft music where the athletes can kick back with a chilled beverage. (It has been mild weather for a Milan winter.)\n\nThere are rolled-up yoga mats in the corner, and a chalkboard outside lists times for a breathwork class with Sarah, a soundbath session with Guilia, and restorative yoga and meditation in the afternoon.\n\nNot far away, and made of similar wood, is a wagon labeled the Cero (“zero”) Stress Plant Shop. There, an athlete can adopt a houseplant for the duration of his or her stay, nurturing it for a couple weeks before it’s donated to a local charity, perhaps for auction. The competitor is given a pack of seeds upon departure to grow the same plant at home.\n\nFour-time Olympian Madison Chock said she was “pleasantly surprised” the competitors could foster plants. She said the plant that she shares with husband/ice dance partner Evan Bates is named “Stenry,” a combination of their dogs’ names, Stella and Henry. She said the plant is thriving, although she doesn’t know the variety, only that it’s dangly and has leaves that cascade down like a waterfall.\n\nOf course, sitting around and watching plants grow can get a little dull. This week, the arriving athletes seemed more interested in getting accustomed to their free Samsung phones and using their own hand gestures to direct a robotic hand behind glass to pick up a plastic ball encasing a mystery Olympic pin. The AI demonstration by Alibaba Cloud is a futuristic version of those arcade games where you maneuver a metal claw to grab a stuffed animal.\n\nThe Olympics is filled with young, beautiful athletes, so it’s no wonder two of the more popular pop-ups in the Village provide skin and haircare products and services. KIKO Milano has cosmetic stations where athletes can schedule makeup appointments — very popular before the Opening Ceremonies — and Procter & Gamble has built a “Champions Clubhouse” for scalp massages, hair washing and styling, along with barbers for personalized shaving and beard care.\n\nThere are P&G swag bags of course — some athletes arrived without any toiletries — and KIKO engraves complimentary tubes of lipstick with the names of competitors.\n\nCoca-Cola takes that engraving process a step further with a machine that snaps a photo of the user, then embosses that picture onto the iconic red can of soda.\n\nBeyond the keepsakes, the Olympic organizers have gotten an essential right in the Village. Gone are the flimsy cardboard bedframes of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, held during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere was speculation at the time that those beds were designed to discourage casual sex among the competitors because the frames would break apart at the slightest provocation. Organizers brushed off those rumors, heralding the beds as sturdy and eco-friendly.\n\nRegardless, when she arrived at this year’s Olympic Village, Britain figure skater Phebe Bekker posted a Tik-Tok video from her room that answered a popular question among the athletes, many of whom found the cardboard beds uncomfortable.\n\n“We’re looking good,” she said, knocking on her wooden bedframe and testing the mattress. “Heard it here first, there are no cardboard beds, as far as I know.”\n\nJust like the slogan of that popular soft drink. It’s the real thing.\n\nStaff writer Thuc Nhi Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Several Italy internationals moved clubs during the January transfer window, but which ones will be hoping to earn more regular minutes ahead of a potential World Cup campaign in the summer of 2026?\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – JANUARY 25: Giacomo Raspdori of Atalanta celebrates scoring his team’s third goal with teammate Nikola Krstovic of Atalanta during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and Parma Calcio 1913 at Gewiss Stadium on January 25, 2026 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nGiacomo Raspadori is back in Serie A after a short-lived, six-month spell in LaLiga with Atletico Madrid. The two-time Scudetto winner struggled to break into Diego Simeone’s first-team plans in the Spanish capital and was limited to just one start from a possible 18 league matches prior to his joining Atalanta.\n\nRaspadori has already featured in two Serie A matches for Atalanta, starting and scoring in their most recent match against Pisa, which ended in a resounding 4-0 victory for La Dea.\n\nHe has already been a regular in Gennaro Gattuso’s Italy national team squad and now just needs a consistent run of games before becoming a sure-fire pick for the 2026 World Cup squad assuming that Italy qualify.\n\nOfficial: Lorenzo Lucca joins Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy from Napoli (picture: www.nottinghamforest.co.uk)\n\nIt had been a disappointing season at Napoli for the towering centre-forward, who has since joined Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy.\n\nNapoli brought in both Lucca and Rasmus Hojlund to strengthen their options at centre-forward over the summer, but even after a serious injury to Romelu Lukaku the week before the season began, Lucca was limited to just four starts in Serie A and none since the end of October.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Lucca will become a regular starter in the Premier League under Sean Dyche, but if he is given regular minutes, he will certainly be an option for Gattuso to consider in Italy’s slightly understocked centre-forward department.\n\nDaniel Maldini wears the Lazio jersey\n\nAnother attacker hoping to impress ahead of the World Cup is Daniel Maldini, who joined Lazio on loan with a potential obligation to buy from Atalanta during the January window.\n\nThe son of Italy legend Paolo Maldini was limited to just three Serie A starts with Atalanta during the first half of the season, but looks set to be handed more consistent opportunities under Maurizio Sarri at the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nThere have even been suggestions that Sarri could look to deploy Maldini as a false nine.\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JANUARY 27: Marco Brescianini of ACF Fiorentina battles for the ball with Nico Paz of Como 1907 during the Coppa Italia match between of ACF Fiorentina and of Como 1907 at Stadio Artemio Franchi on January 27, 2026 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)\n\nAnother Italy international who left Atalanta in January was Brescianini, who has joined Fiorentina on loan with an option and potential obligation to buy.\n\nBrescianini has already earned more minutes over his first four games with Fiorentina than he had done in his last four months with Atalanta, earning his first league start since October during La Viola’s recent 2-1 loss against Napoli.\n\nBrescianini still faces a difficult task to break into the Italy midfield department with stiff competition from the likes of Nicolo Barella, Sandro Tonali, Manuel Locatelli, Davide Frattesi, Bryan Cristante and Samuele Ricci.\n\nOfficial: Diego Coppola joins Paris FC from Brighton & Hove Albion (@Diegocoppolass via Instagram)\n\nDiego Coppola has taken the decision to move away from the Premier League after six months on the south coast with Brighton and Hove Albion. He had to wait until December to earn his first starts in the English top flight, and has since joined Paris FC on loan, where he will team up with fellow Italy representatives Ciro Immobile and Luca Koleosho.\n\nCoppola has two Italy caps to his name at the age of 22, and will be hoping for more regular minutes in Ligue 1 to challenge the likes of Alessandro Bastoni, Alessandro Buongiorno, Riccardo Calafiori and Gianluca Mancini for a spot in a potential World Cup squad.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United host Brentford at St James’ Park this weekend as both sides return their focus to the Premier League.\n\nFor Newcastle United, the match marks a chance to reset after their Carabao Cup campaign ended in disappointment during the week.\n\nEddie Howe’s side were knocked out convincingly by Manchester City, a result that extended a worrying run of form across competitions.\n\nThat defeat leaves Newcastle winless in four matches and searching for rhythm as the league season enters a crucial phase.\n\nTheir recent Premier League form has been inconsistent, with defensive lapses and missed chances undermining momentum.\n\nSitting in mid-table, Newcastle United are not yet out of the European conversation, but the gap to the top six remains a concern.\n\nReturning to St James’ Park may offer some comfort, given the points they have traditionally accumulated at home.\n\nHowever, recent home defeats have shown that Newcastle’s fortress is no longer quite as secure as it once appeared.\n\nStanding in their way are a Brentford side arriving with renewed confidence after a statement victory last weekend.\n\nThe Bees bounced back from a brief dip in form by beating Aston Villa away from home despite playing an entire half with ten men.\n\nThat result underlined Brentford’s resilience and tactical discipline, qualities that have defined their season.\n\nKeith Andrews’ side have quietly become one of the league’s most efficient teams over recent weeks.\n\nOnly the very top sides have collected more points than Brentford across the last two months.\n\nDefensive solidity has been key, with the Bees conceding fewer goals than almost anyone in that period.\n\nBrentford currently sit just outside the European places and remain firmly in contention for a historic qualification push.\n\nTheir away form has also improved significantly, with recent trips yielding both points and confidence.\n\nThe reverse fixture earlier this season saw Brentford beat Newcastle United comfortably, which will not have been forgotten.\n\nHistory, however, leans heavily in Newcastle’s favour at St James’ Park, particularly against London-based opposition.\n\nEddie Howe’s side have generally dominated home meetings with teams from the capital.\n\nThat record will be tested by a Brentford side increasingly comfortable against established Premier League clubs.\n\nNewcastle’s challenge will be to respond positively to cup disappointment without allowing frustration to creep into their performance.\n\nFor Brentford, the objective is to keep the game tight and exploit any uncertainty in Newcastle’s back line.\n\nTheir confidence suggests they will not arrive merely to contain.\n\nBoth teams have plenty at stake, making this an intriguing contest as the Premier League weekend unfolds.",

The company has launched verified profiles and brands in the fourth quarter and plans to add \"bot verification\" and labelling as a next step.\n\n\"It doesn't mean we have to outlaw entirely,\" he said about AI use on the platform. \"It just needs to be marked as what it is because there are times when it's helpful.\"\n\nReddit has rolled out several AI features since 2023, including AI-powered search results that summarize discussions and content translation. It also uses AI to improve content recommendations and for ad targeting.\n\nThe company reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and beat analyst estimates for both revenue and profit. Revenue for the quarter rose 70% year on year to $726 million, while net income rose 255% to $252 million.\n\nReddit's stock rose 5% after hours on Thursday, but is down 34% so far this year, as part of the broader sell-off in software stocks.",

Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, while trade between the two countries could also come to a halt, Sestanovich added.\n\nThat would come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, sweeping Western sanctions and lower oil prices are weighing on budget revenues that fund President Vladimir Putin's war chest. In January, Russia's oil revenue plunged to its lowest level in over five years.\n\nAt least one Russian state-owned oil company has moved to ringfence its exposure. Last month, Roszarubezhneft said that all of its Venezuelan assets are owned by the Russian state.",

    "description": "Dr. Homoud Aldahash sat three meters away from his patient as he removed a brain tumor via a robot.",
    "fullText": "When Dr. Homoud Aldahash started the three-hour process of removing a tumor about the size of a walnut from a patient's brain, it was an experience unlike any other in his 25 years as a neurosurgeon.\n\nIt wasn't Aldahash's gloved hands slicing 68-year-old Mohammed Almutrafi's right frontal lobe, but surgical instruments attached to a set of robotic arms, which Aldahash controlled from a console where he sat three meters away.\n\nAlmutrafi was referred to Aldahash by his primary care doctor after experiencing chronic headaches and poor concentration that seemed to be getting worse. The referral culminated in what would become the world's first remote robotic brain surgery, performed late last year.\n\nWhile putting a robot in between a patient and their brain surgeon sounds risky (and it is), Aldahash, a consultant neurosurgeon at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Saudi Arabia, told Business Insider that Almutrafi recovered four times as fast as the average patient.\n\nWhy? The robot shock-absorbed any tremors or sudden movements Aldahash may have made, allowing him to make more precise movements and therefore fewer micro-injuries to the surrounding brain tissues, which can prolong the recovery process.\n\n\"It's like an extension of the surgeon's arms,\" Aldahash said, \"but they're much more stable than the surgeon's arms. It only transmits steady, smooth movements that help you in performing your surgery.\"\n\nThe console consisted of an immersive screen that projected a live feed of the brain via cameras, and a control panel from which Aldahash controlled the robotic arms. The live feed is 3D, and the surgeon can zoom in up to 10x from any direction.\n\nThese steady movements, Aldahash believes, enabled Almutrafi to go home less than 24 hours after his surgery, when a typical window is 48 to 72 hours.\n\nThe operation needs to be repeated on many more patients before this claim can be validated, but Aldahash is hopeful.\n\nThe robot, called Da Vinci, is already used in many hospitals for general, colorectal, urology, and gynecology surgery. This, however, is the first time it has been used for the complex practice of brain surgery.\n\nWidespread use could mean shorter recovery times, less post-op pain for patients, and greater overall access to the procedure, Aldahash said.\n\n\"I think this is going to impact patients all over the world, hopefully in the near future. It was a moment of pride,\" Aldahash said.\n\nAlthough robotic brain surgery is in its infancy, this marks a step toward better access to high-quality neurosurgery, neurosurgeons who were not involved in Almutrafi's surgery told Business Insider.\n\nThe brain is \"a highly eloquent organ in a tight box,\" said Kevin O'Neill, a consultant neurosurgeon at Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College, London, and the chairman of the UK-based charity, Brain Tumor Research Campaign. He said that surgeons need to be extremely accurate when navigating the procedure. Still, not all surgeons are equally skilled, meaning patient outcomes can vary.\n\n\"There are individual variances. But with robotics, what you're doing is standardizing that and eliminating some of those variances,\" he said, referring to the varying skillsets of neurosurgeons.\n\nGiulio Anichini, a consultant neurosurgeon at Cork University Hospital, Ireland, and an honorary research fellow at Imperial College London, said he felt \"cautiously optimistic\" about what the procedure could mean for the future of brain surgery.\n\nThe patient's tumor was located on the surface of the brain, making it relatively simple to remove in comparison to tumors located in deeper and less accessible areas, he said. Provided that there are no complications, Anichini said he has seen patients who were recovering from this type of procedure go home after 24 hours.\n\n\"I'm not entirely sure that's all due to the Da Vinci,\" he said of the patient's short recovery time. He added: \"I don't want to sound overly critical about this. It is really impressive what they did.\"\n\nLooking further ahead, the successful remote surgery could signify a step toward a world in which neurosurgeons can operate on patients from different cities, countries, or even continents, Anichini said.\n\nOften, \"there is one neurosurgery centre for a big, big population, sometimes very remote,\" he said. \"If you have surgeons that can perform movements more quickly and more safely, and you can do it even remotely, you have a massive outreach of good quality care.\"",

    "description": "After co-creating Amazon Alexa, William Tunstall-Pedoe became an angel investor. When he started his second business, he drew on the invaluable experience of his mentees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, an angel investor and founder based in the UK. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2012, I sold my first startup, Evi, to Amazon. It later became Alexa.\n\nThat gave me the capital to invest in the next generation of startups when I left Amazon in 2016. I leaned into that opportunity, becoming both a mentor and a very active angel investor.\n\nIt was one of the best experiences I've had for career development, because I saw almost every situation that a startup can encounter, both good and bad.\n\nWhen I left Amazon, I suddenly found myself with an empty calendar.\n\nI wanted to take a break — six months or so — but I still needed to do something with my days. My calendar filled up faster than I expected.\n\nI started saying yes to things I would have turned down while working at Amazon. I was invited to a party in San Francisco, which is a long way to go when you live in the UK, but I went anyway. I booked a hotel for a couple of weeks and let my time fill up with meetings and other activities.\n\nThe year I left Amazon, 2016, turned out to be a really extraordinary time for me, when I traveled a lot and did some very interesting things.\n\nOne of those was being invited to help the Creative Destruction Lab, a seed-stage program for scalable science and technology-based ventures, founded in 2012 by economists at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\nThe premise was simple: mentors who successfully launched companies, like me, provided startups with expertise. Every few months, the mentors and startups would meet to set clear objectives for the next stage of development.\n\nIt was a bit like the \"Weakest Link.\" We'd cut companies, sometimes if they'd fallen short of their goals, at each meeting. Over the course of about nine months, the cohort would narrow, and mentor time and resources would be focused on fewer and fewer businesses.\n\nI did this for about six years. I would fly back and forward from London to Toronto every few months, making angel investments in dozens of promising companies, and for another two years when the program moved to the University of Oxford in 2019.\n\nAround the same time, I became involved with Cambridge Angels, an invite-only network of experienced investors, which gave me exposure to a wide range of early-stage companies and investors.\n\nI knew I wanted to be a founder again one day, but waiting turned out to be the right decision. My time as a mentor and angel investor was great preparation.\n\nWhen I founded my second startup, UnlikelyAI, in 2019, the experience was very different from the first time. I still made mistakes and ran into problems, but I was no longer a novice founder with no support.\n\nThis time, I had the capital to fund the business myself for a while. When I later raised a friends-and-family round, it was largely made up of prominent angel investors I'd met through mentoring and angel investing.\n\nAs a second-time founder, not only did I have a decade of experience from my first startup, but I also had something to complement it: the invaluable, vicarious experience of mentoring hundreds of other startups.",

    "title": "Canadians are staying away from the US — and the drop in travel is getting hard to ignore",
    "description": "Statistics Canada data show fewer Canadians traveling and returning from the US, amid ongoing border fears, tariffs, and the \"Buy Canadian\" movement.",
    "fullText": "Canadians aren't visiting the US as much as they used to.\n\nData from Statistics Canada up to November showed that fewer Canadians returned from the US — indicating fewer visited the US — than in the past couple of years.\n\nJulian Karaguesian, a visiting lecturer in the economics department at McGill University in Montreal and former special advisor in the International Trade and Finance Branch in the Department of Finance Canada, told Business Insider that several factors are contributing to reduced Canadian travel to the US, including an immigration crackdown and President Donald Trump's rhetoric on both trade and turning the country into the 51st US state.\n\n\"We started to see from summer onwards, a lot of protests, a lot of activity by ICE, rhetoric and talk about calling in the National Guard to clean up cities,\" Karaguesian said. \"I think that scared away a lot of tourists.\"\n\nThe number of Canadians returning from the US plunged during the pandemic, and never truly recovered to its pre-pandemic average. After some recovery, it took a massive slip in early 2025 and is down about a quarter from a year ago in November. Statistics Canada data also showed that US residents entering Canada haven't had as large a drop from the start of the year as Canadian residents returning did.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadians are doubling down on what Canada has to offer. Statistics Canada said domestic travel in the second quarter of 2025 was 10.9% higher than a year ago. Over a third of the domestic travel was characterized as holiday, leisure, and recreation trips.\n\nKaraguesian expects Canadian travel to the US to continue to cool due to the \"Buy Canadian\" movement, political instability, the trade war, and recent violence in the US.\n\nPrioritizing Canadian goods was one of the ways Justin Trudeau, now the former prime minister, encouraged residents after the trade war between the US and Canada began. Discouraging US travel was another.\n\n\"We're going to choose to not go on vacation in Florida or Old Orchard Beach or wherever,\" Trudeau said. \"We're going to choose to try to buy Canadian products and forgo bourbon and other classic American products.\"\n\nThe decline in Canadian tourists can affect US businesses that rely on them to prosper.\n\nA report from the Democratic members of the Congress Joint Economic Committee included different business owners describing how the fall in Canadian tourism to the US has affected them.\n\n\"We spoke with Canadian customers who told us point-blank that they were hesitant to cross due to the current political tension,\" Kyle Daley, owner of supermarket Soloman's Store in New Hampshire, said in the report. \"The joy of the 'shopping day trip' has been replaced by anxiety over border enforcement and tariffs.\"\n\nDaley added that \"When our neighbors stay away, our margins disappear and in groceries those margins are vanishingly small to begin with.\"\n\nU.S. Travel Association said Canada is the main driver for the expected 3.2% drop in international inbound travel spending from 2024 to 2025.\n\nKaraguesian said the effects would be felt more by local economies. That can include Michigan, Vermont, and other areas along the border.\n\n\"The longer-term ramifications are that our economy will suffer and that businesses will close and people will lose their jobs, which is just terrible,\" Becca Brown McKnight, a city councilor in Burlington, Vermont, previously told Business Insider. \"We are really lucky in Vermont to have a robust small business economy; a lot of these are mom and pop shops, and this is people's entire livelihood.\"\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that the state and Canada's \"economies are intertwined\" in response to a question at a fireside chat about why Canada should trust the state \"in the midst of a chaotic tariff policy.\"\n\nSandy Levine, the owner of some restaurants in the Detroit area, said in a WDET article published in June that \"We certainly still see people from Canada and from other countries, but it's not nearly to the degree that it was maybe like six months ago or a year ago.\"\n\nKaraguesian thinks that if the White House had simply focused on arguing for tariffs to rebuild the US manufacturing sector without harming Canada, then the administration \"could achieve the same thing and not have put off so many Canadians through a mixture of pride and fear.\"",

    "title": "Waymo may have leverage over human drivers during Super Bowl-level events",
    "description": "Waymo has control over where its robotaxi fleet is stationed, allowing the company to respond to temporary high-demand events like the Super Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Here's one way robotaxi companies might have leverage over traditional ride-hailing services: absolute fleet control.\n\nSuper Bowl weekend has arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is projected to attract around 90,000 visitors. The big game will be hosted in Santa Clara at Levi's Stadium.\n\nMassive events like this are major stress tests for ride-hailing services. The demand can easily exceed the supply — that is, the number of available human drivers — leading to higher costs and longer wait times.\n\nAlphabet's Waymo told Business Insider that it can prepare for the showdown because it can fine-tune how many robotaxis approach the stadium — and when.\n\n\"Because we control all aspects of the fleet — the location of all of the vehicles at any point in time, the matching and the routing that happens — we can do interesting things, like when we know there's going to be a big demand surge, we can position more of our fleet down there and we can do that dynamically,\" Chris Ludwick, Waymo's senior director for ride-hailing commercialization, told Business Insider.\n\nUber and Lyft, which rely only on human drivers in the Bay Area for the time being, have some mechanisms in place to prepare for high-surge events.\n\nThe companies can prepare in advance with organizers and local municipalities to coordinate pickup locations. They can also respond to demand by offering incentives or bonuses to human drivers to serve the area on a specific day and time.\n\nOn Lyft, drivers can see bonus areas in advance.\n\nHowever, those responses are not a perfect science, as long wait times and high prices during large events have essentially become commonplace expectations for customers.\n\nRide-hailing companies can try to incentivize workers, but there's no guarantee that enough drivers will be in the area at the exact moment a surge occurs.\n\nFlooding the zone with a lot of drivers isn't necessarily the solution either. Too many drivers can exacerbate traffic congestion and create a supply shortage in other areas outside the hot spot.\n\nLudwick told Business Insider that Waymo had prepared a plan in advance to deploy more of its fleet in the South Bay Area, where the Super Bowl will be hosted, and that the robotaxis would be positioned near the stadium but not too close as to create congestion.\n\n\"And then we're ready to do more or do less depending on how the dynamic conditions are,\" he said.\n\nSpokespeople for Lyft and Uber declined to provide a comment.\n\nTotal control may be one of the advantages of having a fleet of autonomous vehicles in a future where robotaxi operators successfully scale up.\n\nFor now, Waymo operates a fleet of around 1,000 cars in the San Francisco Bay Area — likely far below the number of human ride-hail drivers in the region. Uber and Lyft don't disclose driver presence by city, but in 2017, the San Francisco Treasurer's Office pegged the number at around 45,000 drivers in SF alone.\n\nWaymo also implements surge pricing, like traditional ride-hailing services, when demand is high.\n\nUber and Lyft have said that the limited robotaxi fleet is part of the reason they envision a hybrid ecosystem of robot and human drivers for years to come.\n\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has previously said that AV-only fleets face the challenge of running a \"highly underutilized network (if supply is built for peak demand) or a highly unreliable network at peak periods (if supply is built for anything less than peak).\"\n\n\"It is important to note that even in San Francisco, 1P AV services are already leaving a lot of demand on the table during peak hours, with average ETAs that are at least 25% higher than Uber as of Q4,\" Khosrowshahi said in prepared remarks for the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nDuring crowded events, robotaxis will also have to navigate temporary road closures, heavy traffic, and the unpredictable behavior of pedestrians. Videos on social media have shown how Waymo's robotaxis can get stuck near first-responder scenes or unexpected power outages.\n\nLudwick said Waymo has experience operating in complex environments, citing the company's operations at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\n\"We're doing over a thousand trips a day to Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, and that's at the terminals where there's other vehicle traffic doing pick-ups and drop-offs at the same place,\" he said. \"We're very capable of interacting in complex environments, and that's just necessary.\"",

    "title": "PwC is rethinking how to train workers in the Al era, and it's betting on 'skills, not titles'",
    "description": "The Big Four firm PwC launched a new in-house training initiative on Thursday, designed for the AI workplace.",
    "fullText": "AI is forcing the Big Four to rethink how work — and workers — are defined. The generalist consultant is out, and technical skills and deep industry expertise are in.\n\nPwC has launched what it's calling the \"Learning Collective,\" a new workplace training initiative designed for the realities of the AI era.\n\nIt's a broad rethink of how learning happens inside one of the world's largest professional services firms.\n\n\"Skills, not titles, are the currency of this new era,\" the firm said in a press release.\n\nThe line was reminiscent of news from January, first reported by Business Insider, that fellow Big Four firm Deloitte is overhauling job titles for all of its professionals. From June 1, simple, traditional job roles like \"consultant\" and \"associate\" will be replaced by more specific descriptors that better reflect the work Deloitte carries out for clients.\n\n\"We're not changing our titles,\" Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, clarified to Business Insider in an interview.\n\nStill, PwC's approach to talent echoes the industry shift. What that \"skills, not titles\" ethos means is that, as employees apply for projects, move around the organization, and progress in their careers, it's their portfolio of skills that will set them apart rather than a job title, said Seals-Coffield.\n\nPwC has introduced three major learning tracks with the Learning Collective. The first is a firmwide emphasis on 30 key skills: 15 AI-centric and 15 human-centric, both of which are \"extremely critical\" to PwC's success, Seals-Coffield told Business Insider.\n\n\"We're not necessarily asking someone to digest all 30 skills in one year,\" said Seals-Coffield. Different levels will focus on different skills, she added, but taken together they represent what PwC believes will matter most as AI reshapes client work.\n\nOn the human-centric aspect, this includes applying critical thinking to evaluate AI-generated outputs and using empathy to understand client dynamics.\n\nThe technical skills include AI fluency and AI simulation, which Seals-Coffield described as simulating the work now being completed by AI to ensure staff understand why and how it's done.\n\nThe firm said it isn't just teaching people about agents — it's using them in the learning process.\n\nSeals-Coffield said she recently watched a demo of an agent giving feedback on presentation skills this week that was \"pretty brutal, but in a really good way.\"\n\nThe agent told her: \"You're still not addressing the question around profitability. You're still not being specific about the ROI. It sounds a little bit generic. And I was just like, 'OK, geez, that was a little bit harsh.'\"\n\nBut the blunt feedback helped her rethink how she had presented certain details, Seals-Coffield said, adding that PwC wants agents that \"provide that real tangible critical coaching.\"\n\nThe Learning Collective is introducing new programs for two groups feeling the impact of AI acutely: engineers and junior workers.\n\nIn a move away from traditional roles associated with the Big Four, PwC has launched a new tech engineering career track, aimed at attracting and recruiting more technical talent.\n\nThe firm wants to become \"a destination for top engineering talent,\" the press release states.\n\nFor junior staff, PwC has launched the Associate Discovery program — a drive to expose new employees to AI from day one. By the time associates land on their first major engagement, PwC wants them to have experience building agents, working with AI, and developing the human skills required to make those tools useful.\n\nThe firm has also reduced the number of offices where consulting associates can begin their careers, from around 60 down to 13, said Seals-Coffield.\n\nTraining and development have always been important at the Big Four consulting and accounting firms. Many young grads join their ranks looking to supercharge their business skills.\n\nBut the isolation of the COVID years, combined with the way that AI is changing the nature of work, has chipped away at some of PwC's sense of connection around learning and development, especially for younger employees, said Seals-Coffield.\n\nThe Learning Collective is trying to change that by encouraging learning beyond courses, such as bringing team members along to meetings or getting teams to discuss what they've learned that week with each other.\n\n\"They will find that we are asking them more and more to engage in these learning experiences in their intact team,\" Seals-Coffield said.\n\n\"Getting our people to spend more time together, learning and growing in an intentional way, is the goal of the experience,\" she added.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Tiffany Tuttle, a former film editor, transitioned from a successful career to being a stay-at-home mom during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "fullText": "I stepped into the production world as a teenager when I founded a TV show at my church. By the time I graduated from high school, production was already second nature.\n\nI studied film at my local college, which led me to an internship at a local production studio, where I stayed as a full-time freelance editor for years. I had a 15-year career in production.\n\nI was lucky to experience some incredible moments, from assisting on set at Connie Francis' house to editing a documentary for James Patterson. It was the career of my dreams.\n\nNow, those memories remind me of the excitement I chose to leave behind to star in the most demanding role of my life — motherhood.\n\nAt first, I regretted leaving my career behind to become a stay-at-home mom, but now I appreciate the privilege I had of staying home to be close to my daughter.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant in 2019, being a stay-at-home mom never crossed my mind. I loved my career and wanted to keep working.\n\nI planned to take a three-month maternity leave to acclimate and ease my child into a day care routine. The timing worked out perfectly for me to return to work on a new season of the travel and culinary TV shows I had helped shape for years.\n\nWith the nursery set up, we eagerly counted down the days until we could meet our baby girl. Then, every news channel started talking about COVID-19. All travel and close contact were halted, forcing production of the shows I worked on to shut down.\n\nEven more devastating, as my due date approached, my husband and I realized we would be welcoming our first baby into the world in complete isolation.\n\nAs soon as I held her in my arms, existing suddenly felt dangerous. I felt like a walking target every time I stepped outside, but I fell in love with being a mom and felt at peace with not returning to work for a while.\n\nNo one was around to bring us trays of lasagna or to fold the mountains of baby clothes. My daughter cried if she wasn't held around the clock, and my husband and I barely had the energy to tolerate each other, let alone connect. I felt deep in the motherhood trenches, with no village to tag-team with.\n\nMore than what was going on around me, the unraveling was happening within me. Parts of me started chipping away between the sleepless nights, the reflux battles, keeping up with the internet rules and cultural norms about how to be a good mom, and trying to solve \"What's for dinner?\" — again.\n\nThere was a 72-hour period when I slept only three hours total. I was in a permanent state of brain fog. The dark circles under my eyes no longer came from pouring myself into fun, meaningful work. They came from being tethered to a colicky baby — a job with no celebration, acknowledgment, or reward. I missed the opportunity to give my energy to something that produced a tangible result.\n\nThe creativity and freedom I once basked in felt chained to my child-free life, and I mourned the closing of that chapter. I missed the simplicity of autonomy. I felt sad, overwhelmed, and embarrassed that my entire identity had condensed into one goal: survival.\n\nThe world never got back to normal. I realized that I had a choice to make, and I decided that this season was not going to break me.\n\nOver the next year, I gathered the parts of myself that had cracked under the weight of new motherhood. The victories felt too small to quantify at first, but it started with taking a shower first thing in the morning, sitting down to eat my meals, and being intentional about rest.\n\nI started to love who I was becoming and felt a deep gratitude for the privilege of not missing a single one of my baby's milestones.\n\nEven though my schedule is packed with homeschooling my five-year-old, chauffeuring her to dance classes, and singing along to Ms. Rachel with my three-year-old son, I've found ways to reconnect with my professional self in this busy season.\n\nI'm a freelance writer and life coach, and I've just reached the 30th episode of my podcast. I'm back to working late nights, but they feel rewarding again, and my projects are a piece of my independence.\n\nI would love to return to editing one day, but I'm not sad about my life's demands taking over for now. I'm still shaping stories through who I'm becoming and the big-hearted kids I'm raising.",

    "title": "See the new business class keeping Lufthansa's Airbus A380 competitive as deliveries of new next-generation jets slip",
    "description": "The new A380 business class is an example of how Lufthansa is keeping the world's largest passenger plane competitive amid widebody shortages.",
    "fullText": "Lufthansa is doubling down on a jet that many thought was history.\n\nThe German flag carrier announced Friday that it will install a new business-class cabin on all eight of its Airbus A380 superjumbos as part of its broader multibillion-dollar fleet renewal.\n\nAirlines are racing to meet growing demand for high-dollar premium experiences on long-haul flights. The new A380 business class will deliver an upgrade over the current layout, with more space, modern technology, and aisle access for all passengers.\n\nHowever, it will not be part of Allegris, Lufthansa's new signature economy and premium cabins rolling out across its old Boeing 747-8s and newly delivered Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s.\n\nLufthansa said the A380 seat, from manufacturer Thompson Aero, was chosen strategically because it is already certified for the jet type. Allegris is not, and using it would require a separate, lengthy certification process.\n\nThat means Lufthansa can quickly retrofit the A380 planes and get them back in the air. The project is expected to start in February, with the first refreshed jet returning to service in April.\n\nThe move comes as airlines face delayed deliveries of next-generation widebodies — particularly the Airbus A350-1000 and the yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777X — creating a crunch in long-haul, money-making capacity.\n\nA company spokesperson told Business Insider that Lufthansa's A380 refurbishment was planned well in advance and isn't a direct response to shifting delivery timelines.\n\n\"Lufthansa is investing in an aircraft that has already been in scheduled service for several years,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, we always want to offer our guests a modern and high-quality cabin product.\"\n\nStill, Lufthansa has repeatedly delayed retiring its A380s.\n\nIt considered ditching the jet after COVID halted travel (six aircraft were permanently removed from the fleet), but a strong post-pandemic rebound brought some planes back from storage and pushed the retirement of the remaining A380s to 2026.\n\nIt now has at least another five years. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said in October 2025 that the A380s will continue flying into the early 2030s as the airline awaits new widebodies.\n\nLufthansa is the expected launch customer for Boeing's 777X, now expected to be at least seven years late in 2027 due to production and certification issues. The airline has also faced delivery delays for the 787 and A350.\n\nCarriers like Dubai-based Emirates, Australian flag carrier Qantas, and British Airways are similarly keeping older planes flying longer as they await new planes — including refurbishing the A380 with expensive new economy and premium cabins.\n\nData from the aviation analytics firm Cirium shows roughly 91,500 A380 flights are scheduled for 2026, about 1,500 more than in 2025. That uptick comes after the number of A380 flights plunged from about 120,000 in 2019 to just under 14,000 in 2021.\n\nThis increase comes despite the A380's inefficiencies. Its four fuel-hungry engines make it costly to operate, its size limits the number of airports it can serve, and its roughly 500 seats are challenging to consistently fill. While a few ultra-high-demand routes can justify the capacity, it doesn't work across an entire network.\n\nAirlines are also increasingly favoring smaller, more flexible twin-engine widebodies that can better adjust to fluctuating demand and efficiently serve both point-to-point routes — nonstops that don't go through a mega hub — and traditional hub-and-spoke networks.\n\nAirbus ultimately ended A380 production in 2021.\n\nLufthansa's A380s presently feature a 2-2-2 business-class layout, which forces window-seat passengers to climb over a neighbor to reach the aisle — a frustration for travelers paying a premium for privacy and flexibility beyond what economy offers.\n\nRenderings show the new cabin will switch to a 1-2-1 layout, giving every passenger direct aisle access. The design also adds Bluetooth connectivity, privacy partitions, and a lie-flat bed longer than six feet when the seat is fully reclined.\n\nOnce retrofitted, the A380 will feature eight seats in first class, 68 in business, 52 in premium economy, and 371 in regular coach.\n\nThe cabin won't have sliding doors, double beds, or big front-row suites — features that have become increasingly popular across the industry and are included on certain Allegris seats.\n\nThat added complexity, however, has slowed Allegris' rollout. The cabin includes multiple seat types and configurations within a single aircraft and has not yet been certified for the 787.\n\nAs a result, some Dreamliners are currently flying with business-class seats blocked from sale while Lufthansa awaits regulatory approval, limiting premium-cabin capacity and revenue.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that even he has \"fallen prey\" to \"the pixie dust\" of seeing Apple or Google on a résumé.",
    "fullText": "Even Elon Musk sometimes hires the wrong people.\n\n\"I've fallen prey to the pixie dust thing as well, where it's like, 'Oh, we'll hire someone from Google or Apple, and they'll be immediately successful,'\" Musk told Stripe cofounder John Collison and tech Dwarkesh Patel during a 3-hour-long appearance on a special joint episode of their podcasts.\n\nIt's why Tesla's CEO doesn't put his full faith in a candidate's résumé.\n\n\"Generally, what I tell people—I tell myself, I guess, aspirationally—is, don't look at the résumé. Just believe your interaction. The résumé may seem very impressive, and it's like, 'Wow, the résumé looks good.' But if the conversation after 20 minutes is not \"Wow,\" you should believe the conversation, not the paper,\" he said.\n\nHe said he's made other mistakes, too. \"My batting average is still not perfect, but it's very high,\" he said. That includes the times he's discounted certain personality traits.\n\n\"I think it's a good idea to hire for talent and drive and trustworthiness,\" he said. \"And I think goodness of heart is important. I underweighted that at one point. So, are they a good person? Trustworthy? Smart and talented and hard working? If so, you can add domain knowledge.\"\n\nMusk said that it takes a lot to truly impress him.\n\n\"The things I ask for are bullet points for evidence of exceptional ability.\"\n\nThe examples \"can be pretty off the wall,\" but he's looking for evidence of something truly great.\n\n\"If somebody can cite even one thing, but let's say three things, where you go, 'Wow, wow, wow,' then that's a good sign,\" he said.\n\nWhen companies like Tesla are successful, Musk said, their competitors take notice and do everything they can to poach top talent.\n\n\"Tesla had a further challenge where when Tesla had very successful periods, we would be relentlessly recruited from,\" he said. \"Like, relentlessly.\"\n\nMusk said when Apple had its own electric car program, recruiters for the tech giant were \"carpet bombing\" Tesla employees to the point that some engineers just unplugged their phones. (In 2024, Apple reportedly abandoned its secretive car program.)\n\n\"Their opening offer without any interview would be like double the compensation at Tesla. So we had a bit of the 'Tesla pixie dust' thing where it's like, 'Oh, if you hire a Tesla executive, suddenly everything's going to be successful,'\" he said.\n\nSome former employees have complained about Musk's management style. During the interview, the Tesla CEO joked about his reputation as a micro manager, insisting that it be called \"Nano management, please.\" Musk said that, in reality, he now doesn't have enough time to oversee every aspect of his sprawling empire.\n\nUltimately, though, Musk said he just wants one thing.\n\n\"If somebody gets things done, I love them, and if they don't, I hate them,\" he said. \"So it's pretty straightforward. It's not like some idiosyncratic thing.\"",

    "description": "After a 2024 layoff, Alex English struggled to find work in LA and moved back to Tampa, Florida. He said he's happier despite still job hunting.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alex English, a 38-year-old marketing and communications professional who has been unemployed for over a year and a half, based in Tampa. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been unemployed for a year and a half. Before being laid off, I lived in LA and worked in marketing and communications at a startup. I was making around $125,000 and still felt poor.\n\nAfter five years at my last job, I was handed a layoff like it was nothing. I moved back to where I grew up in Tampa, Florida, because I didn't have the savings to sustain myself in LA.\n\nI've relentlessly networked to find a full-time job, taken on freelance projects, and worked in retail. I feel like I'm working harder than I ever have and yet making significantly less money than I did before. My friends who aren't dealing with long-term unemployment don't see my crisis as a crisis. That can be really hard, but I've worked on removing the emotional intensity from the situation.\n\nI hadn't been happy at work for a while. I was well paid, and the company was successful, but it didn't feel like we were improving anyone's life or solving any real problems. It all started to feel like, What am I doing? Where's the value here?\n\nIn my 20s and 30s, I never really believed in my own capabilities, so I never saw that job as a stepping stone to a better role or company. It was comfortable, predictable, and seemingly quite stable.\n\nI've never been good at saving money, so after getting laid off, I was most worried about my finances, but I had a false sense of security, getting unemployment and three months of severance. At the time, I was burned out and not very interested in immediately hitting the ground running to find my next role.\n\nI was always spending almost everything I made and never had an ingrained ethos of saving for a rainy day or investing. Going out to eat and shopping ate into my savings.\n\nI got laid off at the end of June, and by September, I was freaking out.\n\nI made all the plans to come home and live with family, figuring out how to move and ship my car, and bring my two cats. It was just a lot of stress, but I needed to do it.\n\nIt's been hard finding a job in Tampa. I've been reintroducing myself to people and trying to get ingrained in the ecosystem. It's changed and grown up without me. The job market here feels like it's a lot about who you know and having people vouch for you.\n\nI'm happier here even though I'm still trying to find my next opportunity. I loved visiting big cities growing up, but leaving LA, I realized I wasn't hungry enough or career-oriented enough to compete there.\n\nI just didn't feel like I had the energy or the stamina to stay in LA, stick it out, and fight to climb over people to get somewhere. The pressures of the cost of living and just getting attention in a crowded market were too much. I have all these supporters here in Tampa with my family and friends. LA is a beautiful place, but it can be very lonely. I honestly felt like I couldn't deal with that anymore.\n\nI think we are often so fixated on a steady ascent in our lives, with things always moving in an upward, positive direction. When it all comes crashing down, it feels like a personal failing. I've had to focus on what's been good in my life, even if it's not a fantastic, sparkling career. I have a good family, good friends, and my health.\n\nIf I found a job that paid $65,000, was something I'd enjoy doing, and felt meaningful, I'd probably be like, \"Praise the Lord.\"\n\nI've been forcing myself to write down things that I'm grateful for and absorb content, whether it's podcasts or other things that help me feel better and less alone. I take these steps, instead of living on Instagram and looking at what everybody else is doing.\n\nI've also worked on realizing that these things do happen to people, and that it's not the end of the world. Overcoming a layoff might require rethinking some of your assumptions or how you're going to progress in your career.\n\nDo you have a story to share about long-term unemployment?

    "description": "\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about SpaceX's Starbase campus. \"Remote and mostly dudes.\"",
    "fullText": "SpaceX and Tesla both began in California before relocating their headquarters to Texas — a move Elon Musk has said created a hiring challenge.\n\nMusk, the CEO of both companies, said married technicians, engineers, and scientists have struggled to bring their families to certain parts of the state. The problem is most acute at SpaceX's south Texas launch site and headquarters, known as Starbase.\n\n\"I call it the 'significant other' problem,\" Musk said during a nearly three-hour interview with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and Stripe's cofounder John Collison that was posted on Thursday. \"For Starbase, that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low.\"\n\nStarbase — where SpaceX has built and tested its rockets since 2019 — is situated in a sparsely populated area of Texas, close to the US‑Mexico border. It's located across from the largely undeveloped Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe campus is roughly a 40‑minute drive from Brownsville, the nearest city, according to Google Maps. Brownsville has a population of around 187,000, based on the most recent US Census data.\n\nThat remoteness marks a sharp contrast with SpaceX's former headquarters in El Segundo, California, which is minutes from Los Angeles and part of one of the country's largest job markets.\n\n\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about Starbase. \n\"Remote and mostly dudes.\"\n\nTesla, which moved its headquarters from California to Austin in 2021, faces a similar — though less severe — challenge, Musk said.\n\nThe automaker's campus, called Giga Texas, is a roughly 30-minute drive from downtown Austin, where nearly 1 million people live. Plus, while Tesla's top executives have largely moved to Texas, the electric car company still maintains several robotics, energy, and manufacturing operations in California.\n\n\"Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it's easier for people to just... They don't have to change their life very much. Their commutes are going to be the same,\" he said. \"Tesla still has a majority of its engineering in California.\"\n\nMusk, who has predicted Austin will be \"the biggest boomtown that America has seen in 50 years,\" has made moves to build out his company campuses, including a company town called \"Snailbrook\" near The Boring Company and SpaceX.",

    "description": "Gary Marcus advocates caution about AI's risks. He told Business Insider that using OpenClaw was like giving your passwords to a stranger at the bar.",
    "fullText": "AI researcher and author Gary Marcus is worried about those viral agents and their social network.\n\nAnimated lobsters flooded X last week. First, it was OpenClaw (previously called Moltbot and Clawdbot before Anthropic came knocking). The AI agent runs locally and can independently make decisions on common consumer apps without human supervision.\n\nThen came Moltbook, the Reddit-like social forum where AI agents post and comment. No humans are allowed — though it appears some humans may have managed to sneak their way in.\n\nMarcus is known to pour cold water on the most hot-headed AI fanatics. It's in the title of his book: \"Taming Silicon Valley.\" The entrepreneur and scientist founded Geometric Intelligence, a machine-learning startup he later sold to Uber. Now, he advocates for AI regulation and risk consideration.\n\nHis take on these new tools was no different. In a Substack post, he was blunt. \"If you care about the security of your device or the privacy of your data, don't use OpenClaw,\" he wrote. \"Period.\"\n\nCurious to hear more about his thoughts on the latest viral moment in AI, we followed up with Marcus over email for a short Q&A, which was lightly edited for clarity.\n\nHere's what he had to say about those AI agents popping up everywhere.\n\nLet's start with OpenClaw. When did you first run into it, and what was your reaction?\n\nI think it was called something different then, oh so many days ago (seven?). My immediate reaction is, this is just like AutoGPT and it will be a complete security disaster if it becomes popular. Maybe, if we are lucky, it will become a teachable moment and the damage will be modest.\n\nWhy do you think OpenClaw grew so popular (at least online)?\n\nI imagine it is super fun to play with, and it must make users feel like they have an express ticket to the future. Personally I wouldn't touch it.\n\nYou compare OpenClaw to AutoGPT. How are they similar and different?\n\nThey are both basically connectors between LLMs and services. The underlying LLMs are better now than in 2023, but the security risks are roughly the same: immense. It's like giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out. Yeah, maybe.\n\nIs there any secure use of OpenClaw? What about those who have already set it up — what should they do?\n\nI doubt there is any real secure use. Personally I would stop running it and try to uninstall it and change passwords for banks and things like that.\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said he's taken steps to make it more secure. (Here's one example.) What do you think of these efforts?\n\nNoble, but maybe like putting a finger in dike to hold off a flood?\n\nMoving to Moltbook. Is there any argument to set your agent live on the site?\n\nOn TBPN, Matt Schlicht made the argument that startups should build businesses \"on top of Moltbook.\" What do you think of his proposal?\n\nGood luck to you. Don't blame me if your customer base gets scammed because of prompt injection attack you didn't notice.\n\nMeta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, said that he didn't find Moltbook interesting, because these agents were trained to speak like humans. Thoughts?\n\nFacebook did actually have some related experiments years and years ago; he's right that we shouldn't be entirely surprised. The interest comes mostly from the scale.\n\nWill we be talking about Moltbook in two weeks, or is this just another meme cycle?\n\nI don't know. AutoGPT exploded like a rocket in March 2023 and faded because of issues around reliability and accuracy; I wouldn't be surprised if this is just another fad, like Sora videos or pet rocks. But we'll see.",

    "description": "Both Patriots coach Mike Vrabel and Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold are headed to the big game despite previously getting cast aside by other teams.",
    "fullText": "For anyone who's been handed a pink slip, this year's Super Bowl offers more than just sports and music.\n\nIt is also a rare display of workplace vindication.\n\nOn Sunday, the New England Patriots face off against the Seattle Seahawks for the finale of the 2025-26 NFL season. Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel and Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold were both previously with teams that cast them aside — most of which failed to even make it to the playoffs this year.\n\nOf course, getting dumped comes with the territory in pro sports. Vrabel was fired as the head coach of the Tennessee Titans in early 2024 after a power struggle with ownership, while Darnold was passed over by four previous teams: the Minnesota Vikings, San Francisco 49ers, the Carolina Panthers, and the New York Jets.\n\nNow, both Vrabel and Darnold are at the top of their game, their old bosses are sidelined, and one is guaranteed to walk away with a trophy. (If you're a Simpsons fan, cue Nelson Muntz's \"Ha ha!\")\n\n\"It's proof that a different environment makes a huge difference in terms of your potential,\" said Roy Cohen, a career coach in New York.\n\nThe same logic applies to the business world. Some people lose jobs because they aren't a good fit, only to later thrive at other companies.\n\n\"A bad marriage doesn't mean you're destined to always have a bad marriage,\" said Cohen.\n\nGetting fired can be a powerful motivator for people to level up their career, said Dana Sumpter, associate professor of organization theory and management at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School.\n\n\"That means I'm going to double down on my efforts at the next place, not only to ensure that this doesn't happen again, but also to show my former employer, 'Look what you lost,' \" she said.\n\nA client of Nashville-based career coach Bryan Creely initially took a hit to his self-confidence after being sacked from a healthcare startup a few years ago. The client then changed his attitude, launched a job search, and is now in a better-paying, more senior role at a company where he feels valued.\n\nCreely said that kind of end result is common. \"In almost every case, people tend to come out stronger,\" he said.\n\nFeeling hurt, angry, or both is natural after losing a job, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n\"Of course, we have revenge fantasies,\" said Laura Greve, a clinical psychologist in Boston for C-suite executives, politicians, and other high achievers — and a Patriots fan.\n\nIt's not wise, though, to lash out against your former employer or the individual who let you go.\n\n\"Trying to convince somebody that they've mistreated you is something I often have to counsel people against,\" she said. \"That's not productive.\"\n\nInstead, Greve recommends pouring your energy into landing a better role elsewhere — just like Sunday's matchup shows. Getting further ahead in your career at another company can be highly satisfying, especially if your old boss is likely to hear about it. The leaders of the teams that Vrabel and Darnold used to work for are undoubtedly aware that both men have moved on to new gigs where they're excelling.\n\n\"You're looking for restorative justice,\" said Greve.\n\nLikewise, don't gloat to former colleagues or in social-media posts after achieving a career upgrade, or you might hurt your future career prospects, warned Cohen. When verifying your work history, prospective employers may learn about your bravado and not appreciate it.\n\n\"It's not unusual for hiring managers to just pick up the phone and call their buddies at other companies for the down low,\" he said. \"You don't want to burn any bridges, even with employers who treated you badly.\"",

    "title": "A senior exec is suing trading firm Vatic, saying it stiffed him on $1.5 million and blamed 'funding difficulties'",
    "description": "Ex-director of trading Rosen Kralev says most of his guaranteed bonus went unpaid, with Vatic repeatedly citing \"funding difficulties\" for the delays.",
    "fullText": "A senior executive at quantitative trading firm Vatic Labs resigned last month and sued the company, alleging it failed to pay most of a contractually guaranteed $1.5 million bonus, according to a complaint filed in Delaware Superior Court.\n\nRosen Kralev, the former director of trading at the high-frequency trading firm, alleges in court papers that Vatic for months blamed the missed payments on difficulties raising funds. It is the second instance in the past year of a former Vatic executive suing the firm over alleged nonpayment.\n\nThe complaints by former employees give a rare peek inside a systematic proprietary trading firm's efforts to raise capital and expand its business.\n\nVatic disputes Kralev's allegations and moved to halt the Delaware lawsuit, arguing that its operating agreement gives the company the unilateral right to compel confidential arbitration and that an arbitrator — not the court — must decide whether the claims can proceed. A judge this week granted Vatic's motion to stay, sending the case to arbitration.\n\n\"The company rejects the allegations made by Mr. Kralev and his counsel and will address them in the appropriate forum,\" Vatic told Business Insider in a statement through its attorney.\n\nKralev's attorney declined to comment.\n\nVatic, founded in 2014 by Jump Trading alum James Chiu, has over the years hired top quant talent from firms like Citadel, PDT, and Two Sigma. The firm started out trading futures with its own capital, but in recent years, Vatic had sought to launch a hedge fund and expand beyond ultrafast trading into statistical arbitrage strategies commonly deployed by quant hedge funds.\n\nThat initiative fizzled. The firm managed no client assets as of August 2023, according to a regulatory filing, and it terminated the registration of its hedge-fund vehicle with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2024.\n\nIt continued its proprietary trading activities, however, raising $45 million in equity in mid-2024 at a $270 million valuation, a former senior executive alleged last year in a separate suit against the firm.\n\nChiu hired Kralev several months later in 2024, offering him a $350,000 salary and a guaranteed $1.5 million bonus to be paid in quarterly installments over his first year, according to employment records included in the filings.\n\nKralev, a quantitative trading veteran with prior stints at Virtu Financial and Ritter Alpha, said he received the first $375,000 payment in January 2025 but that subsequent payments never materialized.\n\nWhen the second installment came due in May, Chiu asked to delay payment, \"explaining that a temporary delay would improve the Company's financial presentation in connection with due diligence discussions with a potential investor,\" the complaint states.\n\nIn the following months, Chiu repeatedly cited \"funding difficulties\" but assured Kralev he would be paid within weeks, Kralev alleges. During a Zoom meeting at the end of October, Chiu told Kralev that Vatic was expecting two investments totaling $50 million and would then pay out the remaining bonus, according to the complaint.\n\nChiu later pushed the payment timeline into December, telling Kralev in a Slack message that the fund closing had been delayed by Know Your Customer verification issues.\n\n\"Wanted to give you an update for you [sic] delayed bonus,\" Chiu said, the complaint alleges. \"The investor fund closing got delayed bc of KYC documents. We should get the funding the week of Dec 22 before xmas. Apologies for the delay.\"\n\nAt this point, the complaint says, Kralev said he \"realized that Chiu simply did not intend to pay his bonus,\" and sent notice that he would resign the following month if the problem wasn't rectified.\n\nHe resigned on January 7 and filed the lawsuit against Vatic a week later, alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n\nKralev's lawsuit is not the first brought by a senior former Vatic employee. Last year, former chief business officer Abiruman Subramanian sued the firm, alleging it failed to make payments for his termination, equity holdings, and fees related to capital introduction and fundraising efforts.\n\nSubramanian said he helped raise $45 million in equity for Vatic in 2024 at a $270 million valuation and was fired shortly after the deals closed.\n\nMonths before the cash infusion, Chiu told senior personnel that Vatic was on the brink of insolvency and asked them to contribute money to keep it afloat, Subramanian's complaint alleges:\n\nSubramanian contends he complied, liquidating personal investments, but said he never received \"any written documentation supporting the purpose or terms of the Personal Investment.\"\n\nThat case was voluntarily dismissed by Subramanian in February 2025, and it subsequently moved to arbitration, a lawyer for Subramanian said.",

    "description": "As tech sells off, Wall Street is in the midst of a rotation that Piper Sandler analysts say should favor stocks in \"old economy\" sectors of the market.",
    "fullText": "Investors looking for refuge from the tech sell-off slamming Wall Street should look to the \"old economy.\"\n\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler offered a handful of ideas for weary investors weathering the tech sell-off this week. The latest rout, which started in a small corner of the software space, eventually spread to bigger names like Microsoft after an agentic AI update from Anthropic sparked AI replacement fears. The new bearish AI sentiment has bled into the wider tech sector, with a risk-off shift gripping investors in the last few days.\n\nWhile some commentators argue the software crash is overblown, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, others frame it as a healthy rotation away from tech.\n\nPiper Sandler analysts are in the \"rotation nation\" camp, seeing the tech sell-off as a shift to \"old economy\" plays in cyclical and value shares.\n\n\"The bull market is intact; however, it's not being led by the popular Tech and Growth favorites of investors. Instead, new momentum and leadership are emerging in cyclical and value sectors—Energy, Industrials, Materials, Staples, and Banks,\" they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 information technology sector is the worst performer in the index in 2026, down more than 6% year to date. The losses have been particularly pronounced in software this week, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF falling 17% in the last week.\n\n\"After years of focus on identifying stocks with the greatest potential AI exposure, concerns about disruption have pushed investors back toward 'real economy' industries, including those leveraged to recent signs of accelerating economic growth,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote this week.\n\nThe analysts examined industry exposure to AI automation compared to labor costs and sales to determine which spaces are most insulated. Some of Piper Sandler's \"old economy\" sectors, specifically energy, industrials, and consumer staples, were part of the same group Goldman flagged.\n\nGoldman analysts added that the sell-off has only sped up an existing market rotation into cyclical stocks.\n\n\"The investor search for insulation from AI disruption risk has accelerated the ongoing cyclical rally,\" they wrote.\n\nBeyond clear flight from stocks exposed to AI risks, BNY Investment researchers credit the rotation, in part, to a cyclical recovery in the US economy.\n\n\"The prevailing narrative in US equity markets is one of market broadening and leadership rotation, consistent with our view of a cyclical recovery in the US economy,\" the BNY analysts wrote.",

    "fullText": "Exploring the mountains is my favorite way to see a new place.\n\nSo, when I spent a year as a traveling winemaker and nomadic freelance writer in Europe and Oceania, I set out to hike in every country I visited.\n\nI traversed narrow, rocky paths in the Dolomites, meandered through Scotland's sweeping green valleys, and trekked past kangaroos in the Australian bush.\n\nNow, over a year later, I can say I've hiked in some of the most awe-inspiring corners of the world. There are four trails I'd return to in a heartbeat, and three ticketed ones that felt crowded and overhyped.\n\nIn the Austrian Alps, just south of the iconic Zugspitze mountain, lies Leutash, a lush, pristine alpine valley with an immense network of trails.\n\nThe circular Rotmoosalm-to-Wettersteinhütte tour was tough — the full loop is around 9 miles with over 3,000 feet of elevation gain — but in my opinion, it condensed the most idyllic aspects of the Austrian experience into one hike.\n\nI saw dense forests, stunning craggy peaks, green meadows, mountain streams, ice-blue lakes, and traditional mountain huts, all in one day.\n\nAfter traveling through the Dolomites last October with my boyfriend, I still dream about our 7.5-mile hike to Lago di Sorapis.\n\nCarved into the rockface with a dramatic dropoff to the autumnal forest below, the technical out-and-back trail definitely required some steady footing on the ascent.\n\nThat said, the lake's opaque turquoise waters, contrasted by pale rocky mountains, made it well worth the journey.\n\nMy best friend and I road-tripped through Slovenia in the fall, traveling north to south along the Italian border. Deep within the magical Soča Valley is Slap Kozjak, a 49-foot emerald waterfall tucked inside an open gorge.\n\nJust over 2 miles, the waterfall loop follows a scenic route along a cliff's edge, over a wooden suspension bridge, and through ankle-high forest creeks.\n\nAlthough I usually prefer longer, more challenging hikes, I loved that this route was easy enough that I still had energy to explore the area.\n\nOver the summer, I traveled to the Jura region of France and hiked the iconic 4.3-mile trail that tours past a steep succession of seven unique waterfalls.\n\nI found that this was the perfect time to visit — I loved watching the dappled sunlight filter through the bright green tree canopy, and almost glitter against the trail's flowing rivers.\n\nIt's a popular hike, though. Next time, I would start earlier to avoid the crowds and enjoy the picturesque views in solitude.\n\nMost famously known as the Three Peaks of Lavaredo, this UNESCO World Heritage Site lies in the heart of the Dolomites.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my fall visit here, but I made the mistake of starting in the early afternoon, and the hordes of visitors made my €40 parking fee much less worthwhile.\n\nEven during the Dolomites' low season, the popular, 6.3-mile trail was already filled with hikers, climbers, and beer drinkers by the time I started it.\n\nThe Eisriesenwelt was the first — and arguably the most memorable — hike I completed after moving abroad in August 2024.\n\nSouth of Salzburg, it's a relatively short but steep climb along an open rock face that leads to the largest ice cave in the world.\n\nAlthough this hike was a fascinating and unique experience, it's also easily accessible by cable car, which — in my experience — meant large crowds and long wait times.\n\nMy sister and I walked the Fairy Glen trail on the Isle of Skye during our Thanksgiving road trip through Scotland.\n\nIt's an easy, mile-long path up grassy hills, past unusual rock formations and herds of roaming sheep. The views were beautiful and fairy-tale-like, but the small paid car park became flooded with visitors as the day progressed.\n\nBetween that, the short trail length, and the wet, gray weather that turned the trails into mud, I'd prefer to explore Scotland's more dramatic and remote long-distance trails.",

The impact of that decision is yet to be communicated by the ICC.\n\nThey will play their games in Sri Lanka as part of an agreement reached in 2024 around India and Pakistan matches not being played in the other country.\n\nThe 20 sides are split into the following four groups in the initial phase:\n\nGroup A: India (X1), Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan (Y3), USA\n\nGroup B: Australia (X2), Ireland, Oman, Sri Lanka (Y4), Zimbabwe\n\nGroup C: England (Y1), Italy, Nepal, Scotland, West Indies (X3)\n\nGroup D: Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand (Y2), South Africa (X4), United Arab Emirates\n\nFull squad lists for the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup\n\nA total of eight venues are being used - five in India and three in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn India, Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi will host games.\n\nR Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground - both in Colombo - and Pallekele Cricket Stadium put on matches in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium, which holds 132,000 fans and is the biggest cricket venue in the world, is due to host the final, unless Pakistan qualify, with the game then moved to Colombo.\n\nThe tournament is played in a T20 format, so both teams will face 20 overs unless they are bowled out beforehand or the team batting second reaches their target before then.\n\nEach innings will start with a six-over powerplay and there are different fielding restrictions in that phase.\n\nMatches should last three hours and 10 minutes, with each innings allocated one hour and 25 minutes and separated by a 20-minute interval.\n\nIn limited-overs cricket there is a 'stop-clock' meaning the bowling side must be ready to bowl each over within 60 seconds of the previous one finishing.\n\nEach side will be allowed two unsuccessful reviews per innings.\n\nShould the number of runs scored by each team be level after 20 overs, the match will go to a super over (each team will face six balls - highest score wins). If that finishes a tie then super overs will continue to be played until a winner is found.\n\nIn the two group phases a minimum of five overs per side must be played to constitute a result, but that rises to 10 overs in the semi-finals and final.\n\nIf a match is halted after that point due to weather conditions then DLS (Duckworth Lewis Stern method) will be used to decide the winner.\n\nThe ICC are yet to publish playing conditions around reserve days and extra time allocated to the knockout matches.\n\nIf Pakistan reach the semi-finals, Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium will replace Kolkata as the venue for the first semi-final, while the final would also move if Pakistan qualify.\n\nIf India make the last four and face any side that is not Pakistan, they will play in the second semi-final in Mumbai on 5 March.\n\nGlossary of cricket terms including DLS and powerplay\n\nThere have been six winners of the nine Men's T20 World Cups. They are:\n\nThere will be ball-by-ball commentary of all 55 matches across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nOur commentary team includes Henry Moeran, Prakash Wakankar, Aatif Nawaz, Daniel Norcross, Simon Mann, Nikesh Rughani, Kevin Howells and Melissa Story.\n\nExpert analysis will come from multiple Ashes winner Steven Finn, World Cup winner Alex Hartley, T20 World Cup champion Dawid Malan, Scotland and England T20 World Cup spinner Kirstie Gordon, former Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien and Big Bash winner Michael Carberry.\n\nThe BBC Sport website and app will have live text commentary on selected group-stage matches then every match from the Super 8s onwards.\n\nThere will be daily reports and score updates alongside in-play and post-match video highlights, alongside regular coverage on the BBC Cricket Instagram, external account.\n\nThe tournament is available to watch live in the UK on Sky Sports.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "BBC Sport reporter Emma Sanders takes fans' questions on the Women's Super League, the transfer window and the future of Alexia Putellas.",
    "fullText": "With transfer deadline day having passed, teams in the Women's Super League are embarking on their road to the end of the season.\n\nBBC Sport women's football news reporter Emma Sanders joined fans on Reddit to take questions on a range of topics, including how the window works, why Chelsea surprised her and the future of Spain superstar Alexia Putellas.\n\nHere is a selection of the questions and Emma's answers.\n\nQ. As a newcomer to women's football, I still don't know how/why only some transfer fees are released and also if they are real? Is the BBC provided with figures by agents, clubs, or other means?\n\nEmma: It's the biggest headache we have! Clubs do not release fees so we have to work very hard to get that information from our own sources. Some clubs can be helpful and confirm it off the record but we've had lots of scenarios where one club says one fee, and the other club completely contradicts it. If it were up to me, Fifa would release them all. I don't see the harm and it would offer transparency for fans to know where the club spends money. It's the fans' investment too, after all.\n\nQ. Have you ever been completely blindsided by a transfer? Like no-one had a clue the player might be moving until it was announced by the club?\n\nEmma: Definitely! There's not many of us who work full-time in women's football media – especially for national broadcasters and newspapers – so naturally, there's a lot to cover on our own. That makes it hard to keep track of every movement. To be fair, it happens less now that there are more covering the women's game - but I've definitely been blindsided in the past. Most of the time we get rumblings when a player might be moving, even if we do not have confirmation from enough sources or the name of the club they're moving to.\n\nQ. Have you heard the rumours of Alexia Putellas to London City Lionesses in the summer?\n\nEmma: I would say it's going to be a very interesting few months regarding Putellas. She can choose pretty much any club in the world and obviously can choose to stay at Barcelona too. The latest I've been told is that she's still deciding her next steps but there has definitely been a suggestion that WSL clubs are interested. London City Lionesses have the money and the ambition so I wouldn't rule them out.\n\nQ. Do you think it is curious that Chelsea were quiet?\n\nEmma: Very. They are out of the WSL title race, have injuries in the squad and clearly needed to add before the Champions League quarter-finals. I was disappointed.\n\nWhat's gone wrong for Chelsea in the WSL this season?\n\nOut of contract in the summer - so what next for these stars?\n\nQ. Any updates on Katie McCabe and Arsenal? Where would you like her to go?\n\nEmma: With McCabe's contract running out and no talks on a contract renewal, it has always been expected that she would leave in the summer. She has not decided her future but she's understandably got options. I think she's definitely still good enough to be playing Champions League football so I would like to see her stay in Europe, and preferably in the WSL. Manchester City would be a great fit but a controversial one I'm sure for fans.\n\nQ. Was there interest in [Arsenal midfielder] Victoria Pelova or a transfer request? I felt like if Georgia Stanway was about to get in, she would've been free to leave.\n\nEmma: Pelova is one of many we believe is out of contract this summer at Arsenal, so naturally her future is uncertain. I'm not aware of any transfer request but I would be surprised if she doesn't move. It's going to be a transition period for the club with the likes of Stanway and Ona Batlle on their list to bring in.\n\nThere's also been attention on Emily Fox, who Arsenal want to sign a longer-term contract. It was widely reported her deal was due to expire this summer; however, I've been told she may have an additional year on her existing contract. We believe she may be tied down to 2027, not 2026, as originally thought. That means the club would have longer to negotiate.\n\nQ. Just wondering if there's been any updates regarding Bunny Shaw's contract?\n\nEmma: It is something I am monitoring. The latest we were told was that the discussions were positive but it is a concern it's not been agreed. I would be surprised if she leaves.\n\nQ. Can you comment on Brighton's January window? Seemed like a very muted month. Are they happy with their squad? Also do you have any information about Fran Kirby and whether she was approached during the window?\n\nEmma: Personally, I think Brighton are short in forward positions and I would have liked to have seen them do more. They are very particular with their recruitment as it's led a lot by data. I think they may have missed out on one target, but I would expect a busy summer. A lot of clubs this season are bracing for that with it being a non-major tournament year in Europe. In terms of Kirby, Italian media reported that Juventus made bids. I don't know on that, but I do know Brighton would not have sold at any price in January.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Under-19 World Cup, final, Harare\n\nIndia 411-9 (50.0 overs): Suryavanshi 175 (80); Minto 3-63\n\nIndia teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a stunning 175 from just 80 balls in the Under-19 World Cup final against England.\n\nThe 14-year-old hammered 15 sixes and 15 fours at a strike rate of 218.75 during a brutal and breathtaking knock at the Harare Sports Club in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe scored 24 off his first 24 balls, meaning his last 151 runs came off just 56 deliveries.\n\nSuryavanshi's 126-minute stay at the crease was eventually ended by England seamer Manny Lumsden in the 26th over to leave India 251-3.\n\nLumsden took pace off the ball and Suryavanshi gloved an attempted slog sweep to England captain and wicketkeeper Thomas Rew.\n\nA number of England's players shook Suryavanshi's hand as he left the field in recognition of the brilliance of his innings.\n\nIndia finished on 411-9 from their 50 overs - the fifth highest total in U19 World Cup history and a record for a final eclipsing the 253-7 made by Australia against India in the 2024 final.\n\nSuryavanshi's score took his World Cup tally to 439 runs in seven innings at 62.71 - four runs clear of Afghanistan's Faisal Khan as the tournament's leading run-scorer.\n\nSome other notable statistics from Suryavanshi's innings:\n\nIt was the highest score in an Under-19 World Cup final, beating Unmukt Chand's 111* for India in the 2012 final against Australia.\n\nThe innings gives him the ninth highest score in the history of youth ODIs. South Africa's Jorich van Schalkwyk (215 vs Zimbabwe) is the only player to make a double century.\n\nIt was the sixth-highest individual score in the history of all matches played at U19 World Cups.\n\nHis knock included the record for most sixes (15) in a youth ODI innings, beating his own record of 14 against the United Arab Emirates at last year's U19 Asia Cup.\n\nHis 15 sixes is the highest number in an Under-19 World Cup innings. Only two other players have managed double digits.\n\nThe century off 55 balls is the second fastest in U19 World Cups, behind Will Malajczuk's 51-ball hundred for Australia against Japan earlier in this year's tournament\n\nIt is the latest achievement for Suryavanshi, who shot to global fame in April last year when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.\n\nHe then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.\n\nIt was also the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, he struck what was then the fastest recorded century in a youth ODI, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester.\n\nHe took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.\n\nFour months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.\n\nListen to ball-by-ball commentary of the final on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Shovelling snow, finding childcare and a frenetic scramble for plane tickets.\n\nIt's been an unexpectedly stressful few weeks for Scotland's cricketers, who were thrust into action by Bangladesh's decision to boycott the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Scots were called up by the International Cricket Council (ICC) by virtue of being the highest-ranked team not already at the tournament, but the players were finding out as everyone else was - via social media and news outlets.\n\n\"It was just so many screenshots of Bangladeshi journalists and all these tweets,\" Scotland spinner Mark Watt told the BBC's No Balls: The Cricket Podcast.\n\n\"All the boys were just flying round saying 'is this true? Is this going to be happening?'\n\n\"It was like that scene in The Office - 'it's happening, it's happening, stay calm'. Cricket Scotland have done really well to get to organise everything so quickly and getting everyone out to India so quickly.\"\n\nNo Balls: Watt's this? Scotland at the T20 World Cup?\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nNo sponsor, kit on order & visa wait - Scotland embrace late World Cup call\n\nScotland had failed to reach the World Cup because of a hugely disappointing qualifying campaign in the Netherlands last summer, which included defeats by Italy and Jersey.\n\n\"It's so surreal,\" Watt said. \"I did a chat at a local club and they were saying, 'what are you going to do when the World Cup's on?' And I was like, 'I'm not even going to watch any games because I'm still so gutted that we're not playing in it'.\"\n\nInstead of prepping for subcontinental conditions, players based in Scotland were undergoing fitness programmes and going about their day-to-day lives when the news started to filter through.\n\n\"[Michael Leask] lives in Aberdeen and he was shovelling snow as we were getting all these calls,\" Watt said.\n\n\"We were doing boxing and between sets we're saying 'do you think we're actually going to go?'\n\n\"Not a lot of cricket was going on, it was other things. [Matthew] Cross is trying to build his house at the moment, so he's doing all his DIY.\n\n\"He's been stressed trying to get other people to go in and do the stuff he was going to do.\n\n\"People who have kids were trying to get them minded.\n\n\"I got all my holidays out of the way last year. I was looking forward to a little break, but I'm very happy to be here.\"\n\nThe last-minute nature of Scotland's entry has drawn comparisons to a famous equivalent in the world of football.\n\n\"Everyone keeps saying Denmark [at the Euros] in 1992, because they didn't qualify and won it,\" Watt said. \"Anything's possible. Imagine that?\"\n\nAfter Watt and his team-mates knew they were going to India, they were not sure when they would depart.\n\nFlights were booked in the hope that visas would come through, and when they did the rush to get halfway around the world began.\n\n\"It was like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" Watt said. \"I got my golden ticket and I was like, 'you need to get me on the flight tonight'.\n\n\"Leasky in Aberdeen had to drive two and a half hours to Edinburgh, he got his visa through the same time as me.\n\n\"We're all so excited and so grateful this opportunity came about, but also feel sorry for Bangladesh on the other side of it.\"\n\nScotland are one of five European sides at the competition and one of nine associate ICC members.\n\nAfter warm-up defeats by Afghanistan and Namibia, they take on West Indies in their opening match on Saturday, before games against Italy, England and Nepal in Group C, with the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nWatt says the prospect of seeing different match-ups can only be a positive.\n\n\"Obviously I've got a bit of favouritism for their associates,\" he said.\n\n\"But I just think the more the merrier. You see these Test-playing nations play against each other so often, it's a little bit samey and I think it's really refreshing when the associates come to play against these big teams.\n\n\"Obviously sometimes the results don't go your way, but it's the only way these teams and ourselves are going to learn how to play against them.\n\n\"So it's a great learning curve, but also, we're not there just to learn, but we're there to beat teams.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "BBC Sport crunches the numbers to see if greater ambition in attack can secure England a Six Nations title.",
    "fullText": "England begin their Six Nations campaign against Wales on Saturday having won their past 11 matches and completed their first unbeaten four-Test autumn in nearly a decade.\n\nWith recent results driven by greater ambition in attack, BBC Sport examines whether England's firepower can prove decisive in their hunt for a first Six Nations title in six years.\n\nRewind to three years ago and England were effectively the worst attacking side in the top tier of Test rugby.\n\nSteve Borthwick had been appointed as head coach with just nine months to prepare for a Rugby World Cup and opted for a failsafe approach: kick high, long and often, and limit mistakes.\n\nThe reductive strategy so nearly secured successive World Cup finals - but often proved soporific for supporters.\n\nEngland's limitations were such that an Italy side which began 2023 ranked 12th in the world - lower than Samoa – still scored more tries across the calendar year, despite playing three fewer matches.\n\nEngland had not so much left the handbrake on as lost the keys to a car locked in the garage.\n\nThe following year, a transitional team lost seven of 12 Tests as they continued to tread water in attack.\n\nMiddling metrics. Fleeting momentum.\n\nIn 2025, England's attack evolved into something with verve and variety. Only back-to-back world champions South Africa scored more tries, while Opta data demonstrates a drastic improvement in comparison to every other Tier 1 nation.\n\nAnd England's new-found ambition underpinned a year of growth – winning a series in Argentina with a depleted squad and defeating New Zealand for just the ninth time in their 120-year rivalry as part of an unbeaten autumn.\n\nEngland's current run of 11 wins is their longest in nearly a decade.\n\nThose 2025 numbers may have been boosted by a record-breaking triumph against Wales last March but the same could be said for resounding wins by South Africa, New Zealand, France and Argentina against the same opponent – and England's attack still compares favourably over the past year.\n\nFormer Red Rose winger Chris Ashton believes the catalyst for change was England's fourth successive loss against Scotland, at Murrayfield in the 2024 Six Nations.\n\n\"Steve has a very pragmatic style and it's hard to convince him otherwise,\" said Ashton, who scored 20 tries in 44 caps for England between 2010 and 2019.\n\n\"Sometimes, losses show you where you're going wrong. That loss against Scotland was one-sided and showed we're not spending enough time on attack.\"\n\nThere have been annual gains since the Edinburgh defeat two years ago.\n\nUnder the guidance of Richard Wigglesworth, England's attack scored 25 tries in last year's Six Nations, the most the team have managed in a single campaign in almost a quarter of a century.\n\nAs well as the 10-try rout of Wales, they ran in four against eventual champions France and seven at home to Italy.\n\nLee Blackett - the mastermind of a Bath backline that scored an unrivalled 102 tries on their way to winning last year's Premiership - inherited that upward trajectory.\n\nSeconded for the tour of Argentina last summer with a brief to \"remould\" England's attack, a 2-0 series win followed, despite the absence of 15 senior players to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia.\n\nBlackett was then appointed attack coach permanently in September.\n\nA clean sweep of the autumn followed, including the exhilarating win against New Zealand.\n\nIn the early days of Borthwick's reign, attacking platforms were often wasted by an inaccurate, even hopeful kick. England were statistically the worst of all Tier 1 sides at turning clear opportunities into tries, converting just 28% of their chances.\n\nHowever, in 2025, only South Africa and France were more effective at scoring from a line-break, with England's completion rate rising to 43%.\n\n\"(Blackett) is really good at giving players confidence to take risks,\" said Ashton. \"You need a coach who's encouraging you to score tries.\"\n\nThe statement victory against New Zealand also underlined England's enhanced ability to seize the biggest moments.\n\nIn 2024, they lost all three meetings with the All Blacks despite leading each one heading into the final quarter.\n\nBut at Twickenham two months ago, England responded to an opening salvo of 12 unanswered points to take control of the game - a hold they did not relinquish in the latter stages despite losing influential back-row Ben Earl to a yellow card on 65 minutes.\n\nIt was the ultimate vindication of England's destructive \"Pom Squad\" bench and followed wins against France, Scotland and Argentina earlier last year when England were either losing, or level, after an hour.\n\n\"Accuracy\" may be a beloved buzzword of elite coaches, but the data shows a clear improvement in how England handle the closing stages of Test rugby.\n\n\"Against New Zealand it was close but in the final quarter they took the game away from them,\" said Ashton.\n\n\"It was a massive moment in terms of development and mindset of the players. They're now trying to go on and win those matches late on, not just survive.\"\n\nThere does, however, remain a Springbok in the room. England have defeated France, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina over the past 12 months but will not face the world's most formidable defence until this summer.\n\nTheir development will instead be tested when they begin their Six Nations campaign by hosting Wales on Saturday before a round two Calcutta Cup clash in Scotland.\n\nEngland's preparations have been disrupted by an increasing number of injuries in the front row but Borthwick still named 11 Lions in his matchday squad to take on Wales.\n\nThe side is otherwise settled – no debuts were awarded in November, the first time that has happened in an autumn series for England in 26 years.\n\nEngland, though, have not won at Murrayfield since 2020 – the last time they went on to become Six Nations champions – while they travel to Paris in round five having not triumphed on French soil in a decade.\n\nBut Ashton believes strength in depth can help sustain title ambitions for a side who have finished fourth, third and second over the past three years.\n\n\"All the signs say England could win it this year,\" said the former Saracens winger.\n\n\"Scotland didn't get the autumn wins they may have wanted, Ireland have injuries and an older squad.\n\n\"France are dangerous but England are in a confident place.\"\n\nAnd such confidence stems from developing different ways to win.\n\nKicking remains an integral part of the Borthwick battleplan – along with most Test teams – but it is no longer a means to simply mitigate risk.\n\nEngland are more prepared to play wide and vary their passing game, built on the rediscovery of a physical edge.\n\nUtilising ball carriers like Earl and wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso in threatening areas, England's gainline success - a metric that indicates how effective the ball-carrying team is at knocking back defenders - has improved significantly.\n\nIn 2023, their success rate was just 58%, ranking England sixth in Tier 1. In 2025, it was 65% - second only to hard-hitting South Africa (66%).\n\nThey also gained more metres per carry (4.3m) than every other Tier 1 team last year.\n\nAs a result, they have scored more tries, beaten more defenders and completed more offloads than at any time under Borthwick.\n\n\"England are in as good a spot as you could possibly be even with some injuries up front,\" added Ashton.\n\n\"They've won games in different ways which is also key – you can't just have one way of playing against any given team.\n\n\"We want to start the Six Nations well, give the lads a lot of confidence and get some tries, too.\"",

    "fullText": "Preliminary EU ruling says app shifts brains of users into ‘autopilot mode’, with concerns for children and vulnerable adults\n\nTikTok could be forced into changes to make the app less addictive to users after the EU indicated the platform had breached the bloc’s digital safety rules.\n\nThe EU’s executive arm said in a preliminary ruling that the popular app had infringed the Digital Services Act (DSA) due to its “addictive design”.\n\nThe European Commission said TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, had not adequately assessed how its design could harm the physical and mental wellbeing of users including children and vulnerable adults.\n\nThe preliminary ruling accused TikTok of ignoring indicators of compulsive use, such as the amount of time children spend on the app at night.\n\nThe commission said it was considering forcing changes to the app’s design, including alterations to its powerful algorithm that pushes content to users.\n\n“At this stage, the commission considers that TikTok needs to change the basic design of its service,” it said in a statement. “For instance, by disabling key addictive features such as ‘infinite scroll’ over time, implementing effective ‘screen time breaks’, including during the night, and adapting its recommender system.”\n\nThe commission said TikTok’s safety regime appeared to be inadequate, singling out the screentime management and parental control tools as not doing enough to mitigate the risks created by the app’s addictive design. The screentime management features were too easy to dismiss and parental controls were time-draining to install, the preliminary ruling added.\n\nThe commission said its preliminary views did not prejudge the outcome of the investigation and TikTok would have the opportunity to challenge its findings.\n\nOnline safety campaigners have urged politicians to tackle features on social media platforms that encourage users to stay online. The crossbench peer and online safety campaigner Beeban Kidron, a leading voice in the UK debate, has urged the British government to “detoxify the dopamine loops” of addictive social media platforms.\n\nBreaches of the DSA can result in a fine totalling up to 6% of a company’s annual turnover, as well as the imposition of remedies such as an app redesign. TikTok does not publish its revenues, but according to estimates from the World Advertising Research Centre it will post revenues of $35bn (£26bn) this year.\n\nTikTok said it rejected the commission’s findings. “The commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us,” a spokesperson for the company said.\n\nLast year Elon Musk’s X was fined €120m (£104m) for a breach of the DSA in the first-ever fine under the legislation. The breaches included what the EU said was a “deceptive” blue-tick verification badge given to users, and impeding research around what adverts the platform had hosted.",

    "fullText": "Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) is a key step toward the quantum internet, as it provides the highest level of cryptographic security allowed by quantum mechanics. For it to have practical applications in a communication network, it must be achieved between nodes that are sufficiently far apart. An article published in Science demonstrates DI-QKD for the first time between two single-atom nodes connected by 100-kilometer-long fibers. This distance would be sufficient to achieve cryptographic security at a metropolitan scale.\n\nRamón y Cajal Researcher Department of Theoretical Physics UAM Madrid\n\nIn a future quantum communication network, a sufficiently large and reliable quantum computer (far beyond anything we currently have) could break the cryptographic keys used to protect our data and operations. The solution is to use new cryptographic keys based on the properties of quantum physics. These new keys are also vulnerable to certain types of attacks, but a particularly secure way to generate them is for the sender and receiver to share a quantum system with the celebrated property of quantum entanglement. Any attack would destroy the entanglement, which would be easily detectable by measuring the so-called Bell inequalities. This is the principle behind device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD).\n\nIf we truly want DI-QKD to have practical applications in a future communication network, we must be able to perform it between network nodes separated by sufficiently large distances.\n\nIn this Science article, the researchers succeed in implementing DI-QKD between parties separated by distances ranging from 10 to 100 kilometers. The quantum systems that are entangled are neutral rubidium atoms.\n\nThe method used to entangle them was proposed, among others, by Ignacio Cirac in 2001 and consists of detecting the light emitted at a point halfway between the atoms. Since this light can originate from either atom indistinguishably, the rules of quantum physics tell us that, upon measuring a photon, the atoms become entangled. Although in this experiment the atoms are not actually separated by tens of kilometers—because they are located in the same laboratory—the distance is simulated by sending the light through coiled optical fiber cables of those lengths.\n\nQuantum entanglement is a very fragile property: as light travels through the fiber, small losses accumulate, and the resulting entanglement is of lower quality, which translates into higher error rates in the generated cryptographic keys. The experimental results show that the key error rate ranges from 3% at a distance of 11 kilometers to more than 7% at 100 kilometers. Therefore, although this represents an important step in the right direction, we are still far from being able to achieve a completely secure, error-free quantum key distribution over intercity distances.\n\nICREA research professor at the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO)\n\nWhat does this advance consist of?\n\n\"Cryptography is a very important field today: every day, a large number of confidential information exchanges take place. Quantum key distribution (QKD) cryptographic protocols allow two honest users—usually referred to as Alice and Bob—to share a secret key, which can then be used to transmit confidential information privately. This represents a paradigm shift: in these schemes, the security of the protocol is guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics.\n\nAround 2010, a series of successful attacks on QKD implementations showed that the security of these protocols can be compromised if the devices used in practice do not behave exactly as assumed in the theoretical description of the protocol. In other words, any mismatch between theory and experiment opens up opportunities for an adversary to break the security. To address this weakness, device-independent QKD protocols were introduced. In these protocols, the theoretical description makes no assumptions about the devices (it is independent of them), which are treated as black boxes. There is therefore no gap between theory and experiment that an adversary could exploit to break the communication, as in the earlier successful attacks. Device-independent protocols provide the highest level of security guaranteed by quantum physics. The quantum property used to achieve this exceptionally strong level of security is the violation of the so-called Bell inequalities, which is observed when measuring entangled particles.\n\nThe drawback of device-independent protocols is that their implementation is complex. Before this experiment, they had only been demonstrated in a configuration where the distance between Alice and Bob was two meters. The result was remarkable as a proof of principle, but in practice we do not usually need full cryptographic schemes to secure a transaction between two people who are only two meters apart. Taking a couple of steps would be more than enough 😊.\n\nThis article reports the experimental implementation of a device-independent protocol over distances of tens of kilometers, which are far more interesting from a practical point of view, and therefore opens the door to the viability of these protocols\".\n\n\"Excellent. It is a major achievement and a very significant improvement over the state of the art: it is the first practical demonstration of device-independent quantum key distribution\".\n\nAre there any limitations that should be taken into account?\n\n\"Despite being an impressive advance, it still has aspects of a proof of principle. The most important one is that Alice and Bob are not separated by tens of kilometers. They are located in the same laboratory, but connected by a fiber whose length is tens of kilometers. In principle, this configuration simulates the situation in which Alice and Bob are located at sites separated by tens of kilometers and connected by a fiber, but in practice it is not exactly the same.\n\nA slightly more technical point: the experiment reports that, for fiber distances of hundreds of kilometers, the conditions required to successfully carry out the protocol are observed, but a complete implementation has not yet been achieved\".",

    "description": "The Winter Olympics opening ceremony takes place on Friday, and for the 16 days that follow many eyes of sport lovers worldwide will be focused on the Milan-Cortina Games.",
    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics are upon us and Italy is ready - almost - to host 'the greatest show on Earth'.\n\nSome 2,900 athletes from more than 90 countries will compete on snow and ice over the next 16 days.\n\nThe Games are spread out across hundreds of miles in northern Italy, from fashionable Milan to chic Cortina d'Ampezzo, to the fellow Dolomite regions of Predazzo and Tesero, and the Alpine resorts of Livigno and Bormio.\n\nHere is everything you need to know.\n\nWhy 2026 could be GB's most successful Winter Olympics\n\nWhat's on when? Winter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\nWhile the action began on Wednesday, the Games officially get under way on Friday when the opening ceremony takes place at Milan's iconic San Siro stadium.\n\nA who's who of stars are set to appear, including multiple Grammy Award winner Mariah Carey and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n\nGiven the vast distances between the Olympic venue 'clusters', it's not possible for all athletes to be in Milan. But fear not, those based elsewhere will not miss out on the fun.\n\nA second ceremony, including its own Olympic cauldron, will take place in Cortina, while other satellite ceremonies will occur in Predazzo and Livigno.\n\nFigure skater Lilah Fear and bobsleigh pilot Brad Hall have the honour of carrying the Great Britain flag. Fear will do so in Milan, while Hall will be in Cortina.\n\nBBC coverage of the opening ceremony starts from 18:30 GMT, live on BBC Two and iPlayer.\n\nBBC Sport to show 450 hours of Winter Olympics\n\nCould it be that Great Britain - a land of no ice track, Eddie the Eagle and an average of 13 days of snow per year - is becoming a winter sports nation? Whisper it quietly, but the next few weeks could prove it so.\n\nTeam GB's best medal haul from a Winter Games is five - at Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 - but UK Sport says up to eight medals could be won this time around.\n\nSo who could be standing on the podium?\n\nTeam GB have two of the best men's skeleton athletes in two-time world champion Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatt. Between them, they won every World Cup gold medal this season.\n\nTake your pick of snowboarders Mia Brookes and Charlotte Bankes, and freestyle skiers Kirsty Muir and Zoe Atkin, as to who could win the nation's first Olympic gold or silver medal on snow.\n\nOn the ice, Lewis Gibson and Lilah Fear - widely seen as the next Torvill and Dean - are very much in with a shout of winning a first British Olympic figure skating medal since 1994, while Britain's curlers look set to add to their two medals from 2022.\n\nGet to know the Team GB Winter Olympics squad\n\nYour Winter Olympics need-to-know guide in six charts\n\nVonn, Gu and Malinin - global stars to follow at Milan-Cortina 2026\n\nFor the first time since the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, a new sport has been added to the Winter Olympic programme.\n\nSki mountaineering - or skimo - will take place in the resort of Bormio and features three medal events: men's and women's sprint, and the mixed relay.\n\nAthletes start by sprinting uphill with adhesive skins on their skis to provide traction. They then remove the skis, placing them in their backpack, and continue climbing on foot.\n\nAfter a further uphill section on skis, they remove the skins and ski downhill to the finish line.\n\nThere are no British athletes competing in skimo at the Games.\n\nA string of new events have also been added to the programme for Milan-Cortina: men's and women's dual moguls, men's and women's luge doubles, men's and women's team alpine combined, women's large hill individual in ski jumping, and the mixed relay team in skeleton.\n\nMilan and Cortina were selected as host cities in 2019 and while existing facilities have largely been used, new venues have been created for ice hockey and the sliding sports.\n\nA year out from the Games starting, the Cortina Sliding Centre - rebuilt on a century-old track at a cost of more than £72m - was facing a race against time to be ready.\n\nWhile that race was won, with the opening races of the bobsleigh and skeleton season taking place on the new track in November, the same cannot be said for the Milano Santagiulia ice hockey stadium.\n\nAs recently as Sunday, Olympic organisers said the stadium would not be completely finished in time for Thursday's first match of the Games - but they were \"absolutely certain\" all scheduled fixtures will be played there.\n\nThe 11,800-capacity stadium has been beset by delays and controversies - including a boycott warning from the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nThe rink in Milan, approved by the International Ice Hockey Federation, is shorter than the minimum requirement in the NHL, leading to suggestions there could be an increase in high-speed collisions. The quality of the ice has also been questioned.\n\nFrom an Olympics controversies perspective, things didn't get any better for hosts Italy when their biathlete Rebecca Passler was kicked out of the Games because of a failed doping test on Monday.\n\nItalian biathlete fails doping test before Olympics\n\nIce hockey venue will not be ready for start of Olympics\n\nAthletes with Russian or Belarusian passports have been banned from many sports since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn September, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it would allow athletes from the two nations to compete at the Winter Games under a neutral flag and strict conditions, as they did at the 2024 summer Olympics.\n\nThose conditions include showing they had not actively supported the war and were not contracted to the military.\n\nIn total, 20 competitors from Russia and Belarus are set to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) at Milan-Cortina across eight sports.\n\nHowever, four of the 13 Russian athletes approved to compete have links to activity supporting the war in Ukraine, according to evidence seen by BBC Sport.\n\nThey are figure skater Petr Gumennik, cross-country skiers Savelii Korostelev and Dariya Nepryaeva, and speed skater Kseniia Korzhova.\n\nThe IOC said it could not comment on individual cases but stated that the panel had \"reviewed the athletes in accordance with the executive board decision and the principles it had established\".\n\nNone of the athletes named responded to BBC Sport's requests for comment.\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity",

    "title": "How Casemiro revived his Man Utd career",
    "description": "Casemiro's Manchester United career looked to be petering out, but the veteran midfielder has found a return to form this season.",
    "fullText": "It was the lowest point of Casemiro's Manchester United career. A 2-0 home defeat by Newcastle on 30 December 2024.\n\nThat night, his team-mate Joshua Zirkzee was sarcastically cheered off by his own supporters, substituted after just 33 minutes.\n\nBut the common consensus that night was that if Casemiro had been brought off at that point, the reaction would have been worse.\n\nThe 33-year-old didn't play for a month after that, consigned to the bench for the following five games.\n\nYet if there was a debate now as to which player United could least afford to lose for the rest of the season, Casemiro would be near the top of the list.\n\nOnce, the Brazilian looked leggy and exposed in midfield. Now, he shines. The midfielder will leave Old Trafford when his contract expires at the end of the season - and it looks as if he will do so on a positive note. How has the veteran turned it around?\n\nWhy Man Utd are taking their time over manager decision\n\n'Form is temporary, class is permanent,' the football adage goes. But form is dictated by a number of factors.\n\nA footballer's performances can be affected by the side they play for, their tactics, their team-mates. Form is about situation.\n\nSo it can look as if a player has become worse - when in reality, the conditions around them have changed, limiting their chance to thrive.\n\nThis season, Casemiro has found himself in the situations that get the best out of him, more often.\n\nWhen Ruben Amorim was United's head coach, between November 2024 and January 2026, Casemiro had to play in a physically demanding role.\n\nBut his pre-season preparation was key in matching those demands this season, with the midfielder visibly leaner and stronger.\n\n\"Pre-season [is] a time to really grind, and really do some real work, then during the season you can focus more on the games themselves,\" he said about his summer.\n\nAmorim also deserves some credit for improving the squad's fitness this season too, a notable strength of his.\n\nWhen Liverpool were looking at successors to Jurgen Klopp, one area they looked at was an ability to keep their players fit, at which Arne Slot ranked second only to the Portuguese manager.\n\nThe fact United haven't played in European competition this season and were eliminated early from the domestic cups - meaning a total of just 40 games - will have helped protect Casemiro's legs in his final season at United too.\n\nIn his short time as United head coach since replacing the sacked Amorim in January, Michael Carrick has improved the conditions that Casemiro has found himself in on the pitch.\n\nDefensively, moving from Amorim's 5-2-3 shape, which required players to press high at times, to a more conservative and compact 4-4-2 shape has reduced the distances he has to cover.\n\nAdmittedly, United have played teams that look to dominate the ball, but under Carrick, Casemiro is averaging 10.3km per 90 minutes compared to the 10.7km per 90 minutes he ran under Amorim.\n\nIn wide areas, particularly during the 2-0 win over Manchester City on 17 January, the full-back, winger and striker near the ball would come over to apply pressure alongside the closest United central midfielder. This reduced the distances Casemiro had to defend alone, allowing him to win the ball more effectively.\n\nConserving his energy and making the most of his actions is a theme that continues into his duelling statistics under Carrick. Casemiro has contested an average of 9.5 duels per 90 minutes under Carrick - compared to 12.6 under Amorim. His success rate, however, has jumped up from 51% to 58%.\n\nIn attack, Casemiro boasts five goals and two assists in the Premier League this season, one goal away from his most prolific league campaign ever.\n\nWith more non-penalty goals than Viktor Gyokeres, Mohamed Salah and Bukayo Saka, Casemiro's contributions in attack have put United in contention for Champions League qualification.\n\nFour of his goals have come directly from set-pieces or the phase of play immediately after.\n\nThis season, United have become the most efficient scorers from set-pieces. They have scored eight per 100 set-pieces in the Premier League - something Amorim's assistant Carlos Fernandes deserves praise for.\n\nFrom set-pieces, Casemiro has typically been found at the back post, using a burst of speed to get free of his marker before heading the ball home, as he did in the 3-2 win against Fulham last Sunday.\n\nUnited have often paired Casemiro's back-post position with having a nearby team-mate use their body to provide a 'screen' - blocking opponents from getting close to the Brazilian as the ball floats over their head.\n\nIn addition to his goals, his general play on the ball looks far better this season.\n\nCasemiro has a tendency to play direct passes often - which can be a good or bad trait depending on a team's tactics.\n\nWith Amorim in charge, players were encouraged to execute certain passing routines that ended with the midfielders playing direct passes quickly to attackers running in behind.\n\nThat made games more end-to-end. But if the defenders didn't step up as passes were played, it left the two midfielders with huge spaces to cover.\n\nPairing Casemiro with a strong runner in Bruno Fernandes helped mitigate some of these concerns but under Carrick, general play has been more measured.\n\nThe defensive midfield and attacking lines are closer together - with the team moving more collectively. With this more controlled approach in attack, Casemiro's direct passing becomes a necessary risk rather than something that exposes the weaknesses of the team.\n\nFor Matheus Cunha's goal against Fulham, the ball moved from the right side of the pitch to Casemiro in the centre. Casemiro turned his body and head to face towards the left, disguising his intentions - causing Fulham midfielder Alex Iwobi to shift that way.\n\nThis opened up space for Casemiro to play a through ball, resulting in Cunha's goal.\n\nDuring Casemiro's worst run of form, questions were asked of his ability on the ball, under pressure, in build-up play.\n\nThis season, Amorim often skipped short build-up, with goalkeeper Senne Lammens more suited to playing long. These more chaotic moments of the game suited Casemiro who often read where the ball would land, winning second balls proactively.\n\nAgainst Fulham, Carrick asked United to build out from the back at times, while accounting for Casemiro's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn build-up, Casemiro peeled wide at times. This dragged his marker, Iwobi, into an unfamiliar position while opening up a passing lane centrally for Kobbie Mainoo to receive the ball.\n\nFinding the more technically secure player under pressure is a sensible use of personnel. Casemiro then moved closer to Mainoo, asking for the ball, under less pressure.\n\nCasemiro was used in a similar way his most successful spell as a player at Real Madrid. Head coaches Zinedine Zidane and Carlo Ancelotti both asked Luka Modric and Toni Kroos to drop deep and build up play, pushing Casemiro further forward when Real had the ball, minimising the number of times he was in situations where he might struggle.\n\nFairly or not, the way a footballer finishes their career tends to dictate how they are remembered.\n\nRaheem Sterling, for instance, made his debut at 17, and has won numerous trophies, but perhaps gets less respect than he deserves because of how the past few years of his career have petered out.\n\nFor a player as accomplished as Casemiro, central to one of Real Madrid's greatest eras, there was a genuine risk of his reputation suffering after last season.\n\nThe manner of his revival - helped by his buying into Carrick's use of him - has laid the platform for a much happier conclusion to his career in England.\n\nWith United five points off third place, and with 42 points to play for, the serial winner will hope to leave Manchester United with no regrets.",

    "description": "Humans have no damn clue how to measure intelligence.",
    "fullText": "tl;dr: Humans have no damn clue how to measure intelligence.\n\nWater is wet (and heavy). Because it's wet/heavy, it tends to flow downhill (and\nunderground).\n\nTo continue living, humans often wet themselves (\"drinking\"/\"bathing\") and their\nplants (\"irrigation\"). But many humans live uphill (and aboveground) -- to\nmaintain wetness, they raise water to their homes/farms.\n\nOnce you carry your own water, you will learn the value of every drop.\n\nBut water is heavy (and wet), so humans built machines\n(\"horse mills\") and forced horses to\nraise water.\n\nHorses (and humans) are made of meat. Meat is great, but it's prone to disease,\nexhaustion, distraction, etc. Ever cleverer, humans built non-meat machines\n(\"steam engines\") and forced\nwater to raise water.\n\nSo that an engine which will raise as much water as two horses, working\n together at one time in such a work, can do, and for which there must be\n constantly kept ten or twelve horses for doing the same. Then I say, such an\n engine may be made large enough to do the work required in employing eight,\n ten, fifteen, or twenty horses to be constantly maintained and kept for doing\n such a work…\n\n-- Thomas Savery, The Miner's Friend (1702)\n\nHorses can do work, i.e.\nexert force over distance.\nWork over time is \"power\".\n\nTo explain his steam engine to other humans, James Watt defined \"1 horsepower\"\nas \"33,000 foot-pounds per minute\", which approximates a typical horse's work on\na typical mill.\n\nThe \"foot-pound\" is\n the worst unit of energy. Be careful not to confuse it with the\n \"pound-foot\", which\n is a unit of torque.\n\nHorse numbers are convenient at horse-scale, but cumbersome in calculations for\ntelegraphy and rocketry, so scientists/engineers literally removed horses from\nthe equation. Humans now measure power in \"Watts\" -- named after the human who\nnamed the measurement after horses. 1 horsepower equals ~746 watts.\n\nOne SpaceX Starship exceeds 100 million horsepower, but 100 million horses\nprobably can't pull a sleigh into orbit. Horse-force is not\nthrust, and\nEarth's ~60 million total horses\nare not enough.\n\nIndeed -- scientists have yet to discover even a single horse living on the\n moon. Terra Luna's scant fossil record suggests that horses may have never\n even established a stable population beyond Earth's atmosphere. Biologists\n blame the moon's unforgiving atmosphere; physicists blame the tyranny of\n the rocket equation.\n Either way, the moon seems safe from equine invasion.\n\nMicrowave ovens run at roughly one horsepower. This sounds like nonsense unless\nyou're familiar with math, energy, work, dimensional analysis, electromagnetism,\nradiation, dielectric heating, magnetron design, and thermodynamics.\n\nWell, it sounds like nonsense until you microwave your hundredth frozen burrito\nand it becomes mundane magic. We learned to measure energy, then capture it,\nstore it, and harness it.\n\nBut humans still have no damn clue what \"intelligence\" is. We can't measure it,\ncan't capture it, can't store it, and rarely use it.\n\nSometimes intelligence smells like \"cognitive horsepower\", i.e. some\npeople/machines seem to have better overall engines for doing brilliant\nthinky-things.\n\"g-factor\"\nresearchers show that many positive cognitive traits tend to correlate with each\nother. But the world also creates counterexamples like\nAlphaGo and\nKim Peek -- non-generalizable\nbrilliance.\n\nIQ demonstrates intelligence in the same way that horse races demonstrate\n horsepower.\n\nWe can't define intelligence, yet we desperately want it -- and pay handsomely\nfor it. Institutions approximate cognitive horsepower (if it exists) via crude\nproxies:\n\nIt's unclear how these measures compare and interact. If I were to get a heart\ntransplant tomorrow, should I prefer 5 medical students over 1 expert? Should I\nprefer 2 Harvard grads over 3 UCR grads? A human child or 10,000 crows?\n\nSuch comparisons sound like nonsense; we lack equations to convert absurdity\ninto understanding. We want to convert cognition into mundane magic. We need\ncrowpower.\n\nCrows are a good unit of measurement. They're cute\n (awww), smart (whatever\n that means), portable (~500g), and consistent/fungible (no 10x crows).\n\nScientific revolutions\nare punctuated by\nparadigm shifts. These shifts\noften occur when thought-experiment crash into new mathematical tooling:\nSchrödinger's cat, Newton's cannonball, Hilbert's hotel, Bell's spaceship,\nMaxwell's demon, Mermin's device, Zeno's race, Heisenberg's microscope,\nGalileo's ship, Savery's horse, Turing's machine, etc.\n\nIn each case, mature mathematics hit the limits of human intuition. Consider\ncrowpower a catalyst.\n\nWe don't know what it means to cognitively \"raise water\". We lack the tools to\nquantify (or estimate) intellectual work. Consider the following tasks:\n\nWe intuitively understand these as \"challenges\", but it's hard to explain how\nor why they're challenging. Concepts like\ncomputational complexity,\nlogical depth,\nlearnability,\nKolmogorov complexity,\netc. could be\ndifferent parts of the same elephant.\n\nThere are no horses on the moon -- could 100 million crows solve Fermat's Last\nTheorem?\n\nFLT was postulated in 1637. Despite countless attempts, it went unsolved\n until Andrew Wiles produced a\n proof in 1994. This was absurdly difficult; many rank Wile's FLT proof among\n the greatest feats in mathematical history.\n\n100M crows might not be able to prove FLT, but could 100 clones of Adam Sandler\ndo it?\n\nI know very little about Adam Sandler -- he could totally be as smart as\n Andrew Wiles. I specifically chose a comedic actor who plays\n an average Joe.\n\nI fully expect that comparing Sandler to Wiles is like comparing a 10-watt\n heater to an 11-watt blender. Wattage clearly explains rotational vs.\n thermal energy; nobody blames their heater for frothing milk poorly.\n\nHere are some crude units-of-measurement to consider:\n\nI shouldn't need to tell you that rhetoric like this is dangerous. Don't\n take this too seriously. Be kind to each other.\n\nSince nobody knows how human intelligence scales, \"oz\" (superhuman\n intelligence) purposefully ambiguates\n Oz and\n Ozymandias. Of course this\n also ambiguates the accepted abbreviation for \"ounces\", but this is the best\n I can do with my limited joepower.\n\nIt took 1 wile to prove FLT. It remains unclear how many joes it would take to\nperform the same feat. Here are some common responses to this\nthought-experiment:\n\nWe still have no damn clue what we're measuring.\n\nOpenAI's GPT models might illuminate our fragile human hierarchies. Is GPT-4\n closer to 99 gumps or 0.8 joes?\n\nWe weigh horses because we don't know how to test strength. In this world,\nnobody can distinguish a strong horse from a fat horse.\n\n100 duck-sized horses are not equivalent to 1 horse-sized duck. 100 1MHz\nprocessors are not equivalent to 1 100MHz processor.\n\nNeil J. Gunther's\nUniversal Scalability Law\nformulates this phenomenon:\n\nNote that β (i.e. \"communication overhead\") dominates parallelization gains.\nAs team size increases, the cost of talking can exceed the value of the work.\n\nEven if 100M crows could be motivated to prove FLT, the bandwidth of crow speech\nis probably insufficient.\n\nCoordination is hard. Humans build tools like traffic signs and\npunch clocks and SMS to more\nefficiently communicate across spacetime. Likewise, crow communication could be\naugmented with specialized tools/devices. Imagine millions of crows wearing the\ncutest little VR headsets -- each bird working on their own microscopic math\nmini-game in exchange for grapes or whatever crows eat.\n\nWe also don't know how to measure motivation. How many kilowatt-hours (a\n proxy for economic value) would it take to incentivize a crow to solve\n equations? How many kW-hours would it take to make those crows flip burgers?\n\nBut we've got too many variables on the table -- let's assume all crows are\ntelepathic and cooperative. When β is zero, USL is equivalent to\nAmdahl's Law.\n\nα represents contention. This variable depends entirely on the problem (e.g.\nproving FLT) and solution (e.g. proof strategy/algorithm). Information \"assembly\nlines\" cannot be parallelized -- some work/processing/computing cannot begin\nuntil intermediate results are completed.\n\nIn some sense, all difficult problems are difficult because they are\n sequential. In ten coin flips, it is easy to get any head, but hard to get\n all heads.\n\nAutomated theorem-proving\nis hard. Because FLT\nwas remarkably difficult, the proof is probably resistant to highly-parallel\nstrategies. 100M crows can only prove FLT if they have enough compute/memory to\ncomplete its most difficult subsequence.\n\nWith enough training and error-correction, an average crow could emulate a\ntransistor. A sizable murder of crows could emulate a Commodore 64, an Intel i9,\nan Nvidia RTX 5070, a human brain, etc.\n\nIf you believe that a crow can emulate a transistor, it would only take\n a few thousand crows to\n build a CPU. With enough patience and mechanical prowess, crows could\n summarize PDFs and write novels.\n\nThe Chinese Room Argument is\ndiscussed ad nauseam -- few folks would consider individual crow\ntransistors/neurons as \"intelligent\" despite their emergent behavior. But it's\nunclear how much intelligence (if any) each crow can contribute to a\ncollective.\n\nThere is only one way to make salt; salt molecules cannot be \"more salty\" or\n\"less salty\". But there are infinite ways to make\npepper -- a messy blend of\nbiomolecules created by messy genomes created by messy selection pressures.\n\nIf intelligence is like salt, then crows are very expensive (and cute)\ntransistors. If intelligence is like pepper, a murder could someday be President\nof the United States.\n\nMany people view intelligence as a sudden \"waking up\" phenomenon. Ice melts;\nwater boils. In this lens, evolution produced smarter ape architectures until a\n\"phase-change\" happened and Homo sapiens took center stage.\n\nWhenever I glimpse phase-changes, I reach for\n universality\n in my mathematical toolbox.\n\nIt's hard to take this idea seriously if you've ever experienced childhood.\nHumans slowly grow intelligent. Even milestones like\nobject-permanence and\nwalking and\nliteracy become gradual under\nscrutiny.\n\nBut ideas also \"click\" into place. It's hard to \"unsee\" ambiguous illusions.\n It's difficult to simultaneously understand why sqrt(2) is irrational and\n not understand it -- intelligence may be gradual, but the experience is\n sudden/frenetic.\n\nBut along some orthogonal axis, we've taught robots object-permanence and\nwalking and literacy, but it's \"not real general intelligence\". It's \"just\nAlexNet\" or \"just\nPID\"\nor \"just stochastic parrots\"\n-- until AI performs some magic phase-change, many folks won't admit it into the\nCognition Club; it's merely \"artificial\" intelligence until it's\n\"synthetic\" intelligence.\n\nBut if the Cognition Club is real, why is it so hard to describe its minimal\nentry requirements? How many crows would it take to make it into the club? How\ndid a dead parrot\nobliterate the Turing Test?\n\nHumans that excel at any subject tend to excel at all subjects. Researchers\ncall this phenomenon\n\"g-factor\" or g.\n\nThis model compliments\n s-factors\n and contrasts\n theories of multiple intelligences.\n\nBut if 10K crows could comfortably beat every Nintendo game, would you trust\nthat same murder to file your taxes?\n\nVideo games don't span the full gamut of human knowledge/ability, but they're\narguably the most objective available measure of general problem-solving\nability.\n\nMany video games are harder than college-level courses. Whirlitzer of\n Wisdom\n involves lunar cartography.\n\nVideo games form an objective (albeit anthropocentric (and ethnocentric))\nhierarchy for g:\n\nTypewriter monkeys could beat Super Mario Bros. given enough time, so this\nmeasure needs additional parameters. Because game-completion times can range\nfrom minutes to days, a reasonable time constraint might be \"no more than 100x\nslower than current glitchless any% WR\". For zero-shot attempts, it might be\nwise to allow ~10 lives/restarts within the total allocated time limit.\n\nLet's try an example. Suppose you want to hire crows to beat racing games.\nMurder A beats 40% of Mario Kart installments. Murder B beats 100% of\nfirst-person shooters. Murder C beats 5% of all games. Which murder do you hire?\n\nIntuitively, games are more similar when insights/learnings transfer, i.e.\nlearning game A reduces the learning effort of game B. We'd expect the average\n\"learning distance\" between racing games to be smaller than the distance between\nall games. If learning distance is independent of players, we can arrange all\nthese games in a high-dimensional \"gamespace\".\n\nExtrapolating from this framework, g-factor does not measure the competence of\nplayers -- it measures the compactness (or maybe\ncompressibility) of a\ngamespace region. The existence of a g-factor merely suggests that human\nschool subjects are not so dissimilar: French, English, music, physics,\nmathematics, etc.\n\nBut what in the precise h*ck is gamespace? Surprise -- if our games are\narranged by learning distance, then gamespace simply contains all learnable\nproblems.\n\nThere are multiple ways to define \"learnability\":\n statistical learning theory,\n algorithmic learning theory,\n computational learning theory,\n etc.\n\nLearnable problems are a subset of\ncomputable problems.\n\nThe Church-Turing Thesis\nasserts that computable functions are precisely those that can be computed by a\nTuring Machine (TM) and anything\nthat can simulate a TM. A system is [Turing-complete (universal)] if it can\nsimulate any TM.\n\nMany systems are unexpectedly Turing-complete, e.g. Dwarf Fortress,\n Minecraft, Conway's Game of Life, Magic: The Gathering.\n\nHumans simulate computers,\nsimulate conversations,\nsimulate copulation,\nand simulate creatures.\n\nTo \"think\" is to simulate oneself. Memories simulate the past; dreams simulate\nthe future. The\nhard problem of consciousness\n-- why subjective experience exists -- might be a mere side effect of simulating\nsimulation itself.\n\nIf epiphenomenalists are\n correct, consciousness might be an unnecessary side effect of intelligence.\n\nIf true, all universal simulators (\"supersimulators\"?) are members of the\nCognition Club. Simulation-depth might be a useful metric.\n\nNo two supersimulations are alike -- only a bat can\n be a bat,\n and only you can be you.\n\nLearning is arguably an act of simulation: players sample examples, then predict\n(i.e. simulate) results. Difficult games demand more training; bad players\nrequire more training.\n\nAndrew Wiles required 41 years of post-training to prove Fermat's Last Theorem.\nAs it stands, 100M crows face fierce competition.\n\nWe measure things we care about; we make units for things we measure. We made\nhorsepower to sell steam engines. We made Watts to harness the [literal] power\nof electricity.\n\nWe needed energy beyond horses; we need cognition beyond crows, but we cannot\nmeasure intelligence. We think we know what intelligence looks like, but we have\nno clue when/how/why it happens.\n\nHumans tend to confuse properties with processes. Illness isn't a divine\n curse; it's wild emergent behavior culminating from the struggle of\n countless organisms to survive a little longer. A frog is not a thing that\n hops; a frog is the phenomenon of frogging.\n\nMeasure difficulty. Measure motivation. Measure contention. Measure crosstalk.\nMeasure collaboration. Measure gamespace. Measure compression. Measure learning.\nMeasure simulation-depth. Measure everything. Measure anything.\n\nHumans need intelligence. We get the units we deserve.",

    "fullText": "At its new Stone Mountain, Georgia, facility, Roomba-like robots shuffle between stacks, another adds shipping labels while another arranges packages in pallets\n\nOne of the reasons Amazon is spending billions on robots? They don’t need bathroom breaks. Arriving a few minutes early to the public tour of Amazon’s hi-tech Stone Mountain, Georgia, warehouse, my request to visit the restroom was met with a resounding no from the security guard in the main lobby.\n\nBetween the main doors and the entrance security gate, I paced and paced after being told I would have to wait for the tour guide to collect me and other guests for a tour of the 640,000-sq-ft, four-story warehouse.\n\nAmazon offers tours to the public at 28 of its 1,200 US warehouses – a recruiting and public-relations tool to boost brand trust and address criticisms of poor working conditions. It was something to consider as I wound up having to go in the parking lot, propping open my rental car door for privacy.\n\nBathroom access is one of the most notorious criticisms of Amazon’s treatment of workers. Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers have reported having to pee in water bottles due to lack of time and access, and have even said their bathroom breaks are timed.\n\nZoe Hoffman, an Amazon spokesperson, said it was “absurd and false to connect a visitor’s tour experience to that of our employees”, adding that workers were allowed “regularly scheduled breaks” throughout their shifts.\n\nNone of this will be an issue if Amazon’s multibillion-dollar robot dreams come true.\n\nAmazon cites 10 different robots through its warehouse network, though the Stone Mountain warehouse had only a handful of them, including the Roomba-like robots moving shelves of products around to stowers and pickers, an automated crane arm palletizing products, and a robot along a conveyor belt printing and adding shipping labels to boxes of products set to be mailed out of the warehouse.\n\nSeveral sections of the warehouse were closed off during the tour for construction for upgrades, though specifics weren’t disclosed.\n\nThe tour began with a spiel about how Amazon is a great place to work, rattling off Amazon’s 1.5 million global employees and 1 million workers in the US, before playing a brief video of Amazon workers at a warehouse in the UK that made similar claims.\n\nThe tour guide touted Amazon’s vast seasonal workforce of 250,000 workers, claiming many of those workers are then hired full-time.\n\nCriticisms of Amazon’s safety record, high injury rates, high employee turnover or the worker organizing efforts at the Stone Mountain warehouse after workers passed out on the job from heat exhaustion in 2022 were not mentioned. The tour guide, however, did finally offer guests a bathroom break before leading us through the warehouse.\n\nThe tour guide, from the local area, explained that the warehouse, which opened in late 2020, “came out of nowhere” from an area once covered in forest.\n\nThroughout the first floor of the warehouse, the ceilings were covered with an assembly line conveyor belt of yellow Amazon totes, either empty or filled with miscellaneous goods from grocery items to electronics. The sounds of the conveyor belt bellowing through the warehouse’s first-floor ceiling is loud, and tour guests were given headphones to be able to hear the tour guide. Signs around the warehouse stated “hearing protection required” but several of the workers didn’t appear to have any earplugs or other protection.\n\nThe second floor of the warehouse included worker stations surrounding stacks of products in a dark room. Robots resembling Roombas shuffled the stacks between stations to a worker, directed by a computer about what to pick or stow, where to place it or pull it from and where to move it.\n\nThe tour guide claimed that before the robots’ arrival, and in some facilities where the robots aren’t used, a worker with a pushcart used to go around pulling or stocking products.\n\nBack on the first floor, a single robotic arm was palletizing yellow totes of products. The tour guide claimed the facility had only one, had no plans to add more, and said it was only there to help human workers. The robot seemed to need human helpers as much as they needed it, unable to reach products that were too high in the tote, which were shuffled to the side for a human worker to fix and send back to them.\n\nNot so long ago, one of Amazon’s top robot executives (to be clear, he oversees robotics and is not himself a robot) was telling journalists they need not worry about robots taking people’s jobs.\n\nTye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, told the Guardian in 2022 he disagreed with the notion that artificial intelligence and robots wouold lead to the elimination of jobs at Amazon. “I just don’t see that at all,” said Brady. “We made our first serious investment in robotics over 10 years ago and in those 10 years we created more than a million jobs.”\n\nHe said: “The need for people to solve problems and use common sense will always be there. We are nowhere near that with robotics. It’s not even close. We have millions of years of evolution for the human brain that’s powered off 20 watts and a banana – that’s incredible.”\n\nNow the message from the top is very different. Last June, Andy Jassy, the Amazon chief executive, told white-collar workers at the company that the advancement of AI would eliminate jobs at the company over the next few years.\n\n“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years we expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy said in a memo.\n\nIn October, the New York Times reported on internal documents at Amazon that were presented to the company’s board, which included plans by the company to replace more than 500,000 jobs at Amazon and avoid hiring 160,000 workers by 2027. The documents cited an ultimate goal to automate 75% of its operations.\n\nAmazon denied the report, claiming “the documents referenced paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans”.\n\nThe company laid off about 14,000 corporate employees the same month in anticipation of adopting more broadly artificial intelligence technology, and recently announced plans to lay off an additional 16,000 employees, though Amazon denied that AI and automation had any role in this round of cuts. An Amazon spokesperson added: “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority of these reductions.”\n\nAmazon is reportedly developing “humanoid” robots to pop out of delivery vans to deliver packages, eventually replacing the work of delivery drivers.\n\nIn November, more than 1,000 Amazon workers signed an open letter expressing concern that the company’s “all-costs-justified, warp-speed” approach to developing the technology puts jobs, democracy and the environment at risk.\n\nStaff are seeing the impact already. An Amazon picker and stower at a warehouse in northern Georgia, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian that human resources at their Amazon site had gradually shifted from humans to artificial intelligence and computers.\n\n“We have had a big change at my warehouse in HR over the past six months. At first I noticed that the human resource personnel were just not available as much,” they said. “We now have a reduced staff for our HR, and we now have an automated texting service for us to use to contact HR.”\n\nThey also claimed Amazon pushes for cross-training and that workers in areas such as picking and stowing are learning other technical skills such as robot repair, in anticipation that their jobs may eventually be automated.\n\n“People are getting hurt stowing and picking, so that’s one of the reasons why Amazon is wanting to get robots that can do the work of the picker and the stower,” the worker said. “They’re letting us know that it’s smart for us to learn how to do something different, like robot repair work or something in it, because eventually this might be replaced.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said: “We’re preparing employees for the roles of the future because we believe investing in workers and our employees is more crucial than ever in this rapidly advancing technological age, especially with AI.”",

    "description": "We look at the key players and key battles that will decide whether the Seattle Seahawks or New England Patriots will win Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara.",
    "fullText": "In terms of the pre-season betting odds this is the most unlikely Super Bowl match-up for years, but there's no denying the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots deserve to be here.\n\nThe pair have shown different strengths and weaknesses but throughout an unpredictable season they have had long winning streaks and shown enviable consistency.\n\nThe Seahawks are the 4.5-point favourites in Santa Clara but in terms of the numbers there is not much between them at all, so expect this one to be a close call.\n\nIt could come down to a play here, a play call there and perhaps the finest of margins making the biggest of differences - Super Bowl's can by won and lost in the blink of an eye.\n\nSo let's see how the two sides match-up, what the key battles will be and exactly where Super Bowl 60 will be decided.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nBoth sides finished 14-3, won eight games on the road and developed a serious winning habit.\n\nThe Patriots lost their three games by a combined 19 points and the Seahawks lost theirs by just nine in total, so they are both tough to beat.\n\nThis is the first Super Bowl meeting between two teams that finished with both top four scoring offences and scoring defences, showing how well rounded they are.\n\nNew England scored just seven points more than Seattle as they finished second and third on offence, while the Seahawks had the best scoring defence in the league.\n\nThe Pats locked it down in the post-season though. Despite scoring the fewest points ever in three play-off games (54) the defence allowed just 26 points, the second-fewest ever, to fight into the Super Bowl.\n\nSeattle blew away the 49ers then won a shootout with the Rams, and with the better skill position players and quick-strike offence they should have the firepower to win another.\n\nThe Pats will be looking for a tense, tight defensive scuffle in a bid to win a record seventh Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe term 'game manager' has become an insult to modern quarterbacks but that's exactly what you need to win a Super Bowl - especially this Super Bowl with two defences who have conceded an average of just over 17 points per game this season.\n\nDrake Maye is bidding to become the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and has had a surgical sophomore season setting records for accuracy even Tom Brady could not match.\n\nSam Darnold's ultimate redemption story could take him from worst to first but even after a super showing to get Seattle here, there are still some doubters around.\n\nSo both will have to handle the pressure of the huge occasion and also of two opposing defences that will be hunting them down. How they deal with that will be key.\n\nMaye's antidote will be his running ability. Excluding kneeldowns he has gained 6.13 yards per carry this season and with 12 of his 16 play-off runs going for a touchdown or first down he's being used in those vital moments.\n\nSeattle need to find a way to bottle him up.\n\nDarnold's not a runner but has the league's top receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to throw to in times of stress and his arm talent is now undeniable. So is his temperament after nine game-winning drives in the past two seasons.\n\nNeither will have felt anything like this pressure though and with solid defences behind them there is no immediate need to play the hero. Whoever manages the game better will hoist the Lombardi.\n\nTeams that have won the turnover battle in the Super Bowl have a 40-7 record. Enough said?\n\nIn a post-season littered with close games turnovers proved crucial - both teams had vital takeaways to win their Championship games and they were first and second in turnover differential in the play-offs.\n\nDarnold struggled all season in this area, leading the league with 20 turnovers, and despite Seattle having zero in the play-offs that will be an area the Patriots hope to exploit.\n\nCoaches will be preaching ball security to everyone all week.\n\nSpeaking of coaches, they can make or break a game from the sideline. Just ask Pete Carroll from this very fixture 11 years ago with that infamous decision to throw on the one-yard line costing Seattle the Super Bowl against the Patriots.\n\nBoth head coaches have been incredible this season - Mike Macdonald is a defensive genius having now built a top defence at previous side Baltimore and in Seattle.\n\nHe's young and one worry is that with him still calling the defensive plays it all may be a bit much in his first Super Bowl.\n\nMike Vrabel can become the first man to win a Super Bowl as head coach and player with the same team, and he could have an ace up his sleeve with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.\n\nA huge success with Tom Brady, this will be a 10th Super Bowl as a coach for McDaniels. In the hardest game to keep your head could that experience be the difference?\n\nThe defensive front seven are the wrecking crews of the NFL, tasked with, among other things, making life as uncomfortable as possible for opposing quarterbacks.\n\nBoth sides excel here with terrific units and we've seen before how dominance here can decide the outcome of a Super Bowl.\n\nHarold Landry and K'Lavon Chaisson combined for 16 regular season sacks for New England, thanks to defensive tackles Christian Barmore and Milton Williams bringing constant interior pressure, collapsing pockets at will.\n\nThe Patriots made Williams the highest paid player in team history with a $104m deal in free agency last year, following a dominant Super Bowl display for the Eagles against Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs.\n\nIf he replicates that here then Darnold is in trouble.\n\nIt's Seattle, though, who could hold the advantage here as they are bringing a four-headed monster of Leonard Williams, Uchenna Nwosu, Byron Murphy and DeMarcus Lawrence who have combined for 30 sacks this season.\n\nLawrence, who left Dallas to win a Super Bowl, has had a sack and forced fumble in both play-off games so far and has been particularly impressive, but it's the danger right across the Seahawks defensive front that gives them the edge.\n\nAs the Patriots will make history by starting two rookies on their offensive line in Will Campbell and Jared Wilson - with left tackle Campbell, the man charged with protecting Maye's blindside, having some rookie struggles.\n\nMaye has been sacked 15 times in the play-offs, the record is 19, and if the two rookies fail to protect him again then it could get ugly - think Patrick Mahomes' two Super Bowl defeats by the Eagles and Buccaneers.\n\nSkill players scoring touchdowns make the headlines, but Super Bowls are won and lost in the trenches - and that battle on Maye's blindside could just decide the whole argument.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'",

    "fullText": "AI content for scams can be targeted at individuals and ‘produced by pretty much anybody’, researchers say\n\nDeepfake fraud has gone “industrial”, an analysis published by AI experts has said.\n\nTools to create tailored, even personalised, scams – leveraging, for example, deepfake videos of Swedish journalists or the president of Cyprus – are no longer niche, but inexpensive and easy to deploy at scale, said the analysis from the AI Incident Database.\n\nIt catalogued more than a dozen recent examples of “impersonation for profit”, including a deepfake video of Western Australia’s premier, Robert Cook, hawking an investment scheme, and deepfake doctors promoting skin creams.\n\nThese examples are part of a trend in which scammers are using widely available AI tools to perpetuate increasingly targeted heists. Last year, a finance officer at a Singaporean multinational paid out nearly $500,000 to scammers during what he believed was a video call with company leadership. UK consumers are estimated to have lost £9.4bn to fraud in the nine months to November 2025.\n\n“Capabilities have suddenly reached that level where fake content can be produced by pretty much anybody,” said Simon Mylius, an MIT researcher who works on a project linked to the AI Incident Database.\n\nHe calculates that “frauds, scams and targeted manipulation” have made up the largest proportion of incidents reported to the database in 11 of the past 12 months. He said: “It’s become very accessible to a point where there is really effectively no barrier to entry.”\n\n“The scale is changing,” said Fred Heiding, a Harvard researcher studying AI-powered scams. “It’s becoming so cheap, almost anyone can use it now. The models are getting really good – they’re becoming much faster than most experts think.”\n\nIn early January, Jason Rebholz, the chief executive of Evoke, an AI security company, posted a job offer on LinkedIn and was immediately contacted by a stranger in his network, who recommended a candidate.\n\nWithin days, he was exchanging emails with someone who, on paper, appeared to be a talented engineer.\n\n“I looked at the resume and I was like, this is actually a really good resume. And so I thought, even though there were some red flags, let me just have a conversation.”\n\nThen things became strange. The candidate’s emails went directly to spam. His resume had quirks. But Rebholz had dealt with unusual candidates before and decided to go ahead with the interview.\n\nThen, when Rebholz took the call, the candidate’s video took nearly a minute to appear.\n\n“The background was extremely fake,” he said. “It just looked super, super fake. And it was really struggling to deal with [the area] around the edges of the individual. Like part of his body was coming in and out … And then when I’m looking at his face, it’s just very soft around the edges.”\n\nRebholz went through with the conversation, not wanting to face the awkwardness of asking the candidate directly if they were, in fact, an elaborate scam. Afterwards, he sent a recording of it to a contact at a deepfake detection firm, who told him that the video image of the candidate was AI-generated. He rejected the candidate.\n\nRebholz still does not know what the scammer wanted – an engineering salary, or trade secrets. While there have been reports of North Korean hackers trying to get jobs at Amazon, Evoke is a startup, not a massive player.\n\n“It’s like, if we’re getting targeted with this, everyone’s getting targeted with it,” said Rebholz.\n\nHeiding said the worst was ahead. Currently deepfake voice cloning technology is excellent – making it easy for scammers to impersonate, for example, a grandchild in distress over the phone. Deepfake videos, on the other hand, still have room for improvement.\n\nThis could have extreme consequences: for hiring, for elections, and for broader society. Heiding added: “That’ll be the big pain point here, the complete lack of trust in digital institutions, and institutions and material in general.”",

    "fullText": "Verdict could influence more than 3,000 similar cases against ride-hailing company\n\nA federal jury in Phoenix ordered Uber on Thursday to pay $8.5m after finding the company liable in a lawsuit brought by a woman who said she was sexually assaulted by a driver. The verdict could influence thousands of similar cases against the ride-hailing company.\n\nThe case, brought by plaintiff Jaylynn Dean, was the first trial of more than 3,000 similar lawsuits against Uber that have been consolidated in US federal court. So-called bellwether trials are used to test legal theories and help gauge the value of claims for possible settlements. The jury found that the driver was an agent of Uber, holding the company responsible for his actions. They awarded Dean $8.5m in compensatory damages but declined to award punitive damages. Attorneys for Dean had sought more than $140m in damages.\n\nIn a statement, an Uber spokesperson noted that the jury rejected Dean’s other claims, that the company was negligent or that its safety systems were defective, adding that the company plans to appeal. “This verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety,” the spokesperson said.\n\nSarah London, an attorney for Dean, said the verdict “validates the thousands of survivors who have come forward at great personal risk to demand accountability against Uber for its focus on profit over passenger safety”. If the verdict is upheld on appeal, it will be used as precedent in other litigation against Uber, said personal injury attorney John Carpenter of Carpenter & Zuckerman, who is not involved in Uber litigation. Carpenter said while each sexual assault case is valued on its individual merits, the $8.5m verdict could be used as a benchmark for other such cases.\n\nDean, an Oklahoma resident, sued Uber in 2023, one month after her alleged assault in Arizona. She said Uber was aware of a wave of sexual assaults committed by its drivers, but had failed to take basic actions to improve the safety of its riders. Such assertions have long dogged the company, drawing headlines and congressional scrutiny.\n\nAlexandra Walsh, an attorney for Dean, said during the trial’s closing arguments that Uber had marketed itself as a safe option for women traveling at night, particularly if they had been drinking.\n\n“Women know it’s a dangerous world. We know about the risk of sexual assault,” Walsh said. “They made us believe that this was a place that was safe from that.“\n\nUber, which has faced numerous safety controversies, including allegations of lax driver vetting and a culture critics said prioritized growth over passenger protection, has argued that it should not be held liable for criminal conduct by drivers who use its platform, saying that its background checks and disclosures about assaults are sufficient.\n\nThe company maintains that its drivers are independent contractors rather than employees, and that regardless of their classification it cannot be responsible for actions that fall outside the scope of what could reasonably be considered their duties.\n\n“He had no criminal history. None,” Kim Bueno, an attorney for Uber, said of the driver during closing arguments, noting that he had 10,000 trips on the app and a nearly perfect rating from riders. “Was this foreseeable to Uber? And the answer to that has to be no.”\n\nDean’s lawsuit said she was intoxicated when she hired an Uber driver to take her from her boyfriend’s home to her hotel. The driver asked her harassing questions on the ride before stopping the car and raping her, Dean alleged in the lawsuit.\n\nUS district judge Charles Breyer, who normally sits on the bench in San Francisco, oversaw Dean’s case in Phoenix. Breyer is managing all of the similar federal cases against Uber, which have been centralized in his court in San Francisco. The company is also facing more than 500 cases in California state court. In the only one of those cases to go to trial so far, a jury in September sided with Uber. The jury found that while the company had been negligent with its safety measures, that negligence was not a substantial factor in causing the woman’s harm.\n\nRival Lyft is facing similar lawsuits in both state and federal court, although there is no coordinated federal litigation for those claims.",

    "fullText": "Former players turned pundits have a \"duty of responsibility\" to the new generation of footballers when commenting on their performances, Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk says.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports' Gary Neville, the defender warned opinions sometimes strayed into \"clickbait, saying things to provoke things, and without thinking about the repercussions for the mental side of players\".\n\n\"For me personally, I can deal with it, but I'm a bit worried for the next generation,\" Van Dijk told Neville.\n\nIt is not the first time Van Dijk has spoken out on the subject this season.\n\nIn November, the Dutchman said Wayne Rooney blaming a lack of leadership for Liverpool's poor form was \"lazy criticism\".\n\nHe raised the comments again days later when the pair appeared pitchside on Amazon Prime following the Reds' 1-0 win against Real Madrid in the Champions League.\n\nPundits' views also came under the spotlight last month when former Manchester United midfielders Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt made comments about current Red Devils' defender Lisandro Martinez.\n\nBefore the Manchester derby at Old Trafford, Butt claimed City striker Erling Haaland would treat Argentine Martinez like a \"little toddler\", while Scholes suggested the Norway forward would \"throw him in the net\" after scoring.\n\nMartinez responded by saying pundits \"can talk on the television\" but \"no-one says anything\" to your face.\n\n\"I feel like the ex-top players have a responsibility to the new generation,\" Van Dijk said.\n\n\"Criticism is absolutely normal and part of the game, and I think it should stay that way.\n\n\"But sometimes criticism also goes into being clickbait, saying things to provoke things, and without thinking about the repercussions for the mental side of players, and especially the younger generation, who are constantly on social media.\n\n\"You can say, 'yeah, you shouldn't be on social media' - that's what I've mentioned [to them] loads of times.\n\n\"There is always this thing of when you play a good game, younger players check all the positive praises, but when you have a worse game, and you're getting bullied all over social media, or you're getting bad criticism, it can really affect you.\n\n\"I've seen that in certain players in the past, and currently as well, because it's just not easy.\"\n\nMan Utd's complicated relationship with Class of 92\n\n'I don't care what they say' - Martinez on pundits\n\n'It was over the top' - Van Dijk and Rooney's awkward on-air exchange\n\nWith the use of social media ever-growing, the 34-year-old added: \"It's going to get worse and worse, because the platforms nowadays, with the clickbait and the headlines, everyone is on it constantly.\n\n\"I feel like especially the ex-pros, top players, who have been through everything as well, they have this responsibility of protecting a little bit of that side as well.\n\n\"That's something maybe to look at.\"\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Snoop Dogg might have taken most of the attention in the Cortina Curling Stadium early on Friday, but Team GB's duo delivered a big-ticket performance of their own to maintain their 100% record in the Winter Olympics mixed doubles.\n\nThe swaggering rap legend - in the high-end Italian mountain resort as a Team USA hype man and \"honorary coach\" - even felt the urge to claim a selfie with Jen Dodds and Bruce Mouat after their fourth win of the competition.\n\n\"He's just asked for a photo with us, so I'm feeling pretty good about myself,\" Mouat told BBC Sport, before Dodds disclosed that Mr Dogg \"said he'd heard about Bruce\".\n\nIf he and Dodds continue this form, he won't be the only one who has.\n\nIt was another day, another victory for last year's world silver medallists; this time the fancied Sweden - who beat them to bronze in 2022 - who were the victims.\n\nThe Scottish duo delivered a display that showed as much gallus as guts, their 7-4 win takes them top of the standings as the only unbeaten team and within touching distance of the semi-finals.\n\nThe curling cognoscenti reckon six wins in the nine round-robin games could be enough to earn a place in Monday's last four, and the GB duo are well on the way.\n\nThey can edge closer when they return to the ice for the fifth time to face South Korea, who have lost all three of their matches, at 13:35 GMT, live on the BBC.\n\nOlympic skater given Minions music permission\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\nMouat has been calling himself all the bad swears during three patchy opening games amid the Dolomite mountains in the north of Italy, but one of the sport's leading lights lifted it against the Swedes.\n\nAnd in Dodds, he has a partner who has been consistently superb so far. Only Sweden's Isabella Wranaa had been statistically better but she was no match here.\n\nWhen Dodds asked her questions, she struggled to find answers. Indeed, at one stage, she battered her brush off the side of the sheet after an errant throw as the sibling bonds between her and partner Rasmus began to fray.\n\n\"The difference was the two girls. Isabella wasn't making shots, but Jen was,\" said BBC Sport pundit Jackie Lockhart.\n\nAt that stage, the GB pair were four points up - a second consecutive night without much sleep after a quick turnaround from Thursday's win over Czech Republic proving no impediment - but the lead was narrowed to 4-3 at the break.\n\nAnother two in the fifth end cleaved open the advantage again before the teams traded points in the next two to leave Sweden needing four in the final end to win.\n\nThey got none, as the end was blanked. A stunning Mouat throw proved decisive, evincing a first-pump from the restrainted Scot and earning him an audience with Snoop moments later.\n\n\"Can you say you won pretty? It was just a lot better from me and happy we're making opponents play tough shots,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nUp in the Italian Alps, snowboarder Txema Mazet-Brown was the first Team GB athlete in action at the Livigno Snow Park.\n\nMaking his Olympic debut, the 19-year-old placed 21st in big air qualifying with a score of 151.75, with only the top 12 progressing to Saturday's final.\n\n\"I'm happy with the riding, it could have been a bit better with the cleanliness of one [run], but not bad overall,\" Mazet-Brown told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Standing up there, you realise that this is one of the biggest events in the world. I'm proud, for sure. You get a little tingling, some butterflies, but that's a good thing - it's really special.\"\n\nMazet-Brown will return to action on 16 February in slopestyle qualifying, an event he says he came to Italy \"more ready\" for.",

    "description": "Ireland face one of the most difficult periods of soul-searching under Andy Farrell after falling to a vastly superior France in Thursday's Six Nations opener.",
    "fullText": "With the home fans inside the Stade de France already buzzing from a spectacular pre-match light show and a typically spine-tingling rendition of La Marseillaise, it only took Les Bleus two minutes to show Ireland what they were up against.\n\nFor the Parisian crowd, it was instantly edge-of-the-seat stuff. Dynamite winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey collected the ball on the left wing. He chipped the ball over Sam Prendergast's head and set off after it.\n\nIt's a tried-and-tested move from the Bordeaux flyer that usually ends with him scoring a try. Only this time it didn't.\n\nWith Bielle-Biarrey having sent Ireland nervously scurrying back towards their line, Charles Ollivon knocked the ball on and let the men in green off the hook.\n\nBut even having survived that scare, Ireland could not stem the rising French tide.\n\nFor most of the next two hours, green jerseys were mercilessly pulled all over the place as France dished out another bruising lesson on the biggest stage, 11 months on from their rampant 42-27 win in Dublin.\n\nFrance scored five tries to win 36-14, but it could have been even uglier for Ireland had they not summoned what head coach Andy Farrell called a \"gallant\" second-half display.\n\nThat was barely scant consolation for Farrell. Ireland were beaten in the air, missed tackle after tackle, and were often chasing shadows on the ground against a razor-sharp team brimming with speed, invention and self-belief.\n\nIreland must 'stop rot' after Paris humbling\n\nRuthless France thrash Ireland in Six Nations opener\n\nRugby Union Weekly: France outclass Ireland in Paris\n\nIn contrast, Ireland's confidence looked shot to pieces and they were again found wanting against one of the sides against whom they like to measure themselves.\n\nLast year, France tore Ireland to shreds in the second half, scoring 34 unanswered points in a stunning response to losing Antoine Dupont to injury.\n\nIn Chicago in November, the All Blacks ran away from Ireland with three tries in 15 second-half minutes, before Farrell's side were brutally overpowered by scrum-masters South Africa.\n\nWith questions over Ireland's direction intensifying after that autumn campaign, Farrell is facing one of the most daunting challenges of his six-year reign.\n\nFor former Ireland full-back Rob Kearney, the current situation is the first time this Irish group has felt \"real pressure\" to turn things around.\n\n\"I was less concerned about the performances in November,\" Kearney said on the Ireland Rugby Social.\n\n\"Guys were not very battle-hardened. They were coming off that long tour, they hadn't played a huge amount of rugby. They went to Chicago, half the team hadn't played 100 minutes [in the season].\n\n\"We lost that game but it was in the balance for 60 minutes. Then you come against South Africa, who are playing a different game to any other team in the world at the moment, so I had given them a little bit of a pass.\"\n\nHe added: \"But in truth, if you go back to September and looked at our fixtures, you would have said 'OK, there is a very good chance we're going to lose to New Zealand, South Africa, France and then we go away to Twickenham and there's a good chance we lose there too'.\n\n\"So it's the first time that this team have come under real pressure and real scrutiny. It's going to be a different challenge for them.\"\n\nWhile Farrell was in no mood to make post-match excuses in Paris, Kearney feels the lingering effects of the Lions tour last summer for which Ireland supplied a record 18 players may explain the tortured attempts to hit top form.\n\nIndeed, several of the players that toured Australia - including first-choice props Tadhg Furlong and Andrew Porter and key backs Mack Hansen and Hugo Keenan - are currently sidelined.\n\n\"I definitely felt it after the two Lions tours I was on,\" said Kearney, who was part of the 2009 and 2013 series.\n\n\"They're long seasons, the bodies start to break down. You go for 12 months, you get four weeks off and then all of a sudden you're back into this again.\n\n\"If you look at our team at the moment, we have some world-class players, but none of them are playing to the level of a world-class player.\n\n\"Is there anyone really on that Irish team that are at the peak of their powers? I don't think so.\"\n\nWhile a lot of Ireland's players struggled in Paris, Kearney felt fly-half Sam Prendergast performed well after being picked from the start ahead of Jack Crowley.\n\n\"I thought Sam played pretty well. Defended well. He kicked pretty well, there were a couple of Garryowens that went long and there was definitely one down the left-hand touchline when he tried a little grubber and he'd have been better going long.\n\n\"But no, I would have had Sam down as having a pretty decent game.\"\n\nWith several players missing, Farrell is under pressure to breathe new life into his side 18 months out from the Rugby World Cup in Australia.\n\nThe road to redemption starts against Italy next week, but even if Farrell is tempted to shake things up, his extensive injury list and lack of a France-strength player pool to dip into makes wholesale changes for the Azzurri's visit to Dublin seem unlikely.\n\n\"Italy will smell blood, they'll see a bit of weakness there,\" added Kearney, who won Grand Slams with Ireland in 2009 and 2018.\n\n\"They'll see a team who are, not mentally fragile, but coming off the back of a big defeat, who will internally start to question what they are doing.\"",

    "fullText": "The 2026 World Cup is almost upon us.\n\nIndia are defending champions after their 2024 win and have home advantage as co-hosts alongside Sri Lanka.\n\nCan anyone stop them? And who will be the best batters and bowlers?\n\nHere are the Test Match Special team's predictions before it all gets under way on Saturday, 7 February.\n\nFormer England bowler Steven Finn: It is hard to look beyond India, but the romance of South Africa winning after how close they got to winning by reaching the 2024 final is something I would like to see.\n\nI do actually think England are dark horses to win the tournament given how well they played in Sri Lanka and the options they have.\n\nFormer England bowler Alex Hartley: No team has ever won a men's T20 World Cup on home soil, so I'm going India.\n\nFormer England bowler Tymal Mills: India will be tough to beat in their own conditions. Obviously all their players are well-accustomed to playing on those decks, so I'll go with India.\n\nEngland and Scotland bowler Kirstie Gordon: It is probably a popular answer but it is hard to look past India in their own conditions. They look incredibly strong and well balanced. I would love to see South Africa give them a scare.\n\nAs for Scotland, it is hard to say given their lack of preparation time, but they have some excellent players and will be keen to show they deserve to be there.\n\nI think they will beat Italy and Nepal but West Indies and England's firepower could be too big a hurdle.\n\nBBC cricket reporter Henry Moeran: India will be hard to beat at home, and having won the last two global white-ball events will be full of confidence.\n\nBut as we saw in the final of 2023, home pressure can sometimes be a hindrance and so many top players from around the world having Indian Premier League experience means knowledge of conditions perhaps will not be as significant.\n\nSouth Africa could be a threat having broken their hoodoo with the Test Championship win.\n\nTMS commentator Prakash Wakankar: While India will be among the favourites, the pressure will be immense.\n\nI would never write off Australia, and South Africa are really well placed with the variety in their bowling and depth in their batting.\n\nIf pressed, I would go for a repeat of the 2023 50-over final between India and Australia, but hopefully with a different result...\n\nTMS commentator Daniel Norcross: India. It is the obvious choice but that is because India come into this World Cup in formidable form and have home advantage.\n\nIn addition, if their match with Pakistan does not go ahead, they will not only pick up two points without playing a game but will also not have to leave India.\n\nTMS commentator Aatif Nawaz: Though both England and Pakistan are heading into the World Cup with strong form, getting the better of India will be a Herculean task.\n\nBBC cricket writer Matthew Henry: I was all set to try and be clever. Like before the 2023 50-over World Cup in India, Australia have lost their past two series.\n\nAt that World Cup, Australia were without Travis Head for the start. This time Josh Hazlewood was set to miss the opening weeks but now he has been ruled out entirely, they surely have little chance.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - fixtures\n\nFinn: England's Phil Salt. He has been outstanding in both the IPL and T20 internationals recently. Opening is the best place to bat in India and expect the top run-scorer to bat in the top two.\n\nHartley: Australia's Ashes hero Travis Head. He's become more consistent over the last 18 months and also plays with complete freedom. He does not care about getting out which will help him push the boundaries.\n\nMills: I'll go with South Africa captain Aiden Markram. He's in good form at the moment and he does well in India too.\n\nGordon: India's Abhishek Sharma. He's got a ridiculous strike-rate and has provided so much firepower at the top of the order for India recently. First World Cup. Home conditions. Are the stars aligned?\n\nMoeran: It might be his debut tournament, but Abhishek is a brilliant player and I think he will do some serious damage to bowling attacks.\n\nNorcross: Abhishek. The Indian opener is in frighteningly good form and will have plenty of opportunity to go big on friendly, run-drenched pitches at home in India.\n\nNawaz: Abhishek is the smart bet. He will open for India and doubtless hit sixes for fun. He stands head (sorry Travis!) and shoulders above everyone else in T20 cricket right now.\n\nWakankar: Head is my pick. He is just so dominant in this format. His hand-eye co-ordination is of a different level. He has been top of the pops for Sunrisers Hyderabad consistently in the IPL and knows the conditions really well.\n\nHenry: India captain Suryakumar Yadav scored 242 runs at 80.66 during the recent series win over New Zealand. One thing that could stop him may be the form of others in India's top order denying him enough time at the crease.\n\nHartley: Sherfane Rutherford. He had a great SA20 campaign with 334 runs and a strike-rate of 165. Nothing beats watching a West Indian when they get going.\n\nMills: South Africa's Dewald Brevis, who I played with recently at the SA20.\n\nObviously people know about him, but he probably hasn't really exploded in terms of international cricket just yet. He played some special innings for us.\n\nFinn: So much has been talked about Brevis from a young age and it finally feels like he has come of age. A fantastic SA20 - 370 runs and a strike-rate of 156.11 - should give him confidence.\n\nGordon: I'm going to go for New Zealand's Finn Allen. He's off the back of a great Big Bash campaign for Perth Scorchers, where he was the leading run-scorer with 466 in 11 innings. It seems like his batting has really matured in the last couple of years.\n\nNorcross: Allen is hit and miss, but if he gets going those small grounds in India won't be able to contain his monstrously destructive hitting.\n\nMoeran: Tom Banton of England looked in excellent touch with an unbeaten 54* in the second T20 in Sri Lanka and feels a very different player to his first iteration in the England side back in 2019 and 2020.\n\nHenry: Brevis is a good shout. England have seen what Pathum Nissanka, now sixth in the world T20 rankings, can do in recent weeks.\n\nNawaz: Let's go for someone a little less obvious. Wayne Madsen. Obviously Italy are unlikely to go past the group stage but the 42 year old's storied career feels like it has one more fairytale chapter in it...\n\nFinn: Kuldeep Yadav. He could clean up in the group stage, looking at India's opponents, and wrist spin is always a potent wicket threat as the tournament wears on.\n\nMills: It is hard to look past Jasprit Bumrah, an outstanding bowler across all formats but particularly within T20 and he'll obviously play a huge part in India's claim to winning the title.\n\nGordon: Australia's Nathan Ellis. A highly skilled T20 bowler who can bowl in all phases but is especially strong at the death.\n\nHe often goes under the radar in a top-quality attack but regularly bowls some of the toughest overs.\n\nMoeran: How can we look past Bumrah? He won India the tournament two years ago in the final against South Africa and will again be key. Few bowlers can do what he does, and his overs at the death will be integral.\n\nHartley: I do not like copying my friends but, as they have said, how do you look past Bumrah? I want to pick a spinner and I want that man to be Varun Chakaravarthy but I'm not sure he will play all the games.\n\nNawaz: I'm certain it will be a spinner. There are so many to chose from, but I'll go with Adam Zampa. He was one of Australia's few positives in their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Pakistan.\n\nWakankar: I expect Hardik Pandya to be that person, fitness being the only challenge. He is the key cog in the India team for sure as their main seam-bowling all-rounder.\n\nNorcross: Abrar Ahmed. A left-field pick maybe but hear me out.\n\nPakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka where the pitches have shown strong signs of favouring spin.\n\nThe bespectacled leg-spinner recently had the Australians in a pickle and has a great chance to bag a hatful of wickets in the opening group stage against weaker teams.\n\nHenry: The leading wicket-takers in the past three editions of the IPL have all been seamers. Always improving, always moving the new ball, I'll go with South Africa's Marco Jansen.\n\nHartley: Pakistan's Usman Tariq - not for the amount of wickets he will or won't get but the hype around his controversial bowling action.\n\nFinn: Tariq was relatively unknown until recently. Mystery spinners who burst on to the scene usually have a good first tournament, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him do well.\n\nGordon: Azmatullah Omarzai. I could have picked one of a few bowlers from Afghanistan, who I think could cause an upset in the group of death which also includes South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nA spinner might have been the common choice but Omarzai has been central to them becoming a more balanced team.\n\nMills: Maybe someone like Noor Ahmad from Afghanistan, the left-arm wrist spinner. Obviously all eyes will be on Rashid Khan but Noor is an excellent bowler in his own right as well.\n\nMoeran: South Africa quick Anrich Nortje is in fine form, taking a stack of wickets in the SA20 for Sunrisers Eastern Cape as they won the tournament. He knows the conditions, knows his game and can bowl economical and rapid spells.\n\nWakankar: I have a nagging suspicion it could be someone like Chakravarthy, given the Indian conditions.\n\nHe is deceptive and has a way of picking up wickets. His mystery element still seems to get batters in the key middle part of the innings.\n\nNawaz: Saim Ayub from Pakistan. He has established himself as a genuine all-rounder over the past 12 months and been very effective in the powerplay.\n\nI know it is a big call to go with an opening batter as bowler to watch - but that's how good he's been.\n\nNorcross: Keshav Maharaj. The South African slow left-armer is in the form of his life.\n\nA complete master of his craft, he will be desperate to go one better after South Africa's loss in the final last time around.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "description": "James Milner will equal the Premier League appearance record if he features for Brighton on Sunday, 24 years after making his debut as a 16-year-old.",
    "fullText": "\"People joke that I only did it because he didn't do his homework,\" says former Premier League referee Jon Moss about the time he sent off James Milner.\n\nTwenty-four years after making his debut, Milner, 40, will equal the record for most Premier League appearances if he features for Brighton against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nA stellar career spanning more than two decades, six top-flight clubs, 652 Premier League appearances, 61 England caps, three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and one Champions League triumph has also delivered some unexpected moments.\n\nLike the time Milner - known as 'Millie', external by those close to him - was sent off by Moss, his former teacher at Westbrook Lane Primary School in Horsforth, Leeds, while playing for Liverpool against Crystal Palace in 2019.\n\n\"He said I couldn't wait to get my card out,\" laughs Moss about dismissing his former pupil after switching careers.\n\n\"People say I'm the only teacher to send off one of his pupils in a Premier League game. We can both laugh about it now.\"\n\nMilner is set to go level with Gareth Barry, who played 653 times, at the top of the all-time Premier League appearance list some 8,491 days after making his debut for hometown club Leeds United soon after leaving school in 2002.\n\n\"I think that will be a special thing for him but he is focused on top of that on the ambitions from the club as well. He wants to be always successful like he was his whole life,\" said Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler.\n\n\"He is a driver of this winning mentality and I think it's very important to have these kind of players in the squad.\n\n\"They know how to win, they know what it needs to win, how you need to prepare a game, how you react in bad phases like on bad runs we have at the moment.\"\n\nAlan Shearer, who played with Milner at Newcastle, describes him as a model professional and a \"manager's dream\".\n\n\"You would do well if you had him in your squad because you knew exactly what you were going to get,\" adds former England captain Shearer.\n\nThis is the story about a young lad from Leeds who evolved to set standards for hard work, professionalism and longevity - and earn respect from fans all over the world.\n\nMilner was just 16 and earning £70 a week as a YTS player when he broke into the first team at Leeds, six months after taking his GCSE exams.\n\nOn 10 November 2002, his dad Peter was in the away end at Upton Park when boss Terry Venables sent the youngster on for Jason Wilcox, now director of football at Manchester United, in the final minutes of a 4-3 win against West Ham.\n\nIt was a dream come true for Milner, who had grown up supporting the club and wore shirts with the names of Tony Yeboah and Tony Dorigo on the back.\n\nSix weeks after the West Ham game, Milner - aged 16 years and 356 days - became the youngest Premier League goalscorer at that time when he scored in a 2-1 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.\n\nIt was not enough to get the former Leeds season ticket-holder out of his post-match duties, however.\n\nBack then YTS players were expected to clean the dressing room after first-team games.\n\n\"Even when I was playing and scoring goals, after games I was helping the kit man pick dirty shirts off the dressing room floor,\" Milner told the High Performance podcast, external in 2023.\n\n\"I carried on cleaning the under-18 captain's boots. I was playing in the first team but he was still older than me.\"\n\nIt was not long, however, before Milner was sent on loan to the third tier of English football to continue his football education.\n\nSome 17-year-olds might have sulked at the prospect of swapping the glamour of the Premier League for games against Grimsby and Peterborough.\n\nMilner saw it as a chance to show what he was all about.\n\nDuring four weeks in Wiltshire, Milner played six games and scored two goals.\n\nSam Parkin, who was at Swindon at the same time as Milner, remembers a committed and hard-working teenager eager to learn.\n\n\"James was determined, driven and focused compared to some of the other young lads we had from Premier League clubs,\" recalls Parkin.\n\n\"He made a goal for me against Brighton at the Withdean Stadium and I remember us both scoring in a win against Peterborough.\"\n\nMilner describes his time in the lower leagues as a \"bit of an eye-opener\", with Swindon's players bringing their own pasta to eat on the team bus.\n\nYet he impressed with his attitude and performances, says Parkin.\n\n\"Before James went back to Leeds I told him: 'I never want to see you back here because you've got too much quality for this level',\" he adds.\n\nMilner returned to Elland Road where he became a first-team regular alongside the likes of Mark Viduka and Alan Smith.\n\nHe 'celebrated' his 18th birthday by playing in a 4-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal before relegation at the end of the 2003-04 season resulted in Leeds selling players to raise money.\n\nEngland forward Smith moved to Manchester United in a deal worth £7m, goalkeeper Paul Robinson went to Tottenham for £1.5m, while Milner signed for Newcastle in a deal worth £5m.\n\nNewcastle had just finished fifth in the Premier League, Sir Bobby Robson was manager and Shearer wore the captain's armband.\n\nIt was at Newcastle, however, that Milner would go on to experience one of the lowest moments of his career.\n\nShearer remembers Milner having a desire to learn and improve.\n\n\"He had a great mentality to get better, to be patient, but also to be frustrated and angry - you get that at times during your career.\"\n\nRobson lost his job four games into the 2004-05 season and was replaced by Graeme Souness, the former Liverpool and Scotland midfielder.\n\nA year after signing for Newcastle, Milner was sent out on loan to Premier League rivals Aston Villa.\n\nSouness defended his decision at the time saying \"you won't win the league with James Milners\". The remark, for which Souness has since apologised,, external stung the young winger, who would go on and win three Premier League titles.\n\nYet there was more turbulence ahead.\n\nMilner had impressed on loan at Villa so much that in September 2006 they offered around £4m to sign him permanently.\n\nNewcastle accepted and Milner travelled to the West Midlands only to learn upon arrival at Villa Park that the Magpies had pulled out of the deal at the 11th hour at the end of the transfer window.\n\nMilner was bitterly frustrated.\n\nIt would be another two years before he finally sealed a permanent switch to Villa at the age of 22 after 94 top-flight appearances for Newcastle.\n\nFor two seasons he played under Martin O'Neill before another move in 2010.\n\nChelsea had just won a Premier League and FA Cup double under Carlo Ancelotti and wanted to add Milner to their squad.\n\nManchester City were also keen. The trouble was, they had not won anything significant since 1976.\n\nIn the end he opted for the challenge of reviving City's fortunes.\n\nHe left five years later having helped them win two Premier League titles, one FA Cup, one League Cup and one Community Shield.\n\nMilner proved a versatile servant for both Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini, playing in a variety of positions including a stint as a lone striker - and he was popular in the dressing room.\n\n\"We won the Premier League together in 2012 but there were times that season when things were not going well,\" recalls former City defender Micah Richards.\n\n\"He was one of the people who kept everyone going.\"\n\nRichards developed a close bond with Milner but remembers getting the blame for the parody 'Boring James Milner' social media account, which mocked the player, often focusing on ironing, tea and trivial match details.\n\n\"Everyone thought I was behind it,\" says Richards.\n\n\"Whenever a new post went up Milner would say, 'Come on, mate, you've had your fun'. I'd be going, 'I swear, Millie, it's not me!'\n\n\"I ended up messaging the guy behind it, saying, 'Who is this because Milner thinks it's me?'\n\n\"He would not disclose his name but he sent me a picture of himself and it was just some random bloke. I just told him, 'Keep it up - I love it!'\"\n\nMilner played along with the 'boring' tag and during lockdown posted a video of himself cutting his lawn with scissors.\n\nAfter 147 top-flight appearances for City, he was ready for his next challenge.\n\nNext stop...Liverpool, where he won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Uefa Super Cup, Fifa Club World Cup and the Community Shield.\n\nIt was not all trophies and smiles, however, at Anfield.\n\nThere was that red card from his former teacher - and then the time he angered Klopp.\n\n\"One time at half-time he [Klopp] was sharing his thoughts and I was sharing mine,\" Milner adds on the High Performance podcast.\n\n\"I remember him smashing his hands down on the table and saying, 'Will you shut up'. But Jurgen was great, I had a great relationship with him.\"\n\nAfter Liverpool came an offer from Brighton in 2023 to prolong his top-flight career, where he continues to compete in what is his 24th Premier League season.\n\nMilner, who is eight years older than Seagulls boss Hurzeler, became the Premier League's second-oldest goalscorer behind Teddy Sheringham when he scored from the penalty spot against his former club Manchester City earlier this season.\n\nHe celebrated by recreating Diogo Jota's trademark video game controller celebration in tribute to his former Liverpool team-mate, who died in a car crash last July.\n\nMilner is wearing the No 20 shirt for Brighton, the same number Jota wore at Liverpool.\n\n\"I've not scored [in the Premier League] for six years and I was wearing his number. Obviously, I've got help from the great man,\" said an emotional Milner after the match.\n\nWhere does the player who represented England at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups rank on the list of all-time Premier League greats?\n\n\"Milner's name never really is mentioned as one of the greats, but he is, without a doubt,\" says Richards.\n\nFormer Leeds and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, who played the night Milner made his debut at West Ham in 2002, said his former team-mate had dedicated his life to remain at the top level.\n\n\"It's everything you do, it's how you walk around at home, it's what shoes you wear, it's how you sleep, it's what pillows you sleep on, it's what you eat, it's what you put in your body,\" says Robinson.\n\n\"And for him to have evolved the way that the game's evolved as well, it's huge credit to himself as a person, not just a footballer, but as a person.\"\n\nWill Milner carry on playing when his contract expires in the summer? Having turned 40 in January, he treats every game as though it could be his last.\n\nHe still remembers a conversation with veteran Leeds goalkeeper Nigel Martyn soon after breaking into the first team 24 years ago.\n\n\"He told me, 'Enjoy it while you can because it goes so fast'. I said, 'Leave it out, Nige, I'm 16!'\n\n\"And here we are in the blink of an eye - and I'm where he was.\"\n\nMilner sent off by former PE teacher\n\nLatest Brighton news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Brighton - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "While copyright and licensing currently form the core legal \nstructures that support Free Software, a September 2025 ruling from the \nSpanish Supreme Court provides a legal precedent that underlines the \nimportance of transparency in source codes and algorithms, and support \nfor the Freedom to Study!\n\nIn 2009, the Spanish central government passed a law to\naward a so-called “social bonus” to an estimated 5 million\nhouseholds, in order to subsidise their electricity costs. A 2016 court\nruling later compelled the government to introduce stricter rules\nregulating who could receive this social bonus. All existing\nbeneficiaries were required to re-register by the end of 2018, whereupon\ntheir eligibility for the social bonus would be re-evaluated by a\nsoftware known as BOSCO, administered by the Spanish Ministry for Green\nEnergy Transition (the “Ministry”).\n\nFollowing this re-evaluation, close to 1.5\nmillion beneficiaries were approved for the social bonus. This was\nalmost a million fewer than the 2.4 million under the previous scheme,\nand significantly less than the estimated 4.5 million who fulfilled the\ncriteria to receive the social bonus in the first place. Several\napplicants who had been rejected contacted Civio, a non-profit based in Madrid that\nworks to investigate\nshortcomings in the public sector and advocate for positive changes\nto support transparency and social support, raising suspicions that the\nBOSCO software had failed to properly review their claims.\n\nAs highlighted by AlgorithmWatch,\none of the complaints to Civio involved a retired widower who applied\nfor the social bonus under means testing. Under the regulations, she\nwould still be eligible for the bonus due to her status as a retiree and\na widower, even if her income exceeded the maximum to be eligible under\nmeans testing. BOSCO nevertheless discarded her application\nautomatically.\n\nCivio therefore contacted the Ministry to ask for BOSCO’s source\ncode, in order to confirm the veracity of the testimonials that they had\nreceived, as well as to check for other malfunctions. In response, the\nCouncil\nof Transparency and Good Governance (the “Council”), Spain’s freedom\nof information authority, denied Civio’s request, on the grounds of\nprotection of “intellectual property rights”, and protection of personal\ndata. This in turn prompted Civio to file\nan administrative appeal, which kicked off the lengthy judicial\nprocess that concluded in September 2025 in the Supreme Court of Spain\n(the “Court”).\n\nThe Supreme\nCourt ruling displayed a general support of transparency and the\nFreedom to Study, by clearly stating that Civio’s initial request for\naccess to BOSCO’s source code should be granted. In doing so, the Court\nhas now established a concrete legal precedent in Spain that the Freedom\nto Study is constitutionally necessary in the context of publicly\nadministered software programmes a algorithms, and in accordance with\nprinciples inherent to a democratic state .\n\nExplaining its position, the Court stated that:\n\n“… the right to access to public information transcends its\nstatus as an objective principle governing the actions of public\nadministrations, to constitute a constitutional right that can be\nexercised, as a subjective right, against administrations, derived from\nthe demands of democracy and transparency, and inseparably linked to the\ndemocratic rule of law set out in Article 1 of our\nConstitution.”\n\nIn simpler terms, the Court’s analysis on the importance of public\ntransparency relating to software programmes and algorithms can be\nbroken down into the following key findings:\n\nIn reviewing Civio’s request for access to BOSCO’s source code, the\nCourt was quick to emphasise that the validity of public administrations\nto make use of automated decision-making systems was not in question.\nIndeed, it recognised that such automated processes were often essential\nfor efficiency and adequate provision of public services.\n\nRather, the Court stressed the need for the principle of transparency\nto continue to be observed even in the use of such automatic systems, as\nenshrined in Article 105.b of the Spanish\nConstitution. It is therefore a legal requirement in Spain for\npublic administrations to allow citizens to access fundamental features\nof the algorithms used in decision-making, or their source code.\n\nThe Court considered such transparency to be associated with an\nimportant broader concept that it called “digital or electronic\ndemocracy”:\n\n“Digital democracy is not only a technological extension of\nrepresentative democracy, but also the fruit of a real structural\ntransformation in the democratic functioning of public authorities,\ncharacterised by the validity of the principles of transparency,\nparticipation, and accountability in a digital environment, where access\nto public information and algorithmic transparency play an essential\nrole in guaranteeing it.”\n\nPublic authorities are therefore obliged to allow citizens to\nunderstand how algorithms used in decision-making that affect citizens\nwork. The Spanish Supreme Court considers that doing so would be inline\nwith the principles of digital democracy, in order to allow citizens to\nknow, control, and participate in public management.\n\nIn Spain, Article 14(1)(j) of the Spanish Law on\nTransparency, Access to Public Information and Good Governance (the\n“LTAIBG”) allows access of information to be limited if such access is\ndetrimental to what they referred to as “intellectual property rights”.\nIndeed, throughout the litigation of this case, the Ministry relied on\nthis provision to argue on the vague and unspecific claim that BOSCO’s\nsource code was protected generally by “intellectual property rights”,\nwhich gave the Ministry the option to refuse to share BOSCO’s source\ncode with Civio.\n\nSimilarly, Article 14(1)(a) of the LTAIBG restricted access of public\ninformation on national or public security grounds, and was also relied\non by the Ministry in its arguments to refuse access to BOSCO’s source\ncode.\n\nThe Court found that, while the right to access of public information\nis neither unlimited nor absolute, the restrictions stated in the LTAIBG\nmust be applied in a manner that is justified and proportionate. This in\nturn has to be decided by a weighing of the interests at stake, namely\nthe importance of the access to public information on the one hand, and\nthe importance of protecting the rights of the copyright holders of\nBOSCO, or of any national security concerns, on the other. Indeed, it\nconsidered that while copyright and security concerns are important\nconsiderations, they cannot be invoked as automatic shields for\nsecrecy.\n\nWhen weighing these interests against each other, the Court gave\nparticular importance to Civio’s request for BOSCO’s source code. It\nrecognized that the public relevance of Civio’s investigation into\nwhether BOSCO was functioning correctly was of significant magnitude: it\nserved to ensure the protection of consumers who are in a more fragile\nsocial and economic situation, specifically in this case to protect them\nagainst energy poverty.\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the mere risk of possible harm to\nthe “intellectual property rights” of the public administration was not\nsufficiently important enough to be considered valid grounds for\nrefusing Civio’s right of access, when weighed against the significance\nof Civio’s investigation.\n\nSimilarly, when considering possible risks to public security, the\nCourt found that a request for source code and algorithmic transparency\ndoes not contain or include personal data of the citizens applying for\nthe social bonus. This was sufficient for the Court to consider that the\npublic interest for Civio to access BOSCO’s source code outweighed any\npublic security concerns.\n\nInterestingly, the Court further noted that even if access to BOSCO’s\nsource code could potentially increase certain security risks,\ntransparency itself can contribute towards counterbalancing this risk,\nsince it would:\n\nthat the right of access to public information takes on special\nrelevance in light of how digital technologies are exercised in the use\nof public powers and the provision of public services. Such use of\ncomputerized and automated decision-making systems in public\nadministration, especially when their purpose is the recognition of\nsocial rights, must necessarily entail transparency of the computer\nprocesses followed in such actions.\n\nThis kind of transparency, which the Court recognized to include the\npossibility of access to source code, has the effect of providing\ncitizens with the necessary information for their understanding and\nknowledge of their operation, in order to make it possible to check the\nconformity of such systems against the applicable regulatory\nprovisions.\n\nIndeed, the Court recognized that such fundamental principles of\ntransparency and access to public information in the public use of\ndigital technology are not just unique to Spanish jurisdiction, but are\nalso the logical extension of Article 42 of the Charter\nof Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the “CFR”):\n\n“Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing\nor having its registered office in a Member State, has a right of access\nto documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the\nUnion, whatever their medium.”\n\nThe Spanish Supreme Court’s conclusions in the BOSCO case clearly\nlays out the importance of transparency of source code and algorithms in\npublic administrations, and how they are important to the healthy\nfunctioning of societies that depend on digital technology. It is\ngratifying to see a European court clearly lay out how important it is\nto have public access to knowledge on how software and algorithms work,\nespecially when they have significant impact on the lives of individuals\nat large.\n\nNevertheless, while we appreciate the recognition of the importance\nof transparency in publicly administered source code by the Spanish\nSupreme Court here, this case only establishes this limited standard in\nSpain. While the aforementioned Article 42 of the CFR can be\ninterpreted to include algorithmic transparency and access to source\ncode used by public administrations, the interpretation taken by the\nSpanish Supreme Court is still not a unified stance seen throughout the\nEU.\n\nStill, some positive steps can be seen in other European\njurisdictions. For example, in France, the Digital Republic Law (\"Loi\npour une République numérique”) of 2016 codifies source code as part\nof government documentation that must be released in certain\ncircumstances. Of course, this does not necessarily mean that all\npublicly administered source code is immediately available in practice\nin France, as there have been cases in the past of the French\ncourts blocking access even after the Digital Republic Law came into\nforce.\n\nThere also remain other EU jurisdictions that are resistant to the\npublic access of state administered code. For example, in the\nNetherlands, the Debat\nDirect app, which allows the public to view livestreams of the\ndebates in the Dutch House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer), is only\navailable in the Apple, Google, and Microsoft app stores and is not\navailable under a Free Software licence. When FSFE Dutch volunteer Jos\nvan den Oever was unable to run the app on his devices and made a\nrequest for the Debat Direct source code from the Dutch parliament,\nthe resulting legal proceedings unfortunately resulted in a ruling that\nthe code should remain unavailable to the public.\n\nIn addition to the Freedom to Study, an informed and empowered\ncitizenry also needs other\nfreedoms that come with Free Software, in order to enjoy true\nsovereignty in our current society that is defined by its reliance on\ndigital technology.

    "description": "Anna's Archive has lost yet another domain name as legal pressure on the shadow library continues to mount.",
    "fullText": "Anna’s Archive has faced a barrage of domain takedowns in recent weeks, after Spotify and several major record labels filed a high-profile lawsuit.\n\nThe music industry giants filed the case after the shadow library planned to release hundreds of terabytes of scraped Spotify data, including full tracks.\n\nWhile Anna’s Archive has since taken its initial Spotify metadata release offline, the legal pressure hasn’t been lifted. On the contrary, the preliminary injunction issued by the New York court, targeting domain registries, registrars, and other intermediaries, has proven to be quite effective.\n\nThe .org domain was the first to fall, followed by the .se and .in variants. However, not all intermediaries were eager to comply with the U.S. injunction. As we reported last week, AFNIC, the French registry responsible for the .pm domain, made clear that U.S. court orders carry no direct legal weight in France.\n\nEnforcing the injunction would require the music companies to petition a French court; as far as we know, that hasn’t happened yet. Instead, the jurisdictional barrier appears to have been sidestepped entirely through a different route.\n\nEarlier this week, Anna’s Archive’s .pm domain became unreachable. WHOIS records confirm that the domain now has a “blocked” status, with a hold flag preventing it from resolving.\n\nAFNIC, the French registry responsible for the .pm extension, previously told TorrentFreak that U.S. court orders carry no direct legal weight in France. This makes it unlikely that the registry itself took action.\n\nInstead, the suspension may have been issued on the registrar level by the Dutch company Hosting Concepts B.V., also known as Openprovider. Thus far, neither Openprovider nor AFNIC has responded to our requests for comment.\n\nIt is clear that there is no shortage of U.S. court orders targeting Anna’s Archive. In addition to the preliminary injunction in the Spotify case, library catalog company OCLC won a default judgment and permanent injunction against the shadow library last month in the WorldCat scraping lawsuit. That order also includes provisions that could be used to target intermediaries.\n\nAs highlighted earlier, however, not all domain registries and registrars fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Because of this, rightsholders and anti-piracy groups in other countries have added their own pressure.\n\nIn the Netherlands, anti-piracy group BREIN repeatedly urged the local domain registrar Openprovider to take down the .se and .pm domains in January. Openprovider informed BREIN that it had forwarded the request for closure to its customer.\n\nBREIN doesn’t know for certain whether its pressure led directly to the .pm domain going offline, nor is it certain that Openprovider is the party that pulled the plug. However, the result is the same.\n\n“In any case, the result counts. It’s good that the sites are offline. These shadow libraries are very harmful to authors,” BREIN director Bastiaan van Ramshorst informed TorrentFreak.\n\nRegardless of who took action, the .pm domain is now out of rotation. That left Anna’s Archive down to a single working domain earlier this week, but that didn’t last very long.\n\nAccording to domain records, Anna’s Archive registered annas-archive.gl earlier this week. This new domain uses Njalla’s nameservers and is registered through Immaterialism Limited, a familiar setup from the site’s working .LI domain.\n\nThe choice of a Greenland-based domain is notable. With ongoing tensions between Greenland and the United States, the .gl registry may not be eager to subject itself to U.S. court jurisdiction. Whether that assumption holds remains to be seen.\n\nPreviously, The Pirate Bay also moved to a .GL domain briefly. However, the Greenlandic telecoms company that manages the registry decided to suspend it soon after, over alleged illegal use.\n\nFor now, Anna’s Archive continues its game of domain whack-a-mole, staying one step ahead of the takedowns for the moment. At the same time, it is expected that rightsholders will do everything in their power to maintain pressure.",

    "title": "AWS intruder achieved admin access in under 10 minutes thanks to AI assist",
    "description": "UPDATED: LLMs automated most phases of the attack",
    "fullText": "UPDATED A digital intruder broke into an AWS cloud environment and in just under 10 minutes went from initial access to administrative privileges, thanks to an AI speed assist.\n\nThe Sysdig Threat Research Team said they observed the break-in on November 28, and noted it stood out not only for its speed, but also for the \"multiple indicators\" suggesting the criminals used large language models to automate most phases of the attack, from reconnaissance and privilege escalation to lateral movement, malicious code writing, and LLMjacking - using a compromised cloud account to access cloud-hosted LLMs.\n\n\"The threat actor achieved administrative privileges in under 10 minutes, compromised 19 distinct AWS principals, and abused both Bedrock models and GPU compute resources,\" Sysdig's threat research director Michael Clark and researcher Alessandro Brucato said in a blog post about the cloud intrusion. \"The LLM-generated code with Serbian comments, hallucinated AWS account IDs, and non-existent GitHub repository references all point to AI-assisted offensive operations.\"\n\nThe attackers initially gained access by stealing valid test credentials from public Amazon S3 buckets. The credentials belonged to an identity and access management (IAM) user with multiple read and write permissions on AWS Lambda and restricted permissions on AWS Bedrock. Plus, the S3 bucket also contained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data for AI models, which would come in handy later during the attack.\n\nTo prevent this type of credential theft, don't leave access keys in public buckets. Sysdig recommends using temporary credentials for IAM roles, and for organizations that insist on granting long-term credentials to IAM users, make sure you rotate them periodically.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying usernames such as \"sysadmin\" and \"netadmin\" typically associated with admin-level privileges, the attacker ultimately achieved privilege escalation through Lambda function code injection, abusing the compromised user's UpdateFunctionCode and UpdateFunctionConfiguration permissions:\n\nThey replaced the code of an existing Lambda function named EC2-init three times, iterating on their target user. The first attempt targeted adminGH, which, despite its name, lacked admin privileges. Subsequent attempts eventually succeeded in compromising the admin user frick.\n\nThe security sleuths note that the comments in the code are written in Serbian - likely indicating the intruder's origin - the code itself listed all IAM users and their access keys, created access keys for frick, and listed S3 buckets along with their content.\n\nPlus, the attacker's code contained \"comprehensive\" exception handling, according to the security sleuths, including logic to limit S3 bucket listings and an increase to the Lambda execution timeout from three seconds to 30 seconds.\n\nThese factors, combined with the short time from credential theft to Lambda execution, \"strongly suggest\" the code was written by an LLM, according to the threat hunters.\n\nNext, the miscreant set about collecting account IDs and attempting to assume OrganizationAccountAccessRole in all AWS environments. Interestingly, they included account IDs that did not belong to the victim organization: two with ascending and descending digits (123456789012 and 210987654321), and one ID that appeared to belong to a legitimate external account.\n\n\"This behavior is consistent with patterns often attributed to AI hallucinations, providing further potential evidence of LLM-assisted activity,\" Clark and Brucato wrote.\n\nIn total, the attacker gained access to 19 AWS identities, including six different IAM roles across 14 sessions, plus five other IAM users. And then, with the new admin user account they had created, the crims snarfed up a ton of sensitive data: secrets from Secrets Manager, SSM parameters from EC2 Systems Manager, CloudWatch logs, Lambda function source code, internal data from S3 buckets, and CloudTrail events.\n\nThey then turned to the LLMjacking part of the attack to gain access to the victim's cloud-hosted LLMs. For this, they abused the user's Amazon Bedrock access to invoke multiple models including Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, Amazon Nova Premier, Amazon Titan Image Generator, and Cohere Embed.\n\nSysdig notes that \"invoking Bedrock models that no one in the account uses is a red flag,\" and enterprises can create Service Control Policies (SCPs) to allow only certain models to be invoked.\n\nAfter Bedrock, the intruder focused on EC2, querying machine images suitable for deep learning applications. They also began using the victim's S3 bucket for storage, and one of the scripts stored therein looks like it was designed for ML training - but it uses a GitHub repository that doesn't exist, suggesting an LLM hallucinated the repo in generating the code.\n\nWhile the researchers say they can't determine the attacker's goal - possibly model training or reselling compute access - they note that the script launches a publicly accessible JupyterLab server on port 8888, providing a backdoor to the instance that doesn't require AWS credentials.\n\nHowever, they terminated the instance after five minutes for unknown reasons.\n\nThis is the latest in examples of attackers increasingly relying on AI to help them at almost every stage in the attack chain, and some security chiefs have warned that it's just a matter of time before criminals can fully automate attacks at scale.\n\nThere are things organizations can do to defend against similar intrusions and most involve hardening identity security and access management. First off: apply principles of least privilege to all IAM users and roles.\n\nSysdig also recommends restricting UpdateFunctionConfiguration and PassRole permission in Lambda, limiting UpdateFunctionCode permissions to specific functions and assigning them only to identities that need code deployment capabilities to do their jobs.\n\nAlso, make sure S3 buckets containing sensitive data, including RAG data and AI model artifacts, are not publicly accessible.\n\nAnd it's a good idea to enable model invocation logging for Amazon Bedrock to detect unauthorized usage.\n\nWe reached out to Amazon for comment, but they said they wouldn't be able to get us anything by publication time. We'll update this story with any relevant information we receive from them. ®\n\nto add the following comment sent by AWS.\n\n“AWS services and infrastructure are not affected by this issue, and they operated as designed throughout the incident described,\" the company told The Reg by email. \"The report describes an account compromised through misconfigured S3 buckets. We recommend all customers secure their cloud resources by following security, identity, and compliance best practices, including never opening up public access to S3 buckets or any storage service, least-privilege access, secure credential management, and enabling monitoring services like GuardDuty, to reduce risks of unauthorized activity.\"\n\nThe cloud giant also wants its customers who suspect or become aware of malicious activity within their AWS accounts to check out guidance for remediating potentially compromised credentials or contact AWS Support for assistance.\"",

    "description": "Why tech stack choices should be driven by business context and constraints—not framework preferences—and why this matters even more with agentic coding tools.",
    "fullText": "Developers love to argue about tech stacks.\n\nFlutter vs React Native.\n\nNative vs cross-platform.\n\nJava vs Ruby vs C#.\n\nReact vs Angular.\n\nRiverpod vs Bloc.\n\nDrift vs Hive.\n\nThese debates can go arbitrarily deep, down to library-level choices that have little impact on whether a product succeeds or fails.\n\nEveryone has preferences, and that’s fine. Preferences come from experience. Someone who started with strongly typed languages will value compiler guarantees and explicitness. Someone who started with dynamic languages will value flexibility and speed. Both viewpoints are internally consistent.\n\nWhat they are not is universally correct.\n\nThere is no hard data that can rank one stack as objectively “better” across all contexts. Teams, constraints, markets, and goals differ too much. Most arguments rely on anecdotes, and anecdotes do not generalize.\n\nSo if preference is not a reliable guide, how should a tech stack be chosen?\n\nThis question is often interpreted at the feature or use-case level. That misses the point.\n\nIn almost all non-hobby software, the problem being solved is a business problem.\n\nIf there is no business, no users, no revenue, then the software is irrelevant. It may be elegant or technically impressive, but it has no economic value. Software only matters insofar as it supports a business outcome.\n\nThat framing matters because it establishes the correct hierarchy.\n\nTechnology is not the goal.\n\nTechnology is a tool.\n\nAnd tools are chosen based on the job they need to do.\n\nEarly on, nobody knows whether the business will work.\n\nYou don’t know if users care. You don’t know if they will pay. You don’t know if the problem is real or imagined.\n\nAt this stage, obsessing over the “right” stack is misplaced effort. The dominant constraint is uncertainty, not scalability or architectural purity.\n\n“The FIRST rule of enterprenuership is you use what you have” - Alex Hormozi\n\nThis is simple rule of entrepreneurship applies surprisingly well to engineering.\n\nFounders and early teams start with what they already know. Not because it is theoretically optimal, but because it minimizes friction. Familiar tools reduce cognitive overhead, increase speed, and allow faster learning.\n\nEarly success is rarely determined by technical elegance. It is determined by whether you can ship something people want before you run out of time or money.\n\nAs the business grows, the constraints change.\n\nRevenue appears.\n\nUsers depend on the system.\n\nThe team grows.\n\nThe cost of failure increases.\n\nNow the stack begins to matter more. Not because some technologies are inherently superior, but because the software must support new business realities. Hiring, onboarding, operational cost, maintainability, performance characteristics, and risk management all become relevant.\n\nThis is where teams often conclude that an early stack choice was “wrong.” In most cases, it wasn’t wrong. It was right for the phase the business was in. The mistake was assuming it would remain right indefinitely.\n\nTwitch is often mentioned as a scaling story, but the more interesting part is how long the architecture stayed simple.\n\nAt one point, Twitch was serving millions of users with a monolithic Ruby on Rails application and a single PostgreSQL database. That setup was not elegant or future proof, but it worked. It allowed the team to move quickly, ship features, and grow the business without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\nOver time, the constraints changed. Growth amplified failures. Database contention increased. Reliability, support load, and churn started to matter more than raw development speed. The cost of incidents became visible in a way it had not been before.\n\nThat was when the architecture began to evolve. The database was scaled and restructured, services were split out, and new infrastructure and languages were introduced. None of this happened because the original stack was flawed. It happened because the business had outgrown it.\n\nThe technology changed in response to the business, not the other way around.\n\nIf you want to read more about how Twitch migrated from a monolith to microservices, see Breaking the Monolith at Twitch and Breaking the Monolith at Twitch: Part Two.\n\nIf you want to know more about how Twitch scaled its database, see How Twitch Uses PostgreSQL.\n\nAgentic coding tools make this even more important.\n\nTools like Claude Code and Cursor reduce the advantage of deep, framework-specific familiarity. Generating boilerplate, navigating unfamiliar code, applying patterns across modules, and keeping implementation consistent are no longer manual, error-prone tasks.\n\nWhen an agent can help you stay productive across technologies, the cost of switching or extending a stack drops. What remains expensive is not syntax or APIs, but domain knowledge, product decisions, and the long-term behavior of the system.\n\nIn other words, the more the tooling levels the technical playing field, the more tech stack decisions become about business fit.\n\nInstead of asking whether one technology is better than another in the abstract, ask questions that reflect the reality of the business:\n\nWhat are we optimizing for right now? Speed, cost, reliability, hiring, or time-to-market?\n\nHow quickly do we need to validate this idea?\n\nHow expensive will change be later, and what changes are most likely?\n\nWhat kind of team will maintain this system?\n\nWhat risks could realistically kill the business, and does the stack reduce or increase them?\n\nOnce framed this way, stack decisions become clearer and less emotional. Sometimes multiple choices are equally valid. Sometimes the boring option is correct. Sometimes speed matters more than correctness. Sometimes correctness matters more than speed.\n\nThere is no universal answer. The answer depends on the context.\n\nMost tech stack arguments are debates about taste, not outcomes.\n\nOnce technology is treated as a business decision rather than a personal identity, those arguments lose their intensity. The question stops being “what do I prefer?” and becomes “what does the business need right now?”\n\nThe right stack is not the one that wins debates.\n\nIt is the one that helps the business survive and grow at its current stage.\n\nIf are starting a project and need help with tech stack decision, connect with me on LinkedIn and I’ll take it from there.\n\nSoftware Developer specializing in Flutter, Android, and mobile development.\n Writing about code, architecture, and developer productivity.",

    "fullText": "Thousands of federal immigration agents have been complaining about their jobs in an online forum, where they blasted “incompetent leadership,” according to a report.\n\nAgents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies, part of the Department of Homeland Security, have taken to venting about their frustrations online as they have been placed at the center of the Trump administration’s crackdown.\n\nThere are over 5,000 users on the unnamed forum seen by WIRED claiming to be current and former federal immigration agents. There, they complained of the negative public perception of the agencies, long working hours and “incompetent” leadership, according to the outlet.\n\nThe outlet noted that users on the forum do not need to prove their employment to join and it had not confirmed the identities of the people posting.\n\nUsers were candid about the public perception of the agencies amid the Trump administration’s immigration surge in cities across the U.S.\n\n“I'm all for removing illegals, but snatching dudes off lawn mowers in Cali and leaving the truck and equipment just sitting there? Definitely not working smarter,” said one user in a post viewed by WIRED.\n\nPosts in the forum reportedly amped up following public scrutiny and outrage of the agencies in Minnesota, where U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed at the hands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nOne user started a thread titled, “Ready to resign, had enough stress” five days before Pretti was killed. “I have 2.3 years left for full special category retirement … but don't know if I'll make it. Tired of this Agency. Employees being abused badly,” the user reportedly wrote.\n\nThe user also complained of agents being deployed for temporary duty at short notice in cities where the administration is carrying out large-scale immigration operations.\n\n“No more weekends off, more work than ever before in 18 years. No more union. No more down time,” the post reportedly continued. “This is not what any of us envisioned for our last years of career when we are in our 50's.”\n\nOther users lashed out at Homeland Security leadership.\n\n“Led by some of the worst leadership I’ve ever witnessed, from the local level all the way up to the national stage, this agency has managed to turn a righteous mission into a complete clown show,” another user reportedly wrote.\n\n“This is going to be a train wreck that we may not survive,” another reportedly said.\n\nThe Independent had contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nReports of “plummeting” morale among federal law enforcement officers tasked with carrying out the administration’s immigration operations have been widespread since the unrest in Minneapolis. In a report at the end of January, more than 20 current and former immigration officials told The New York Times of their discontent in the hours following the fatal shooting of Pretti.\n\nCurrent and former ICE officials who spoke with the outlet anonymously said they were “unhappy with the sharp rhetoric” coming from top White House and Homeland Security officials, who were quick to blame Pretti.\n\nOne ICE agent told the Times that he had “always given the benefit of the doubt to the government in these situations,” but that he now no longer believed “any of the statements they put out anymore.”\n\n“We lost all trust,” a current ICE official added. “I’m not sure I can see how we exist three years from now.”\n\nFox News correspondent Bill Melugin also reported “extreme frustration” in the department over “some of the claims & narratives DHS pushed in the aftermath of the shooting.”\n\n“These sources say this messaging from DHS officials has been catastrophic from a PR and morale perspective, as it is eroding trust and credibility,” Melugin reported Sunday.\n\nIn response, Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said ICE and border patrol agents “get up every morning to try and make our communities safer.”\n\n“The men and women of ICE and Border Patrol are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters,” McLaughlin said in a previous statement to The Independent. “Like everyone else, our officers just want to go home to our families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”",

    "description": "MicroStrategy reveals its extreme Bitcoin downside scenario, outlining when debt pressure, restructuring, or dilution risks emerge.",
    "fullText": "MicroStrategy (Strategy) released its Q4 2025 earnings report and, along with it, disclosed an extreme downside scenario that would begin to strain its Bitcoin treasury model.\n\nThe CEO’s remarks provided rare insight into how far the market could fall before the company’s capital structure comes under serious pressure.\n\nDuring its latest earnings discussion, MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le said that a 90% decline in Bitcoin’s price to roughly $8,000 would mark the point where the firm’s Bitcoin reserves roughly equal its net debt.\n\nAt that level, the company would likely be unable to repay convertible debt using its BTC holdings alone. As a result, it may need to consider restructuring, issuing new equity, or raising additional debt over time.\n\nLeadership emphasized that such a scenario is viewed as highly improbable and would unfold over several years, giving the firm time to respond if markets deteriorated significantly.\n\n“In the extreme downside, if we were to have a 90% decline in Bitcoin price to $8,000, which is pretty hard to imagine, that is the point at which our BTC reserve equals our net debt and we'll not be able to then pay off of our convertibles using our Bitcoin reserve and we'd either look at restructuring, issuing additional equity, issuing an additional debt. And let me remind you: this is over the next five years. Right, So I'm not really worried at this point in time, even with Bitcoin drops,” said Le.\n\nMeanwhile, it is worth noting that Le’s remarks come only months after the Strategy executive admitted a situation that would compell the firm to sell Bitcoin.\n\nAs BeInCrypto reported, Phong Le cited a Bitcoin sale trigger tied to mNAV and liquidity stress.\n\nSpeaking on What Bitcoin Did, CEO Phong Le outlined the precise trigger that would force a Bitcoin sale:\n\nFirst, the company’s stock must trade below 1x mNAV, meaning the market capitalization falls below the value of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nSecond, MicroStrategy must be unable to raise new capital through equity or debt issuance. This would mean capital markets are closed or too expensive to access.\n\nTherefore, the latest statement does not contradict Phong Le’s earlier position but adds another layer of risk.\n\nPreviously, a Bitcoin sale depended on stock trading below mNAV and capital markets' closing. Now, he clarifies that in an extreme 90% crash, the immediate issue would be debt servicing, likely addressed first through restructuring or new financing—not necessarily selling Bitcoin.",

    "fullText": "Many high-flying tech stocks are in a rut, with some plateauing for months and others down sharply.\n\nGary Marcus said the underwhelming release of ChatGPT-5 marked a turning point in the AI discourse.\n\nHe says investors are waking up to the idea that AI might not be as game-changing as originally thought.\n\nWith names like Nvidia, Oracle, and CoreWeave down double digits in the last few months, the AI trade appears to be stuck in a rut.\n\nBut far from a temporary blip, the diminished fortunes of the market's tech leaders might represent a much more dire reassessment of the technology among investors, a top AI researcher says.\n\nThe latest volatility began with Anthropic's debut of its new plugins for its Claude AI agent, which sent legal tech stocks into a nosedive that quickly spurred volatility into the broader sector. Yet, many leading AI names have been down for months, with Nvidia losing 13% since November and Oracle down 43%.\n\nAI scientist and former Uber AI chief, Gary Marcus, said the moves show investors are waking up to reality. Marcus has been skeptical of AI's big ambitions, and his latest post reveals he sees a clear recent turning point in the AI discourse.\n\n\"Investors have been 'rotating out of tech stocks' — because they realize they were sold a bill of goods,\" he wrote. \"My guess is that these stocks — and the reputation of OpenAI — will fall further, but either way it is already clear that the rockets will not reach the altitude so many people were hoping for.\"\n\nIn Marcus's opinion, the debut of ChatGPT-5 was an underwhelming event that left investors wondering if the promises of AI might be overblown. Marcus highlighted Sam Altman's statement in early 2025 that OpenAI knew how to build AGI as one such promise that appears false given current capabilities.\n\n\"That fateful ChatGPT-5 introduction day last August — this Saturday will be the half anniversary — was the day people woke up to the reality that ChatGPT is not magic.\"\n\nIn Marcus's view, the rotation away from tech stocks is a clear indication that investors are beginning to understand that the AI boom is waning. He also said that investors seem to be moving away from tech stocks for two reasons that are almost contradictory.\n\n\"Some may be leaving companies like Nvidia out of concerns about circular financing and profitability of LLM companies, while others are leaving traditional companies like Salesforce because they're worried about companies like Anthropic replacing traditional software,\" he noted.",

    "fullText": "FOREST HILLS, Tenn. (WKRN) — After last week’s ice storm, the damage across Forest Hills and nearby neighborhoods is easy to see: split trees, sagging limbs, yards left exposed. What is harder to spot, state officials say, is the risk that follows close behind.\n\nThe Tennessee Attorney General’s Office issued a consumer alert this week warning homeowners about tree removal scams targeting storm-damaged areas. Complaints have increased about door-to-door crews asking for cash, offering immediate cleanup, and then failing to deliver any work.\n\nFor homeowners eager to clear dangerous trees, the pressure to act can be intense.\n\nOne Nashville homeowner told News 2 he paid more than $6,000 to a company operating under the name Certified Tree Care LLC for tree removal services that were never performed. The homeowner said repeated attempts to reach the company went unanswered.\n\n📧 Have breaking news come to you: \nConcerns about the company have also surfaced publicly online.\n\nIn a post shared on the Tree Climbers Facebook Page, Nashville resident Bailey Brandon warned others not to use Certified Tree Care, describing his own experience following the ice storm and urging homeowners to be cautious before hiring anyone for cleanup. The post has drawn dozens of comments from others sharing similar concerns and frustrations.\n\nNews 2 also attempted to contact the company directly. Calls were routed to an automated voicemail system and were not returned.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau currently gives Certified Tree Care LLC an F rating, citing unresolved complaints.\n\n“Most reputable firms may ask for a deposit, but they should never charge the full amount upfront,” said Robyn Householder, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau of Middle Tennessee. “Anything beyond fifty percent should be a red flag.”\n\nAt the height of the storm, about 230,000 customers across Middle Tennessee were without power. Many residents were left searching quickly for help to clear fallen trees blocking driveways, threatening homes, or resting on power lines.\n\nThe homeowner who contacted News 2 believes he is not alone and claims dozens of others may have had similar experiences since the storm. That number has not been independently verified.\n\nTrevor Cochran, a partner with Tree Job, a licensed and insured tree removal company operating locally, said pressure is often the first warning sign.\n\n“A pushy sales rep is always something to be cautious of,” Cochran said. “If someone is rushing you or singling you out, there is usually a reason, and it is not a good one.”\n\nCochran said homeowners should always insist on a written estimate that clearly states the total cost before any work begins.\n\n“If they cannot give you a final price in writing, walk away,” he said. “Once you sign something without details, you lose control of the situation.”\n\nThe Better Business Bureau and the Attorney General’s Office recommend homeowners look for credentials such as Certified Arborist, which requires training through the International Society of Arboriculture. Officials also suggest choosing companies affiliated with organizations like the Tree Care Industry Association or the American Society of Consulting Arborists.\n\n⏩ Read today’s top stories on wkrn.com\n\nHomeowners are advised to ask what cleanup is included, verify proof of insurance, and never allow work to begin without a signed contract outlining costs, scope of work, and start and completion dates.\n\nInsurance matters, officials warn. If an uninsured worker is injured while performing tree work on private property, the homeowner may be held financially responsible.\n\n“Your greatest asset is patience,” Householder said. “Taking the time to verify who you are hiring can save you a lot of money and a lot of headaches later.”\n\nAfter a storm, speed can feel like the answer. State officials said that when it comes to tree removal, slowing down may be what protects homeowners most.\n\nNews 2 left a message on Wednesday for Certified Tree Care LLC about Bailey’s complaint. Thursday, Certified Tree Care LLC general manager Bryan Koepke said a crew began work but trees were still icy, which presented a safety concern. He said the crew left but intended to go back.",

The first batch of terminals that made it onto the ‘whitelist’ are already operational.”\n\nA source at the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that “all Russian Starlinks have been cut off” along the front line as of Thursday evening local time.\n\nUnder US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia’s practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine’s electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country.\n\nUkraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools.\n\n“The enemy on the front lines is facing not just a problem, but a catastrophe. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia’s “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it’s “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.”\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense has not addressed the claims of Starlink disruptions.\n\nBut Russian military bloggers began commenting on the Starlink outages on Wednesday and Thursday, noting that Russia’s internet and communications capabilities on the front line have taken a hit.\n\nOne pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods.\n\nAnother Russian military blog, which supports the airborne special forces, tried to downplay the disruption, writing: “The Starlinks may have been shut down, but the backup communications are still there. The radios are working, and there’s communication between the positions.”\n\nSome Starlink units used by the Ukrainian side were also reportedly cut off, although it’s unclear how widespread the disruption is, as the government continues the whitelisting process.\n\nOne Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system.\n\n“It works for us,” a Ukrainian drone pilot said in a video posted to Telegram. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.”\n\nMeanwhile, the second round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States concluded in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country’s delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.”\n\n“I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov told the Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine.\n\nWhile no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff.\n\n“While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiators agreed to hold another round of talks “in the near future.”\n\nCNN’s Ivana Kottasová, Daria Tarasova-Markina and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China used this week's Singapore Airshow to flex its military and aviation muscle, drawing heavy attention from regional delegations as Beijing sharpens its bid for influence in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe U.S. military has demonstrated its power this year through the precision extraction of ​Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and a major naval buildup around Iran. Yet President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of some of U.S. ‌allies and imposed tariffs on them, creating an opening for China.\n\nWhile China's fighter jets and commercial airliners remain far from achieving mass-market international adoption, their makers appeared more assertive and confident and enjoyed greater ‌visibility this year at Asia's largest air show.\n\nThe PLA Air Force's aerobatic team made a headline-grabbing show debut of its Chengdu J-10C fighter jets, an aircraft whose export variant, the J-10CE, surged to prominence in 2025 when customer Pakistan used it to shoot down an Indian Air Force French Rafale.\n\nChinese state media reported the team had used mid-air refuelling to fly directly to Singapore for the high-profile deployment.\n\n\"That's a bit of a message to say: Our power projection is growing,\" said Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of the Royal ⁠Aeronautical Society's Aerospace magazine.\n\n\"It's one of the key enablers ‌a modern air force should have. Previously people said this is one of their weaknesses.\"\n\nInside the sweltering air show's air-conditioned halls, Chinese state companies occupied a prime spot with brightly lit displays dominated by a 1:2 scale model of AVIC's J-35A stealth multirole ‍fighter. Little is known about the latest addition to Chinese air power, which was first seen domestically in 2024.\n\nNo technical data was displayed, but observers of the global arms marketplace said the message to Asia's buyers was evident.\n\n\"That's obviously positioned to say: if you can't afford an F-35 or are banned from buying an F-35 we've got an alternative,\" Robinson said.\n\nSoutheast Asian defence officials crowded Chinese military and aerospace booths, underscoring Beijing’s growing pull as it aggressively markets hardware across the region.\n\nThe show of strength ‌landed at a politically sensitive moment, with Southeast Asian governments increasingly uneasy about U.S. security commitments amid a more isolationist Washington under Trump, analysts and Western officials said.\n\n\"We see the same delegations as before but the conversation has changed,\" said a senior official at a Western arms company.\n\nIndustry-watchers are cautious about any sudden switch of arms trade but agree the backdrop reflects the new power politics and the diversification of supply chains.\n\n\"The Chinese arms companies may think that, if other countries have lost confidence in buying American, there's an opportunity for China,\" said China defence specialist Bradley Perrett.\n\n\"But most of the U.S.' customers, if they want to look elsewhere, will look ⁠at European, South Korean and Japanese equipment.\"\n\nAsia's arms spending is growing apace as countries respond ​to a sustained build-up from an increasingly assertive China.\n\nChina's efforts to penetrate the airliner ​market, grabbing share from Airbus and Boeing, are proceeding slowly due in part to the lengthy process of winning European certification.\n\nBut state-owned planemaker COMAC again flew the C919 narrowbody jet and advertised the future C929 wide-body in model form at the show. That is now ‍progressing through detailed design as a Chinese ⁠project after initially exploring a joint development with Russia.\n\nChinese delegates said that given the Singapore venue, COMAC was prioritising potential clients from Southeast Asia, and Indonesian attendees were among those inquiring about aircraft.\n\nChina's efforts to rival Airbus and Boeing are a national priority though Western analysts say it will take ⁠years if not decades to establish the global footprint and marketing support that helps the industry leaders maintain entrenched positions.\n\nBut delegates noted a broadening commercial assault at the show including the market ‌for alternative third-party spare parts, tapping into airline concerns about shortages at a time when supplies are strained across the globe.",

    "fullText": "US stock futures turned higher early Friday, pointing cautiously to a rebound from a tech bruising as Wall Street reassessed worries about the impact of AI disruption and the risks of hefty Big Tech spending.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) rose 0.5%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) added 0.7%, retracing earlier premarket losses. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) also switched course, moving up 0.4%, on the heels of sharp closing losses on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\nThe tentative risk-on tone extended beyond stocks, as bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed back above $65,000, having touched a 16-month low overnight. But the biggest cryptocurrency is still on track for its worst weekly performance since 2022 after wiping out all of its post-Trump gains this week.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by that steep sell-off, which initially weighed on shares. But the stock was up almost 6% before the bell as bitcoin revived and Strategy's CEO played down concerns about debt-servicing risks.\n\nSome tech gloom persisted, as Amazon's (AMZN) shares tumbled 8%. In its earnings, the major cloud provider outlined plans for a massive 2026 jump in spending to least $200 billion, even as its forecast for operating income fell short.\n\nElsewhere, Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) warned it will take a charge of over €22 billion ($26 billion) in a plan to scale back its EV push.

    "description": "Scientists drilled the deepest core yet, reaching near Earth's mantle, uncovering unique geological samples and offering new insights into Earth's structure.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nTo understand the mantle—the largest layer of Earth’s rocky body—scientists drill deep cores out of the Earth.\n\nScientists drilled the deepest core yet and recovered serpentinized peridotite that forms when saltwater interacts with mantle rock.\n\nAlthough this is the deepest into the mantle scientists have ever drilled, the mission didn’t uncover pristine mantle that lies beyond the Mohorovičić discontinuity, or Moho, boundary.\n\nIf you want to understand the geology of our home planet, studying the mantle is a great place to start. Separating the planet’s rocky crust and the molten outer core, the mantle makes up 70 percent of the Earth’s mass and 84 percent of its volume. But despite its outsized influence on the planet’s geologic processes, scientists have never directly sampled rocks from this immensely important geologic layer.\n\nAnd that’s understandable, especially when you consider that the crust is roughly 9 to 12 miles thick on average. Luckily, that average contains outliers—areas of the world where the crust is actually incredibly thin and faulting exposes the mantle through cracks. One such area is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, specifically near an underwater mountain called the Atlantis Massif.\n\nOn the south side of this massif is an area known as the Lost City—a hydrothermal field whose vent fluids are highly alkaline and rich in hydrogen, methane, and other carbon compounds. This makes the area a particularly compelling candidate for explaining how early life evolved on Earth. Additionally, it contains mantle rock that interacts with seawater in a process known as “serpentinization,” which alters the rock’s structure and gives it a green, marble-like appearance.\n\nIt was here, 800 meters south of this field, in May 2023 that members of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP)—aboard the JOIDES Resolution, a 470-foot-long research vessel rented by the U.S. National Science Foundation—extracted a 1,268-meter core containing abyssal peridotites, which are the primary rocks that make up the Earth’s upper mantle. The results of the study were published in the journal Science.\n\nAlthough this makes this particular drill core the deepest sample of the mantle yet, going that deep into the rock wasn’t the goal of this record-breaking expedition.\n\n“We had only planned to drill for 200 meters, because that was the deepest people had ever managed to drill in mantle rock,” Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist at Cardiff University and co-author of the study, told Nature. He said that the drilling was so easy that they progressed three times faster than usual. The team eventually drilled a staggering 1,268 meters, and only stopped due to the mission’s limited operations window.\n\nAndrew McCaig—study co-author and University of Leeds scientist—said in an article from The Conversation that, according to a preliminary analysis of the rock, the core’s composition contains a variety of peridotite called harzburgite that forms via partial melting of mantle rock. It also contained rocks known as gabbros, which are coarse-grained igneous rocks. Both of these rocks then chemically reacted with seawater, changing their composition.\n\nWhile this core represents an incredibly opportunity to learn more about the Earth’s mantle, as well as give an in-depth look at the geologic substrate upon which the Lost City rests, the mission didn’t quite complete the “grand challenge” of crossing the Mohorovičić discontinuity. Otherwise known as the Moho, the Mohorovičić discontinuity is recognized as the true boundary between the crust and pristine mantle.\n\nFuture missions could continue exploring this site near the Atlantis Massif, but sadly, those missions won’t include JOIDES Resolution—the NSF declined to fund more core drilling past 2024. Just as scientists are finally knocking on the door to the Earth’s most ubiquitous geologic layer, the future of these kinds of drilling missions is now uncertain.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Researchers examined the relationship between a warming climate and poverty. They found that colder weather may give people a leg up in creating equitable societies.\n\nEarth's climate is dynamic. In fact, NASA scientists say the planet has gone through eight ice ages and warmer periods over the last 800,000 years.\n\nMost of this is due to natural variations in Earth's orbit affecting solar radiation levels, though cyclical patterns in the Pacific Ocean, such as El Niño and La Niña, are among the other natural phenomena also causing shifts in weather.\n\nHowever, today the Earth is heating up at an unusually fast rate.\n\n\"While the Sun has played a role in past climate changes, the evidence shows the current warming cannot be explained by the Sun,\" NASA explained.\n\nThe agency listed four human-generated pollutants — carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons, which are purely industrial in origin — as contributing to the warming problem. Gas, oil, and coal account for the bulk of the troublesome pollution.\n\nThe effects of rising global temperatures are already disrupting daily life.\n\nInsurance premiums are soaring as weather-related disasters become more frequent, as is the cost of essentials. Farmers are struggling to turn a profit, while agricultural workers are increasingly exposed to dangerous conditions like extreme heat.\n\nThe authors of this study analyzed poverty in 130 countries over the past decade and found that poverty increased by up to 1.18 percentage points for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of temperature increase.\n\n\"These poverty estimates equal a projected increase of global poor by 62.3–98.7 million people by 2030 compared with a scenario without climate change,\" they wrote.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe researchers believe their analysis is the first step toward uncovering \"nuanced dynamics\" that hinder economic growth and opportunity among developing countries.\n\nThat's because they also examined how climate impacted inequality, or the whole income distribution. They noted that \"scant empirical evidence exists on the global impacts\" of both.\n\nHowever, they said this was important to investigate because \"poverty and inequality are closely intertwined.\" They said they found some evidence suggesting that richer countries have less inequality under colder temperatures.\n\nWhile complex factors — including cultural traditions, historical interactions with other peoples, and policies enacted during nation-building — influence how wealth is viewed, generated, and distributed, the findings may aid policy discussions aimed at limiting future losses from warming.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "The Sixers turned in another third-quarter meltdown to waste a good Joel Embiid performance, falling 119-115 to the Los Angeles Lakers in infuriating fashion.\n\nJoel Embiid had just an okay game against the Clippers in Philadelphia’s barnstorming win on Monday, sitting out the second half of a back-to-back against Golden State the next night. It felt a little bit like he owed these guys something, if for no other reason than having the freshest pair of legs. And boy, did he deliver on that, sparking the Sixers early while playing a do-it-all hub on offense for a team that struggled to make shots for most of the night.\n\nWith the Lakers down Jaxson Hayes thanks to his mascot-related suspension — yes, he really is that big of a clown — DeAndre Ayton was the only guy close to like-sized that L.A. could throw at him. But it didn’t especially matter, outside of a few offensive rebounds Ayton pulled down at his expense. Ayton’s on-again, off-again effort is a bad matchup for an opponent who will take any bit of space and rise into a midrange jumper, and Embiid was able to get the shot going within the first five minutes of the game. When that happens, opponents are in jail trying to guard him, as it opens up opportunities to punish reach-ins and drive by jumpy defenders.\n\nOutside of Ayton, the Lakers mixed up coverages and the defender primarily tasked with guarding Embiid. From Jarred Vanderbilt to Maxi Kleber and others across the spectrum, the main theme was a big size advantage for Embiid. On some nights, that might mean deep post catches and a free-throw parade, but with Embiid often operating from the middle of a zone, it meant a lot of jumpers his man could never get close enough to contest. One little jab step, one little body language cue, and the Lakers were falling all over themselves to stay with him, with Embiid rising into lightly-contested shots for the entire first half. 20 easy points at halftime, thank you very much.\n\nEmbiid had some sloppiness with the handle early, but he was killing the Lakers as a playmaker for others, too, punctuating his first half with an outstanding play: Embiid faked a handoff attempt to Tyrese Maxey, drove downhill into the space the Lakers left vacated, and as the defense collapsed on him in the paint, he released the ball to Dominick Barlow for an easy bucket, sending the Sixers into halftime on a high note.\n\nEverything was rolling along until, you guessed it, the third quarter hit. I cannot believe we are this far into the season and still treating the quarter after halftime as an unsolvable Sphinx riddle for the Sixers to solve. Change the opponent, the venue, the players on the floor, nothing really matters. They will find a way to stink it up all the same.\n\nThere was a decided lack of seriousness from the Sixers after they surged to a double-digit lead early in the third, allowing the Lakers to get back into the game with seven turnovers in a single quarter. They were mostly in cruise control until about the halfway point of the third, and then the wheels came off. Nurse resisted turning to his bench as the Sixers held onto a small but mildly comfortable lead, and it all came crashing down in the end-of-quarter stretch, with Maxey battling foul trouble and Embiid resting on the bench.\n\nEnter Quentin Grimes, a mystifying player to watch. His first half was filled with genuinely awesome moments, with Grimes best understanding what needs to be done when Austin Reaves is on the floor. Drawing him in isolation repeatedly, Grimes went right by him to the rim on several different occasions, making Reaves work as he tore up the Sixers on the other end. He also put down his second highlight dunk of the week with a hellacious throwdown over Jake LaRavia, who I presume had a family.\n\nTELL THEM DON’T JUMP, Q!!! 💥🤯pic.twitter.com/K78SL0bJGp\n\n— PHLY Sixers (@PHLY_Sixers) February 6, 2026\n\nThe second half was what we will charitably refer to as an adventure. When Grimes checked into the game for his end-of-third minutes, the game almost immediately flipped in the wrong direction. He had a brutal turnover, a bad foul, and a miscommunication with VJ Edgecombe in quick succession, and the Lakers were surging. His first good play of that stretch, a steal near halfcourt, was nearly botched before order was restored, only for Kelly Oubre to launch a tightly-contested three with close to 20 seconds left on the shot clock. Not the time or the place, particularly when you’re 2/7 at the time, Mr. Oubre.\n\nThis was the first stretch of basketball over the last week where I felt they desperately needed Paul George. In those backup lineups where they try to buy rest for Embiid and Maxey, it tends to be George who emerges as a cooler head, attacking in isolation or offering spacing for VJ Edgecombe to attack in. With George in street clothes, we were back to early-season Sixers hoops, with the Edgecombe/Grimes/Watford/Oubre combo dying for some spacing, plus decision-making, and savvy.\n\nDown two points with 27 seconds left, the Sixers apparently decided they would trap late and concede a basket instead of either defending the play straight up or fouling to play the back-and-forth game. On the ensuing possession with 12 seconds left, Maxey took a ridiculous foul-baiting three and lost them the opportunity for even a chance to tie or win the game.\n\nOne of the dumbest sequences in Sixers history, straight up.\n\nVJ Edgecombe is what I would affectionately refer to as an all-action player, someone who rarely rests on his laurels who helps you win games no matter what the moment requires. Those guys can occasionally cross the line and go careening into the opponent, trying too hard to impact the game while it boomerangs back on them. But he is a rare breed of rookie, constantly playing with 100 percent effort while minimizing his wild moments on both ends of the floor.\n\nIn fact, Edgecombe often cleans up craziness from other players. Joel Embiid had the rare opportunity to throw him a lob on the break, tossing the ensuing pass so high that two VJ Edgecombes stacked on top of one another in a trenchcoat probably wouldn’t have reached the ball. But after making the attempt to meet it at the summit, Edgecombe collected himself quickly and saved it from going out of bounds, ultimately earning the Sixers an extra possession that ended with an Embiid midrange make. These plays are a constant in the Edgecombe experience.\n\nThe Lakers tried to dare the Sixers into beating them with the three-ball with a fair amount of zone, and Edgecombe was the only guy making outside shots to potentially get them out of it. He is slowly starting to figure out the happy medium on the break, darting through traffic for layups and dunks or slowing down to find an open shooter if those easy opportunities aren’t there. Edgecombe was one of their few solid options defending Austin Reaves, who gave L.A. a big lift off the bench, ripping him on a first-half possession before the Sixers got out and scored on the break.\n\nAt least, that was the case for the first half, because Edgecombe ran into a wall and struggled mightily in winning time for Philadelphia. He was a little too much gas without brakes, throwing up some wild attempts inside the arc with no whistles to save him. And even after he made a gigantic steal and hit a three and drew them within three, he and Grimes combined for one of the worst fouls of the season, fouling down three with 35 seconds left when a normal defensive possession would have sufficed.\n\nBut I was much more disappointed in Tyrese Maxey, who had an impactful passing game but a dire attacking performance, letting the Lakers dissuade him from getting past the initial defensive coverage while jacking missed three after missed three on stepback jumpers. Between true zone coverage and some extra bodies in the paint sagging off of questionable shooters, Maxey relied far too much on his jumper on a night where he had nothing going from deep.\n\nCould the Sixers have been more purposeful with their offense to get him rolling? I think so, yes. First play of the game, they ran him off of an Iverson cut to get him a look closer to the basket, and rarely turned to off-ball action to get him looks the rest of the night.\n\nIf not for the lack of incoming players at the trade deadline, we’d have a real opportunity to celebrate Dominick Barlow, who is one of the great organizational success stories of the last two years. Signed to a standard deal on Thursday evening, Barlow rose quickly from an end-of-bench afterthought to an essential piece of this Sixers team.\n\nIt has been a big road trip for Barlow, who brought his standard brand of energy and athleticism to the arena against L.A. One of the high notes of a solid Sixers first half was an end-to-end sequence from Barlow, who came from the weakside to block Rui Hachimura on a deep catch before streaking to the other end, finishing with style for two points after outrunning the entire Lakers team in transition.\n\nHis night was defined by work in and around the dunker spot, with Barlow catching drop-off after drop-off from every available passer.\n\n— In games where an opponent gets a whistle that seems ultra skewed against one team, my dad likes to shout to no one in particular, “It’s like playing the Globetrotters!” It certainly felt like the Harlem Lakers were on the floor on Thursday night.\n\n(All that said, the officials did not win this game for the Lakers. The Sixers happily gave this game away themselves. But Jenna Schroeder is the worst ref in the league and I don’t even think it’s close.)\n\n— That was perhaps the worst Oubre game of his Sixers tenure and a version of him I thought he largely left behind in Charlotte. Embarrassing shot selection, miserable off-ball defense, every negative trait in his profile on full display all at once.",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — Wichita Heights senior Jalihn Timmons has etched his name in history, tying the school’s single-game record that’s gone untouched for nearly 28 years.\n\nTimmons had a standout performance in Heights’ January matchup against Andover Central, scoring 43 points. Thirty-six of his 43 points came in the second-half of the game.\n\n“I told him, ‘You’re getting close to the record of 43 points,'” Head Coach Gary Thomason said. “He kind of looked at me like that little smirk, like, ‘Really, you’re not messing with me, are you?'”\n\n“He told me, like beginning of the fourth quarter, that I was close to it, so I just thought I would go for it,” Timmons said.\n\nThomason says Timmons has always been a fearless scorer.\n\n“He always wants the ball in his hands. Not so much to maybe score all the time, but we know he’s going make a good decision at the end of the day,” said the coach. “It’s really, it’s really fun to coach someone like that who loves the game and just as important, he respects the game too.”\n\nTimmons now holds a place in history alongside CJ Martin, who first set the record in 1998. It was previously held by City League legends Darnell Valentine and Aubrey Sherrod.\n\n“All the hard players that came through the program, it just shows that I really put a lot of work in to be where I’m at,” Timmons said.\n\nNational Baseball Congress honors three new Hall of Fame inductees\n\nEven with such an achievement, Timmons remains humble, giving credit to the guys around him.\n\nHis teammates don’t just feel like family, they’re actually related.\n\nTimmons’ younger brother Jordan Timmons and his first cousin Jorelle Hadley are right there with him on the court.\n\n“We played in a backyard growing up, so yeah, we played a lot with each other growing up throughout the years,” Timmons said.\n\nTogether, the trio is always holding each other accountable. There’s a strong support system around Jalihn, as he navigates his final season.\n\n“One thousand points is on the horizon for him, and he can take these guys into the postseason,” Thomason said.\n\nDespite the historic achievement, Timmons continues to strive for more.\n\n“State championship,” Timmons said. “I feel like that’s something that I really have come close to in the past years, but I just haven’t been able to grasp it yet, and I’m hoping this year me and my team are able to get it done.”\n\nTimmons is committed to the Hutchinson Blue Dragons to continue his basketball career.\n\nIf you would like to nominate a person, team, or sporting event for Competitive Drive, fill out KSN Sports’ online contact form.",

    "description": "Wilson is releasing the newest addition to the legendary Dynapwr family with the 2026 Dynapwr Forged irons, rounding out a revilized lineup.",
    "fullText": "Wilson is rounding out its 2026 releases with a great answer for improving players demanding better from their irons.\n\nWilson’s new Dynapwr Forged irons enter a crowded player’s distance spot in the market, but with a cavity back design and an AI-generated “Variable Face Technology,” they’re making a push toward the top of the category.\n\n“We wanted to build on the success of the previous award-winning model, while taking strides to elevate the performance to the next level,” Ben Hanser, CAD engineer at Wilson Golf, said in a statement. “The new iron is a statement of Wilson’s dedication to innovation and tradition. By combining forged precision with AI-driven design, we’ve created an iron that delivers distance, control and feel in perfect harmony.”\n\nKeep reading below for more on the Dynapwr Forged irons, including my take on the release.\n\nWhile the previous generation Dynapwr Forged irons were super successful, the 2026 models improve on them by adding a new optimized face thickness with the help of AI. This eliminated the need for the power holes of the previous model.\n\nThe variable face thickness helps boost face flex, in turn increasing ball speeds.\n\nDynapwr Forged also has a new KR-CUP face design, which overlaps the face around the sole, enhancing face flex further, particularly on low strikes.\n\nTo help further improve feel in the forged 8620 carbon steel chassis, the cavities in the 3- to 9-iron are filled with urethane to enhance feel.\n\nWhat is it: A player’s distance cavity back iron with a new AI-designed variable face thickness and urethane-filled cavity.\n\nWho it’s for: Players who are advancing their ball striking ability and want something with a more premium feel without sacrificing forgiveness and speed, or moving to something as compact as a hollow-body.\n\nMany people are going to ask if they should choose between the Dynapwr Forged or the Staff Model XB iron. But truthfully, the new Dynapwr Forged perfectly fills a gap between the XB and the standard Dynapwr iron.\n\nThe Dynapwr Forged is clearly in that player’s distance category with entries like the P790, JPX 925 Forged, Ti Fusion and many others for players looking for speed and forgiveness.\n\nThe Dynapwr Forged is going to fall on the larger and faster end of that spectrum, while the XB falls \n\nWhat’s the difference? I believe it depends on your trend. This Dynapwr Forged is great for a player who is improving and needs to build confidence, but also wants to start getting into the more premium feel. In other words, they are a player who is improving, rather than a player looking to recapture lost performance.\n\nYou can still benift from lots of modern technology, like the new varaible face thickness and urethane-filled cavity, but you can also hone in your precision with a more players shape than the Dynapwr irons.\n\nDynapwr Forged gives Wilson a very complete iron lineup with no one left out. Another step toward the restoration of one of golf’s (and sport’s) great brands.\n\nWilson’s new Dynapwr Forged irons are available for pre-order starting Feb. 5 and will arrive at retail locations on Feb. 19.\n\nThe full set will cost $1,199.99 for 5-GW with steel shafts or $1,299.99 for graphite. A 3- and 4-iron are also available through custom.\n\nWant to find the best driver for your game in 2026? Find a club-fitting location near you at True Spec Golf.\n\nThe post Wilson’s 2026 Dynapwr Forged irons add AI-tech to the iconic family appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "It takes more than practice, sweat and grit to build a wrestling dynasty.\n\nThe Juab boys wrestling squad capped off its 10th consecutive state championship Thursday night at the Sevier Valley Center in Richfield.\n\n“It really takes a community to be able to do this and give those kids something to perform for,” coach Joel Holman said. “I think the state wrestling tournament is the greatest sporting event hosted by the (Utah) High School Activities Association. The highs are the highest, and the lows are the lowest.”\n\nJuab racked up 277.5 team points en route to the title, with Canyon View finishing runner-up with 232 points and Morgan in third with 165.\n\nOutside of Juab’s triumph, one of the top stories of the night belonged to Union’s Tucker Roybal, who wrapped up his career with a remarkable fourth individual state title. He won his championship match by technical to finish the year with a 47-1 record.\n\nFor Juab, of the seven wrestlers that advanced to the finals, two earned individual state titles.\n\nKaden Martineau (150) delivered Juab’s first individual title of the tournament with a win by fall over Union’s Rowdy Roybal and Ladd Holman (190) picked up the team’s other individual title, pinning Emery’s Hazen Meccariello in just 48 seconds.\n\n“I came in feeling pretty confident,” Martineau said. “I knew I just had to come in and do my stuff.”\n\nMartineau said being part of the championship team is an incredible experience.\n\n“It’s awesome to be part of this. Everyone here is so electric,” he said. “Wrestling is just part of my life. Without it, I don’t know where I’d be.”\n\nAdded Ladd Holman, the coach’s son: “It was fun for me, but it’s even more fun to be part of the team. It’s special to be here. Wrestling helped me reach some goals, but also deal with some setbacks.”\n\nA junior, this marks his third consecutive state title, and he said the coaching staff, including his dad, are some of his best friends.\n\nThe finals began with Carbon’s Jantz Greenhalgh earning a third-round pin over Juab’s Jack Holman in the 106-pound division. Canyon View’s Jaxten Bowler edged Juab’s Trevor Cowan with a 5–4 decision at 113, while Union’s Grady Roybal won a 17–10 decision over Juab’s Jet Abbott.\n\n“There’s always going to be disappointment, but hopefully they learn not only to do hard things, but to do them with class and integrity,” Joel Holman said. “You represent yourself, your program and your community.”\n\nAt 138, Carbon’s Riker Ohearon defeated Juab’s Drake Johnson by decision.\n\n“What stood out for me is that most everyone on the backside took third place,” Holman said. “I’m proud of the guys who took their loss, shook it off and came back to score points for the team.”\n\nHolman also expressed appreciation for the support the team receives from the Juab community, including donations, countless volunteer hours and a sea of crimson shirts filling the cheering section.\n\n“People know when we’re doing well,” he said. “It’s important because if you feel like no one cares, it’s easy to give up on yourself.\n\n“When you know the community is behind you, watching and wanting you to succeed, you don’t want to let them down.”\n\nBeyond the wins on the mat, Holman said he hopes his athletes understand they represent more than just a high school wrestling team.\n\n“Wrestling teaches the lessons of sports better than any other sport because it’s harder than any other sport,” he said. “Juab is a wrestling town, and now we have kids in the program who have never known Juab not to be a wrestling town.\n\nJantz Greenhalgh, Carbon, So.

    "fullText": "Manchester United are preparing to face Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday as Michael Carrick looks to make it four wins out of four.\n\nIt has been a dream start for the caretaker head coach, with the Red Devils seeing off Manchester City, Arsenal, and Fulham.\n\nThe manner of the wins was also impressive, with the 20-time English league champions playing Pep Guardiola’s side off the park before securing late wins against both London teams.\n\nAhead of Saturday’s crunch tie, Spurs boss Thomas Frank was asked to give his verdict about United under Michael Carrick.\n\nThe under-fire Dane went on to explain the two major differences he has noticed during the pre-match press conference.\n\nHe also added that United possess great individual quality to change games in an instant, highlighting Bruno Fernandes‘ impact as the attacking midfielder.\n\n“I think he has had a great start,” Frank was quoted as saying as per Sky Sports News. “It seems like there was injected a little bit of energy into the team.\n\n“I think it looks like some of the players are in a good place. We know the threats that I also think they posed before from Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, Cunha and Bruno Fernandes, he’s getting this team ticking.\n\n“He has done that the last, I don’t know, four or five years. It has been incredible. It is a threat, it is a challenge, but we are looking forward to it.”\n\nFrank is spot on. The energy put in by the players, both offensively and defensively, has been a joy to behold and is a marked improvement from Ruben Amorim’s time at the club.\n\nSomething plenty of United stars have alluded to in recent interviews.\n\nNot to mention, the legendary midfielder has also revitalised quite a few players who seemed down and out under the former head coach.\n\nKobbie Mainoo is a perfect example of that, while Carrick’s man-management also saw Patrick Dorgu shine in a more attacking role before his untimely injury.\n\nHopefully, the three-time Champions League winners can continue their mid-season revival and exact revenge on the North London side for what had transpired in the Europa League final in the last term.\n\nFeature image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

The Patriots have a chance to pass them this weekend, however, if they’re able to upset the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAccordingly, it figures that either Pittsburgh or New England would have had the best play in Super Bowl history, which legendary broadcaster Al Michaels revealed this week during his appearance on the “Fitz And Whit” podcast.\n\nAl Michaels on James Harrison’s Super Bowl Pick six:\n\n\"You've got James Harrison what, for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history.”#steelers\n\nFitz and Whit pic.twitter.com/MIW81OEahF\n\n— Matthew Luciow (@matthewluciow92) February 5, 2026\n\nMichaels discussed the Steelers’ exciting 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, which featured a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown by Pittsburgh linebacker James Harrison off Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. The play set a Super Bowl record and gave the Steelers a 10-point lead heading into halftime.\n\n“You’ve got James Harrison with, what for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history. A hundred-yard interception return at the end of the half. Crazy, down the sideline, he’s almost getting tackled 15 times,” recalled Michaels, who called the game for NBC.\n\nEven though the play happened 17 years ago, Michaels still remembers it like it was yesterday. So do many Pittsburgh fans, as their team hasn’t won a Super Bowl since.\n\nMore Steelers: Steelers Reportedly Expected To Hire New Outside Linebackers Coach\n\nThe post Al Michaels Claims Steelers Had ‘Greatest Play In Super Bowl History’ appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "NEW HAVEN - The Greenwich boys and girls indoor track and field teams were both winners at the FCIAC championships Thursday night at the Floyd Little Athletic Center.\n\nThe boys won with 112 points, with Danbury next at 66. The girls finished with 116 points, ahead of second-place New Canaan's 65.\n\n\"I think [the girls team] won all four relays, so it was really a team effort,\" Greenwich girls head coach Peter Watson said.\n\nWatson also credited second- and third-place finishes that contributed to the team's success.\n\nCardinals boys head coach Christopher Wallace said the mentality of his athletes coming into the season has really started to pay off.\n\n\"This year is like a culmination of a lot of years of hard work for this team, and they all believe in each other and have each other's backs,\" Wallace said.\n\nGreenwich's 4x200 boys relay squad of Jack Hannafin, David Boside, Daniel Silver and Alexander Yu started the meet by winning in a season-best time of 1:32.35.\n\nYu was also part of the 1,600 sprint medley that finished second with a season-best time of 3:45.85, and the 4x400 that finished third in 3:36.71.\n\n\"This is the best,\" Yu said. \"Last year, I missed my FCIAC time just barely. This year, I'm back. I'm so much better and so much more prepared.\"\n\nThe Cardinals' 4x800 of Michael Yardis, Oliver Eaton, Benjamin Hayes and Ryan Newcomb won gold with a season-best time of 8:16.45.\n\nOn the girls side, Greenwich swept the relays thanks to standout performances from Riley Barber and Eliana Daplyn. Barber was on the 4x200 with Nina Silver, her twin sister Ella Barber and Chloe Culver, and the foursome finished with a season-best time of 1:45.15.\n\n\"I'm really proud of my teammates,\" Riley Barber said. \"Our team is really well-rounded, and I'm just really proud of all of them. They all did really well.\"\n\nBarber was also on the winning 1,600 sprint medley team, along with Daplyn, who was a member of the 4x400 with Gemma Hardwick, Chloe Culver, Margaret McCooe that took gold in a time of 4:09.64.\n\nThe 4x400 got interesting in the third leg when McCooe sensed that she was being passed by another runner. She looked back twice and decided to make her move, which ultimately paid off.\n\n\"The runner was right next to me, and I was going to let her pass, and then maybe try to [pass by her] then, but then I just decided to sprint the last [stretch of the race],\" McCooe said.\n\nAlthough the relays were where the Cardinals took command of the meet, they also had victories elsewhere.\n\nRyan Newcomb won the boys 600 in 1:24.79, and Jacob Mobley won the shot put with a meet record of 51 feet, and a half-inch.\n\nHardwick won the girls 600 in 1:38.45, and Daplyn claimed the 1,000 in 2:58.40.\n\nBoth Greenwich coaches were proud of what they saw, and are expecting more good results next Saturday in states.\n\n\"We're gonna get ready for the CIAC Class LL championship,\" Watson said.  \"We've got a little bit of time to rest. We worked really hard today. We're excited to try and go in and do something special.\"\n\nBoys team results: 1. Greenwich 112; 2. Danbury 66; 3. Ridgefield 42.5; 4. Brien McMahon 36; 5.

    "description": "Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye for 2026 NFL MVP by one vote, 24-23 in the closest MVP race in 22 years, however it was odd first-place nods for Justin Herbert and Josh Allen that might have made the difference.",
    "fullText": "Why Justin Herbert's first-place MVP vote is odd twist to Matthew Stafford victory over Drake Maye originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL was very close to having co-league MVP quarterbacks for the second time ever and first time in 22 years. Instead, the Rams' Matthew Stafford's margin of victory -- one first-place vote -- over the Patriots' Drake Maye (24-23) will go down as the closest decision in league history.\n\nNot since the Colts' Peyton Manning and the late Titans great Steve McNair tied 16-16 and shared MVP in 2003 has there been such a narrow call. Stafford edging Maye was the most expected result at Thursday's Associated Press NFL Honors ceremony, but it still came with controversy considering where the three other first-place votes went.\n\nWhile 47 of the 50 AP voters, which includes national beat reporters and television analysts such as Tom Brady, had a natural split between Stafford and Maye -- much like Josh Allen beating Lamar Jackson for 2024 MVP -- three went in a different direction. Two voters thought Allen should repeat and gave him a follow-up first-place love. But one inexplicably threw away their most valuable vote on Justin Herbert.\n\nMORE:How Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye in closest race since 2003\n\nThere was some logic to Allen's season with the Bills being worthy of some recognition, given it was more efficient than his winning year in many ways. But Herbert's year with the Chargers shouldn't have had a real case.\n\nHerbert wasn't even one of the five finalists \"nominated\" at the 2026 NFL Honors. Stafford, Maye and Allen were joined by Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence and 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who both didn't get any first place votes.\n\nBefore the AP reveals on Friday how all 50 voters ranked their top five from first to fifth, the Herbert voter outed himself -- it was former Pro Football Focus analyst Sam Monson.\n\nI was the Justin Herbert vote.\n\nThe guy had the worst offensive line in the NFL all season and despite that he was working miracles in almost every single game.\n\nStafford's OL became 2/5ths as bad as Herbert's for 5 minutes and he became a turnover howitzer.\n\nHe embodied 'value'.\n\n— Sam Monson (@SamMonsonNFL) February 6, 2026\n\nHerbert did have to deal with a broken-down offensive line with both top offensive tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt going down with season-ending injuries. He was sacked 54 times and the Chargers gave up 60 as a team.\n\nBut Maye also was sacked a ton, 47 times, with his rookie left tackle Will Campbell battling inexperience and injury. Maye led the league in completion percentage (72.0), yards per pass attempt (8.9) and passer rating (113.5). He also rushed for 450 yards.\n\nStafford led the league with his 4,709 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes while averaging 7.9 yards per attempt and rating 109.2.\n\nHerbert's numbers weren't close to either. He averaged 7.3 yards per attempt and rated 94.1. He threw for only 26 TDs with 13 interceptions while passing for fewer than 4,000 yards (3,727 yards). Those kind of mediocre numbers lack both efficiency and profilic nature, two things that count most in the history of the award, with MVP really being \"the best quarterback in the league award\".\n\nMORE:Matthew Stafford says he’s not retiring in 2026 NFL MVP Speech\n\nEvery quarterback that wins MVP has a favorable support system. Herbert might have been let down by his team, but in the end, MVP is an award for individual performance. Had Herbert put up transcendent numbers with those challenges, it's one thing. But one cannot blame Stafford or Maye for having better all-around support systems and taking full advantage.\n\nHerbert didn't deserve that vote, or even a fifth-place one.",

    "fullText": "Transfer expert for The Athletic David Ornstein has revealed the fee that Liverpool have paid to sign Rio Ngumoha from Chelsea.\n\nThe move at the time caused a bit of a stir because this guy is a highly rated young player, and Chelsea fans knew very well that they were losing a gem. But for whatever reason, they couldn’t keep hold of him and he made the decision to go and play for Liverpool instead and try his luck there, rather than stay at Chelsea where he came through the academy.\n\nSome people will feel that Chelsea have got decent money for a player who was yet to even sign a professional contract, whereas others who are experts on the Blues academy will know that this fee will soon end up looking like an absolutely bargain for a player with a very high ceiling.\n\nRio Ngumoha celebrates scoring for Liverpool.(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to the report, Liverpool must pay an initial fee worth £2.8million — which could rise by a further £4m — for the signing of Rio Ngumoha from Chelsea. This was decided at tribunal.\n\nI think it is safe to say that paying so little for any player in the top leagues these days will be considered a bargain. But for me, I think this fee will soon look like an absolutely bargain of the century for Liverpool – this guy is a superb talent.\n\nChelsea and Strasbourg have had a ridiculous 12 transfers between them in the last two windows. It’s all within the rules, but it’s making people uncomfortable.\n\nJoao Pedro impressed with his performance on Tuesday night, and the highlights show him doing really well against a physical Gunners team.",

(WLNS) — Parma Western girls basketball has won four-straight games with their most recent win coming over Holt and the Panthers believe they have begin to gel at just the right time.\n\nIn the win over Holt on Tuesday, senior Rayah Hitt finished with 25 points and senior Aubree Allen finished with 23 points.\n\n“What’s great is there’s no ego’s, there’s no beef from the rest of the team,” said Parma Western basketball coach Jeff Beckman. “Some nights, we’ve had a couple games where we’ve had four in double figures so it’s just who’s hot and let’s get them the ball and it’s a great display of unselfishness.”\n\nWith that unselfishness, Beckman says his team has began to flourish and he believes one of the biggest reasons for that is the relationships his players have created and strengthened off the court.\n\nFor Hitt, who says her and her teammates push each other to their limits, she also added it’s about knowing what the team needs from each person in order to excel.\n\n“We’ve always been a good team, a good program and I think we just needed to figure out how to work together and the cohesiveness of this team and that’s what we’re figuring out right now and we’re really starting to gel at the right time,” explained Hitt.\n\nHitt who one of the senior leaders of the team says each person on the team has something to give and that is what makes the Panthers successful.\n\n“We know our roles on the team,” said Hitt. “That’s a really good thing for our team cause in the past we had to learn our roles and now we’ve done that and we’re really succeeding.”\n\nParma Western will go for its fifth straight win when they take on Portland at home on February 6th.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Mark Stone had a goal and two assists and the Vegas Golden Knights took control early Thursday night by scoring four times on their first six shots for a 4-1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nVegas heads into the Olympic break with back-to-back victories after losing seven of eight games. The Kings have lost four of five.\n\nJack Eichel and Pavel Dorofeyev each had a goal and an assist for the Golden Knights.

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Honors celebrated the defining performances and stories of the 2025 season, recognizing excellence that went far beyond the box score. From veteran stars reaching new heights to emerging talents announcing their arrival, this year’s winners reflected the league’s unique blend of longevity, resilience, and evolution. Together, these awards capture the moments and individuals who shaped the NFL’s narrative over the past season.\n\nMatthew Stafford captured his first NFL MVP award after a remarkable 17th season in the league. He led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes. His performance was a career-high and pivotal in the Rams’ offensive success, showcasing both precision and longevity at age 37. Stafford’s journey from years of underappreciated play in Detroit to peak form in Los Angeles adds a compelling arc to his MVP narrative. Despite his veteran status, he announced intentions to continue playing, hinting at even more chapters ahead.\n\nSmith-Njigba emerged as the league’s top offensive weapon, setting franchise records and finishing with 1,793 receiving yards — the most in the NFL for the 2025 season. His route running, consistency, and ability to create separation made him a matchup nightmare for defenses. He became the focal point of Seattle’s attack and proved he’s more than just a deep threat, becoming a true WR1. His production helped elevate the Seahawks into serious playoff contention.\n\nMyles Garrett’s season will go down in history — he shattered the NFL single-season sack record with 23 and logged 33 tackles for loss. His relentless pass rush and ability to disrupt games earned him Defensive Player of the Year honors for a second time. Garrett’s dominance, even when facing constant double teams, illustrated his evolution into one of the truly elite defenders in the league. His impact extended beyond sacks, as he altered offensive game plans weekly.\n\nMcMillan made an immediate splash in his rookie season, leading all first-year players in receiving and showcasing a polished route tree and natural ball skills. His chemistry with his quarterback and knack for big plays gave the Panthers a reliable and explosive weapon. The award signals the start of a potentially incredible NFL career, with McMillan already displaying pro-caliber instincts. His performance brought excitement to Carolina’s offense and optimism for the future.\n\nSchwesinger arrived as a surprise standout, amassing impressive tackle totals and impact plays that anchored the Browns’ defense. His instincts in coverage and physicality in run support distinguished him from his draft class peers. Winning Defensive Rookie of the Year validated his immediate contribution and hinted at future stardom. His emergence added a dynamic element to Cleveland’s defense.\n\nThuney’s performance as an interior offensive lineman earned him the inaugural Protector of the Year award, emphasizing his role in stabilizing the Bears’ offensive front. His pass protection and run-blocking prowess helped elevate Chicago’s offensive efficiency. Known for his intelligence and technique, Thuney became a leader on the line. This award recognizes the importance of unsung linemen who anchor offensive success.\n\nMcCaffrey’s journey back from significant injury was one of the most impressive stories of the season, finishing with over 2,100 scrimmage yards and 17 touchdowns. His versatility — as a runner, receiver, and team leader — made him indispensable to the 49ers’ offense. The award honors not just statistical excellence but resilience and dedication to rehabilitation. His triumphant return energized teammates and fans alike.\n\nVrabel guided the Patriots through a successful turnaround, leading them to an AFC East title and deep playoff push on his first year with the team. His leadership and game management earned recognition as Coach of the Year by his peers. Vrabel’s emphasis on culture and discipline translated into tangible improvement on the field. The award underscores his impact in transforming the Patriots into a contender.\n\nMcDaniels’ role as Assistant Coach of the Year reflects his influence in shaping the Patriots’ offensive identity and maximizing the talent on the roster. Known for his strategic approach and game-planning acumen, McDaniels helped elevate New England’s execution. His contributions were integral to the team’s success and competitive positioning.\n\nWagner was honored for his exceptional leadership on the field and impactful community service off it. The Walter Payton Man of the Year Award recognizes players who demonstrate commitment to their communities, and Wagner’s efforts have extended well beyond football. His charitable initiatives and mentorship work set a standard for NFL players. The award celebrates character and civic contribution.\n\nTaken as a whole, the complete list of 2026 NFL Honors winners tells the story of a season driven by elite play, leadership, and perseverance. Each awardee left a distinct imprint on their team and, in many cases, the broader direction of the league. As the NFL turns the page to a new season, these honorees stand as benchmarks for excellence and reminders of how special the 2025 campaign truly was.\n\nThe post Complete list of winners in 2026 NFL Honors appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "Lasses Preview: Friday Nights Under The Lights!",
    "description": "Charlotte Patterson previews tonight’s clash between Sunderland Women and Sheffield United — a big game awaits!",
    "fullText": "A February night under the lights at Eppleton always carries its own kind of electricity, but tonight’s game feels particularly charged.\n\nSunderland Women welcome Sheffield United in a fixture that arrives at a pivotal moment for both clubs, with each navigating the fine margins of a league table where a handful of points separate mid‑table security from the creeping anxiety of a relegation battle.\n\nIt’s the sort of match that can tilt a season’s momentum for better or worse, and the sort of occasion that demands clarity, resilience and a rediscovery of identity. For Sunderland in particular, it feels like a moment to steady the ship, to respond and to remind themselves — and everyone watching — of the football they’re capable of producing.\n\nThe Lasses’ recent run of form has been a frustrating blend of promise and inconsistency, with their loss to Bristol City standing out as a particularly bruising setback. Heading into that match, there was a sense that Sunderland were beginning to stitch together some cohesion, even if results hadn’t always reflected the performances.\n\nSadly, the trip to Bristol unravelled in a way that will have disappointed Mel Reay and her squad.\n\nBristol were sharper in key moments and more decisive in both boxes, and Sunderland struggled to impose themselves in the way they had earlier in the season.\n\nThe defeat wasn’t simply about the scoreline — it was the manner of it as Sunderland looked disjointed, unable to find the rhythm that had defined their best spells of the campaign, and too often second to loose balls and transitional moments.\n\nThe most concerning aspect was the lack of attacking fluency.\n\nEarlier in the season, Sunderland carved teams open with quick combinations, intelligent movement and a willingness to commit bodies forward. Against Bristol, that spark was missing.\n\nPasses that would normally split lines instead drifted into congested areas, wide players found themselves isolated and the midfield — usually a source of control and tempo — struggled to dictate. Bristol capitalised, pressing aggressively and forcing Sunderland into rushed decisions.\n\nIt was the sort of performance that leaves a team not just disappointed but reflective, and with tough fixtures looming Sunderland know they can’t afford to let that result remain in their system.\n\nIf Sunderland’s form has been uneven, Sheffield United’s have been quietly gathering momentum, culminating in a very impressive 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic — a result that, in context, brought far more than just a point. Charlton have been one of the strongest sides in the division — both in terms of form and league position, — and Sheffield’s ability to go toe‑to‑toe with them was a statement of intent.\n\nI watched that match myself and it was impossible not to be struck by the level of intensity and organisation Sheffield brought to the pitch.\n\nThey pressed Charlton relentlessly, especially in the first half, swarming with four or five players at a time whenever Charlton attempted to build from goal kicks. It wasn’t reckless pressing — it was coordinated, intelligent and suffocating.\n\nWhat impressed me most was how consistently Sheffield sustained that pressure.\n\nCharlton aren’t easily rattled yet Sheffield forced them into hurried clearances, misplaced passes and uncomfortable defensive sequences. The energy levels were remarkable, and the tactical discipline even more so.\n\nAs a neutral observer, it was exhilarating to watch; as a Sunderland supporter, it was slightly worrying as Sheffield looked like a side with belief, clarity and a willingness to work for every inch of the pitch, and one player who stood out was former Sunderland midfielder Mollie Rouse.\n\nHer performance was a reminder of the qualities she brought during her time on Wearside: composure, vision and an ability to knit play together with subtle but incisive touches.\n\nAgainst Charlton, she was central to Sheffield’s best moments. Her through balls repeatedly carved open space and her link‑up play helped Sheffield transition from pressing to possession with fluidity. She seemed to anticipate the movement of teammates before the ball even reached her feet, and her presence gave Sheffield a creative axis that Charlton struggled to contain.\n\nThe match itself was intense from start to finish, with both sides trading periods of control and half‑chances, but the closing stages belonged to Sheffield.\n\nThey created two huge opportunities in the dying minutes — chances that, on another day, would’ve secured all three points. The fact that they were still pushing with such conviction so late in the game spoke volumes about their fitness, mentality, and ambition, and it was a performance that’ll have boosted their confidence significantly heading into tonight’s clash.\n\nThe head‑to‑head history between Sunderland and Sheffield United adds another layer of intrigue to this fixture.\n\nSheffield got the better of the Lasses in the League Cup earlier this season, in a result that stung not just because of the defeat itself, but because Sunderland struggled to impose their style on the match, and it was a reminder that Sheffield are more than capable of disrupting Sunderland’s rhythm and exploiting lapses in concentration.\n\nHowever, the league meeting between the sides at the start of the 2025/2026 season told a very different story as Sunderland travelled to Bramall Lane and produced one of their most complete performances in recent memory, dismantling Sheffield 0-4 with a display of free‑flowing, incisive attacking football.\n\nEverything clicked that day: the movement, the passing patterns, the pressing triggers, the confidence in possession.\n\nIt was the sort of performance that set expectations for the season ahead and showcased the attacking identity Sunderland have been striving to recapture. Unfortunately, that brand of football has been harder to find in recent weeks. The contrast between that opening‑day brilliance and the more laboured performances of late is stark, and Friday night offers an opportunity, perhaps even a necessity, to rediscover that spark.\n\nThis match carries weight not just because of form or history, but because of the broader context of the league table.\n\nBoth Sunderland and Sheffield United find themselves amid a cluster of teams separated by only a few points, where a single win can propel a side toward mid‑table comfort and a single defeat can drag them back into relegation battle. It’s a precarious position — one that demands consistency and resilience, and where every point matters, every mistake is magnified and every moment of quality becomes decisive.\n\nFor Sunderland, the urgency is heightened by the fixtures that lie ahead.\n\nTough tests are on the horizon and dropping points at home — especially in a match against a direct competitor, — would place additional pressure on those upcoming challenges.\n\nThe crowd will be expectant, vocal and eager to see a response to the disappointment at Bristol. There’a something about these evening fixtures that often brings out the best in Sunderland teams, and the players will know that this is a moment to rise to the occasion.\n\nThe key for Sunderland will be re‑establishing control in midfield and rediscovering the attacking patterns that defined their early‑season success.\n\nThey need to move the ball with purpose, stretch Sheffield’s defensive shape and avoid being drawn into the chaotic, high‑pressing game that Sheffield executed so effectively against Charlton. If Sunderland can dictate the tempo, they can create the sort of chances that’ve been lacking in recent matches, but if they allow Sheffield to set the rhythm, press aggressively and force turnovers, the match could become uncomfortable very quickly.\n\nDefensively, Sunderland will need to be alert to Sheffield’s transitions.\n\nThe Blades showed against Charlton that they can break with pace and precision — especially when Rouse is given space in which to operate. Sunderland’s defence will need to communicate clearly, track runners diligently and avoid the lapses that proved costly against Bristol. Concentration will be crucial, particularly in the opening stages when Sheffield are likely to press with intensity.\n\nPsychologically, this match is an opportunity for Sunderland to reset.\n\nA win would not only provide valuable points but also restore confidence and momentum. It would demonstrate that the Bristol result was a blip rather than a trend, and that the team remains capable of producing the football that defined their best performances earlier in the campaign.\n\nFor Sheffield, it represents a chance to build on their impressive draw with Charlton and to continue to climb away from the lower reaches of the table — and they’ll arrive with belief, energy, and a clear game plan.\n\nWhat makes this fixture so compelling is that both sides have shown glimpses of their potential but have also struggled for consistency.\n\nBoth have strengths that can trouble the opposition, both sides have vulnerabilities that can be exploited and both teams understand the stakes. It’s the sort of match where the first goal could be decisive, where momentum could swing dramatically and where individual moments of quality may determine the outcome.\n\nAs a Sunderland supporter, there’s a natural desire to see the team respond with conviction, to see the patterns of play that lit up the early weeks of the season and to see the players embrace the occasion. But having watched Sheffield’s performance against Charlton, there’s also an awareness that this will be far from straightforward.\n\nSheffield are organised, hungry, and capable of unsettling even the strongest sides. They won’t come to sit back; instead, they’ll come to compete, to press and to test Sunderland’s composure.\n\nUltimately, tonight feels like a crossroads.\n\nSunderland can either use this match to reassert themselves, to reclaim their identity and to put daylight between themselves and the teams below — or they can allow the uncertainty of recent weeks to linger.\n\nThe choice is theirs, and the stage is set.",

    "title": "Simon Adingra’s Exit Is A Sign Of The Times At Sunderland",
    "description": "\"Loaning out such a high-profile player sends a very strong message in itself”, writes Phil West of Adingra’s departure",
    "fullText": "When Granit Xhaka took what felt like ten Leeds United players out of the game with a sumptuous pass to Simon Adingra, who then composed himself before curling a smart finish beyond the dive of Lucas Perri at the Stadium of Light back in December, was I the only Sunderland fan whose first thought was “Now he’s truly arrived and we’ll see what he can bring to the table if he’s given an extended run in the side”?\n\nAs we eventually shared the spoils with the visitors from Elland Road, that goal really felt like a breakthrough moment for the Ivory Coast international.\n\nTo my mind, it was the perfect response to being omitted from his country’s AFCON squad and as he dropped to his knees in celebration with his teammates surrounding him, I really believed we’d seen something that would kickstart his Sunderland career, putting him back into favour with Régis Le Bris after murmurings about his work rate and defensive diligence.\n\nSadly, things didn’t work out that way.\n\nJust over one month later, Adingra has made a swift Wearside exit after being loaned to Ligue 1 side AS Monaco, with Ecuadorian winger Nilson Angulo set to arrive from Anderlecht as the latest addition to our talented legion of wingmen.\n\nA sharp, ruthless and possibly brutal reversal of fortune? Perhaps. A move that in some ways is justifiable and was needed for both the benefit of the squad and Adingra himself? Many would say yes.\n\nIn the first instance, his summer signing from Brighton was by no means the most ill-advised we could’ve made as we sought pace and dynamism on the flanks ahead of our return to the Premier League.\n\nAs a 2023 AFCON champion and a player who was seemingly highly rated down on the south coast — albeit with a cautionary note sounded about his consistency when the opinions of Brighton fans were canvassed before and after his transfer was completed — I was excited by his arrival on Wearside and was hopeful that he could make a major impact in the red and white stripes.\n\nSadly, despite his goal against Leeds and an assist during our opening-day victory over West Ham, his spell at the Stadium of Light hasn’t lived up to that initial promise and it feels unlikely that he’ll play any further part in what we all hope will be Sunderland’s story of continued progress during 2026 and beyond.\n\nAlthough we’ve at least cushioned any financial blow by virtue of how we’ve structured his loan arrangement, it does represent a rare blip in terms of representing a transfer that didn’t work out as planned — albeit with our strike rate for new signings still more than good enough to deem that particular window a success.\n\nThe speed at which Adingra was moved on surprised me.\n\nAs recently as last weekend, I felt he would be given further opportunities to play his way back into form and prove that he could make the grade at this level, but it also brought into sharp focus the standards being set, the demands placed on our players and the qualities you’re expected to bring to the table.\n\nNowadays, Sunderland is a club where careers can be launched and reputations enhanced, but no new signing will find the going easy and in the quest to establish ourselves as a genuine competitive force at this level, that’s the way it has to be — and occasionally in spite of supporters such as myself who are eager to see players given every opportunity to prove their worth even as their form fluctuates.\n\nIt’s obvious that despite his Gallic charm, level-headed interviews and even-tempered nature, Le Bris is a hard taskmaster.\n\nIn order to earn and retain a place in a team coached by him, you must combine skill, footballing intelligence, physicality, adaptability and perhaps most importantly a willingness to graft for the entirety of the ninety minutes.\n\nAdingra’s profile and style of play — that of a winger who plays off the front foot, was more effective in wide open spaces and for whom tracking back perhaps wasn’t a high priority — has evidently not gelled with the head coach’s ideals and therefore a parting of the ways feels mutually beneficial.\n\nWith any luck, Angulo will prove to be another previously unearthed gem of an addition and we can continue to work on the attacking side of our game during the remaining games of the season, but loaning out such a high-profile player sends a very strong message in itself: talent alone isn’t enough nowadays, and no decision will be shirked if the team can possibly benefit as a result.\n\nThat in itself feels like a bit of a shock given our historical reputation for indulging players who didn’t perform consistently enough, but hopefully Adingra can use this opportunity as a chance to reset and get back into the groove — and the club deserves credit for ensuring that a very talented footballer will be playing at a decent level for the remainder of the campaign.",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona’s women put on a show at the Alfredo Di Stéfano, leaving Real Madrid behind in a 4-0 quarter-final. The win books their place in the Copa de la Reina semifinals.\n\nAlexia Putellas opened the scoring with a towering header from a Caroline Graham Hansen corner, Ewa Pajor scored a brace, and Salma Paralluelo added another goal, with Patri Guijarro pulling the strings in midfield.\n\nThe night started rough. Heavy rain, strong wind, and a boggy pitch made passing tricky, and Madrid came out with intensity, pressing high and trying to force errors. Early interventions from Irene Paredes and Vicky López kept Barcelona afloat, but the real drama came in the 15th minute. Laia Aleixandri collided with Feller and went down clutching her knee. She had to leave on a stretcher, visibly shaken. Aïcha Camara had to come on, but the team kept rolling.\n\nThe opener arrived in the 20th minute. Alexia rose unmarked and sent a header past Misa. She celebrated with her hand to her ear, and suddenly, the game became livelier.\n\nVicky López hit the post, Clàudia Pina’s shots were blocked, and for Madrid, an Athenea del Castillo goal was correctly ruled out for offside. By halftime, Barcelona led 1-0, in a calm but commanding fashion.\n\nAfter the break, the Catalans shifted up a gear. Pajor struck a powerful shot to double the lead, then Salma finished off a perfect through ball from Patri to make it 3-0. Salma sprinted down the left and laid the ball off for Pajor, who controlled with her chest and slotted it coolly to score the fourth and final goal. By the final whistle, Barcelona had accomplished their mission and were onto the next round.\n\nThe other three teams left to compete for the cup are Atlético de Madrid, Tenerife, and Badalona Women.",

    "fullText": "Omar Marmoush has been scoring goals since returning from AFCON. He hit the back of the net in Manchester City’s recent win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Etihad. Marmoush didn’t score in City’s win over Galatasaray or in the brief time he was on the pitch last weekend in Manchester City’s 2-all draw with Tottenham. However, Marmoush bagged a brace against Newcastle United to help Manchester City book their place in this season’s Carabao Cup final with a 3-1 win over Eddie Howe’s side at the Etihad.\n\nWith Marmoush in form, City have another dangerous weapon in the final third. The Egyptian international could be a key player this weekend as Manchester City bid to beat Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday in a crucial Premier League fixture.\n\nMarmoush put in an energetic and lively display against Newcastle. His intelligent movement and interplay with his teammates helped City routinely get at Eddie Howe’s side, as did Newcastle’s approach in the first half. Omar Marmoush bagged a brace, and although both goals could be considered fortunate, the Egyptian international did the work to earn his rewards.\n\nFor Omar Marmoush’s first goal, he combined superbly with Tijjani Reijnders to get behind the Newcastle defence. Marmoush’s backheel to Reijnders and run was superb. He got lucky as his heavy first touch got away from him as Newcastle’s defender Dan Burn reached the ball before Marmoush. But Burn’s clearance hit the Egyptian international before looping over the oncoming Aaron Ramsdale to give City the lead in the seventh minute. It was a fortunate goal, but Marmoush’s movement and interplay with Reijnders created the opening.\n\nFor his second goal, Marmoush showed his goal scoring instincts. Newcastle right-back Kieran Trippier cleared an Antoine Semenyo cross in the air and Marmoush was on hand to head home. Marmoush had a brace inside half an hour and he had his rewards for his intelligent movement and predatory instincts. With Marmoush in form, City have another weapon in the final third. That could be vital for City in their next match against Liverpool.\n\nUp next for Manchester City is a crucial Premier League fixture against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. Pep Guardiola’s side sits six points behind Arsenal, who lead the league. Sunday’s match is a massive one for City, and you do sense that Pep Guardiola’s side cannot afford to drop many more points. Looking at Sunday’s match, the Liverpool defence does look to be an area of their side that City can exploit. If that is the case, Marmoush could have an important role to play at Anfield if he does start.\n\nThe movement and interplay with his teammates that Marmoush adds could unsettle Liverpool’s defence, especially if City has space to operate in the final third. Marmoush should be full of confidence after his brace against Newcastle. If he does start on Sunday, he could be a match-winner for City. Of course, that depends on whether Marmoush starts. I’d expect Erling Haaland to start against Liverpool. Whether or not Semenyo, or Marmoush, or both start with him remains to be seen.\n\nManchester City have a different dynamic in the final third with Omar Marmoush back among the goals. The Egyptian international adds variety and intelligence to City’s attacking play. Whether or not Marmoush starts on Sunday remains to be seen, but if he does, he could have a massive role to play in a huge fixture at Anfield.",

Vrabel – who was a three-time Super Bowl champion in eight seasons as a linebacker with the Patriots from 2001-08 – was asked how he will use that experience as a player to coach against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday.\n\n\"I think I always try to use every experience that I've had over the course of 30 years of experience in this league whether that's as a player as a coach to help the team and to help individual players do their job,\" Vrabel said at his Tuesday press conference.\n\n\"You only have so many opportunities to make a play,\" he said. “You have to be ready.\"\n\nVrabel took advantage of those chances as a player. Will he do the same as a coach?\n\nMORE: Revisting Mike Vrabel's time as a Patriots linebacker\n\nVrabel would become the fifth player to win the Super Bowl as a player and coach. A look at those other four individuals:\n\nFlores was a backup quarterback for the Chiefs when they won Super Bowl 4 against Minnesota. He led the Raiders to victories in Super Bowl 15 and Super Bowl 18 as a head coach. He also was an assistant under John Madden when Oakland won Super Bowl 11.\n\nDitka played in two Super Bowls for the Cowboys – who were 1-1 in those games.

As a coach,  Pederson led Philadelphia to a 41-33 victory against New England in Super Bowl 42.\n\nMORE: Inside Mike Vrabel's playoff record as a coach\n\nThree other individuals have been in the Super Bowl as a player and coach:\n\nReeves played in two Super Bowls for Dallas. He had one carry for seven yards in the 24-3 victory against Miami in Super Bowl 6. Reeves was 0-4 in the Super Bowl as a coach. He led Denver to three Super Bowl appearances (21, 22, 24) and Atlanta to one Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl 33 – a 34-19 loss to Denver.\n\nRivera played for Chicago under Ditka in Super Bowl 20 and won a championship as a player. As a coach, he led Carolina to an appearance in Super Bowl 50. The Panthers lost 24-10 to Denver.\n\nKubiak was a backup quarterback for John Elway in three Super Bowl losses (21, 22, 24) and he was an assistant coach in three Super Bowl victories (29, 32, 33). Kubiak led Denver to the Super Bowl 50 victory against Carolina.\n\nMORE: Complete coaching timeline for Mike Vrabel, from Ohio State to Patriots\n\nVrabel played in four Super Bowls with the Patriots and won three Super Bowls as a player.

    "fullText": "Another pivotal Premier League gameweek awaits, with several sides locked in relegation battles and crucial clashes shaping the title race.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester City headline the round in a fixture that could significantly impact Arsenal’s advantage at the top.\n\nManchester United will look to continue their resurgence under interim boss Michael Carrick, while Spurs aim to halt their inconsistency.\n\nAt the bottom end, multiple six-pointers offer teams a chance to create daylight between themselves and the drop zone. With form fluctuating across the table, this gameweek promises tension, drama, and fine margins.\n\nLeeds will be hopeful of delivering a much-improved performance after a disappointing 4–0 defeat to Arsenal last week.\n\nThe Whites must be sharper in front of goal and defensively disciplined if they are to get a result against Nottingham Forest.\n\nForest were unable to capitalise against an out-of-sorts Crystal Palace side dealing with off-field issues.\n\nWith both teams level on 26 points, this clash represents a potential six-pointer in the relegation battle and should make for a tense encounter.\n\nJaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha are doubts for Leeds, while Anton Stach is ruled out. James Justin has made a full recovery and is expected to be available.\n\nFor Forest, Matz Sels and Callum Hudson-Odoi are doubts, while Neco Williams is suspended.\n\nA last-minute strike from Benjamin Šeško earned Manchester United their third consecutive win since Michael Carrick took charge as interim manager.\n\nThe Red Devils have found their rhythm in attack while maintaining defensive discipline, making them favourites to extend their unbeaten run to six matches when Spurs visit Old Trafford.\n\nTottenham showed resilience by coming back from two goals down against Manchester City last week. Improved second-half performances saw Dominic Solanke score twice to rescue a point.\n\nThat level of intensity will be required again if Spurs are to trouble Carrick’s side.\n\nMicky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, and Dominic Solanke have all been passed fit, while Djed Spence is a doubt.\n\nArsenal will be keen to secure all three points after an entertaining draw in the reverse fixture at the Stadium of Light.\n\nThe Gunners returned to winning ways by dismantling Leeds last week, extending their lead at the top of the table to six points.\n\nThey also booked their place in the League Cup final by completing a semi-final double over Chelsea at the Emirates.\n\nSunderland picked up an important victory against Burnley last week to move back into the top half of the table. It was just the Black Cats’ second win in five games.\n\nMartin Ødegaard is a doubt for Arsenal, while Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino are ruled out through injury.\n\nBournemouth secured a routine 2–0 win over Wolves last week, making it three wins in their last four matches and four games unbeaten.\n\nThe Cherries appear to have adjusted well following Antoine Semenyo’s departure.\n\nAston Villa, meanwhile, were frustrated in a goalless draw against 10-man Brentford despite playing with a numerical advantage from the 42nd minute.\n\nThe dropped points saw Villa fall one point behind second-placed Manchester City and seven behind leaders Arsenal. David Brooks is a doubt for Bournemouth, while Ollie Watkins is a doubt for Villa.\n\nThis is a clash between 18th and 19th on the league table. Burnley failed to extend their unbeaten run to four matches after a tepid 3–0 defeat to Sunderland.\n\nThe Clarets’ performance was disappointing, and Scott Parker will demand a significant response.\n\nWest Ham suffered a second-half collapse last week, surrendering a two-goal lead against Chelsea.\n\nDespite that setback, the Hammers come into this clash as slight favourites based on recent performances. Jean-Clair Todibo remains suspended.\n\nFulham’s defensive frailties were exposed last week when Manchester United snatched all three points courtesy of a last-minute Šeško winner.\n\nPrior to that goal, the Cottagers had shown resilience by fighting back from two goals down to level the match deep into stoppage time.\n\nUnlike Fulham, Everton were beneficiaries of late drama, with Beto scoring in the 97th minute to rescue a point against Brighton.\n\nThe result extended the Toffees’ unbeaten run to four games and lifted them into the top half of the table.\n\nWolves’ brief resurgence has come to an abrupt end following back-to-back defeats.\n\nRob Edwards’ side looked devoid of ideas in their loss to Bournemouth and could face a tough afternoon when Chelsea visit Molineux. Ladislav Krejčí is a slight doubt.\n\nChelsea will be eager to bounce back from their League Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal.\n\nThe Blues have won their last three league matches, with Enzo Fernández and João Pedro shouldering the attacking burden.\n\nFilip Jørgensen, Reece James, and Pedro Neto are doubts, while Jamie Gittens is ruled out long-term with a hamstring injury.\n\nNewcastle exited the League Cup after a heavy 5–1 aggregate defeat to Manchester City.\n\nThe Magpies have also struggled in the league, failing to win any of their last three matches, and European qualification now looks unlikely.\n\nBruno Guimarães and Lewis Miley are doubts, while Anthony Gordon is ruled out with a hamstring injury.\n\nBrentford showed immense resilience to secure a 1–0 win over Aston Villa despite playing more than half the match with ten men. The victory moved the Bees to within five points of fourth-placed Manchester United.\n\nBrighton will be without Yasin Ayari due to a shoulder injury, but Diego Gómez has been passed fit.\n\nThe Seagulls were denied victory by a late Everton equaliser last week, extending their winless run to four matches.\n\nCrystal Palace earned just their second point in five games with a 1–1 draw against Nottingham Forest.\n\nOngoing off-field issues appear to be affecting performances, with the Eagles now sitting 15th, nine points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nLiverpool host Manchester City in the standout fixture of the gameweek at Anfield.\n\nThe Reds will be seeking revenge after a 3–0 defeat in the reverse fixture and will take confidence from their emphatic 4–1 win over Newcastle last week.\n\nJeremie Frimpong remains sidelined, while Joe Gomez faces a late fitness test.\n\nManchester City need a win to keep pace with Arsenal in the title race. Pep Guardiola’s side have won just one of their last five league matches and now sit six points behind the leaders.\n\nA second-half collapse against Spurs last week highlighted recent inconsistencies. Rúben Dias is ruled out, while Bernardo Silva is a doubt.",

    "description": "New court filing sheds considerable light on Gruden's four-year-old civil action.",
    "fullText": "Former Buccaneers and Raiders coach Jon Gruden's lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell continues. And, as Gruden sees it, the potential financial damages will be very significant.\n\nIn a Case Conference Report filed on Wednesday, February 5, Gruden's lawyers revealed that his losses \"total well over $150,000,000.\" The damages flow from, per the Case Conference Report, \"loss of his employment, interference with future employment opportunities, loss of contract value, loss of sponsorships, reputational damage, costs, expert fees, and attorney fees incurred as a result of this dispute.\"\n\nGruden filed the lawsuit roughly a month after his forced resignation from the Raiders, following reports from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times containing emails Gruden had sent and received while employed by ESPN. Those emails had been harvested as part of an investigation regarding the Washington Commanders and former owner Daniel Snyder. Gruden contends that the emails were leaked with the specific goal of prompting the termination of his employment.\n\nThe Case Conference Report was prepared following an \"early case conference\" in which the NFL declined to participate. The league, we're told, contends that discovery in the case has been stayed pending the appeal of a denial of a motion to dismiss under the Nevada anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nIn the Case Conference Report, a copy of which PFT has obtained and reviewed, Gruden's lawyers list in the form of mandatory disclosures the potential witnesses in the case. They include: Goodell, various attorneys from the Paul Weiss law firm, former NFL general counsel Jeff Pash, chief NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, Snyder, former Raiders general counsel Dan Ventrelle, Raiders owner Mark Davis, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, attorney Beth Wilkinson, various attorneys from the Reed Smith firm, Desiree Perez of Roc Nation, former NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith, and Gruden.\n\nThe Case Conference Report does not expressly indicate that any, some, or all of these individuals listed will be deposed by Gruden's lawyers, and it does not mention any current attempts to compel their deposition testimony.\n\nThe Case Conference Report lists several specific NFL teams that have potentially relevant information: the Commanders, Raiders, Cowboys, Patriots, Seahawks, Giants, Jets, and Dolphins. It does not identify any of the reporters from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.\n\nIn a separate portion of the Case Conference Report, Gruden's lawyers list various documents that they contend the NFL should disclose \"immediately.\" The documents include all 650,000 documents generated during Wilkinson's investigation of the Commanders and a so-called \"'Blackmail Powerpoint' presented by Daniel Snyder and/or Reed Smith to the NFL Defendants, containing communications by Roger Goodell and Jeff Pash.\"\n\nThe Case Conference Report also states that no settlement discussions have occurred.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the NFL has filed, or plans to file, a petition for appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the question of whether Gruden should be required to pursue his claims through arbitration controlled by the NFL.\n\nThe case has been pending for more than four years, due mainly to the preliminary skirmishes regarding the arbitration question. At some point, depositions will occur and documents will be obtained — unless the case is dismissed or settled.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Clippers were one of the hottest teams in the NBA heading into the trade deadline, and nobody saw what came next.\n\nAfter rattling off a 16-3 stretch that pulled them from the bottom of the Western Conference standings all the way into play-in position, the front office decided to blow it up.\n\nIn the span of just a few days, the Clippers moved their second- and third-best players, James Harden and Ivica Zubac, turning what looked like a late-season push into a full-blown rebuild on the fly.\n\nThe Clippers now sit at 23-27 on the season and are left with more questions than answers as they head into All-Star Weekend as the host team at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe first domino fell on Tuesday when the Clippers sent 11-time All-Star James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for two-time All-Star Darius Garland and a second-round pick.\n\nHarden had been the engine that kept Los Angeles afloat all season, averaging 25.4 points and 8.1 assists per game while carrying the team through a brutal 6-21 start.\n\nHe was having his best scoring season in six years, so the move caught almost everyone off guard.\n\nBREAKING: The Los Angeles Clippers are trading James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Darius Garland and a second-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Prolific swap of the star point guards. pic.twitter.com/IHhhhabJnX\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 4, 2026\n\nFor the Clippers, though, it was about looking ahead.\n\nGarland is 10 years younger than Harden and is locked into a long-term deal that runs through 2028-29.\n\nHe is recovering from a toe injury that has kept him out since January 14, but when healthy he is a strong scorer and playmaker who averaged 20.6 points and 6.7 assists last season.\n\nClippers president Lawrence Frank said the team is \"trying to get younger while continuing to win,\" and Garland fits that goal on both ends.\n\nThe Clippers were not done there. On Thursday, they sent starting center Ivica Zubac and forward Kobe Brown to the Indiana Pacers in a deal that brought back a big haul of young talent and draft picks.\n\nLos Angeles received Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, two first-round picks and a second-round pick in return.\n\nFULL TRADE DETAILS:\n\nPacers receive:\nIvica Zubac\nKobe Brown\n\nClippers receive:\nBenedict Mathurin\nIsaiah Jackson\n2 1st-round picks\n2nd-round pick pic.twitter.com/iCAvemn9ls\n\n— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) February 5, 2026\n\nZubac had been the longest-tenured Clipper on the roster, having joined the team back in 2019 after being traded from the cross-town rival Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe was putting up 14.4 points and 11.0 rebounds per game this season while shooting over 61 percent from the floor, and he was coming off a career year in 2024-25 that earned him All-Defensive Second Team honors.\n\nThe centerpiece coming back is Mathurin, a 23-year-old wing who has been averaging 17.8 points per game this season and gives Los Angeles the kind of young scoring talent they will need going forward.\n\nThe draft capital is a big part of this, too. The Pacers' 2026 first-round pick is protected 1-4 and 10-30, which means the Clippers only get it if it falls between the fifth and ninth picks.\n\nIndiana currently has one of the worst records in the league, so there is close to a coin flip chance it lands in that range. If it does not, it turns into an unprotected 2031 first-rounder from Indiana, and the Clippers also picked up an unprotected 2029 first from the Pacers.\n\nWhat makes the timing so shocking is that the Clippers had just gone on that incredible 16-3 run and seemed to have real momentum going.\n\nThe Clippers pivoted HARD and turned James Harden and Ivica Zubac into:\n\n- Darius Garland\n- Bennedict Mathurin\n- Two first-round picks, including a potential lottery pick.\n\nHats off to the front office.\n\n— Grant \"Money\" Mona (@Gmona48) February 5, 2026\n\nThey had the oldest roster in the NBA this season with six core players aged 31 or older, and the front office clearly decided that a possible first-round exit in the playoffs was not worth passing up the chance to get younger and stockpile assets.\n\nKawhi Leonard will remain with the team for now, but his future in Los Angeles will be a major talking point this offseason.\n\nFor a franchise that came into the year swinging for the fences with a veteran-heavy roster, this was a pivot that nobody expected, and the ripple effects will be felt for years to come.\n\nFor now, though, it is a new era in Inglewood.",

    "fullText": "World Skeleton champion Shelley Rudman was the star of Team GB Winter Olympics back in 2006 when she was the only one to return with a medal, creating a fever in her Wiltshire village which is still felt by some today.\n\nAs this year's Winter Olympics kicks off in northern Italy, Rudman said she would never have guessed the lasting legacy that bringing home the silver medal would have on Pewsey, where she was born and still lives.\n\nTwo streets are now named after her, Olympic Road and Silver Road, which she says makes her children very proud.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal, my children love the fact they are named after me,\" Rudman added.\n\nVillagers were invested in her success from the start. They played a key role in fundraising to send her to Turin to compete on the ice, and still proudly remember their involvement.\n\nOne of them being Emma Dainton, who along with Colin Harris, canoed a 35-mile route from Pewsey to Bath along the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n\nEmma said: \"It was so quiet on the canal until a swan chased us for a while, and we joked about it and we cheered each other on.\"\n\nDuring the Games, Emma was travelling in Australia and watched the heats on TV with her fellow backpackers.\n\n\"I told them all about Shelley and how I was part of her fundraising team and she was from my village,\" she added.\n\nBack at home, nothing could prepare landlord Jerry Kunkler for the world's media and fans cramming into his Moonrakers pub.\n\n\"My phone kept ringing and ringing, all the local and national media wanted to come to the pub, it was all happening.\n\n\"I had to get up early for breakfast TV and was able to talk to Shelley live from Turin. It was a whirlwind,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Games, Shelley was greeted by a champion's welcome when she arrived home.\n\nLocal newspaper reporter Nigel Kerton organised an open-top bus parade to travel through the village.\n\nNigel recalls how he phoned a bus company to see if it was possible.\n\n\"I had a dream for this to happen. You see football teams do it after cup finals, so why not for Shelley.\n\n\"It left the train station and we could see the crowds building. There must have been thousands there,\" he added.\n\nShelley said she was in disbelief when she returned home and saw how many people had turned up to cheer her home.\n\n\"There were so many friends from school I recognised and just people I saw around the village,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she will always feel grateful to those that supported her and the strong community that Pewsey still has today.\n\n\"It is just stunning around here, there's a great community spirit. I always appreciate what they did for me,\" she added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "fullText": "Wasteful. Disjointed. Beatable. These are not words typically associated with Sonia Bompastor’s Chelsea squad.\n\nThis is the team who bulldozed their way to a domestic treble last season, collecting a record-high Women’s Super League points tally of 60 (from 22 games) along the way. Until December, they were on the longest unbeaten run in league history at 34 matches.\n\nAnd yet, by losing 2-0 to Arsenal at home on January 24 and 5-1 at Manchester City on Sunday, they have made unwanted history.\n\nChelsea had not lost consecutive WSL matches since 2015, a marker of how high their standards have been, but also of how unprecedented the current situation is.\n\nThere were no major departures from the playing squad or coaching staff over the summer. Yes, there have been injuries, but any other WSL manager would still jump at the chance to manage a squad of the quality Bompastor has available.\n\nSo what has changed on the pitch to leave Chelsea vulnerable?\n\nThe main tactical change from last season has been Bompastor’s increased use of a defensive line formed of three centre-backs and two wing-backs.\n\n“It’s more about being unpredictable and being able to play with different systems,” Bompastor said after the first game of the season in September. “I think it brings some good in possession of the ball, some good control, being able to play back three.”\n\nIt is important to note that Bompastor views her setup as a back three, not five. She deploys wing-backs Ellie Carpenter and Sandy Baltimore with heavy attacking involvement, the aim being to add two more wide threats in the final third of the pitch rather than two more defensive bodies.\n\nThe problem with this shape is not that it leaves Chelsea bottom-heavy, but that it leaves them light in the middle.\n\nAttacking full-backs are an aspect of their game that has been increasingly emphasised since Carpenter arrived from French side Lyon, where she played under Bompastor for three seasons, in the summer. The Australian and Baltimore are crucial to Chelsea’s ball progression, and in build-up they tend to move high and wide to try to create overloads on the wings.\n\nWhen they get free, it can yield excellent results — see Carpenter’s superb overlapping run for her goal against Barcelona — but that build-up shape leaves the midfield light.\n\nWith Baltimore and Carpenter playing these advanced roles, the back three often remain deep to provide stability while the midfielders move higher and wider to create combinations with the wing-backs, leaving a gap between Chelsea’s lines for opponents to exploit.\n\nBelow, as Chelsea try to build from the back against Arsenal, Guro Reiten has stepped into the forward line and Wieke Kaptein has also moved up to offer support to Carpenter. Erin Cuthbert is the only holding midfielder, stationed in front of the back three.\n\nAfter Chelsea striker Sam Kerr loses the ball, Arsenal quickly have an overload and can play wide to Beth Mead, who scores the opening goal of that recent 2-0 win.\n\nPart of the problem here is that Baltimore’s advanced position grants Mead space — but in the build-up to the second goal that day, we see how even with all five defensive players back, the way the Chelsea team are set up leaves too much space in the midfield.\n\nAs Arsenal striker Alessia Russo receives a long pass from Katie McCabe, the support runners bypass Reiten, Cuthbert and Keira Walsh to invade the space in front of the Chelsea defensive line.\n\nIf anything, a Chelsea formation some of their fans say is too negative has left them vulnerable by creating gaps in front of their defensive line.\n\nThey are considerably more susceptible to conceding chances on the break this season, as this chart shows:\n\nBompastor said in October that an increase in expected goals (xG) conceded was related to wanting to take “more risks”.\n\nChelsea’s defensive quality means that opponents have not punished their vulnerability most of the time; in the first half of this season, they conceded six goals, the same as in the same period of their title-winning 2024-25 campaign and the lowest figure in the league. Until the seven goals they shipped in losing against Arsenal and Manchester City, the risks in Bompastor’s setup were not backfiring defensively, but the gamble was not paying off in attack.\n\nBompastor has acknowledged multiple times that her side’s failure to put their chances away is costing them.\n\nThe chart below shows how Chelsea’s output has fallen far below expectations based on the chances they have been generating.\n\nThe 1-0 defeat to Everton in December that ended their 34-match unbeaten run was the pinnacle of this — only six of their 30 Chelsea shots in that game were on target.\n\nPart of that is due to injuries.\n\nChelsea have not had an in-form centre-forward: Mayra Ramirez has not featured this season following hamstring surgery in September and will remain out having picked up a calf issue this week, Kerr has not been her previous clinical self since returning that same month after more than a year out recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her knee, and Aggie Beever-Jones and Catarina Macario have had sporadic fitness problems that have limited their output.\n\nWas Bompastor right to hint on Sunday that she would have liked more backing in the summer transfer market? The headline signings of Carpenter and forward Alyssa Thompson mean fans elsewhere in the WSL are unlikely to have much sympathy, but there are other areas where strengthening might have been prudent.\n\nChelsea’s attacks have felt characterised by the pace of Carpenter, Baltimore and Thompson, but been lacking the central creativity to balance them out. Perhaps nobody can match Lauren James’ quality when fit, but they need a deputy to cover for her frequent injuries. Kaptein’s transition into a more attacking role has been impressive, but that is still a work in progress.\n\nIn suffering issues with Kerr, Ramirez, Beever-Jones and Macario, Chelsea have been unlucky in the centre-forward department. That is perhaps an area they could have bought in January to refresh a forward line lacking in confidence. They have historically shown willingness to react in that window — Ramirez was brought in for a then-world record fee after Kerr tore her ACL in January 2024. However, it could be that the number of strikers already on their books made the club more reluctant to splash out again.\n\nStill, Bompastor has a squad of enormous experience and quality to draw on. These players should be more than capable of working with her to solve these tactical issues.\n\nA seventh straight WSL title may be inching out of their reach with City taking prime position, but there are still three other trophies to fight for at home and in Europe this season and if Bompastor can restore Chelsea’s missing confidence, there is no reason they cannot lift them.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "There are going to be some big names up for Hall of Fame consideration next year.",
    "fullText": "The Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2026 was a competitive one, with Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly, Adam Vinatieri and Roger Craig earning enshrinement. Among those left out: Bill Belichick and Eli Manning.\n\n2027 could be even more competitive. Belichick and Manning be back on the ballot — alongside other 2026 finalists like Frank Gore, Torry Holt and Marshal Yanda — and there will also be a large number of first-time candidates deserving of consideration.\n\nHere are 10 players whose last NFL appearance was in the 2021-22 season.\n\nOne of a few acceptable answers to the question, \"Who is the greatest tight end of all time?\"\n\nNo player caught more passes or posted more receiving yards from Tom Brady than Gronkowski, who was also one of the best blockers at his position and a larger-than-life personality. The only thing that ever limited \"Gronk\" was injuries. When healthy, he was an unstoppable weapon in the hands of some of the NFL's best minds.\n\nThe last running back to win NFL MVP was AD, who sits at fifth in the NFL's all-time rushing list and is one of nine players in history to post 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He came only eight yards short of breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season record in 2012-13.\n\nPeterson was a star from his first snap and kept going until his mid-30s.\n\nThe loudest member of the Legion of Boom was also the best. Sherman made the switch from wide receiver to cornerback in high school and waited until the fifth round of the 2011 NFL Draft to hear his name called.\n\nOne of the largest corners in the league at 6-foot-3 and 195 pounds, Sherman became a paradigm-shifting defensive back in the Seahawks' system and was a central component of their Super Bowl XLVIII team. He was an all-time trash-talker who earned it, regularly shutting down his side of the field.\n\nAside from Manning, the system is usually kind to two-time Super Bowl champion quarterbacks. Roethlisberger's first ring was more a product of Jerome Bettis and the Pittsburgh Steelers defense in his sophomore season, but was overall one of the NFL's most prolific quarterbacks during his 18-year career.\n\nBig Ben retired as the all-time leading passer for one of the NFL's most storied franchises. However, a pair of sexual assault allegations from earlier in his career loomed over his achievements, and there's no telling how that could play out if Spygate was enough to get Bill Belichick off some people's ballots.\n\nOur second of three Steelers offensive stars is also the most mercurial, to put it politely. Brown was on track for an overwhelming case when he turned 30 and still had a standout career, ranking behind only Hines Ward on the Steelers' all-time receiving list.\n\nAnd yet, few stars have crashed out of the NFL as loudly as Brown did, first with the Oakland Raiders, then the New England Patriots, then the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He rose from the sixth round of the 2010 Draft to do some amazing things on the field, but he's going to be remembered for much more than that.\n\nThe third of the Killer B's likely faces the longest odds, considering how short his prime ended up being. Bell was one of the NFL's top backs as a runner and receiver, but an ugly divorce from the Steelers saw him sit out a season then land with the New York Jets. He was never the same after that.\n\nNewton not making the College Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility despite posting one of the greatest seasons in the sport's history was a Belichick-style puzzler. His NFL career was a standout too.\n\nNewton led the 2015-16 Carolina Panthers to a 15-1 record and the Super Bowl, demanding attention every time he stood on the field. Injuries derailed what could have been a strong second act, though, especially with so many other quarterbacks vying for enshrinement.\n\nOffensive linemen usually don't get their due, but Whitworth earned his right to be an exemption with a 16-year career as a dependable blind-side blocker for the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams. He went out on top with the latter against the former at Super Bowl LVI, alongside...\n\nWeddle spent a solid decade as one of the NFL's top safeties for the San Diego Chargers and Baltimore Ravens, earning six Pro Bowl nods and hauling in 29 interceptions in his career. He had a strong case when he first retired in 2020, but his return to the Rams in 2021-22 postseason after a pair of devastating injuries was one of the biggest stories of their Super Bowl title, especially when he didn't let a pec tear stop him from playing every defensive snap.\n\nMack was arguably the best center of the 2010s, earning seven Pro Bowl nods for the Cleveland Browns, Atlanta Falcons and San Francisco 49ers. Between him and Joe Thomas, the Browns had two of the best in the league anchoring their offensive line for seven years, and he helped lead the Falcons to the ill-fated Super Bowl LI with the Falcons.",

    "fullText": "“It makes me sad that women’s football is sexualised and disrespected,” read Liverpool midfielder Marie Hobinger’s victim statement. “No woman, no matter her job, should have to put up with this type of behaviour.”\n\nMangal Dalal, 42, contacted Hobinger, 24, via social media before waiting for her at the side of the pitch after Liverpool’s away game against Manchester City in February 2025. He was handed a two-year restraining order and sentenced to 18 months of community service in January after pleading guilty to stalking the Austria international.\n\nThis is only one example that highlights the growing concerns around the safety of Women’s Super League (WSL) footballers. “There is that fear among players that it could happen to anyone,” Fern Whelan, women’s football equality, diversity and inclusion executive for the Professional Footballers’ Association, tells The Athletic.\n\nDuring the 2025 European Championship, England and Gotham defender Jess Carter spoke out about the racist abuse she received on the internet, later telling the BBC she feared leaving the team hotel. A 60-year-old man pleaded guilty to malicious communications in January. Mark Roberts, the national lead for football policing, called the comments “appalling”.\n\nAt the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, when England reached the final, the Lionesses received fan mail from Australia that contained death threats. The UK football policing unit (UKFPU) conducted a joint investigation, including forensics, with Australian police, but as yet, nobody has been charged.\n\nIn January, Arsenal deleted a video on X and turned comments off on Instagram of new signing Smilla Holmberg promoting ticket sales because of inappropriate sexualised and misogynistic comments. Tottenham Hotspur also turned comments off on their X post announcing the arrival of Matilda Nilden, 19, for the same reason. Some of the replies asked X’s artificial intelligence tool Grok to produce sexualised images of the player.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement for Matilda Nildén to join us from BK Häcken in January, 2026 ✍️\n\n🗞️ https://t.co/bLC1QvkmsS pic.twitter.com/xPUfesurS2\n\n— Tottenham Hotspur Women (@SpursWomen) December 31, 2025\n\n“It is really worrying,” says Whelan. “It’s difficult to manage unless it is stopped at source.”\n\nSome players have spoken about their fear of staying in their own homes after receiving rape and death threats online, Whelan told a Women and Equalities Committee held in the UK Parliament in October. Online abuse of women players, she said, has become “alarmingly worse” and “catapulted” since 2024 to the point where it is becoming “dangerous”.\n\nOther areas of concern for players include the control and management of access on matchdays, their safety when off duty, and the amount of contact they have with fans and the general public via social media.\n\nSome player representatives have put preventative measures in place, such as limiting the number of private drivers who can take a player home, to reduce how widely their addresses are known. Another noted that their players expressed no concern at all about their safety.\n\nThe UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on football has recently launched an inquiry into online harms across the men’s and women’s games. “We are clear that the women’s game faces some specific and heightened risks,” said Fair Game, secretariat to the Football APPG.\n\nThe Athletic has spoken to stakeholders within the game, including WSL Football, which oversees the top two tiers of women’s football in England; data science company Signify; and the PFA and the UKFPU to investigate how safe WSL players feel. The English Football Association was approached for comment, as were all WSL clubs.\n\nIn some incidents detailed below, clubs in question remain anonymous to respect the confidentiality of their security arrangements.\n\nThe message may read: “I know where you park your car”, “I know what car you drive”, or “I know where you live”. Whether genuine or not, such messages force players to judge the level of threat.\n\nWomen’s football is in a period of generational transition. The increased investment and global broadcast exposure have seen a fundamental shift in the game’s profile, especially in England, following the Lionesses’ consecutive European triumphs in 2022 and 2025. All publicity, however, is not good publicity.\n\nHistorically, women’s football has leaned into accessibility — players signing autographs, taking photos and engaging closely with supporters. As the game’s profile has grown, that openness has created tension between connection and safety.\n\n“It is becoming increasingly difficult for elite-level women’s players to embrace fan access to the same levels as has been the case historically,” says Jonathan Sebire, co-founder at Signify, which works across multiple sports and with several WSL clubs to collect, triage and assess the threat online abuse poses to players.\n\nThe majority of online abuse players receive contains sexual elements, according to Signify, including sexualised content of the individual player or their partner. Other categories of online abuse include racist and violent threats, the latter of which often contains a sexualised element. Some abuse, particularly from male online users, centres on the quality of the women’s game, but there is another concern, says Signify, that has increased far more rapidly.\n\n“One of the fundamental differences in the women’s game is there are openly gay players, some of whom are in relationships with other footballers, some of whom are at the same club,” says Sebire.\n\n“We see a large number of young women who look up to these players because of their sexuality. They’re seen as openly gay icons and role models in the sport. It starts with a level of fandom that has sometimes tipped over into fixation, infatuation and developed into something more problematic.”\n\nSuch behaviour is not exclusively linked to sexuality, but most cases known directly to Signify fall into this category.\n\nIn some rare instances, but increasing in occurrence, people have followed players around supermarkets and visited the same bars or restaurants as them. Contact can start online and move offline or vice versa. For example, players have reported people making contact via direct messages online and then seeing them appear in their local surroundings.\n\n“It’s not uncommon,” says Sebire. “If you speak to a group of players, some will almost certainly have experienced it.”\n\nSignify observes that often the behaviour does not involve physical contact or direct interaction. Instead, it centres on attempts to create the appearance of a relationship for others to see — for example, by taking selfies of themselves with players in the background. They then message players later online to suggest a personal connection.\n\n“If they’re doing that every week, that has become an infatuation,” says Sebire. “In most cases, when the club or police warn them and tell them this behaviour is problematic, it stops because they are shocked it has been noticed and received in that way.”\n\nIn other extreme cases, players have suspected a person was tracking their car’s movements, as they appeared wherever the players went. Clubs have sanctioned season-ticket holders, and law enforcement agencies have carried out risk assessments in response.\n\nThe answer, though, is not for women players to simply abstain from social media. “It is not their responsibility; they are just doing their jobs,” says Whelan.\n\nMany women’s players, after all, earn significantly more through off-field commercial deals than via playing contracts. Social media is a critical tool for connecting with fans, building personal profiles, and securing sponsorship income.\n\nIt is also far more likely that women’s players still run their own social media accounts, whereas in the men’s game, certainly among Premier League stars, others tend to manage players’ online profiles. According to Sebire, that is something that needs to and is starting to change.\n\nIt is also very different for a WSL player, who may live a relatively ‘normal’ life, to receive a threatening message than perhaps a Premier League footballer who lives in a house with significant security provisions and perhaps access to a private chef or barber. Premier League clubs also have established onboarding processes for their players, with, for example, security briefings including dedicated services for players’ properties.\n\nThat does not negate the impact of online abuse for a men’s player, but it is important context to consider, even if some WSL players are now household names.\n\n“In some clubs, the infrastructure around women’s teams’ safety is catching up with the men’s game,” says Sebire. “But it has not been universal. Those are fundamentals that have to change for women’s players to feel safe.”\n\nThe nature of the online abuse suffered by women’s players is often different, too. Unlike violent or racist abuse, it does not necessarily fit into a clearly defined category with reporting mechanisms, policies and consequences.\n\nThe Online Safety Act, fully enforced as of 2025, means OFCOM, the UK’s independent regulator for the communications industries, can take action against social media platforms, including removing content or working with law enforcement. But there are nuances to the women’s game that need to be considered.\n\nSome platforms do not recognise a lot of the abuse and threat directed at women because universal language, such as “kitchen” — referring, for example, to the misogynistic phrase ‘Get back in the kitchen’ — is repurposed or not seen as harmful without the necessary context.\n\nThe AI tool Grok is another example. X has now prevented Grok from being used to edit images of real people in revealing clothing after OFCOM launched an investigation in January. The public body Sport England decided to stop using X last month to stay true to its values of the “mission is to ensure sport and physical activity are safe and inclusive for everyone,” it said in a statement. WSL Football had already scaled back its use of X, and some WSL clubs have said they continue to monitor the situation.\n\nAnother growing pain for WSL clubs is the contrast between playing games at the women’s home grounds and the main club’s stadia.\n\nIt is easier for the club to use the same security infrastructure at a Premier League ground when their women’s team plays there, but when switching to smaller grounds, there are different security measures around the pitch, players’ entrance, or car park.\n\n“It’s safer in general to be at the Emirates,” England captain and Arsenal defender Leah Williamson told the New Statesman in December. “You’re more accessible. It’s a five-metre difference (between the players and fans).”\n\nSome players have reported concerns of being repeatedly approached by the same people outside stadiums and hassled as they approach their cars.\n\n“If players make themselves accessible signing autographs in the ground with stewards but are approached once they leave the ground, when do they say: ‘No, this isn’t appropriate?” asks one person. “That feels like an invasion of space.”\n\nSupporter interaction has become increasingly challenging as attendances have increased. WSL Football, WSL clubs and the English Football Association are trying to balance maintaining the game’s unique atmosphere and sense of community while grappling with a rapidly changing landscape.\n\nAhead of the 2024-2025 season, Chelsea changed their player access rules before and after games, citing it was “no longer safe or sustainable” for players to sign autographs or take selfies “in an uncontrolled way”. Many clubs followed suit. Some now have more organised meet-and-greets with season-ticket holders in a controlled environment, while others have close-protection officers pitchside. When on England duty, players walk around the pitch after games but do not stop and sign autographs.\n\n“It would be a shame if it got shut down to the extent that the men’s game has,” says Sebire. “But the risk is there.”\n\nClubs are taking player safety seriously, according to numerous people, and are investing to try to keep players safe. “Everybody is just trying to find a way through,” comments one observer.\n\nWSL Football’s safeguarding standards require that each “club ensures that physical and online environments promote safety and wellbeing while minimising the opportunity for children, adults at risk and players to be harmed and/or exposed to harmful or inappropriate behaviour, materials or content”.\n\nEach club undertakes its own risk assessments and all clubs in the top two leagues have a nominated police officer. WSL Football has its own safety and security working group and regularly engages with the UKFPU and clubs via monthly safety officer meetings.\n\nThe FA and several WSL clubs, including Arsenal, Chelsea, London City Lionesses, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, say they have robust security provisions and educational resources. Some employ dedicated safeguarding, player care and close-protection measures, alongside partnerships with external monitoring firms, while others have players escorted at matches and events, administer online safety training, and have formal reporting routes.\n\nThe biggest barrier to prosecution a few years ago was obtaining player statements. “With the national teams, we’ve certainly broken through that,” Chief Constable for Cheshire Police Mark Roberts tells The Athletic.\n\nNow, the UKFPU prepares players by explaining the reporting process proactively, and before tournaments, officers conduct security briefings and education sessions with the England team to offer advice regarding security and online abuse.\n\n“Don’t just delete it, try to keep it,” says Roberts. “We’ll capture it, try to identify the person, ask for a statement, and give the player support. It’s the shock of receiving something and making sure they know what to do. If you debunk the system, hopefully it makes it easier for people to come forward.”\n\nSignify has found that in some of their education sessions, players may understandably find it embarrassing to talk about their experiences, whether it’s the content of the material or that it has affected them. Often, individuals report incidents in private after group sessions.\n\n“If anything is happening in places that no one else can see, tell someone about it because you shouldn’t be dealing with this on your own,” says Sebire. “It’s not OK.”\n\nNikki Doucet, CEO of WSL Football, has spoken with Meta’s global head of safety and the Women’s National Basketball Association about the tools they use. She recently met at UK Parliament with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s Women’s Sport Taskforce, hosted by minister Stephanie Peacock, alongside representatives from OFCOM, the police, and other sports leaders to discuss protections for sportswomen online.\n\n“It is top of the PFA’s agenda, including pushing the clubs to see how we can protect the players better,” says Whelan, adding that online abuse is a “massive barrier” to participation for many young girls and parents.\n\n“It is not football that is the problem; it is the perpetrators behind it all,” she adds. “We have to make sure the people who are looking after the footballers are taking it really seriously. I would hate for it to come to a point where those threats become reality, and then we act.\n\n“Everyone is working hard behind the scenes to find a solution. Clubs are aware of the concerns the players have raised. There is a real shift; players are not going to stand for this. The more we see perpetrators held to account, the more they are emboldened.”\n\nAdditional reporting: Philip Buckingham\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, England, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "After conceding four consecutive scores to open the game, the Los Angeles Kings went on to fall 4-1 at the hands of the Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday evening at T-Mobile Arena. They head into the Olympic break on a three-game skid, currently three points out of a Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nVegas, which heads into the break atop the Pacific Division, set a major tone in the first period. After a quiet opening eight minutes from both sides, Jack Eichel, Mark Stone, Pavel Dorofeyev and Mitch Marner all scored for the Golden Knights within five and a half minutes of each other.\n\nThe @GoldenKnights aren't messing around tonight. 👁️👁️\n\nThey're up 4-0 in the first period! pic.twitter.com/ohjiGNYNAc\n\nTrevor Moore managed to get one back for the Kings at the 15:03 mark of the period, providing their only tally of the night. It was his seventh score of the year and first point since Jan. 24.\n\nMoorezy! pic.twitter.com/TscLE09oso\n\n— LA Kings (@LAKings) February 6, 2026\n\nAnze Kopitar earned his 16th assist of the year on the play to reach 1,300 career points. He becomes just the 39th player in league history to achieve the milestone and only the eighth born outside of North America to do so.\n\nLos Angeles proved otherwise ineffective against Golden Knights' netminder Adin Hill, who saved 32 shots en route to the 100th win of his career. It was the first victory for the nine-year veteran against the Kings in a Knights uniform.\n\nOn the other side of the ice, Anton Forsberg fell to 9-7-5 as his struggles in Las Vegas continue to linger. Across two road starts against the Golden Knights this season, he has allowed nine combined goals, representing two of his three highest goal totals surrendered to opponents this season.\n\nThe Kings were forced to hold their breath regarding the status of Andrei Kuzmenko, who took an inadvertent puck to the face late in the first period of Saturday's loss. He seemed to skate off the ice in a state of discomfort, but was eventually able to return to the contest midway through the second period.\n\nAndrei Kuzmenko leaves the game after taking a redirected puck to the face. pic.twitter.com/b6ZyoANJSU\n\n— Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) February 6, 2026\n\nRecent blockbuster trade acquisition Artemi Panarin was not in the lineup for Los Angeles and is not expected to make his debut with the squad until after the break. He will begin practicing with the team on Feb. 18, looking to ramp up and help the Kings in their second-half push to the postseason.\n\nFive different players will represent Los Angeles at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Italy. Joel Armia (Finland), Adrian Kempe (Sweden), Kevin Fiala (Switzerland), Drew Doughty (Canada) and Darcy Kuemper (Canada) will all make the trip to represent their countries.\n\nKings' hockey will return on Wednesday, Feb. 25th, in yet another battle against the Golden Knights. This time around, the two sides will play at Crypto.com Arena, marking the final game of four in the season series.\n\nPuck drop is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. PT.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea winger Geovany Quenda is now very close to returning from a serious injury that has kept him side-lined for some time.\n\nThe young rising star is set for a spot in Liam Rosenior’s first team next season, but he has been out recovering from a metatarsal injury for the last couple of months.\n\nChelsea correspondent for Football London, Bobby Vincent, has had the drop on this story and put his latest info out on the current Sporting player.\n\nGeovany Quenda in action for Sporting Lisbon. (Photo by Stefano Guidi/Getty Images)\n\n‘Geovany Quenda is a matter of weeks away from returning to training following a metatarsal injury that has kept the soon-to-be Chelsea winger out of action for the past couple of months.\n\n‘Dario Essugo has been in consistent dialogue with Quenda over the last month or so to help him settle in a new country. He is set to be part of the first-team picture next season, has also spoken with Liam Rosenior.’\n\nEssugo of course is another Chelsea player who we have rarely seen anything of yet due to him also being out injured currently.\n\nLiverpool must pay an initial fee worth £2.8million — which could rise by a further £4m — for the signing of Rio Ngumoha from Chelsea. This was decided at tribunal. This fee will certainly prove to be a bargain in years to come, I have no doubts.\n\nChelsea and Strasbourg have had a ridiculous 12 transfers between them in the last two windows. It’s all within the rules, but it’s making people uncomfortable.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have real injury problems right now and one of them will surely force a new transfer strategy.\n\nLiverpool haven't had a good time of it with injuries this season. Giovanni Leoni's knee injury on debut ruled him out for the season and things never really got easier.\n\nAlexander Isak is missing long-term. His season has been a near-nightmare as he battled for fitness only to be rewarded with a leg fracture as soon as he found momentum.\n\nThen there's Conor Bradley. Bradley suffered an awful knee injury against Arsenal last month and it's one that keeps him out for the season at the very least.\n\nBut there's a feeling that he might actually be out longer than that. Sport Scientist Simon Brundish reports that Bradley's rehabilitation time is likely to be around a year in a brilliant analysis of the situation.\n\nIf Brundish is correct - and he typically is - then this will force Liverpool into a chance of plans.\n\nThere is no chance that Liverpool were going to look at right-back options this coming summer. It’s a situation they handled in 2025, signing Jeremie Frimpong to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nHalf the midfield options can play there, too, and it felt like a well-stocked position. Only, it absolutely isn’t.\n\nBradley will be missing for some time and Frimpong has proven unreliable with his own fitness. He’s currently injured for the third time this season.\n\nJoe Gomez, one option there, has a difficult injury history and has been linked with an exit. Curtis Jones has also been linked with an exit as he enters the final year of his contract and he’s been an option at right-back, too.\n\nAnd so with things as they are, Dominik Szoboszlai could end up being the de facto right-back for a lot of next season. That’s not something Liverpool will want.\n\nNot only is he not a natural there but he actively doesn’t want to play as a regular right-back - something that will become an issue as Liverpool try to negotiate a new contract with him. It’s also a move that depletes the midfield further.\n\nThe only real solution seems to be for the club to consider new right-backs. Or at least, players comfortable at operating there, either from midfield or a centre-back position.\n\nThey absolutely won’t have shortlisted many such players but plans have changed. Bradley’s injury forces them to think of something new.",

    "description": "How real is the AI threat to software companies? CNBC put it to the test by vibe-coding a Monday.com replacement.",
    "fullText": "Software, legal services and video games stocks have been selling off in recent weeks on fears that new AI features and tools could wipe them out. But how real is that threat? We decided to find out.\n\nCNBC's Deidre Bosa and I used Anthropic's AI coding tool \"Claude Code\" with the goal of creating a replacement for Monday.com, a project management platform with a $5 billion market cap. We didn't expect to get anywhere — we're not developers and we don't have any coding experience. But we have become adept at vibe-coding tools, which are AI tools that can build functioning apps based on commands in plain English from users, including those with limited technical chops.\n\nWe started out simple, telling Claude to build a project management dashboard similar to Monday, with features like multiple project boards, assigned team members and a status dropdown. It spit out a working prototype in minutes.\n\nWe then asked Claude to research Monday on its own, identify main features and recreate them. It added a number of other features, including a calendar.\n\nThe real magic happened when we connected the clone to an email account, essentially spinning up a customized project manager for our personal lives. The AI found Dee's forgotten calendar invite for a kid's birthday party (which she definitely didn't have a gift for yet) and it added reminders to book tickets for an upcoming trip and sign a waiver for another kid's birthday party.\n\nIt took us under an hour, and had we been paying users, it would have cost something like $5 to $15 in compute credits, depending on how much we went back and forth with the AI agent. As more data centers get built out, that cost could start to come down.\n\nSo which companies should investors worry about? Silicon Valley insiders we talk to say the most exposed names are the ones that \"sit on top of the work\" — tools like Atlassian, Adobe, HubSpot, Zendesk, and Smartsheet, that aren't core to businesses.\n\nThey say cybersecurity stocks like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto are harder to disrupt since they have network effects that no one would want to try to replicate and maintain.\n\nSystems of record may be safer, but not immune. Salesforce, for instance, anchors a business with enterprise data, making it harder to clone with a weekend coding project.\n\nWith the wholesale sell-off in software this year, that may be a chance for investors to separate between the need-to-haves and nice-to-haves.",

    "fullText": "This is Pine Chapel Road. One of the most beautiful spots in the county. The rolling hills, the wildlife, vegetation, the water. Absolutely stunning. It’s kind of my zen place.\n\nThese beautiful rolling hills behind us are used for cattle grazing. There’s nothing about this that doesn’t look healthy, right? And lo and behold, it is absolutely contaminated with the sludge and the PFAS. It’s one of many fields that are toxic in this county.\n\nIt is kind of concerning, isn’t it, to see these guys standing in the water that’s so polluted with PFAS. Poor things have no idea what they’re standing in.\n\nPolyfluoroalkyl, commonly called PFAS.\n\nA contaminant linked to cancer and other illnesses.\n\nFamilies in northwest Georgia have been living with unanswered questions about PFAS.\n\nWater quality experts are raising alarm bells about a dangerous chemical.\n\nI think that PFAS is going to eventually be the front and foremost of health problems here.\n\nI moved here around the age of 5. I’ve basically been here ever since. That’s a good chunk of my life.\n\nI just turned 34 a couple weeks ago and I feel that’s too young to feel how I do physically. What I technically have been diagnosed with is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It’s something that affects you from the second you wake up to the second you go to bed. It makes me feel guilty as a mom that when my kids ask to do something, I have to explain to them I don’t feel well enough to do that. I feel it’s unfair to them.\n\nWe have to be realistic in the fact liver is something you have to have to survive. And if the damage continues, you eventually have to go on a transplant list, and a transplant list is a long wait. My husband and I actually were discussing a will last night. I’ve discussed it a little bit with my daughter. It’s one of those things that when I do discuss it, you can tell it sets panic off in her for a second. She needs to care more. [Laughs]\n\nShe’s young, but just because you’re young doesn’t mean these things don’t scare you. It doesn’t mean that we can’t prepare you for the worst, we can’t discuss this.\n\nI love you. Have a good day. Morning.\n\nI hope for the best for the future, but right now it’s a day at a time.\n\nDYLAN JACKSON, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nDalton is known as the carpet capital of the world. This is a town that lives and breathes the carpet industry.\n\nJASON DEAREN, The Associated Press:\n\nThere are dozens of carpet mills located there. And at these carpet mills, there’s a dyeing process where they put the color on the carpets. Well, when they do that, they also add chemicals.\n\nThe PFAS was in these chemicals that provide stain resistance. So PFAS got into the water because when that washes off the carpets, it ended up going into the drains to the local utility and ultimately ending up in the river water.\n\nFor much of the past year, a consortium of journalists from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The (Charleston) Post and Courier and AL.com in Alabama, along with The Associated Press and FRONTLINE, have been investigating the carpet industry’s use of products that contained chemicals known as PFAS, even amid warnings of their accumulation in human blood and possible health effects.\n\nWe knew already that there was environmental crisis unfolding in northwest Georgia. The story of responsibility and who should be held accountable is basically a finger-pointing game between the chemical industry, the carpet industry and others.\n\nThere’s a couple things I want to check in here. First—\n\nThe team reviewed thousands of pages of documents and court depositions—\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me.\n\n—and interviewed former regulators and industry insiders, as well doctors, scientists—\n\nWe can extract PFAS from the sample—\n\n—and people who have the kinds of illnesses that researchers have linked to PFAS contamination.\n\nDR. KATHERINE NAYMICK, Family physician:\n\nWe think it’s affecting your liver.\n\nWhat took it to the next level for us and what drew our attention is that there were clear lines of accountability for this contamination and a clear need to really understand why things are the way they are up in northwest Georgia.\n\nThe carpet industry has long insisted it’s not to blame for PFAS getting into the environment and argued that chemical companies obscured the risks and assured them that the products they were supplying were safe.\n\nBut the recently reviewed records also show that executives from the two largest carpet companies, Shaw and Mohawk, were getting warnings about potential harms dating back decades.\n\nAnd with little regulation until recently, the team found that for years both the companies and their suppliers were able to legally switch among stain-resistant products that contained different types of PFAS.\n\nWe can’t do this story without industry’s perspective.\n\nBRAD SCHRADE, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nYou want to just update us on where we are with data?\n\nJUSTIN PRICE, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nMost of the testing up in northwest Georgia is completed, but the rest of the state we still are looking at.\n\nDownstream of Dalton and into Alabama, we’ve estimated that there’s approximately hundreds of thousands, 200-plus thousand people who get their drinking water from the surface waters that originate with the Conasauga River.\n\nThe carpet companies say they stopped using any kind of PFAS in U.S. production in 2019. But for years the compounds ended up in the environment and take decades or more to break down. These so-called forever chemicals have routinely tested in the local drinking water at levels the EPA now considers unsafe.\n\nToday, there are lawsuits against both carpet and chemical companies, and uncertainty and feelings of betrayal are boiling across the region.\n\nWe pay for poison in our water.\n\nCommunities are worried about their drinking water, and local governments say the problem is too vast for them to fix alone.\n\nIt really is still a crisis that’s not fully understood.\n\nThe first signs of trouble began coming to light in the late 1990s.\n\nComing up through here, and these suds or foam on the water, whatever you want to call it. That’s about 18 inches tall, hanging out up in there.\n\nI want to show you what happened to this cow’s calf. Right here lays this cow’s calf. It’s about like that other calf up yonder. It’s getting to the point now you can start to smell it.\n\nROB BILOTT, Environmental attorney:\n\nI first learned about it when a farmer from West Virginia called me trying to figure out why his cows were getting sick. And that phone call back in October 1998 led to what has become several decades of research and work now into this family of chemicals we now call PFAS.\n\nRob Bilott is a lawyer whose suits over the years have exposed how chemical companies had research showing PFAS was more dangerous than the public knew.\n\nObviously you’ve seen a lot of internal company documents through your work. When did the companies, 3M and DuPont, makers of these chemicals, really start to know themselves about the health and safety?\n\nI think that’s probably one of the most disturbing aspects of the whole story on PFAS is how far back the makers of these chemicals understood how dangerous these materials were.\n\n“Industry on Parade” visits the $2 million home of a department of the DuPont company.\n\nFrom the 1950s and ’60s, you had the manufacturers understanding if this stuff gets out into the world, it’s not going to break apart. And that led to the companies being concerned about what happens to living things that might be exposed.\n\nAs I’m seeing all these documents, all these studies, all of this information that suggested there was a very dangerous, toxic, carcinogenic material, possibly not only in the water these cows in West Virginia were drinking, but possibly getting into the blood of the entire U.S. population, possibly getting into water all over the country, and nobody knew about it.\n\nMy new cookware is coated with Teflon. Food just slips off easy.\n\nPFAS had become virtually ubiquitous.\n\nWith Scotchgard protector, water beads up.\n\nFrom nonstick pans to raincoats to shoes—\n\nI got a little down my neck, but otherwise, great!\n\nYou need Scotchgard fabric protector. It keeps ordinary spills from becoming extraordinary stains.\n\n—and prized for its ability to protect against stains, which was especially useful in the carpet industry.\n\nCarpet treated with Scotchgard doesn’t absorb dirt, it rejects.\n\nOne of the most popular products was 3M’s Scotchgard.\n\nLook for the Scotchgard label underneath.\n\nSTEVEN AMTER, Environmental scientist:\n\nPFAS chemicals became basically intertwined with carpet manufacture on a deep level since the 1970s and into the ’80s and beyond.\n\nSteven Amter is an environmental scientist who has worked with Rob Bilott on PFAS lawsuits.\n\nCarpets could be hard to clean and they could stain. And what these chemicals promised to do was reduce or eliminate a lot of that, plus make them last for years.\n\n—they had advertisements on television where they poured soil on carpets and they had animals, all kinds of things just to show it’s incredible how you can keep these things now clean much easier.\n\nIt wasn’t until the late ’90s that 3M began informing the carpet industry that the type of PFAS in Scotchgard might accumulate in people’s bodies.\n\nWere there times when the carpet industry knew or strongly suspected that PFAS would cause some sort of problems?\n\nIt was an evolving practice, and that’s very much argued over in lawsuits. Certainly they were given explicit warnings by the late 1990s. They were getting information from the chemical suppliers that were making the chemicals that were then applied to the carpets at carpet mills by the carpet manufacturers.\n\nIn depositions and other court records, the reporters discovered accounts of meetings between 3M and the two main carpet companies in northwest Georgia, Shaw and Mohawk.\n\nWe have these meetings between 3M and Mohawk, Shaw, where basically 3M discloses that they’re finding this stuff building up in the blood of workers and the general public.\n\nIn one meeting in January 1999, a Shaw executive expressed concerns about getting sued, according to notes from a 3M employee.\n\nThey met with a couple executives there, and one said, quote, he “felt plaintiff’s attorneys would be involved immediately.”\n\nWhich, I mean, they weren’t involved immediately, but they were involved about two decades later, almost.\n\nSo one of the major two carpet companies was like, “How is this going to affect our bottom line? We’re going to get sued.”\n\nYeah. They were worried about getting sued.\n\nThat same day, in a meeting at Mohawk, officials there seemed far less worried.\n\n“No real sense of Mohawk problem/responsibility,” the 3M employee noted. “If it’s good enough for 3M, it’s good enough for Mohawk.”\n\n3M continued to reassure the companies that Scotchgard was safe to use. But a year and a half later, the company and the EPA made a dramatic announcement.\n\nThe 3M Company is phasing out some Scotchgard stain repellent products because of concerns about a chemical used in their production. The company says the chemical has been detected at low levels in people and the environment.\n\nA top EPA official at the time said there was no “imminent harm” to consumers during the phase out, but called the chemical compound in the product an “unacceptable technology that should be eliminated to protect human health and the environment from potentially severe long-term consequences.”\n\nThe news didn’t go over well at a meeting with Shaw Industries, the largest carpet company in the country.\n\nBob Shaw, the CEO of Shaw Industries, confronted 3M chemical executives.\n\nSo in that meeting, Bob Shaw picked up a carpet square with the Scotchgard logo on it and said, “This isn’t a logo, this is a target.”\n\n“And I got 15 million of these out in the marketplace, what am I supposed to do about that?” And then he threw that piece of carpet at them and stormed out of the meeting. This chemical on which his company relied, his billion-dollar company, billions of dollars in revenue every year, was now going to be forced to change a key ingredient of their carpet.\n\nYou have to reach out to people who are reluctant to talk.\n\nYou know, having a letter to deliver with your request and your contact information. “I want you to read it. Your input to the story is really important to us.”\n\nNo one from the chemical or carpet industries would agree to on-camera interviews.\n\nIn statements, both Shaw and Mohawk underscored that they had been assured that Scotchgard was safe, and they stopped using the chemical in it after 3M’s disclosures. Shaw said in its statement that PFAS were for “soil and water resistance” and have also been used in “thousands of applications and products.” And a lawyer for Mohawk said they were “relying on and trusting the chemical manufacturers—the inventors of these products—for their expertise.”\n\n3M has said it discontinued making products with any kind of PFAS in 2025. A successor company to DuPont still uses some PFAS compounds thought to be less persistent in the body for products like Teflon.\n\nMuch of the attention around PFAS in the region has been about exposure to it in the environment—especially drinking water—not carpets themselves. In northwest Georgia, the forever chemicals from the carpet mills ended up in the local rivers for years. In 2008, a landmark study at the University of Georgia found that the PFAS levels in one river were “among the highest ever recorded in surface water.”\n\nJESSE DEMONBREUN-CHAPMAN, Coosa River Basin Initiative:\n\nWe’re really water-rich in northwest Georgia. There is a massive network of really special creeks and rivers that weave throughout the entire region. They were transportation networks before we had rail systems and interstates. The indigenous populations had enormous civilizations up and down these rivers before settlers came. These waterways are critical for recreation, for anglers, for paddlers. They’re providing hundreds of thousands of people with drinking water. It’s really hard to overstate the historical impact of how these rivers have shaped the communities across this region.\n\nJesse Demonbreun-Chapman leads an environment protection group that has sued the chemical and carpet companies over PFAS contamination.\n\nSo now these rivers have taken on a new significance because of PFAS.\n\nIt’s not a badge of honor to be known for some of the most contaminated surface water in the country. And it’s certainly something that’s going to keep us very busy for years to come, to try and tease out how to fix this, how to maintain healthy drinking water systems, how to remediate the environment where we know we have contaminated soil and groundwater. So this issue of PFAS contamination looms large over the entire region of northwest Georgia.\n\nYou can’t see it. You can’t smell it. It doesn’t have a taste. So being told that you live in an area that has contaminated drinking water is a shock to people that came here for an environment that they felt was pristine.\n\nOur reporting in northwest Georgia has brought us before numerous people whose drinking water is contaminated, whose land is contaminated, whose food is contaminated, yet when they go to the doctor or they go to their local officials or their water district and ask, “What can we do about this? How can we get this out of our—”, there’s no answers for them.\n\nIt’s difficult to definitively connect people’s specific illnesses to the chemicals, and there are an estimated 15,000 varieties of PFAS. Little is known about the health effects of most of them. But research has been linking high levels of some types of PFAS in the body to cancers, immune disorders and diseases of the liver and thyroid.\n\nDANA BARR, Prof., Emory University:\n\nThe levels are pretty high in northwest Georgia. We’ve compared them to the general U.S. population, and their values are much higher than the general U.S. population.\n\nDana Barr is an environmental health researcher who’s tested the blood of almost 200 residents in the region.\n\nTwenty-four percent of them had levels that were above that level of high risk of health outcomes, and 74% were in that moderate risk area. And so what we want to do with these people is try to figure out how they’re being exposed, how they’re being the most exposed, and try to reduce those exposures over time. This is a community that—They just live there. They were exposed because of just the surrounding conditions.\n\nWhat do we know about the medical effects PFAS has on the human body?\n\nSo PFAS had been linked to a lot of different diseases, including thyroid hormone disruption, endocrine disruption in general. Cancers like kidney and testicular cancer. And then also alterations in lipid content in the blood as well.\n\nThat stain resistance, the thing that made them successful as a product for the chemical companies that made them, are the same reason that they’re persistent in the environment?\n\nOnce they get into people, they actually bind to albumin, which is a protein that’s in your blood. And the albumin is reabsorbed in your gut, and so it keeps circulating. So it’s not eliminated like a lot of chemicals are.\n\nIs there nothing that can be done in terms of treating or mitigating after it’s already been found in someone’s blood?\n\nThere is nothing that has been shown to be effective yet. We have ideas and we’re pursuing those right now.\n\nI reached out to my doctor. It’s like silence. They don’t know what to do or how to handle it.\n\nOne of the people in Dana Barr’s study is a hair salon owner named Dolly Baker.\n\nYeah, Jason’s my reporting partner.\n\nDana from Emory called me and she was on her vacation and said that she just wanted to talk about my results. Mine was over 1,300. High is 20, and the next highest one below me was 200 something, I believe. And she said, “I don’t want to alarm you, but we’re just trying to figure out what could be causing this.”\n\nHad you ever had any health problems or anything before?\n\nI did have to start taking thyroid medicine last year for the first time.\n\nWhat’s it like knowing that you have this inside your body and that you can’t really do much yet to address that?\n\nI feel like—I don’t know, almost like there’s a blanket over me, smothering me, that I can’t get out from under and that it’s just, you’re trapped, I guess is the best way to describe it.\n\nThyroid issues are among the conditions linked to PFAS.\n\nLisa Martin is another one of the study participants with a thyroid issue.\n\nShe spent 20 years working at Mohawk as an inventory manager.\n\nI was very healthy, active, perfect bill of health. And within just half a dozen years of working in the carpet industry, my health started to decline. We couldn’t figure out why. I ended up having autoimmune disease, had to have my thyroid removed.\n\nDid you work closely with people who were applying these PFAS chemicals to carpet? Did they have any sense of the risks that they faced?\n\nThey did not. They didn’t have a clue. The first plant that I worked at was in Dalton, and we had a dye house up there. My first shock came when we would walk for exercise around this facility, which is a huge facility. But as we would walk out back in the waterways, you could see what color they had been dyeing that day. It was just accepted. It was just the culture. So I became complacent about what I was seeing and I just—I didn’t say anything, which is—it’s my fault.\n\nNo. I was familiar with Scotchgard, that we used it. I knew that we used it. I knew that we used stain resistance on our products, but I did not understand the PFAS element to the degree that I do now.\n\nMohawk said in its statement that they weren’t aware of any instance where PFAS was directly discharged into the environment and that it has always complied with wastewater regulations.\n\nExperience a whole new era in style and beauty for your home. Stainmaster carpet: always stylish, always beautiful.\n\nAccording to Shaw and Mohawk, they received assurances from the chemical companies that these alternative products didn’t contain the types of PFAS that accumulate in the body and were not as persistent in the environment.\n\nBut still, the carpet makers were worried about new PFAS research that was starting to emerge.\n\nI have an email between Werner Braun, the head of the Carpet and Rug Institute, that lobbying group for the carpet industry.\n\nIt says, quote, “The troubling issue for me in this report is a determination that this is carcinogenic in rats.”\n\nSo that’s showing that as early as in 2002, the carpet industry knew of an animal study that was showing carcinogenic nature of these chemicals.\n\nAround 2003, DuPont disclosed that trace amounts of the chemical that caused cancer in rats was in fact in their Stainmaster carpet protector. But DuPont insisted it was an unintentional byproduct and still safe.\n\nThe carpet companies would continue to use Stainmaster for another five years before dropping the chemical in it, too, as part of another EPA-negotiated phase out.\n\nThe Carpet and Rug Institute and its former head, Werner Braun, declined to be interviewed.\n\nIn a statement, the group said it evaluates its products to reflect “science, innovation and customer expectations,” and that the carpet industry’s conduct was, and continues to be, appropriate and lawful.\n\nIn their statements, Shaw and Mohawk again pointed the blame at the manufacturers for misleading them.\n\nAround that time, the EPA approached the carpet industry seeking to test their facilities for PFAS.\n\nThe EPA was starting this priority review, and in 2003, one of the things they wanted to do was focus on, “Let’s go get some samples from the water supply in these areas.” And one of the areas they had targeted was carpet manufacturing.\n\nThe carpet companies refused to allow the testing, citing confidentiality concerns, and told the EPA to ask the local water authority, Dalton Utilities, which also refused, saying there wasn’t an agreed-on, scientifically sound testing method.\n\nSTEVEN AMTER, Co-author, The Polluters:\n\nThe carpet industry completely declined to have their wastewater sampled. And I would also add that Dalton Utilities was asked if they would allow sampling from them as an alternative to the carpet companies allowing sampling, and to quote, Dalton Utilities didn’t just say no, they said, “Hell, no.”\n\nDalton Utilities is the agency responsible for providing drinking water to the people of Dalton, but it’s also responsible for treating the wastewater that comes from the mills in Dalton.\n\nDalton is a carpet company town, and the local utility there, some 80, 85% of the wastewater that takes in comes from the carpet industry. Historically, carpet industry executives and former executives have made up a part of its board.\n\nNo one from Dalton Utilities would agree to an interview. In a statement, it said its board was never influenced by carpet executives, and it didn’t know there was PFAS in the wastewater until 2009.\n\nThe utility is currently suing the carpet and chemical companies. In the suit, it said its wastewater treatment process cannot screen out PFAS chemicals. Dating back to the ’80s, it has run a system that filters some contaminants from the carpet companies wastewater and then sprays it out over thousands of acres it owns on the outskirts of Dalton.\n\nThe thing that was a lightbulb moment for me was the land application. That’s a big concentration of PFAS for a long time, and every time it rains it just flows off that site into the environment.\n\nYeah, so this is the LAS, the land application system. The boundaries are in black here. And then the Conasauga River, you can kind of see moves its way down along the western boundary of the LAS.\n\nOne expert in a lawsuit against carpet and chemical companies said that the land application system will be a perpetual source of contamination for a hundred years, at least.\n\nThe LAS is at the center of several lawsuits. So the utility, through a lawyer, told us that we would be able to take a tour like normal that they offer, but we wouldn’t be able to ask any questions on the record. Going there for the first time was a bit surreal.\n\nEverywhere you look, you can see some form of transportation of water from the waste treatment facilities, eventually into the sprinkler heads that spray the forest with the treated wastewater, and they rely on the land and the soil to absorb that water and remove many of the remaining contaminants that might still be in the wastewater.\n\nThe problem is that PFAS are chemicals that do not break down in the environment. They don’t biodegrade for decades, and you could look at a tree, you could look at soil, any of the spray heads, and fully expect that if you were to test that for PFAS, it would be there, and it would be there in high quantities.\n\nIn the course of our investigation of Dalton Utility’s role in PFAS contamination, I was told I should talk to Scott Gordon. Gordon was involved in inspecting issues with Dalton Utilities’ land application system as far back as 2000.\n\nSCOTT GORDON, Fmr. inspector, EPA enforcement division:\n\nWhen you got out on site, each one of those risers—pipes—with the sprinkler heads on top looked like it had a wig on top, there were so many carpet fibers on the spray itself. And then when as you’re walking around those areas, it felt like you were walking on shag carpet.\n\nYeah. There was that much carpet fibers in the material they were spraying. And all of those pipes going up, and the sprinkler heads, weren’t stabilized at all. Any limb that came along and knocked them over, a deer running through the pasture knocks them over. So when we got on site, we saw lots of just flowing wastewater going down the sides of the hills into the creeks and eventually into the river.\n\nThey were putting this wastewater onto land that was draining directly into the river, which people used for drinking water?\n\nCorrect. And this is a very, fairly large utility, so they were discharging between 20 and 25 million gallons a day to this land application system.\n\nDalton’s filtering system has been cited in lawsuits as one of the main sources of PFAS contamination in the region.\n\nThe utility has said it is looking for new technology that can treat or remove PFAS.\n\nBut the forever chemicals have spread far down the regional riverways, where in Alabama, places like Gadsden have been impacted.\n\nGadsden is about a hundred miles west of Dalton, of the carpet capital, and they get their drinking water from the Coosa River.\n\nEarly 2016, state officials sent out a memo saying, “We are concerned about the PFAS levels in eight water systems.” And Gadsden was one. And so that really set alarm bells off in Gadsden, where they said, “What is this? Where’s this coming from?” And so they were kind of able to conclude that the PFAS was coming from the carpet companies.\n\nWithin a few months, Gadsden decides to sue the chemical manufacturers, as well as the carpet companies.\n\nIt was the first time a carpet maker had been sued over its role in PFAS contamination.\n\nWhat we learned in our reporting is the lawsuit was sort of what they felt like was the only avenue to get any kind of funds or recourse to address the PFAS problem.\n\nI’m good, how are you? Don’t get up.\n\nFred Zackery, he’s a native of Gadsden. He lived away for many years, but he returned to Gadsden and he started doing a radio show called “Introspection.”\n\nWell, good afternoon, my friends, and welcome again to “Introspection.” We’re coming to you live from the village of Gadsden on the banks of the Poison Coosa. And we’re going to be talking about poison water. There is no mistaking—\n\nAbout 10 years ago, when PFAS started to become an issue in Gadsden, he really rededicated his radio show to water quality.\n\nThe contaminants were not flowing from the county. They came downriver from Dalton, Georgia, and those carpet plants upriver.\n\nI think part of Fred Zackery’s frustration is city government has not moved quickly enough, has not met the moment well enough and has just left the people of Gadsden to deal with this contamination issue.\n\nWe’re in need of leadership in this community, and you can’t keep talking about the, “Oh, well, they won’t let you.” Nobody ever let me do anything. Do it because you see it needs to be done.\n\nSince the lawsuit in 2016, six other drinking water systems in Alabama have sued the carpet and chemical companies, alleging PFAS has contaminated their water supply.\n\nGadsden’s suit ended in 2022 with a confidential settlement.\n\nThe city has been trying to reduce the PFAS in the water, including using a carbon filtering system. It recently broke ground on a new high-tech treatment plant that is set to open in 2027.\n\nIt’s sad that it’s taken so long for this to materialize. We shouldn’t have had to wait on a settlement to do this. Bond issues, a whole lot of ways you could have done this. So I want to give great credit where it’s due, but we are still being poisoned while this is being built, and nobody’s talking about establishing a medical facility where we can do testing of citizens to see what level of PFAS, if any, that they have in their system. It’s just not proactive so far as the citizens are concerned.\n\nIn 2025, on average, Gadsden’s water contained more than twice the EPA’s recommended level of the two key PFAS compounds that had historically been used by the carpet industry.\n\nNone of Gadsden’s elected officials would be interviewed about the PFAS situation and the frustration people like Fred Zackery have with how the city has responded.\n\nThe head of Gadsden’s water authority, Chad Hare, said they are doing all they can to address residents’ concerns.\n\nDo you hear from residents that are still frustrated with the level of PFAS in the water, even with the carbon filters?\n\nCHAD HARE, Gadsden Water Board:\n\nAs we get phone calls, we answer the questions the best that we can, and we provide every bit of the information that we have. As far as all of our sampling, all of our monitoring is provided to the public on the website.\n\nOur responsibility is to meet all state and federal regulations. We’re water treatment professionals, and so we take that very seriously.\n\nSo the state requires some water systems to test for PFAS. However, because the EPA has not made their guidelines enforceable, there are not really any limits in Alabama. So even if their drinking water tests above these guidelines established by the EPA, they are still not in violation of Alabama’s water quality rules because the EPA has not said those guidelines are enforceable.\n\nIn 2024, after decades of studying the issue, the EPA finally issued drinking water regulations for some of the PFAS compounds they’d flagged over the years, though they don’t take effect until 2031.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said it is committed to combatting PFAS contamination. It noted that during the first Trump administration it issued a nationwide PFAS action plan and said it is now working to help public water systems around the country.\n\nIt also said it intends to rescind and reevaluate restrictions put on some PFAS compounds under the Biden administration and implement a PFAS testing strategy that doesn’t create an undue burden for industry, and protects human health and the environment.\n\nBETSY SOUTHERLAND, EPA, 1984-2017:\n\nEPA can only act as quickly as the law allows them to, and so again—\n\nBetsy Southerland is the former director of the EPA’s water protection division and spent more than 30 years at the agency. She has become a vocal critic.\n\nIf the agency knew that there was a concern with toxicity in 2000, can you just help explain to people who have this in their bodies or are drinking it in their water why the agency takes so long?\n\nAt the time, the Toxic Substances Control Act that we were working under at EPA was very weak. All the onus was on EPA to prove that there was an existing chemical causing a problem before they could take action. So we were really hamstrung at the time. That current law did not allow EPA to do bans or restrictions of chemicals unless there was enormous evidence.\n\nSome people we’ve talked to have said that this was a failure of accountability at every level, from the local utility to the state to EPA. Do you agree with that?\n\nSo I do agree with that because in this particular case, there were ways we could have been more aggressive at EPA, and again, but because of the limitations of that Toxic Substances Control law, we could have been more aggressive in offering technical assistance to get the states to do things.\n\nEven today, she says, when there are concerns a chemical might be unsafe, the agency has to go through a seven-year process before it can actually impose a ban or restrictions.\n\nAnd meantime, the industry can continue using these chemicals?\n\nWhat it means for public health is that, again, we’re left to our own devices. We can buy a filter for our drinking water, we can get an HVAC for our house, but we’re not going to get helped by the federal government at all. So unless your state is one of those states that’s out there actively working on it, you’re just going to continue to be exposed in what you eat, drink and breathe.\n\nSTEVEN AMTER, Environmental scientist:\n\nSome of them didn’t bioaccumulate in animals as much. Some of them had early data showing less toxicity. But in all cases, when they were making these moves, they didn’t have a great deal of actual data to back it up. So this was done somewhat with a hope and a prayer.\n\nThe carpet industry eventually stopped using products with the short-chain PFAS in 2019, amid a growing body of research raising questions about their toxicity.\n\nThe carpet industry says regulators from Dalton Utilities all the way up to the EPA never restricted their use of these chemicals. What do you say to that?\n\nI think that’s true. The regulatory system can be very slow to respond, especially when it doesn’t have information. And basically the regulatory system did not have any really usable information on PFAS chemicals until 2000.\n\nIs it fair to expect private industry to act before the government regulators do?\n\nAbsolutely, because government regulations are not designed to prevent every harm, especially ones it doesn’t know about. They’re designed to facilitate stopping known harms or putting in place a system where industry can make that call. That’s the basis for so much environmental regulation, that there’s industry responsibility.\n\nI would say that the failure really began with a lukewarm federal response and cascaded down from there. We never had a very robust federal response into the use of these chemicals, how they were allowed to move in the environment, how they were able to be sold in terms of commerce. And as a result, that was a message. That was signaling to states, “This isn’t a big deal yet.” That’s signaling to local communities, “This isn’t a big deal.”\n\nAnd how do you think Georgia is doing in regulating these chemicals?\n\nI think Georgia, like most states, is terribly behind. While I understand being reluctant to get too far out ahead of EPA and federal regulations, I think that there was certainly enough information to begin addressing this if lawmakers and leadership within the state of Georgia wanted to address this problem.\n\nToday, the state is grappling with another concern: how the ongoing lawsuits might impact some of its largest employers.\n\nREP. KASEY CARPENTER, (R) Georgia House of Representatives:\n\nWe are now in the posture that we’re all going to be suing each other, and when that happens, nobody wins.\n\nState legislator Kasey Carpenter, who represents Dalton, has been trying to get support for a bill that would limit lawsuits against the carpet industry.\n\nThis legislation is no laughing matter. It’s about protecting 50,000 jobs in northwest Georgia and hundreds of thousands across the state.\n\nCritics say it would actually harm residents already coping with the area’s PFAS contamination.\n\nThe bill you introduced that would have shielded carpet companies and other PFAS receivers who caused PFAS pollution from legal liability, why did you bring that bill forward?\n\nBecause I think that it’s important to focus litigation on the people that are at fault. I tell people all the time, when we found out asbestos caused cancer, nobody sued the home builder that put it in your house. You went straight to the asbestos manufacturers. And that’s, I see PFAS as being the next asbestos for the United States. It’s important to focus that litigation on the chemical manufacturers, who knew it was not safe and who misled everybody who used it.\n\nThese lawsuits in particular are a lifeline for a lot of your constituents who are worried about their health. Why did you propose a bill that in some ways would make it harder to get answers?\n\nI don’t think so. I think that it just basically said, let’s focus on the chemical companies.\n\nDR. KATHERINE NAYMICK, Family physician:\n\nOK. I just wanted to start to check all of my patients’ levels, and follow everybody.\n\nWe think it’s affecting your liver. You were found to have moderate fatty liver disease. Now, the good thing is that before we checked these, I already had you on a program of changing your diet, decreasing the amount of meat.\n\nCertainly not taking any more fast foods and filtering your water.\n\nThere was a new study and it does talk about fatty liver disease and this relationship to what it’s doing to cause hepatic cancer. I’m going to watch your liver enzymes really closely, and at the first indication that they go up—hopefully they won’t, with everything that we’re trying to do to prevent it. We just want to keep an eye on everything.\n\nI would like to see if we can, because I just know that it’s so new, we’re all just kind of like, what can we do, and can we figure out a solution to mitigate the damage that’s been done?\n\nEvery single part of the regulatory framework that should have addressed this compound essentially left somebody else to handle it. In the end, no one has. We’re left with drastic contamination in this region, and these aren’t the only communities that are facing this problem.\n\nI tell everybody that asks me about this, we’re in an ultramarathon. This is not a sprint. This is going to require immense amount of resources, research and development, and direct leadership at every level to address the extent of this contamination.",

    "description": "On the earnings call, analysts pushed CEO Andy Jassy for assurances on future returns from this capex boom.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Thursday it plans a staggering $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, sparking concern that the AI spending boom has entered an even more bubbly stage.\n\nThe company's capex forecast was more than $50 billion above Wall Street expectations. That left some analysts uneasy about whether these huge investments will pay off.\n\n\"The strong long-term return on investing capital — I think that's the debate in the market today,\" Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at Evercore ISI, said during a conference call with Amazon executives following the results. \"So could you give us a little bit more insight into how you think investors will be able to see that?\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said new AI capacity is being monetized as quickly as it is deployed, calling it \"a very unusual opportunity,\" and argued that AI adoption is accelerating customers' shift to the cloud. He added that AWS' experience forecasting demand helps limit wasted capacity.\n\n\"This isn't some sort of quixotic top-line grab,\" Jassy said during the call. \"We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital.\"\n\nJassy's comments did little to calm investors. Amazon shares fell more than 10% in extended trading after the company detailed its outsized spending plans. A profit forecast also missed Wall Street expectations, adding to ROI concerns.\n\nBig Tech's AI infrastructure buildout has entered a new, breathtaking phase in recent days. On Wednesday, Google said it expects capex of $175 billion to $185 billion in 2026, well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Meta and Microsoft also raised capex.\n\nDuring Thursday's Amazon earnings call, other analysts pressed for assurances around returns on investment. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth asked Jassy whether the company had \"financial guardrails\" in place for the spending plan.\n\nJassy said AI represents an \"extraordinarily unusual opportunity\" that could reshape the scale of AWS and Amazon. He said the company's in-house chips, Trainium and Graviton, are on track to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year and added that its partnership with Anthropic has gone \"very well.\"\n\n\"We see this as an unusual opportunity, and we are going to invest aggressively here to be the leaders like we've been the last number of years,\" Jassy said.\n\nJassy described the AI market as \"barbelled,\" with heavy spending by leading AI labs on one end and productivity-focused enterprise uses on the other.\n\nHe said the middle — enterprise production workloads and new AI-native businesses — remains early but could become \"the largest and the most durable\" source of demand as costs fall and adoption broadens.\n\n\"The lion's share of that demand is still yet to come in the middle of that barbell, and that will come over time,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Global markets slid hard on Friday as losses spread across tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals, reinforcing fears that investors have moved into a \"sell everything\" mindset.\n\nMuch of the pressure is coming from tech, as doubts grow over whether the AI boom that powered recent gains can live up to expectations.\n\n\"A session of pure carnage overnight as the rotational flows noted in yesterday's note — out of tech and into cyclical morphed into a 'sell everything' mentality across stocks, crypto and commodities,\" Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia, wrote on Friday.\n\nIn Asia, South Korea's tech-heavy Kospi plunged and briefly triggered a trading halt after the index dropped 5%.\n\nHeavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were among the hardest hit, dragging the market lower as investors rushed to cut exposure to technology stocks.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell as much as 2.1% as China's major tech names moved lower, reflecting weaker risk appetite and ongoing pressure on the sector.\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 also declined, tracking the global selloff, while Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses ahead of a general election this week.\n\nCryptocurrencies fell alongside equities, extending a week of heavy losses as investors continued to reduce risk.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $64,500 after falling about 10% over 24 hours.\n\nThe selling also swept through commodities, with silver remaining under intense pressure following last week's violent breakdown.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $71.20 per troy ounce. It had hit a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\n\"Silver's attempt to stabilise after last week's historic rout has so far proven short‑lived,\" Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a Thursday note, pointing to renewed selling and technical resistance that triggered reversals.\n\nHansen also pointed to fresh selling from China, including disruption around China's only pure-silver fund after it traded far above its underlying value and was later suspended, leaving investors locked in as it repeatedly hit limit-down moves.\n\nHe added that near-term price action in silver is likely to be driven more by market mechanics and positioning than by macroeconomic headlines, given the extreme volatility still coursing through the market.\n\nThe latest moves underscore how quickly sentiment has shifted across asset classes.\n\n\"Investors are questioning their commitment to the pillars that have underpinned markets over the past six months: AI, crypto, and precious metals. This raises the odds of a deeper unwind,\" wrote Sycamore.",

    "title": "Hollywood superagent and investor Michael Ovitz praised Jeffrey Epstein and was invited to his island, files reveal",
    "description": "Michael Ovitz, cofounder of CAA and a tech investor, praised Jeffrey Epstein's \"outstanding multiple talents\" in one email to the disgraced financier.",
    "fullText": "Michael Ovitz, the cofounder of powerhouse Los Angeles talent agency Creative Artists Agency and a prolific tech investor, effusively praised Jeffrey Epstein and made arrangements to meet him at his New York home and off the coast of St. Barts, newly released files reveal.\n\nThe disgraced financier invited Ovitz to his private Caribbean island in 2012 and said he knew Ovitz \"well\" in emails to a Microsoft executive and his publicist, Peggy Siegal. In 2013, Ovitz emailed Epstein, lauding his \"outstanding multiple talents,\" with Epstein emailing Ovitz, \"great to see you smiling again,\" later that year.\n\nA spokesperson for Ovitz denied that he was on anything more than cordial terms with Epstein.\n\n\"Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did not know each other well, no matter what Mr. Epstein said to Peggy Siegal. They had very limited interaction and correspondence,\" a spokesperson for Ovitz told Business Insider. \"When Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did correspond, Mr. Ovitz was cordial.\"\n\nOvitz co-founded CAA in 1975, where he represented stars like Tom Cruise and Robert De Niro, leaving the firm in 1995 for a stint as president of Disney. The superagent later built deep links to Silicon Valley: he has invested in hundreds of startups, and has served as an advisor to the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nOvitz is also a senior advisor to Palantir and has recently invested in AI startups, including the Google-backed AI studio Promise and the image generator Black Forest Labs, where he serves as an advisor.\n\nDocuments released last week by the Justice Department from its investigation into Epstein provide a deeper look at his ties to Ovitz. It's not the first time Ovitz's name comes up in relation to Epstein: in 2023, Ovitz was subpoenaed by the US Virgin Islands as part of its lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase for banking with Epstein. That lawsuit has since been settled.\n\nThe new material shows communication between Ovitz and Epstein in the early and mid-2010s — after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor, but before his 2019 arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges — which ended with his death by suicide in a jail cell.\n\nIn a 2010 email exchange, Ovitz wrote to Epstein, \"hope you are well\" and \"been a while\" after a dinner with Jes Staley, the former Barclays CEO who later came under close scrutiny for his Epstein dealings.\n\n\"Had dinner with Jes last night and your ears should still be burning,\" Ovitz wrote, adding that he and Epstein should get together.\n\nJPMorgan Chase declined to comment to Business Insider for this article.\n\nIn February 2012, Epstein planned to see Ovitz at an undisclosed location, according to a Google Calendar reminder. A few months later, in April, Ovitz emailed Epstein that he would drop by the financier's Manhattan home for a drink, writing, \"would love to see you.\"\n\nIn December 2012, after learning that Ovitz was wintering in St. Barts in the Caribbean, Epstein invited him to his private island, Little Saint James, writing, \"will you be near my island, come visit.\"\n\nOvitz declined, saying his boat was stuck in St. Barts after he dropped a rudder. He told Epstein his boat was located about 500 yards from the yacht Al Mirqab, owned by former Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani — which Epstein said he was visiting at the time — and suggested Epstein could stop by. The potential meetup didn't take place, Ovitz's spokesperson told Business Insider after publication.\n\nIn a January 2013 email, Ovitz wrote to Epstein that he and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, had been \"raving about you and your outstanding multiple talents.\" Sinofsky had been relying on Epstein to negotiate his Microsoft exit at the time.\n\nSinofsky later asked Epstein in an email if he knew Ovitz, whom he had just met at Andreessen Horowitz, and Epstein replied, \"very very well.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Epstein emailed Ovitz again, writing, \"great to see you smiling again.\"\n\nIn 2014, Andrew Farkas, a real estate magnate who co-owned a marina with Epstein in St. Thomas, also asked Epstein for an introduction to Ovitz to discuss naming a new performing arts degree at Harvard University.\n\nEpstein's most recent reference to Ovitz in the files is from 2017, when Epstein emailed his publicist Siegal that he knew Ovitz \"WELL.\"\n\nThe Epstein files are full of recognizable names who had correspondence with him, and some of the content is anodyne. The latest documents have caused headaches for some of the movers and shakers whose names appear on them.\n\nOn Wednesday night, powerhouse lawyer Brad Karp stepped down from the chairmanship of his firm, Paul Weiss, saying his ties to Epstein had become a \"distraction\" for it. Prominent longevity influencer Peter Attia publicly apologized for his crude email exchanges with Epstein and stepped down as chief science officer for a protein bar company.\n\nOvitz's CAA has become one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies. The firm rose to prominence by driving ever-higher actor paydays by demanding larger box-office cuts for stars like Brad Pitt.\n\nCAA served as an inspiration for Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz when they built Andreessen Horowitz, which prides itself on being founder-friendly.\n\n\"An important part of A16z's origin story, which you may already know, is that we were founded by Marc & Ben to be 'CAA for the tech industry,'\" reads the firm's website.\n\nBesides his involvement with A16z, Ovitz also chairs the VC firm Treville Capital Group and announced last year that he was launching his own startup, SoundPatrol, that uses AI to fight copyright infringement in music.",

    "description": "The rivaling AI companies pushed GPT-5.3-Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, and had back-to-back appearances on a tech and business podcast.",
    "fullText": "The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic intensified this week.\n\nThe two companies released dueling new AI models on Thursday and had back-to-back podcast appearances on \"TBPN.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model that the company says would improve performance on office productivity and coding tasks, with an expanded \"context window\" that allows it to work through longer documents and more complex projects in a single session.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI punched back with its own new coding-focused model called GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company says runs faster, uses fewer computing resources, and can generate and manage complex software from English instructions. The new version also comes alongside a stand-alone Codex desktop app.\n\nBoth Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and Sholto Douglas, one of Anthropic's leading researchers, appeared on the \"TBPN\" podcast in back-to-back chats with show host John Coogan and Jordi Hays.\n\n\"I think we will be heading towards a workflow where a lot of people just feel like they're managing a team of agents,\" said Altman. \"And as the agents get better, they'll keep operating at a higher and higher level of abstraction.\"\n\nDouglas, who appeared in the subsequent timeslot, told Coogan and Hays that users have been comparing previous Anthropic and OpenAI models, and they have noticed some key differences.\n\n\"The OpenAI models were a bit better at trying really, really, really hard on tough problems, but the Anthropic models were much faster and so forth,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"And so they worked on speed while we worked on making the models much, much better at really, really tough problems,\" Douglas added of the Opus 4.6.\n\nThe latest release is part of a long-running competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, dating back to 2021, when a group of OpenAI researchers left to form Anthropic, aiming to develop safer and more controlled AI systems.\n\nThis week, Anthropic's launch of industry-specific plugins triggered a stock market sell-off as Wall Street worried about AI's impact on software.\n\nAnthropic also took a subtle shot at OpenAI with a series of ads released this week, including one that will air during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe ads feature unnamed humanized AIs dropping ads in the middle of their advice, alongside the promise that its model, Claude, will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI announced in January that ads are coming to ChatGPT for users of the free version.\n\nAltman subsequently hit back, calling Anthropic \"dishonest\" and defending ChatGPT as a product that brings AI \"to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.\" He also clarified that the ads will be \"clearly labeled\" to differentiate themselves from the chatbot's answers to queries.\n\n\"We are not stupid. We respect our users. We understand that if we did something like what those ads depict, people would rightfully stop using the product,\" Altman told the \"TBPN\" podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"Our first principle with ads is that we're not going to put stuff into the LLM stream,\" Altman added. \"That would feel crazy dystopic, like a bad sci-fi movie.\"",

I'm speaking for the Guthrie family. Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you. We haven't heard anything directly. We need you to reach out, and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward,\" Camron said.\n\nHe then reiterated the family's request for proof that their mother is in the captor's custody.\n\n\"But first, we have to know that you have our mom. We want to talk to you, and we are waiting for contact,\" Camron said.\n\nA post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)\n\nGuthrie's mother, Nancy Guthrie, has been missing since Sunday. She was last seen at her home in Tucson, Arizona. Officials told NBC Nightly News on Monday that they believe she was \"taken out of her home against her will.\"\n\nThe video comes a day after Savannah, Camron, and their sister, Annie, issued a joint plea for their mother's safe return.\n\n\"Everyone is looking for you, Mommy, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again,\" Savannah said in Wednesday's video. \"We speak to you every moment. And we pray without ceasing, and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you, Mommy.\"\n\nIn a statement uploaded to the sheriff department's X account on Wednesday, Nanos said investigators \"have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case,\" and cautioned the public against \"the sharing of unverified accusations or false information.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the sheriff's department released a timeline with new details, noting that Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera was disconnected and later detected a person, though no video was available. Sheriff Chris Nanos also confirmed that the blood found on the porch belonged to her.",

    "description": "Microsoft AI CEO says vibe coding is lowering the barrier to building apps, raising questions about how defensible software will be.",
    "fullText": "Mustafa Suleyman says vibe coding is rapidly lowering the barrier to building apps, a shift that could put traditional software at risk.\n\nThe Microsoft AI CEO said in an episode of the \"Exponential View\" podcast published Thursday that AI tools now make it possible for anyone to quickly start launching code and apps.\n\n\"It is so accessible now,\" said Suleyman. \"You can watch a three-minute video, get spun up, launch one of these things.\"\n\n\"You can create an app, a web app in seconds,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman said people don't need deep technical skills to get started. Instead, they can learn by experimenting, watching, and doing.\n\nThe AI can \"build something that you may have thought was never possible,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless you push these things to their edges and explore the boundaries, you won't really understand the magic, or what they're kind of bad at.\"\n\n\"Everyone's got to get stuck into that motion,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman also said he has vibe-coded a system that tracks the DJs he wants to see, coming concerts and festivals, and then matches those events with his travel schedule. What used to be manual work now runs automatically in a spreadsheet that updates throughout the year.\n\nSuleyman's comments come as investors grow increasingly anxious that AI tools and agents could wipe out entire categories of software.\n\nThat fear flared this week after Anthropic said it was adding legal-focused capabilities to its Cowork assistant. The tools would allow AI to review legal documents and track compliance — work typically done by legal software.\n\nMarkets didn't take it lightly. Shares of legal-software companies in Europe and the US fell sharply on Tuesday, before the selling spread across the wider software sector and into tech.\n\nOpenAI triggered a similar sell-off months earlier after rolling out internal AI-powered software-as-a-service tools.\n\nMany of the tools now unsettling the tech sector were built using AI coding tools.\n\nAI personal assistant OpenClaw was created with the help of AI, while Moltbook — a viral, Reddit-style forum for AI agents — was entirely vibe-coded.\n\nAnthropic also said last month that it built its Cowork assistant using Claude.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Anthropic's product manager, Felix Rieseberg, wrote on X. During a livestream, Rieseberg said his team put Cowork together in just over a week, thanks to Claude.\n\nTech leaders and developers have also said that such a turnaround is becoming the norm.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the developer behind OpenClaw, said in an episode of \"Behind the Craft\" podcast published last week that AI now lets developers \"build everything.\"\n\nOpenAI's chair, Bret Taylor, said in an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published last week that building software quickly through vibe coding will soon feel routine rather than novel.\n\nBut the real question, Taylor said, is what software still matters.\n\nInstead of dashboards, browser forms, and traditional apps, he expects AI agents to become the dominant software interface.\n\n\"Who's making those agents is the question,\" he said. \"Will you buy those agents off the shelf or build them yourself?\"",

    "description": "The firm said it recently tested the software with Singapore's air force, where a chopper crew used an ISR drone to find a target in the rainforest.",
    "fullText": "Airbus is trialing new software that allows helicopter crews to control a team of drones while the chopper flies at high speeds.\n\nThe company recently tested the technology, called HTeaming, in trials with an H225M helicopter operated by Singapore's air force and defense science and technology agency, said Victor Gerin-Roze, head of UAS business in the Airbus helicopters division.\n\n\"We were completely controlling the drone from the helicopter. For us, it's of course unique. Today, what we performed is a world first,\" Gerin-Roze told reporters on Thursday at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nThe software is part of Airbus' contribution to the surging industry for drone wingmen, which the world's biggest aircraft manufacturers are betting will be the future of air warfare.\n\nThe latest HTeaming trials were held in January and involved a simulated mission, tasking a Singaporean H225M crew with finding and rescuing a stranded pilot in the rainforest.\n\nAirbus said it first deployed one of its uncrewed aerial systems, the 7-foot-long surveillance drone Flexrotor, to locate and identify the pilot.\n\nThe drone, which can fly at speeds of up to 85 miles per hour, then fed real-time data to a handheld tablet on board the H225M helicopter. The crew used that information to find and rendezvous with their rescuee, Airbus said.\n\nGerin-Roze said the Flexrotor and H225M were flying several kilometers apart during the mission, but they can remain connected at distances up to 20 kilometers, or roughly 12.4 miles.\n\n\"One of the big challenges was to keep the data link stable,\" Gerin-Roze said.\n\nAirbus used a modem and four antennae to keep the helicopter and drone connected during the mission, as both aircraft were \"flying in different directions with different altitudes,\" Gerin-Roze added.\n\nThe HTeaming software, announced in June 2025 at the Paris Airshow, is still in early development. Airbus said it last tested the system with one of its lighter helicopters, the H-135, with the Spanish Navy in May of that year.\n\nThe French aviation giant hopes that HTeaming will eventually help create a system that lets its customers fly a mixed fleet of automated fighters, recon drones, and wingmen.\n\nAirbus is designing HTeaming to work with other firms' drones, allowing customers to mix its helicopters with third-party uncrewed aircraft.\n\nThe tablet, hefty but light enough to use on your lap, is designed to allow helicopter crews to receive drones' video feeds, issue commands to the vehicles, and control the trajectory of their payloads.\n\nThe company is experimenting with other drone payloads, such as for data communications.\n\nWhen asked if HTeaming has been developed to issue attack orders to drones that might carry weapons, Gerin-Roze said the company is exploring that option.\n\n\"To start the development, we do it without one, but as we said, stay tuned for this year,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Taiwanese airline Starlux is set to fly a new Airbus A350 variant that will expand its number of business-class seats by over 50%.\n\nThe seven-year-old startup is introducing 18 new A350-1000s to its fleet, with the first delivered in January.\n\nIts A350-1000 configuration offers 40 business-class seats, up from 26 on Starlux's current A350-900s.\n\nThe new aircraft adds 30 economy-class seats, bringing the total to 270 in coach. The rest of its A350-1000 offerings are unchanged from the A350-900, with 36 premium economy seats and four first-class suites.\n\nStarlux showcased its new plane at the Singapore Airshow this week, and Business Insider went aboard for a look.\n\nIt's known regionally for selling business-class tickets on short and medium-haul flights at roughly $1,500.\n\nSome of its longer routes, such as San Francisco to Taipei, can offer regular round-trip business-class fares as low as $2,600.\n\nSince launching flights in 2020, the Taiwanese airline has increasingly leaned on premium seat offerings, a trend among full-service carriers as market prices for economy seats have generally fallen.\n\nThe light under the passenger seat number changes from green to red when do-not-disturb mode is activated.\n\nCabin crew typically open and close the doors for passengers, but an emergency latch on the inside also allows the sliding panel to come loose.\n\nEssentially, that means the seat elevates the head and feet over the rear for better posture, so the passenger's body resembles a \"W.\"\n\nIf a passenger has two windows next to their seat, they can dim the second with a remote.\n\nThese seats have no overhead luggage compartments; instead, they feature a personal closet for each passenger. They're lined with leather, while business class seats are made of fabric.\n\nThere is no curtain or wall separating Starlux's business and first-class areas.\n\nIn-flight entertainment is available for every seat, with an extendable screen for those sitting in the front rows.\n\nChatting with a passenger across the aisle may prove more difficult on the A350-1000.\n\nThe new plane is also scheduled to begin flying Starlux's Phoenix route this summer. Starlux flies to 31 destinations, with five routes to the US.",

    "fullText": "Coach and Kate Spade designers have added AI to their design workflow.\n\nOn a Thursday earnings call, CEO Joanne Crevoiserat was asked how and where Tapestry is investing in AI.\n\nShe answered that Coach and Kate Spade's designers now use AI in their day-to-day work, but the design process starts with hand-drawn sketches.\n\n\"So there is still a human and a need for design eye, right,\" Crevoiserat said. \"They do a sketch. But what AI helps is they can iterate on that sketch.\"\n\n\"They can do color multipliers. They can make design tweaks, much faster than we could in the past,\" she added.\n\nShe said AI tools have sped up the supply chain and product development timelines, which then drive the company's growth.\n\nCoach and Kate Spade are both known for their affordable luxury handbags, popular with aspirational luxury shoppers.\n\nTapestry isn't the only fashion company that's invited AI into its design studios.\n\nA designer for the fashion label Alice + Olivia told The Wall Street Journal in January that she sees AI as a \"creativity explosion,\" and that the brand's recent collection featured tarot-card-inspired prints generated with AI tools like Leonardo AI and Adobe Firefly.\n\nAn IT and tech director for LVMH told the Journal in June that design teams in the French luxury giant are using AI to generate mood boards for inspiration.\n\nSmaller independent designers are also using AI in their processes. Business Insider reported in September that Jasline Ang, a silk designer in Singapore who worked at Goyard and Louis Vuitton, uses ChatGPT and Midjourney to create visuals for her social media campaigns. However, Ang said the tools have not been helpful in her artmaking itself.\n\nTapestry reported second-quarter revenue of $2.5 billion, a 14% increase from the same period last year. The company's stock rose more than 10% after the strong earnings. It's up 95% in the past year.\n\nCoach's sales contributed heavily to the company's success in the last quarter, rising about 25% year over year. Crevoiserat said this was driven by Coach's Tabby handbag collection, which is popular with Gen Z customers, Tapestry's target audience.\n\nHowever, Kate Spade reported a 14% drop in revenue in the last quarter compared to last year, to $360 million. Crevoiserat said this was because there had been a deliberate attempt to reduce Kate Spade's promotional activity.",

    "title": "Digital nomads in Southeast Asia are nothing new — but this city in Vietnam is now on their radar",
    "description": "As digital nomads flock to Da Nang, Vietnam, questions arise about rising rents, local impact, and the city's evolving status as a remote work hub.",
    "fullText": "\"In this video I will show you why I think Da Nang, Vietnam, is clearly the best city for digital nomads,\" Joose the Nomad says, his baby-blue eyes sparkling as he addresses his 80,000 YouTube subscribers.\n\nThe video cuts to a sweeping aerial of Da Nang's skyscraper-studded coastline before lingering in slow motion on Joose running shirtless on the beach.\n\n\"He shows the beach, the fitness studio, and some boring Westerner-focused food that doesn't really represent the city,\" Ngô Xuân Thảo tells me over a bubbling hotpot after I show her the video.\n\nNgô, 38, is from Hue, 62 miles northeast of Da Nang. She works online as a translator and speaks near-perfect English. Her experience of this city, she tells me, is vastly different than his: It's a city with rapidly rising rents and a cost of living that's outpacing wages.\n\nThe gap between Joose's sun-soaked version of Da Nang and Ngô's experience as a local trying to make rent captures a tension playing out across the city — one that raises a broader question about who benefits as Da Nang becomes a magnet for digital nomads.\n\nDa Nang — described by The New York Times as \"the Miami of Vietnam\" in its \"52 Places to Go in 2019\" list — has become the digital nomad community's latest outpost in Southeast Asia. Vietnam was included again in the Times' 2026 list, as international attention grows alongside high-end developments, including Southeast Asia's first Nobu Hotel scheduled to open later this year.\n\nI went to see whether the city is on its way to becoming the next Chiang Mai, Thailand or Bali, Indonesia, places where digital nomads have settled en masse, driving up living costs, contributing to congestion, and accelerating gentrification — trends I've watched firsthand during more than a decade of living in Hanoi, Vietnam, as a travel writer.\n\nVietnam has not introduced a long-stay visa to lure digital nomads like Thailand, but that hardly seems to matter.\n\nNomads.com, an online digital nomad community of nearly 40,000 people, listed Da Nang as Southeast Asia's fastest-growing digital nomad hot spot in 2025. Most nationalities can apply online for three-month e-visas without trouble.\n\nAuthorities seem eager to ride the wave: Nomad Fest in March 2025 actively courted digital nomads, and state-sanctioned local media regularly spotlight the city's growing popularity with remote workers.\n\nBut who exactly is the wave lifting?\n\nNgô moved here in early 2025, drawn by the city's work-life balance, a rare promise in urbanizing Vietnam. Big cities like Hồ Chí Minh City brim with opportunity but face mounting urban and environmental strain. Small cities like Hue remain largely unscathed by Vietnam's urban development, but they lack good jobs.\n\nNgô hoped that Da Nang struck the right balance — until she discovered the cost of living.\n\nBefore she started working online, Ngô says she received decent in-person job offers for international NGOs paying 12,000,000 Vietnam Dong, or $455, a month. The studio apartment she found cost her more than half of that. \"If I want a separate bedroom, then I have to pay at least 12,000,000. How can I afford that?\"\n\nNgô's landlord raised her rent after she spent a few months in the city center, prompting her to move 20 miles south to Hoi An, where she found rents to be 30% cheaper.\n\nFor many digital nomads earning international salaries, however, $455 a month in rent is a steal.\n\n\"Landlords rent out apartments short-term because they think they can keep raising the prices every few months,\" she says. \"The digital nomads are one reason. Landlords assume that foreigners will pay more.\"\n\nI drive a rented motorbike over Da Nang's iconic Dragon Bridge, the city's showpiece infrastructure project, and cruise along the 6-mile-long, palm-studded beachside boulevard.\n\nI'm heading to Hana's Coworking, a new workspace popular with digital nomads. After arriving, I edge past a beaming security guard and weave through the lower floors, thick with dust and the clatter of construction.\n\nUpstairs, the chaos gives way to calm. Where I meet Hana Nguyễn — the founder — the scene is an oasis of quiet productivity. Coders, marketers, and other nomads sit in ergonomic chairs, tapping at their keyboards and gazing out at the swaying trees on the street below. \"Now this room is full,\" Nguyễn tells me. \"That's why I'm expanding to the second floor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic, Nguyễn, 36, began spending time with digital nomads and opened a coworking room on an unused hotel floor. The idea took off, and soon she convinced her parents to convert their family home into an office for remote workers.\n\nTurns out, it wasn't a beaming security guard who greeted me at the entrance — it was Nguyễn's father.\n\nNguyễn, who moved to the neighborhood with her family in her teens, says digital nomads' presence in Da Nang is \"good for the city, the community, and jobs.\"\n\n\"Some foreigners even hire Vietnamese for online work — designers, translators, assistants.\" When I asked her if rising rent prices have become a problem, she dismissed it as a minor issue driven mainly by short-term tourism, and besides, she said, \"we just find different places to stay,\" referring to other Vietnamese residents.\n\nMarkos Korvesis, a career coach who organizes digital nomad events around the world, including Da Nang's annual Nomad Fest, said he has seen neighboring apartments turned into Airbnbs, with owners charging up to $100 a night.\n\n\"In a building I stayed in for many months, the prices were increasing because of tourists, not nomads,\" he tells me.\n\nAccording to data from analytics platform AirDNA, between March 2022, when Vietnam reopened its borders after the COVID-19 pandemic, and November 2025, the number of Airbnb and Vrbo listings in Da Nang increased by 43.8%. And while average nightly rates have fallen from their peak in 2023, they still sit 17.6% above 2022 levels.\n\nWithout an official digital nomad visa, the city government has no way to track which foreigners are working remotely, but it's safe to assume they make up only a small fraction of the millions of annual visitors.\n\nAccording to local media, Da Nang received close to 2 million international visitors in 2023 — and more than 7 million last year.\n\n\"Digital nomadism does definitely gentrify, that was very clear in Medellín, Portugal, everywhere,\" says Daniel Schlagwein, who researches digital work at Chulalongkorn University and the University of Sydney.\n\n\"But it gentrifies along the same trajectory as the broader visitor economy,\" he says.\n\nIn Chiang Mai, Schlagwein found that many locals actually preferred this kind of visitor.\n\n\"Digital nomads work during workdays in their coworking spaces just like locals, they stay longer, and they spend their money more widely in local restaurants and rentals,\" he said.\n\n\"They are not crowding temples every day like mass-package tourist groups or partying on a Tuesday night like backpackers.\"\n\nSipping a cappuccino, I take in the cosmopolitan café. A Vietnamese couple canoodles in the corner; Dutch tourists browse bags of coffee; and the approachable woman in front of me works quietly on her laptop. After we strike up a conversation, I learn she taught yoga online in Asia and Europe before arriving in Da Nang.\n\n\"I think Da Nang has the right mix of nomads, tourists, and locals,\" Tsering Yangzom, 37, told me. \"Here, people who live and work as foreigners seem more connected — like there's still a sense of balance.\"\n\nAside from the possible issue of rising rents, Da Nang does, for now at least, feel like a city in equilibrium.\n\nOther hot spots like Bali offer a template — or a warning — about how long that can last.\n\n\"At first I was really against the digital nomads, but now I see there are two kinds,\" says Gus Dark, a Balinese artist and cultural commentator known for his satirical illustrations.\n\n\"The first are people who come to work remotely but treat Bali like a screensaver — just a beautiful backdrop. They don't engage with the community. The second are those who connect with the culture and genuinely want to explore the island. Some of them seem to care about Bali even more than the Balinese.\"\n\nAs Da Nang's relationship with digital nomads is still being written, perhaps the outcome depends on who chooses to come.\n\nKnowing that Joose the Nomad now lives in Bali, I ask Gus Dark what kind of digital nomad this YouTuber might be. \"These kinds of influencers rarely appear on the local scene,\" he says with a laugh. \"So I don't really give them much attention.\"",

    "title": "SpaceX has a new way to block Russian Starlink access, and Ukrainians are hailing it as a 'catastrophe' for Moscow",
    "description": "Early reports indicate that Russian forces are encountering trouble organizing troops at the tactical level after the Starlink changes.",
    "fullText": "SpaceX moved to cut off Russian access to Starlink this week, disabling connectivity over Ukraine while maintaining a whitelist of approved Ukrainian terminals.\n\nThe new measure has spurred excitement among Ukrainian officials and pundits close to the war, who have said that Russian troops were increasingly using Starlink to guide long-range strikes and coordinate forces.\n\n\"The enemy reports a mass Starlink blackout among Russian units at the front,\" wrote Serhii Sternenko, the leader of a major Ukrainian crowdfunding organization for combat drones, on Thursday.\n\n\"If this is true, then the Ukrainian army will regain its advantage in communications, and the enemy will have a number of problems with controlling troops at the tactical level,\" he added.\n\nSerhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov, an advisor on drone warfare for Ukraine's defense ministry, wrote that the move had disrupted Russian ground assaults in some frontline areas.\n\n\"The enemy doesn't even have a problem on the fronts. The enemy has a catastrophe,\" he wrote on Telegram.\n\nDue to US sanctions after the Kremlin's full-scale invasion began in 2022, SpaceX doesn't sell Starlink terminals to Russia.\n\nBut Ukrainian troops have long raised concerns that Moscow's troops were acquiring terminals from the black market, with Kyiv saying it's found the US tech in downed reconnaissance drones.\n\nPressure for SpaceX to curb Russian access reached a fever pitch last month, as Ukrainian defense officials said they'd begun seeing Starlink terminals on long-range strike drones.\n\nCutting off the Kremlin's forces from Starlink, however, has been more complicated than simple geofencing. Ukrainian troops also use Starlink, so disabling access in contested regions would have affected Kyiv's operations.\n\nThat appears to be changing with the new whitelist. For the last few days, Ukraine's defense ministry and Telegram influencers have been calling on troops to quickly register their terminals under the country's DELTA battlespace management system.\n\nThe access restrictions are likely to extend to civilian areas far from the front lines, due to concerns of Starlink being used to guide the Russian Shahed-type attack drones targeting cities.\n\nBusinesses must apply for access via an online portal, while civilians were told to bring all their private Starlink terminals to administrative centers along with a national ID.\n\nThe whitelist is updated every day, said Ukraine's defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov.\n\n\"We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that were included in the whitelist is already working,\" he wrote on Thursday.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, urged Ukrainian users to join the whitelist.\n\n\"Important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine,\" he wrote on social media on Thursday.\n\nThe connectivity changes have also been reported to cut Starlink access for terminals traveling faster than 75 kilometers per hour, or roughly 46 miles per hour, in an effort to shut down attack-drone guidance.\n\nIt's not yet clear exactly how the new Starlink measures will affect the war, but early reports from Russia and Ukraine indicate the move is already affecting the battlefield.\n\nRybar, a prominent Telegram channel run by a Russian military blogger, wrote on Thursday that the Starlink restrictions would \"temporarily slow down\" Moscow's combat operations.\n\nThe channel, which had until this week been calling on its followers to donate or fund Starlink terminals for Russian troops, also wrote on February 1 that the Kremlin needed to start developing \"domestic equivalents\" of communication systems for the front lines.\n\nRybar downplayed the impact on Russian operations, saying that the Starlink whitelist could also play to the Kremlin's advantage.\n\n\"If the system is hacked, such a list would give Russian troops the geolocation of numerous Ukrainian Armed Forces positions,\" he wrote in a separate post.\n\nRoman Alekhin, another Russian military blogger, raised concerns on Thursday that Russian forces may not have ready alternatives to Starlink and might instead temporarily rely on fiber optics for frontline communications.\n\n\"This is all very bad, especially considering the huge need for communications at the front,\" he wrote.\n\nUkrainian Telegram channels, meanwhile, hailed the outage as a potential significant blow to Russian forces.\n\n\"The enemy even installed terminals on tanks to adjust fire online,\" Sternenko wrote. \"There will be no more. This is just the beginning.\"\n\nThe Wild Hornets, a Ukrainian drone maker, posted a photo it said showed the wreckage of a Russian Gerbera decoy drone that bore a vulgarity-laden message directed at Musk.\n\nStill, some Ukrainian forces also reported being affected by the outages.\n\n\"It was found out from our troops that there were problems with those who did not promptly submit lists for private Starlinks,\" wrote Beskrestnov, the Ukrainian drone advisor. \"The processing process is ongoing.\"\n\nFedorov, who was confirmed as Ukraine's new defense minister last month, thanked SpaceX and Musk for introducing the Starlink measures.\n\n'Thanks to the first steps taken in recent days, no Ukrainians have been killed by Russian drones using Starlink — and that is priceless,\" he wrote.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.",

    "description": "The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since Presiden...",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to office and sought to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nHigh-level military communication was suspended in late 2021, as tension between Moscow and Washington rose ahead of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump then campaigned for a second term on promises that he would swiftly end the fighting. Many of his proposals for peace have heavily favored the Kremlin, including requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.\n\nThe restored communication channel “will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,” the U.S. European Command said in a statement. The agreement emerged from a meeting between senior Russian and American military officials in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who is the commander in Europe of both U.S. and NATO forces, was in Abu Dhabi, where talks between American, Russian and Ukrainian officials on ending the war entered a second day.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow escalated its attacks on Ukraine’s power grid in an apparent effort to deny civilians power and to weaken public support for the fight, while hostilities continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.\n\nThe resumption of the military hotline marks an effort to ease tensions that soared after the start of the war and to avoid collisions between Russian and U.S. forces.\n\nIn one such incident in March 2023, the American military said it ditched an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Black Sea after a pair of Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on it, and then one of them struck its propeller while flying in international airspace.\n\nMoscow has denied that its warplanes hit the drone, alleging that it crashed while making a sharp maneuver. The Kremlin said its aircraft reacted to a violation of a no-fly zone Russia has established in the area near Crimea.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly voiced concern about intelligence flights by the U.S. and other NATO aircraft over the Black Sea, and some Russian officials charged that the American surveillance flights helped gather intelligence that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian targets.\n\nNATO members have been increasingly worried about intrusions into allied airspace. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO’s response.\n\nIn September, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland’s airspace, prompting NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since the full-scale invasion. Later that month, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia’s airspace.\n\nRussia, Ukraine exchange prisoners following talks\n\nThe delegations from Moscow and Kyiv were joined Thursday in Abu Dhabi by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council chief, who was present at the meeting.\n\nThey were also at last month's talks in the same place as the Trump administration tries to steer Russia and Ukraine toward a settlement.\n\nOfficials have provided no information about any progress in the discussions.\n\nFollowing the talks on Thursday, however, Russia and Ukraine said they carried out a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it brought 157 Russian servicemen back from Ukrainian captivity, as well as three Russian nationals captured during Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Ukrainian officials said 150 Ukrainian servicemen and seven civilians returned from Russian captivity.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the released Russian soldiers are currently in Belarus, getting medical assistance, before being taken back to Russia “for treatment and rehabilitation.”\n\nUkrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that among the 150 service members who returned from Russian captivity, 18 were \"illegally sentenced by Russia.” He said that “overall, those released are in a difficult psychological condition, and some are critically underweight.”\n\nZelenskyy says 55,000 Ukrainian troops killed in the war\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died since Russia’s invasion. “And there is a large number of people whom Ukraine considers missing,” he added in an interview broadcast late Wednesday by French TV channel France 2.\n\nThe last time Zelenskyy gave a figure for battlefield deaths, in early 2025, he said 46,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.\n\nZelenskyy has repeatedly said his country needs security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe to deter any postwar Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainians must feel that there is genuine progress toward peace and “not toward a scenario in which the Russians exploit everything to their advantage and continue their strikes,” Zelenskyy said on social media late Wednesday.\n\nLast year saw a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties compared with 2024, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nAlmost 15,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and just over 40,000 wounded since the start of the war through last December, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops have lost access to their Starlink satellite internet terminals on the front line, Ukrainian Economic Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Thursday, after Ukraine asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have consequently lost command-and-control capabilities and navigation for drones, and assaults have stopped in many sectors, according to Fedorov’s adviser Serhii Beskrestnov. Russian officials made no immediate comment.\n\nUkraine is registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.\n\nAlso, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said during a visit to Kyiv that he agreed with Zelenskyy to develop the joint production of ammunition at plants in their countries.\n\nZelenskyy said Poland plans to increase supplies to Ukraine of liquefied natural gas, and the countries are exploring an exchange of weaponry, with Kyiv possibly receiving Polish MiG fighter jets and Warsaw receiving Ukrainian drones.\n\nRussia fired 183 drones and two ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Three people were injured, officials said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight over several regions, the Azov Sea and Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nThis story corrects an earlier version that said Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2016. The annexation happened in 2014.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "The chaos is mostly a tech-stock phenomenon. The equal-weight S&P 500 is actually at a record high.",
    "fullText": "S&P 500 futures were flat-to-up this morning before the markets opened in New York, a sign that traders may be temporarily sated after the carnage they wreaked in the stock markets over the past few days. The index fell 0.51% yesterday, closing at 6,882, after spending much of the previous month flirting with the 7,000 level.\n\nMarkets were flat or down globally this morning, with the worst performer being South Korea’s KOSPI, which lost 3.86%.\n\nThe damage came from the tech and software sector, as investors began to realize that the promise of AI won’t always be sunshine and roses. Until recently, the markets had assumed that companies would be buoyed by the massive amount of capex (capital expenditure) going into AI, and that AI would generate new efficiencies and higher productivity that would ultimately result in higher revenues and earnings per share. Over the past few days, however, traders have reacted to the notion that AI also has the power to destroy the revenues of companies reliant on selling traditional software that can be replaced by AI.\n\nWhat signals indicate the tech correction may continue?\n\nWhy are retail traders buying during market dips?\n\nHow is equal-weight S&P performing versus cap-weighted?\n\nWhat caused the $1 trillion software market selloff?\n\nAs much as $1 trillion was wiped off the market cap of software companies yesterday, according to Bloomberg. Alphabet closed down nearly 2% yesterday and lost a further 2.53% overnight after revealing on its earnings call that it planned to double AI capex. The beatdown on Alphabet shares came despite better-than-forecast revenue growth that indicates the company’s advertising sales are in no way being cannibalized by consumer adoption of AI, including its own Gemini AI chatbot and its AI Mode in Google Search.\n\nThat’s a problem because until very recently the performance of the S&P 500 was governed by the heavy weight of tech stocks, like Alphabet, within it. “By the end of 2025, the 10 largest companies accounted for nearly 41% of the S&P 500’s total weight,” according to RBC Wealth Management.\n\nBut the chaos is mostly a tech-only phenomenon, the data says. The equal-weight S&P 500—a notional index that values each of the 500 companies equally rather than by total market cap—is actually at a record high this morning because the non-tech companies inside it are doing rather well.\n\n“Tech stocks are being squeezed sharply, but a lot of broader indices are still holding up for the most part,” Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank told clients this morning. There were “363 advancers in the S&P 500 [yesterday], which was actually the most in two weeks.”\n\nPeople are buying stocks, just not tech stocks.\n\nSo who is behind this selective buying? Retail traders who love to buy the dip, is one theory, according to Axios. Retail buyers—ordinary folks trading their own accounts—used to be referred to as “the dumb money” among the institutional investors of Wall Street because they historically waited too long to jump into bull markets and sold too late into bear markets, the opposite of what you’d want to do.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that demands made by Democrats for new restrictions on federal immigration officers are “unrealistic” and warned that the Department of Homeland Security will shut down next week if they do not work with Republicans and the White House.\n\nDemocrats say they will not vote for a DHS spending bill when funding runs out unless there are “dramatic changes” at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies in the wake of the fatal shootings of two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nThe Democratic leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, released an expanded list of 10 detailed proposals on Wednesday night for restraining President Donald Trump’s aggressive campaign of immigration enforcement. Among the demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use of force standards and a stop to racial profiling.\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump last week agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated from a larger spending measure and extended at current levels for two weeks while the two parties negotiate. The deal came after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans agreed that new restrictions were necessary.\n\nBut with nearly a week gone, a shutdown is becoming increasingly likely starting Feb. 14 as Republicans have been cool to most of the Democrats’ requests.\n\n“This is not a blank check situation where Republicans just do agree to a list of Democrat demands,” said Thune, R-S.D. “The only way to get reforms to ICE is to agree to a bill.”\n\nAs of now, Thune said, “we aren’t anywhere close to having any sort of an agreement.”\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., said he is “astounded to hear” Republicans say his party’s proposals were political or unworkable.\n\n“It’s about people’s basic rights, it’s about people’s safety,” Schumer said. If Republicans do not like the ideas, he said, “they need to explain why.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries, D-N.Y., have made several demands, including no masks for officers, judicial warrants and better federal coordination with local authorities. The list they released Wednesday added several new items, including a stricter use-of-force policy, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nDemocrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it's verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nThey also want an end to racial profiling, saying DHS officers should be prohibited from stopping, questioning or searching people \"based on an individual’s presence at certain locations, their job, their spoken language and accent or their race and ethnicity.”\n\nFor officers conducting immigration enforcement, Democrats say that in addition to officers taking off their masks and showing identification, DHS should regulate and standardize uniforms and equipment to bring them in line with other law enforcement agencies.\n\nSchumer called it a “gut check moment for Congress\" as the immigration enforcement operations have rocked Minneapolis and other U.S. cities. But Republicans were dismissive.\n\nWyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican senator, said the demands are “radical and extreme” and a “far-left wish list.”\n\nSen. Katie Britt, who is helping lead negotiations, said the list is “a ridiculous Christmas list of demands\" and warned that time is running out before the deadline.\n\n“I encourage them to talk to the White House,” she said. “We only have one week left.”\n\nThune has also encouraged Democrats and the White House to talk. It is unclear whether they are or whether Democrats would be willing to back down on any of their demands.\n\nSome Republicans have demands of their own, including adding legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said it is up to Republicans to ensure the government doesn't shut down because they are in charge.\n\n“The American people want this abuse to stop,” Murphy said.\n\nSome look to limit shutdown pain\n\nOther lawmakers are searching for options to prevent another partial shutdown.\n\nOne idea being floated is to essentially fund some of the other agencies within DHS -– the Coast Guard, airport operations under TSA and disaster assistance from FEMA.\n\n“Why not take that off the table?” said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, whose state is in need of FEMA funds from recent disasters.\n\n“If it doesn’t look like they can get it done,” he said about the immigration enforcement overhaul. “I really think they should look at a la carte funding of agencies.”\n\nSome Democrats have said they agree, but Thune said Thursday that splitting apart the DHS appropriations bill to single out ICE would “defund law enforcement.”\n\nSplitting the bill would mean essentially cutting ICE loose by allowing it to go without its routine federal funding because the agency already has such a robust budget from Trump’s tax and spending cut bill from last year.\n\nICE is expected to receive about $10 billion in the annual appropriations bill, a fraction of the $175 billion-plus for homeland security for the administration’s mass deportation agenda.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped to $67,000 per token on Thursday, falling to its lowest level since 2024 as selling pressure intensified.\n\nThe token extended losses from the prior session after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled that the US government would not step in to support the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nBitcoin fell to as low as $67,073 apiece early Thursday, continuing Wednesday's slump that followed Bessent's comments.\n\nThe decline was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\nWhat are analysts saying about Bitcoin's support levels?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop to $67,000 Thursday?\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed year-to-date in 2024?\n\nWhat did Treasury Secretary Bessent say about crypto?\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower on Thursday only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply last weekend to notch its fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement last Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nAfter bitcoin earlier broke through the key support level at $73,000, 10X Research strategists wrote that \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully.\"\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

The largest derivatives liquidation event on record kicked off a sell-off that has yet to find a floor. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has since fallen to zero.\n\nThe financial strain on miners has intensified sharply in recent weeks. Daily Bitcoin mining revenue plunged from roughly $45 million to a yearly low of $28 million in late January, driven by a combination of falling prices and severe US winter storms that forced large operators to curtail production.\n\nOutput from the largest publicly traded miners dropped from roughly 77 Bitcoin per day to just 28 over the same period, according to CryptoQuant.\n\nAverage block times have drifted to roughly 11.6 minutes, well above the protocol’s 10-minute target, reflecting the volume of hashpower that has gone offline.\n\nThe Miner Profit and Loss Sustainability Index has slid to 21, confirming that revenues are failing to cover costs for a significant portion of the network. Older models, including the Antminer S19 XP+ and MicroBT M60S, are no longer profitable at current difficulty and standard electricity rates of $0.08 per kilowatt-hour.\n\nEven newer S21-series machines are approaching their shutdown price range of $69,000 to $74,000, as previously reported.\n\nThe next Bitcoin difficulty retarget, projected for February 8, is estimated to cut mining difficulty by approximately 14% to around 121 trillion, down from the current 141.67 trillion.",

    "fullText": "Reducing plastic use is a priority for many restaurants, but it's not always so straightforward. A move by McDonald's to introduce a \"reusable\" mixing spindle for its McFlurry drew the ire of an employee and sparked debate on whether it did more harm than good.\n\nThe employee shared a photo of the new spindle to the r/McDonaldsEmployees subreddit in a post titled \"I'd like to point out this McBull****.\"\n\nThey poked holes in the company's initiative by pointing out that the old spindles fulfilled two roles as both spindle and de facto spoon given to the customer. They called that old scheme \"simple\" and \"genius.\"\n\nThe big flaw with the new initiative was replacing the spindle as a serving utensil was a plastic spoon wrapped in more plastic. They questioned whether that was actually an upgrade, while alluding to the inconvenience of employees now having to clean the reusable spindles throughout the day.\n\n\"I already can see problems with this,\" a commenter wrote. They worried employees would mistakenly give out the spindle, and customers would complain about that switch.\n\nA user theorized: \"The spindle spoon is heavier and more plastic? But I agree, it's all posturing.\"\n\nOther commenters said their locations had unwrapped wooden spoons, which could certainly result in a measurable decrease in plastic usage. Potential cost savings on cheaper plastic were another working theory.\n\nSingle-use plastics contribute significantly to environmental pollution, often ending up in landfills. From there, they can produce potent gases like methane. Microplastics from these plastics can also leach out and enter ecosystems, as well as food and water sources.\n\nSome of the biggest contributors to plastic pollution are chain restaurants, and while they're taking initiatives aimed at reducing their waste, it's important that those steps are actually effective.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMcDonald's has taken steps to address its plastic usage. By the end of 2024 over 90% of its primary guest packaging was sourced from renewable, recycled or certified sources, per its corporate website.\n\nFor McFlurries, it'd be nice to see if the company was more transparent in revealing how the shift reduced plastic usage. Another move could be offering more eco-friendly options than wrapped plastic spoons at its restaurants.\n\nFinding alternatives to plastic is a continuing project for researchers and entrepreneurs around the globe. Reuse-and-return schemes are a proposed way to save plastics from going straight to the landfill.\n\nConsumers can reduce their usage of single-use plastics and put pressure on businesses to find alternatives while being more transparent about so-called sustainable moves.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A routine fuel stop turned into a national political flashpoint after a gas station employee refused service to federal immigration agents, igniting a debate that now reaches far beyond politics and squarely into the automotive and fuel retail space.\n\nThe incident unfolded at a Speedway gas station in Minneapolis when Border Patrol agents attempted to refuel government vehicles during official operations.\n\nAccording to video footage that quickly spread online, a man identifying himself as the store’s manager denied service and stated bluntly that he did not support ICE, adding that no one at the store did either. The agents were told to leave without being allowed to purchase fuel.\n\nWithin hours, the encounter became a lightning rod. Critics accused the business of politicizing a basic commercial service, while supporters framed the refusal as a form of protest.\n\nBut for the automotive and fuel industries, the episode raises deeper questions about neutrality, safety, and the evolving role of gas stations in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nFuel stations occupy a unique position in American infrastructure for the simple fact that they aren’t simply retail outlets. They are essential service points relied upon by private motorists, commercial fleets, emergency responders, and, yes, government agencies like ICE.\n\nDenying fuel is not equivalent to refusing a cup of coffee or retail merchandise. Vehicles without fuel do not operate, and in the case of law enforcement or emergency services, that reality carries serious implications.\n\nIndustry experts note that while private businesses generally retain the right to refuse service, gas stations historically operate under an expectation of political neutrality. Fleet contracts, fuel cards, and government supply agreements are built on reliability, not ideology.\n\nOnce a station is perceived as selectively serving customers based on political or occupational identity, that reliability comes into question.\n\nThe fallout for Speedway and its parent companies has been swift. Calls for boycotts surfaced almost immediately, with critics warning that the brand risks alienating everyday drivers who view fuel access as nonpartisan.\n\nOthers warned of reputational damage that could ripple across franchise networks, where individual store decisions can reflect on national brands regardless of corporate policy.\n\nThere is also a safety dimension that automotive analysts are watching closely. Federal agents often refuel during active operations or long-distance deployments. Forcing vehicles to reroute in search of fuel introduces delays and unpredictability.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last month that he was finally prepared to drop his freeze on billions of dollars in funding for a major New York infrastructure project.\n\nBut there was a condition: In exchange for the money, Schumer had to agree to rename New York’s Penn Station and Washington’s Dulles International Airport after Trump.\n\nThe startling offer, which was described by two people familiar with the conversation, was swiftly rejected by Schumer, who told the president he didn’t have the power to deliver on such an unorthodox request.\n\nIn the weeks since, Trump has continued to withhold the more than $16 billion earmarked for the long-planned Gateway project connecting New York and New Jersey through a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River.\n\nThe two states are now suing the Trump administration over the freeze, alleging in a complaint filed earlier this week that the funding suspension is unlawful.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe episode, first reported by Punchbowl, offers a fresh window into Trump’s ever-expanding effort to secure an outsized place in American history — and to do so in part by branding nearly everything around him with his own name.\n\nSince returning to the White House, the president has introduced a slew of initiatives bearing the Trump name, including the Trump Gold Card offering a high-priced path to citizenship, the TrumpRx website offering lower-priced prescription drugs, and a new Trump-class battleship meant to solidify his era of “peace through strength” foreign policy for years to come.\n\nTrump in recent months has set his sights on even bigger targets: Adding his name first to the US Institute of Peace and then, even more controversially, to Washington’s iconic Kennedy Center.\n\nStill, Trump’s offer to Schumer would have represented perhaps his most audacious move yet, an apparent attempt to leverage the future of a massive infrastructure project to fulfill his own personal wishes.\n\nThe commission in charge of the Gateway tunnel has warned that it will soon have to shut down work on the project and lay off roughly 1,000 workers if the Trump administration does not release the funding it needs.\n\nThe tunnel’s construction predates Trump’s return to office, with the federal government on the hook for a significant portion of the funding needed to complete it. But Trump moved to halt the project late last year, a decision that Democratic officials in New Jersey and New York have argued was politically motivated.\n\nSchumer has since played a central role in trying to negotiate the unfreezing of the funding. Yet despite that priority, there’s little that the Democrat could conceivably do on his own to put Trump’s name on either Penn Station or Dulles Airport.\n\nWhile some conservative lawmakers have already introduced legislation to rename Dulles as the “Donald J. Trump International Airport,” it’s so far gained little traction.\n\nThe legislation has not advanced in the GOP-controlled Congress, and as a result remains unlikely to pass.",

He said the authorities have not set up temporary housing.\n\nSeparately, the governor of neighbouring Russia's region ‍of Bryansk said Ukraine hit energy facilities using HIMARS missiles and drones, causing power outage at some settlements.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said last week they had halted strikes on each ​other's energy infrastructure, but they disagreed on the timeframe for the moratorium. ‌The strikes resumed earlier this week.\n\nThe reported attacks took place against the background of U.S.-brokered peace talks.\n\nA post on the unofficial Russian Telegram channel Mash, which has sources in the security services, said missiles had hit the city that lies about 40 km (25 miles) from the Ukrainian border and power had been cut ⁠in some districts.\n\nIn his morning address, Gladkov said the works to restore electric power supply continue.\n\n\"As of today, we have not ‍been able to fully ⁠restore electricity supply in Belgorod,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian forces have regularly attacked Belgorod and nearby parts of the region since Russia's February 2022 invasion ⁠of its smaller neighbour.\n\nUkraine has said Russian missile and drone attacks on the capital Kyiv in ‌January left about a million people without electricity.",

    "fullText": "US stock futures moved lower early Monday as Amazon’s (AMZN) post-earnings slide weighed heavily on tech sentiment and investors braced for further wreckage after a bruising session on Wall Street.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) slid 0.3%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.1%.\n\nThe overnight moves followed a sharp sell-off during Thursday’s regular session, led once again by technology stocks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have now slipped into negative territory for 2026.\n\nAnd after the bell, Amazon (AMZN) added to the gloom. Shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading after the company posted earnings per share that missed Wall Street estimates and projected capital expenditures of $200 billion for the year, raising concerns about the extent of AI spend.\n\nThe risk-off tone extended beyond equities. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued sliding, touching levels not seen since 2024, while silver (SI=F) resumed its decline after a recent surge fueled by retail investor interest. Strategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by bitcoin's sell-off, sending shares down.\n\nEarnings also drove Reddit (RDDT) upward after reporting a quarterly earnings beat, issuing upbeat guidance, and announcing a stock buyback program. Roblox (RBLX) shares also surged. Looking ahead, investors will focus on earnings from Toyota (TM) and Philip Morris (PM), due before Friday’s opening bell.\n\nMeanwhile, the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week following the resolution of the federal government shutdown. But other data this week has shown fresh signs of trouble for the labor market, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.",

    "fullText": "Having won only one of their past six Premier League games and drawn 2-2 at Tottenham after being 2-0 up, can second-placed Manchester City get back on track at Liverpool on Sunday?\n\n\"I wouldn't rule City out of anything at the moment\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\n\"But the way they folded in the second half against Tottenham was a real worry.\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 25 is Gladiators star Apollo, real name Alex Gray, who supports Newcastle.\n\nBefore becoming a Gladiator, the 6ft 6in Gray played Premiership rugby for three teams and also American Football for NFL side Atlanta Falcons.\n\nHe is part of Channel 5's Big Game Night NFL coverage and they are live on Super Bowl Sunday on 8 February from 22:30 GMT.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own Premier League predictions below - and for the Super Bowl too!\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nThe NFL's influence can be seen in the Premier League through the kind of choreographed corner routines that are now commonplace, and Apollo can understand why Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has shared ideas with Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay.\n\nApollo told BBC Sport: \"While football is quite a free-flowing game you do have these set-pieces and if you need some inspiration of how to make things happen then the NFL is a good place to look at, because that's what they do all day every day - not just on offence but on defence as well.\n\n\"What you are always trying to get in the NFL is mismatches, and that's exactly the same in football for some of the big guys coming in and trying to put the ball in the back of the net with a header or whatever.\n\n\"The level of detail that goes into that in the NFL is incredible. I remember my days there in training camp would start with breakfast at 7.30am and some days you wouldn't leave the meeting rooms until 11pm.\n\n\"We were only on the field for two hours max and in the gym for another hour, and the rest would be meetings and analysis.\n\n\"The scrutiny on every individual is so high so I can see why other sports would look at that and try to implement it themselves to find some weakness in the opposition armour. Arteta must have been thinking it is a way to help his team win games.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Apollo - aka Alex Gray - were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.\n\nI am at this game and we are getting to the stage where it really matters how the teams fighting relegation do in their head-to-head-battles like this.\n\nI think the bottom two, Wolves and Burnley are down, but you don't know what West Ham will do from here.\n\nThere are signs they may click, so with Leeds and Nottingham Forest both on 26 points, this is big for both of them.\n\nFrom a Leeds point of view, their home form has carried them a lot this season.\n\nThey got walloped at Elland Road by Arsenal last weekend but they just have to put that behind them for this game because, as the season has gone on, they have proved they can be competitive.\n\nForest's away form is actually better than their home form - they have picked up 14 points on the road compared to 12 at the City Ground, in the same number of games.\n\nSean Dyche's side were comfortable with 10 men in the draw against Crystal Palace last time out and they have won their past two away games, against Brentford and the Hammers. Overall, they are unbeaten in four league games, which is the longest they have gone without losing all season.\n\nAs you can see, I've looked into all the stats for you - but will my research help me get my prediction right? Probably not.\n\nThis is going to be a very tight affair and Forest won't worry about having much possession, but scoring goals has been a bigger problem for them because they have missed Chris Wood badly - only Wolves have scored fewer than them.\n\nForest have brought in 6ft 7in striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli to try to fill the gap left by Wood's long-term knee injury but he has not been in great form in Serie A this season.\n\nSo, after a great deal of thought, I am going to back Leeds at home - although now I've said that it will probably end up as a 1-1 draw.\n\nApollo's prediction: When I looked at the fixtures I was thinking about who in the Gladiators supports who. Two of the guys, Giant and Hammer, are big Forest fans so I am going for a Leeds win here. It should be a good game though. 3-2\n\nManchester United were slightly fortunate to beat Fulham last time out. A draw would have been about right.\n\nStill, it was big for Benjamin Sesko to get their winner and I have got to say he put it away very nicely, especially because he should have scored with a header earlier in the game.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, produced a great comeback against Manchester City. I've talked about how much I rate Dominic Solanke and when he is up for Spurs, they are in a much better place as a team.\n\nThere is a danger of getting carried away with United under Michael Carrick, and I am expecting Solanke to score again here, but it still feels like United will find a way to win it.\n\nApollo's prediction: Tottenham have an affinity with the NFL and I've been to a couple of games there so I am backing them here. 0-1\n\nLosing back-to-back home league games against Everton and Brentford has been a real killer for Aston Villa, who have so many injuries to contend with in their midfield.\n\nAfter a long wait for a win, Bournemouth have now won three of their past four league games - and I make them favourites at home here.\n\nVilla thumped the Cherries 4-0 at Villa Park in November, and I have got a lot of their players in my Fantasy team, but this is going to be a very different game.\n\nI've gone for 2-1 wins in my first two games and I don't really want to go for that scoreline again here, but I feel like I have no choice. I do think Villa will score - Morgan Rogers is always dangerous and Tammy Abraham is a clever signing up front - but Bournemouth will edge it.\n\nApollo's prediction: It's great for Villa to be in a title race. 1-2\n\nI am not going to say 2-1 for this one. Instead it will be another Arsenal clean sheet - they have already kept 12 in their first 24 league games, two more than any other team.\n\nIt's a shame Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka is not fit to face his old club at the Emirates. When he played for the Black Cats against Arsenal in their draw at the Stadium of Light, they were the first team I saw who really rattled the Gunners.\n\nXhaka's experience has helped to glue together a Sunderland side with a lot of young players this season, but they coped all right without him against Burnley on Monday.\n\nThis is a much tougher game for them, obviously, and Sunderland's away form is nowhere near as strong as it is at home.\n\nArsenal swept Leeds aside 4-0 last weekend, when everyone thought they were having a bit of a blip.\n\nThey showed their strength in depth at Elland Road, when they lost Bukayo Saka in the warm-up, and I can see them winning comfortably this time too.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is very easy for me because Legend and Fire both support Arsenal and are real die-hard fans - Legend even has a cannon tattoo - so being absolutely honest I would love Sunderland to win, and do it for the north-east! 0-2\n\nI think Burnley are down but this is their chance to prove me wrong.\n\nThey need it to be - they are at home, against a team one place above them in the table, so this is their big chance to end their long wait for a win.\n\nI just don't see it happening for the Clarets, though.\n\nAs I said earlier, I am not sure which West Ham side will turn up but they have shown some improvement recently, especially in attack.\n\nI don't think the Hammers will keep a clean sheet because they have had only one all season - the fewest by any top-flight team - but I don't see Burnley beating them.\n\nApollo's prediction: My cousins are lifelong Burnley fans and season-ticket holders so if I didn't back them here, I'd be in a lot of trouble. The former NFL player, JJ Watt, is a co-owner of the club too, so for the NFL links and family ties, it's got to be a home win. 2-1\n\nEverton asked about Fulham forward Harry Wilson on deadline day.\n\nHe has been a revelation this season and they won't be looking forward to facing him on Saturday.\n\nThe Toffees have got something after falling behind in their past three league games, including the last-gasp equaliser against Brighton that saw poor David Moyes booked for his celebration - there is no way you should get a yellow card for that.\n\nThis is going to be another close game and it smells of another 2-1 to me, but I am not going to go down that road again this week.\n\nInstead, I'm going for a different scoreline but sticking with a narrow Fulham win. Marco Silva will feel his side deserved something from Old Trafford and it will be him celebrating at the final whistle this week, not Moyes.\n\nApollo's prediction: We don't like draws in the NFL but this might up all-square. 1-1\n\nChelsea were accused of being too negative in their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal in midweek, but I can't see that being the case here.\n\nI was far too optimistic about Wolves last week when I said they would draw with Bournemouth and I am not making the same mistake this time.\n\nThe games have been coming thick and fast for Chelsea and I actually admire their manager Liam Rosenior for the way he changed things up in their 3-2 comeback win over West Ham after being 2-0 down.\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards has probably got one eye on preparing for next season in the Championship, and his side will be one step nearer to that after this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: I went to a couple of Chelsea games when I lived in London and they will get the job done here. 1-2\n\nYou just wonder how much Newcastle have got left in the tank after their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday.\n\nThe Magpies have a few injuries to contend with too, with Anthony Gordon the latest player to be sidelined, so they will have to dig deep and hope Bruno Guimaraes is back fit in time for this game.\n\nBrentford got one heck of a win last time out at Villa, and their manager Keith Andrews deserves a lot of credit for getting that result despite being down to 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nThe Bees are always so well organised at the back, and how Eddie Howe's side try to break them down will be the key to this one.\n\nAs good as Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade is with his back to goal, he doesn't run in behind.\n\nDoing that, and attacking with pace, is how Eddie Howe's side look the most dangerous - Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga will have to do that here, and I fancy Yoane Wissa to score against his former club.\n\nApollo on why he supports Newcastle: I am from a small town in County Durham - my grandmother went to school with Sir Bobby Robson - so I had the choice of Newcastle, Sunderland or Middlesbrough. I know it is absolute blasphemy to say this, but I like to see all the north-east clubs do well.\n\nNewcastle are my team though, because that's who I went to watch first - I went to see them against Ipswich in 2000, and Alan Shearer scored a couple - and it is my city as well. I played rugby for them and I lived there. It's a fantastic place and it's even better when the team is going well.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is going to be a Newcastle win, it's just a case of how much. Brentford's performance coach Ben Ryan used to coach me for England Sevens, then he went to Fiji and got a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, so it would be nice to get one over him as well. 3-1\n\nPalace have brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen, and kept Jean-Philippe Mateta, so Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has got some options up front.\n\nI normally predict a draw in this game, and it ended up 0-0 at Selhurst Park in November. This time, though, I fancy Brighton.\n\nThe Seagulls didn't quite get over the line against Everton, but them conceding late on actually won me some points. I am going for them to keep a clean sheet here though.\n\nApollo's prediction: Palace to edge it. 0-1\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola starts with Omar Marmoush up front ahead of Erling Haaland after his two goals against Newcastle in midweek, but their attack looks strong anyway with Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo in the team.\n\nThe same applies to Liverpool, who have got a striker in form in Hugo Ekitike, while Florian Wirtz is playing with confidence too.\n\nCity will have moments where they will create chances, but Liverpool are going to have opportunities at the other end as well - there will be a few goals in this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is the 'Super Bowl' game of the weekend in the Premier League so I've gone for an NFL-type score as well as a football one. 22-31 (2-3)\n\nSuper Bowl, Levi's Stadium 23:30 GMT\n\nI haven't got a clue about the NFL and I never played gridiron - my nose would be too big and would stick out of the helmet - but I am going for the Seahawks to down the Patriots on Sunday.\n\nSeattle is a really nice place and I played in their stadium for Celtic, so they get my backing here... although that's probably bad news for them, going by how I've done at predictions this season.\n\nApollo's prediction: The Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Aden Durde, was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program that took me to Atlanta. If he gets a Super Bowl, it would be the biggest accomplishment from someone from Britain in the NFL. 21-18\n\nFor the second successive week, the outcome went to the final game.\n\nChris, the BBC readers and AI were all level on 80 points going into Monday's match between Sunderland and Burnley, with his guest - boxer Francesca Hennessy - on 40 points.\n\nChris and Francesca went for a 1-0 Black Cats victory, the BBC readers thought they would win 2-0, while AI picked a 1-1 draw.\n\nSunderland were 2-0 up after 32 minutes but the BBC readers' hopes of an outright win were scuppered when Chemsdine Talbi scored their third goal, 18 minutes from time.\n\nThat meant Chris and the BBC readers tied for victory - they both managed six correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 matches in week 24, for a total of 90 points.\n\nAI managed five correct results with one correct score for a tally of 80 points, while Francesca also managed five correct results but with no exact scores, leaving her on 50 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "To coincide with the start of his new podcast series, Gareth Rhys Owen looks at the role Louis Rees-Zammit is playing in the changing face of rugby in Wales.",
    "fullText": "To coincide with the start of his new podcast series on BBC Sounds, Gareth Rhys Owen investigates if Louis Rees-Zammit, who quit rugby to pursue his American Football dream, can now, after his return, help Welsh rugby through its current nightmare.\n\nAs the Six Nations returns, Welsh rugby finds itself in a familiar place.\n\nHope, doubt, expectation and anxiety – all bundled together, all competing for space. It os the rhythm of this championship. But this year, one name cuts through more than most.\n\nRees-Zammit at full-back for Wales against England\n\n'No bigger game' - Rees-Zammit on England v Wales rivalry\n\nA few months ago, I found myself in a BBC meeting room pitching a different podcast.\n\nThat shift was not accidental. It reflected something broader.\n\nAt 25, Rees-Zammit has already lived several sporting lives. A meteoric rise in Welsh rugby. A global profile built on speed, confidence and comfort in front of the camera. Then the decision that stopped people mid-scroll: leaving rugby to try his hand in the NFL.\n\nIt was bold. It was ambitious. And crucially, it was very him.\n\nThe American chapter did not unfold like a Hollywood script. The NFL is unforgiving, complex and not designed for outsiders to stroll in and succeed. But when Rees-Zammit returned to Wales, what struck me was not disappointment. It was attention.\n\nAt Rees-Zammit's first press conference after coming home, the room buzzed. Clips of him speaking and training flew across social media. One short video hit a million views across our Instagram and TikTok accounts.\n\nBecause Welsh rugby has always understood heroes – but it has not always understood reach.\n\nPrevious generations of players sold something deeper than popularity. Sir Gareth Edwards and Shane Williams did not just excite crowds, they embodied belief, identity and collective pride. They did not need to think about platforms or algorithms.\n\nRees-Zammit lives in a different sporting world.\n\nHe is comfortable in spaces rugby traditionally avoided. He understands how athletes are now consumed, not just on terraces but on phones. He does not apologise for that. And that is precisely why he divides opinion.\n\nSome see style over substance. Others see evolution.\n\nTo explore that divide, I spoke to journalists, fans and fellow broadcasters. One who has spent decades covering Welsh rugby and, like many of his generation, asked a fair question: what is actually new here?\n\nBut when I took the same conversation on to the streets of Cardiff, the response was striking.\n\nFans, particularly younger ones, see Rees-Zammit as a bridge between rugby and a wider audience. Between tradition and modern sport. Between a game fighting for relevance and a generation that consumes it differently.\n\nThey do not see him as a problem. They see him as an opportunity.\n\nRees-Zammit left NFL after 'wasting his talent'\n\nWhy is it so hard to break into the NFL?\n\nThat is where the Six Nations comes back into focus.\n\nThis competition has always been about more than results. It is about narrative, momentum and belief. The stories that carry teams through February and March.\n\nWelsh rugby needs those stories again.\n\nIt needs reasons for people to care, not just about outcomes but about direction. About where the game is heading and who is carrying it there.\n\nRees-Zammit does not have to be the answer to every question. But he does represent a version of Welsh rugby that is not shrinking from the modern world. One that is not embarrassed by popularity. One that understands visibility is not the enemy of authenticity.\n\nThat does not mean tradition disappears. It means it adapts.\n\nSaturday, 7 February, 16:40 GMT\n\nLive audio commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru and on the BBC Sport website alongside live text commentary.\n\nAnd maybe that is the real tension playing out right now. Not whether Louis Rees-Zammit belongs in Welsh rugby, but whether Welsh rugby is ready to fully embrace what players like him represent.\n\nAs the Six Nations begins, that question feels unavoidable.\n\nBecause this is no longer just about one player's career path. It is about how Welsh rugby tells its story, who it wants listening and how it plans to compete, not just on the pitch but in the wider sporting conversation.\n\nThat is the heart of Golden Boy: Louis Rees-Zammit, a series that uses his journey as a lens to explore the changing face of Welsh rugby, its pressures, its possibilities and its future.\n\nAs Wales prepare to start another Six Nations campaign against England on Saturday, it feels like the right moment to ask those questions.\n\nAnd Rees-Zammit, whether by design or instinct, is right at the centre of them.",

    "description": "Ski jumping has been pushed into the spotlight after a whistleblower uncovered a cheating scandal that involves, of all things, crotch manipulation.",
    "fullText": "MILAN — Adrian Livelten hunched over a sewing machine last March on the eve of the men’s ski jumping competition at the Nordic World Ski Championships.\n\nThe suit technician for Norway’s national ski jumping team brazenly made alterations to suits belonging to the country’s two top contenders after those suits had already passed inspection. Livelten did this in plain view of Norway ski jumping head coach Magnus Brevik, seated in a chair halfway across the room.\n\nWhat neither Livelten nor Brevik realized at the time was that someone was recording them in secrecy from behind a curtain, someone who intended to distribute the video far and wide the following day. The damning footage shared by the anonymous whistleblower shook the sport of ski jumping, bringing out into the open the cheating that happened behind closed doors.\n\nWhen officials from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) seized suits belonging to reigning Olympic champion Marius Lindvik and fellow Norwegian Johann André Forfang, they found rules violations that initially went unnoticed during the competition. Stiffer, non-elastic thread had been sewn into the suits to pull down the crotch area during flight, increasing the surface area and creating more aerodynamic lift in a sport where inches can be the difference between medaling and missing the podium.\n\n\"Probably the most shocking part was that it was Norway because they’ve always been considered one of the more standup teams,” said Johnny Spillane, the first American to medal in the sport of Nordic combined, which consists of ski jumping and cross-country skiing. \"Everyone is going to push the limits. That hasn't changed and that probably will never change, but this was deliberately altering a suit after it had been tested in order to cheat. This was the most blatant cheating I've heard of.\"\n\nThe Norway cheating scandal highlighted two irrefutable facts about the crotch-obsessed sport of ski jumping on the precipice of the 2026 Winter Olympics. There is, as Finnish coach Petter Kukkonen put it last April, “a culture of cheating” in ski jumping. And the battleground between unscrupulous teams and rule-upholding regulators is often below the belt.\n\nMale ski jumpers must wear tight-fitting suits that are no more than 4 centimeters larger than their body measurements at any point. Most national teams seek to find every millimeter they can because a bigger, baggier suit catches more wind and provides more lift during flight than a smaller one does.\n\nFittingly, the most advantageous place to enlarge a ski jumper’s suit is the crotch area. Adding just a centimeter of fabric to the circumference of that part of a suit increases flight distance by approximately 2.8 meters — or more than 9 feet — according to a study published by Frontiers in Sports and Active Living in October 2025.\n\nAthletes chasing that competitive advantage have resorted to trickery when having their body dimensions measured prior to a competition. The more they reduce the distance between their inseam and the floor when FIS equipment controllers record their body measurements, the lower regulators will allow the crotch of their suit to hang while airborne.\n\nIn November 2020, Kukkonen told Finland’s leading tabloid newspaper that athletes were stuffing dish cloths and sponges in their underwear during body measuring. In a recent appearance on the Skirious Problems podcast, Austria’s Mika Vermeulen revealed that when he competed in nordic combined earlier in his career, veterans told him before his first body measuring, “It’s very important to tape your c*** back.”\n\nVermeulen later described ski jumpers putting modeling clay in their underwear to lower their crotch-to-floor measurement by five centimeters.\n\n“People used to cheat a f*** ton,” Vermeulen said.\n\nSalacious stories like those were already pushing ski jumping out of the margins and into the mainstream entering these Olympics. Then the German tabloid Bild sparked further curiosity in January when it reported that ski jumpers have worn condom-like sleeves filled with hyaluronic acid to enlarge themselves before measurement.\n\n“When I read that article, all I could do was shake my head,” USA Ski Jumping and Nordic Combined sport director Anders Johnson said. “If that is really what other people were doing previously, I can't believe that that's how far people have taken it.”\n\nOn Thursday, the alleged scandal went to the top of the performance-enhancing food chain when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was asked about it just 24 hours before the Opening Ceremony of the 2026 Olympics.\n\n\"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that [an enlarged crotch area in their suits] could improve performance,” WADA president Witold Banka said. “If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"\n\nCheating in ski jumping isn’t a new phenomenon. Athletes have been pushing boundaries and exploiting loopholes ever since the sport’s governing body began setting rules restricting how far they can fly.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Austrian national team unveiled suits that were highly permeable in the front but did not allow air to pass through in the back. The resulting parachute effect helped Austrian jumpers take gold and silver in the men’s large-hill event at the 1976 Winter Olympics. Seventeen-year-old Austrian prodigy Toni Innauer set a world record the following month and then bettered it two days later.\n\nThe success of those suits inspired copycat attempts, some well-executed, others not so much. Former American ski jumper Jeff Hastings recalls an early 1980s competitor who “put a garbage bag in the back of his suit to try to get the ‘76 Austrian effect.”\n\n“Everybody could hear him up there rustling like crazy,” Hastings said. “It wasn’t even effective but he was just trying to get a little advantage.”\n\nDetailed rules governing the air permeability of ski jumping suits soon went into effect, but that didn’t deter athletes eager to find even the slightest competitive advantage. Retired ski jumpers have admitted to coating the back of their suits with hairspray or slathering on wood glue in an effort to reduce air flow, improve lift and fly longer.\n\n“You name it, people have tried it,” Spillane said.\n\nAs the sport’s deep-pocketed superpowers stopped buying suits from third-party manufacturers and started hiring sophisticated specialists to produce them in-house, new opportunities to cheat have materialized over the past 10-15 years. Teams sought to gain an advantage by creating custom suits for athletes that exceeded their body measurement by as much as possible without resulting in a disqualification.\n\nThe ideal place to add material is where the legs converge, according to Dr. John Goff, visiting physics professor at the University of Puget Sound and author of the book Gold Medal Physics. The crotch area of the suit is naturally stretched wide with a jumper’s legs in a “V” position during flight. It’s also close to the body’s center of gravity, helping an athlete gain lift without sacrificing control.\n\n“The crotch region, where the legs part, is kind of a sharp transition point,” Goff said. “If you can put some kind of material there to smooth that out, you can reduce the turbulence and increase the lift for the skier. That can have a pretty big influence on the flight.”\n\nFor FIS regulators seeking to prevent teams from gaining an advantage, the process starts with athletes stripping down to their underwear. Athletes must have their body dimensions measured before competitions in the presence of an FIS equipment controller, a team official and a qualified doctor or nurse.\n\nSince 2023, those measurements have sometimes been taken with the help of a 3D body scanner. Before then, it was always a manual process. As American Nordic Combined skier and 2018 Olympian Ben Berend once detailed in a blog post, that made the crotch measurement part of this process particularly awkward.\n\n“The process consists of standing with your feet 40 cm apart wearing nothing but underwear,” Berend wrote in 2016. “Then a metal rod is moved up as high as possible until it hits your junk. The measurement is essentially junk to floor in centimeters.”\n\nThe intrusiveness doesn’t end once the measuring process is over. Athletes also must endure what FIS described in a 2023 memo as a “visual crotch area inspection.” A supervising doctor or nurse checks the athlete “for any irregularities in the genital area” — in other words an artificial prosthesis in the athlete’s underwear that could reduce the crotch-to-floor measurement.\n\nAs a result of stories like the ones shared by Kukkonen and Vermeulen, the process is fraught with suspicion that national teams are finding ways to bypass the rules.\n\nA friend recently sent Hastings a screenshot of one of the world’s top-ranked ski jumpers in mid-flight last year.\n\n“The crotch on his suit practically came down to his knees,” Hastings said. “I’m exaggerating a little bit, but it looked like he had a diaper on.”\n\nBetween suspicious images like that one, unconfirmed gossip about which teams were cheating and the knowledge of how much difference a little extra fabric can make, Johnson admits it creates a toxic culture.\n\n“If one team starts cheating, then two or three start doing it,” Johnson said. “Once you have the best nations in the world doing it, then everyone kind of has to follow suit. It just spreads like wildfire and then once it does, it’s really hard to get back.”\n\nThe chicanery mostly occurred in secret until the anonymous whistleblower shined a spotlight on Norway’s dishonesty and turned the birthplace of ski jumping into a symbol for everything wrong with the sport. Austria, Slovenia and Poland filed formal protests against the Norwegians during the World Championships and called for their results to be annulled.\n\n“This is doping, just with a different needle,” former German Olympic champion Jens Weissflog told the German newspaper Bild at the time.\n\nLindvik and Forgang claimed ignorance, insisting they never would have jumped had they known their suits were rigged. When their coaches backed them, the Norwegian ski jumpers received suspensions of just three months, enabling them to return in time for the 2025-26 World Cup season and the Olympics, where the men’s competition begins on Feb 9.\n\nThe penalty was harsher for Livelten, Brevik and Norway assistant coach Thomas Lobben, each of whom confessed to being part of the conspiracy. On January 15, an independent ethics panel backed the FIS’s request for a punishment strong enough to serve as a deterrent against future cheating, suspending the trio for 18 months apiece.\n\n“In (the panel’s) view, now is indeed the appropriate time to put down a clear marker to what is not acceptable,” the panel’s scathing ruling read.\n\nFor many in American ski jumping circles, the Norway cheating scandal entangled close friends. In 2022, USA Ski Jumping signed a formal partnership with the Norwegian national team for the current Olympic cycle to hold joint training camps and coaching clinics and to collaborate on sports science.\n\nWhile Johnson doesn’t condone what Norway did, he also bristles at how the Norwegians have become “the scapegoat for a much broader issue within our sport.”\n\n“There has been a lot of hypocrisy from other nations,” Johnson said. “I don’t have any personal beef with any of these teams, but it was incredibly disappointing for me to see the response from some of the nations. I think everyone needs to take a look at themselves in the mirror. No one can say they were fully clean. They can only claim they are because they didn’t get caught.”\n\nEmbarrassed by the Norway scandal, FIS has since hired new equipment control coordinators and introduced sweeping reforms for the 2025-26 season. The changes include increased use of 3D scanners for pre-event body measurements, more precisely defined rules for how suits can be cut and shaped and more training for equipment controllers who oversee pre- and post-jump inspections.\n\nHarsher sanctions can now be issued for rules violations during 3D measurement or for the manipulation of a suit after it has passed inspection. Athletes disqualified for an equipment violation during a competition will receive a yellow card. A further transgression will result in a red card and suspension from the following event.\n\nTo Johnson and many others in the ski jumping community, the most notable change is one that has gone unmentioned in any FIS press release.\n\nIn the past, Johnson found that “it was much easier for FIS to discard or disqualify athletes from smaller nations because they didn’t have that political pull in the sport.” This year, highly ranked jumpers from prominent nations have been cited for equipment violations, athletes like Slovenia’s Timi Zajc, who was tied for second place at an event in Germany earlier this winter when he was disqualified for suit violation.\n\n“This year, it doesn’t seem to matter if you’re from Austria or Slovenia or Poland or the United States,” Johnson said. They’re enforcing the rules for everyone.”\n\nAs the world’s top ski jumpers prepare to showcase their talents on the Olympic stage this month, the obvious question is whether the competition will be fair. Will the threat of stricter rules and tougher punishments be enough to deter cheaters? Or will the pursuit of Olympic glory tempt some countries to try to skirt the rules?\n\n“Going into this Olympics, I have a lot more faith and trust in the system,” Johnson said, “but I still have my reservations that teams are really going to be in compliance, that they’re not going to be trying something new.”",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher Tanner Scott revealed he wants L.A. to re-sign reliever Evan Phillips.\n\nThe Dodgers non-tendered the veteran reliever earlier in the offseason due to the injury he sustained. Rather than paying him for a whole season — which he wouldn’t pitch much in after undergoing Tommy John surgery — the Dodgers released him into the free agency pool.\n\n“I do talk to Evan quite often,” Scott said at DodgerFest on Saturday. “I mean, we’ll see where it goes. I like the guy and hope he comes back.”\n\nPhillips and Scott had history before the Dodgers, playing together on the Baltimore Orioles from 2018-20 and reuniting after the Dodgers signed Scott ahead of 2025.\n\nPhillips pitched just seven games for the Dodgers last season before his injury, but had a fantastic run to kick off the year. He didn’t allow a run through 5.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe Dodgers will certainly consider bringing Phillips back, as he is a great weapon to have in the bullpen.\n\nHe had a 2.22 ERA through 201 appearances with the Dodgers, and never allowed a run for the Dodgers in the postseason. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman addressed the idea of bringing him back earlier in the offseason.\n\n“We had a number of back and forth discussions with Evan and his free agent,” Friedman said. ” It is challenging with him coming off surgery so he is going to take some time and look to sign after he throws off the mound when his rehab allows. Evan has been a big part of our past success and we will continue the conversation about bringing him back. We respect that he is taking this time to decide what is best for him and his family.”\n\nEvery team in baseball could use an arm like Phillips, and the Dodgers would likely have a leg up on the rest of the league if they were to move for the right-hander later in the season.\n\nThe post Tanner Scott Wants Dodgers to Bring Back Free Agent Reliever appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "The Cowboys were rumored to be part of the NFL's international games in 2026, and that has proven to be true.",
    "fullText": "In 2026, the Dallas Cowboys will be among the teams taking part in the NFL's international games.\n\nWith the thought that the Cowboys could head down under to Australia and even to Mexico after Jerry Jones made it clear he would be interested in such a move, Dallas now knows where it will be heading in 2026.\n\nIt will be the first time the Cowboys have played an international game since 2014, and coach Brian Schottenheimer's team is off to Rio de Janeiro in 2026.\n\nWe don't know who their opponents will be, but it will no doubt be a huge draw given the Cowboys are involved.\n\nAfter a failed 2025 season, the Cowboys will now look towards the 2026 season as one where they can mount a bounce-back and make the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.\n\nAnd playing in Brazil will certainly have its perks.\n\nMost of all, the marketing side, which we know Jerry and the Cowboys will eat up.\n\nSchottenheimer will lead his Cowboys to a place they've never played an NFL game before, nor the NFL, as Maracanã Stadium will host the game, with the previous outings in Brazil being played in São Paulo, so it will be another career first for the head coach.\n\nWhat is rather interesting about the Cowboys playing in Brazil is that, as we understand it, it will be a home game at AT&T Stadium, and so the franchise is giving up the revenue that goes with that.\n\nBut of course, there are riches to be mined internationally, too.\n\nReportedly, the Cowboys' potential opponents for the game are the Buccaneers, Titans, Jaguars, Niners, Cardinals, and Ravens.\n\nThat is, providing the NFL doesn't make it an NFC East showdown, which does seem highly unlikely, but you never know in the NFL.\n\nSo there will be a lot to monitor over the coming weeks and months, as the Cowboys go international for the first time in over a decade, with Schottenheimer's new-look Dallas team leading the way.\n\nThe Ravens loom as a good opponent for the Cowboys, as do the 49ers, but they are already heading to Australia to face the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nEither way, the Cowboys are going to be part of the international series, and that's exciting.",

Anytime you get in this profession as a coach or player, to try and reach a pinnacle of a profession is what you strive for.

    "fullText": "Days before Super Bowl LX, the Seattle Seahawks suddenly have an injury concern on the defensive side of the football\n\nStandout rookie safety Nick Emmanwori, a critical component of the Seahawks secondary and a contender for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, injured his ankle on Wednesday during practice ahead of Super Bowl LX. According to the pool practice report, Emmanwori was “limited in practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury that he suffered during practice.”\n\nAs the report notes, Emmanwori “walked off the field on his own shortly before 4 p.m. Several players and coaches went over to comfort him before he left.”\n\nAsked about the situation after practice, Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald stated that the safety “had an ankle today, we brought him in to look at it, and we’ll kind of go from here and figure out what are the next steps?”\n\nThe rookie safety is a key contributor to Seattle’s defense, the top scoring unit in the NFL. He has lined up all over the field for the Seahawks, spending most of his time down in the box but he has also seen time in the slot, on the outside, and even as a deep safety. His ability to be a stout defender against the run while holding up in coverage allows Seattle to rely on their sub defensive packages, while still being able to slow down opposing rushing attacks.\n\nHe was spotted walking under his own power into the team hotel following practice, but with a noticeable limp:\n\nPlease be alright Nick pic.twitter.com/8TUnAuiqy1\n\n— ᴅᴏxx ⚡️ (@new_era72) February 5, 2026\n\nHis health will be a huge story to follow ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\nUpdate (Thursday evening): Emmanwori did not practice on Thursday due to the ankle injury:\n\nS Nick Emmanwori did not practice because of his ankle injury. https://t.co/J7upYXE0Ne\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 6, 2026",

    "title": "BYU’s defense is to blame for 3 consecutive losses. What’s gone wrong?",
    "description": "Since the start of Big 12 play, the Cougars have been among the league’s worst defensive squads.",
    "fullText": "BYU’s offense did its job Wednesday night.\n\nYes, the Cougars turned the ball over too much, but they also shot 50% from the field, 43% from 3-point range and scored 92 points, which is all typically more than enough offensive firepower to capture road wins in the Big 12.\n\nBut instead of picking up a much-needed, stabilizing Quad 1 victory at Oklahoma State, BYU found itself on the wrong end of a memorable 99-92 upset, as the Cougars’ defense completely whiffed against the Cowboys.\n\nBYU offered little resistance against the Cowboys, who drove downhill all night to score 52 points in the paint — something a frustrated Kevin Young repeatedly mentioned to reporters following the loss, and an increase of more than 20 points from BYU’s previous season average of paint points allowed.\n\nIn the second half alone, Oklahoma State scored 58 points at a blistering average of 1.57 points per possession. Every time the Cowboys had the ball after halftime, they ended up 1.57 points richer, with BYU only stopping them 24.3% of the time.\n\nAccording to the defensive analytics provided by StatBroadcast, neither AJ Dybantsa nor Richie Saunders, two typically solid defenders, recorded a single defensive stop against Oklahoma State. Every time the Cowboys targeted Dybantsa or Saunders, they scored.\n\nBYU’s remaining starters weren’t much better on the defensive end. When Rob Wright III, Kennard Davis Jr. and Keba Keita were on the floor, Oklahoma State averaged 153.4, 148.8 and 146.8 points per 100 possessions each, respectively.\n\n“Our defense, it was terrible,” Young said after the loss. “They had 52 points in the paint. They scored at will. We couldn’t keep anyone in front of us, and it was just a layup fest.”\n\nYoung later added, “We couldn’t guard the ball. We got too spread out. That’s way too many, you know, 52 points in the paint, it’s not good, right? And then attention to detail, that’s something that our team has struggled with ... but more than anything, just our one-on-one defense was abysmal.”\n\nWednesday’s letdown was the loudest example of BYU’s most troubling recent trend — a widespread defensive plunge.\n\nAs noted by broadcaster Greg Wrubell on X, the Cougars ranked No. 17 nationally in KenPom’s defensive efficiency metric back on Jan. 5. Just a month later, BYU has plummeted 25 spots to No. 42.\n\nBYU's KenPom offensive and defensive efficiency ratings on--\n\nJan. 5:\n10th AdjO\n17th AdjD\n\nFeb. 5:\n10th AdjO\n42nd AdjD\n\n— Greg Wrubell (@gregwrubell) February 5, 2026\n\nBeing the country’s 42nd-best defensive team may appear fine on paper, especially considering BYU ranked No. 82 at the end of last season. But the Cougars’ defensive results since the start of Big 12 play, which spurred the 25-spot slide, are cause for major concern.\n\nBYU is allowing Big 12 opponents to score 83.4 points per game, ranking 13th out of 16 teams in the conference. The only teams behind the Cougars are Kansas State, Arizona State, and Utah, who are all far outside of the NCAA Tournament conversation.\n\nFor comparison, top-10-ranked Houston, Iowa State and Arizona are all allowing Big 12 averages of 63.3, 67.7 and 71.9 points each, respectively — quite the gap from BYU’s 83.4 mark.\n\nIn their current three-game losing skid, the Cougars have surrendered 275 points (91.67 per game), with Arizona, Kansas and Oklahoma State combining to make 61.9% of their 2-point baskets.\n\nDuring BYU's 3 game losing streak, they have allowed opponents to shoot 61.9% from 2 point range.\n\nFor the entire season, the worst defense in 2pt% allowed in the nation is 62.5% by Chicago St.\n\n61.9% would be the 2nd worst in the nation.\n\n— CougarStats (@CougarStats) February 5, 2026\n\nBYU has to figure out a way to get stops, disrupt opposing rhythm and guard without fouling so often. The Cougars can’t rely on their offense to bail them out of shootouts every night — look at how that’s gone the past three games.\n\nDuring nonconference play, BYU enjoyed various flashes of defensive brilliance, albeit against lesser competition than the current Big 12 gauntlet.\n\nThe Cougars don’t need newfound brilliance, but if they can’t quickly figure out some sort of improvement to yield defensive respectability, their postseason ceiling becomes dramatically lower. Defense will determine how far BYU plays into March.\n\n“... We’re just going through it right now,” Young said. “We’ve just got to lick our wounds and just work, work, work and figure out what each guy individually can do to help the team right now.”",

The Court DENIES the motions to stay proceedings,” according to the minute order. “UCLA also filed a motion to quash deposition subpoenas and enter a protective order. The Court DENIES UCLA’s motion to quash.”\n\nIn addition to UCLA’s request, the judge also denied similar arbitration motions filed by Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC and StadCo LA LLC, both entities affiliated with SoFi Stadium.\n\nThe City and the Rose Bowl Operating Company welcomed the decision, saying the ruling clears the way for the case to move forward in court.\n\n“For more than forty years, UCLA has benefited from a unique partnership with the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl, a partnership that was memorialized in a carefully negotiated contract that extends through 2044,” the statement said. “That agreement was the foundation for hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer-backed investments made to modernize and preserve one of the most iconic sports venues in the world. In return, UCLA made a clear and binding commitment to play its home football games at the Rose Bowl through 2044 and expressly waived any right to terminate that commitment early, and we are confident that a court will agree.”\n\nUCLA is currently in a legal battle with the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Operating Company. The city and the company sued the prestigious university to prevent the university from breaking its lease. UCLA is under contract with the Rose Bowl through 2044.\n\nThe post Judge Forces Arbitration in Multi-Million Dollar Rosel Bowl Lawsuit appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "With the transfer portal window now closed, the full picture of roster movement is clear. Many programs saw heavy losses because of coaching changes. Others dealt with exits due to playing time or system changes. Some schools managed the damage quickly. Others now face long rebuilds. Here is a breakdown of the schools with the most transfer portal departures. (Via CFB)\n\nCal fired Justin Wilcox and hired Tosh Lupoi from Oregon. That move triggered roster turnover. A total of 35 players entered the portal. The Bears kept their most important player in quarterback Jaron Kaewe Sagapolutele. He impressed as a freshman in 2025. Cal added 31 new transfers to stabilize the roster. Keeping the starting quarterback helped limit the impact.\n\nAuburn made a coaching change by firing Hugh Freeze. That decision caused major exits. The biggest loss was wide receiver Cam Coleman, who transferred to Texas. Other departures included Kayin Lee, Kensley Louidor Faustin, Horatio Fields, Amaris Williams, Xavier Chaplin and Malik Blocton. New coach Alex Golesh rebuilt quickly. He added 39 transfers, including 13 from USF. Quarterback Byrum Brown followed Golesh and is expected to lead the offense.\n\nFlorida State finished 5-7 in 2025 and placed 13th in the ACC. That season led to heavy movement. A total of 36 players entered the portal. Key exits included Earl Little Jr., Lawayne McCoy, Randy Pittman, Edwin Joseph and Justin Cryer. Mike Norvell responded by adding 22 transfers. Quarterback Ashton Daniels and running back Tre Wisner are set to lead the offense in 2026.\n\nMichigan State fired Jonathan Smith and hired Pat Fitzgerald. The coaching change caused 37 players to leave. Losses included Makhi Frazier, Aisea Moa, Chance Rucker, Aidan Chiles and Nick Marsh. Quarterback Alessio Milivojevic stayed and finished the season as the starter. The Spartans added 28 transfers. Wide receiver KK Smith and center Trent Fraley were key additions.\n\nArkansas fired Sam Pittman during the season and hired Ryan Silverfield from Memphis. That move led to 38 portal entries. Jaheim Singletary and Jac’Qawn McRoy were among the top departures. Silverfield rebuilt fast by adding 41 new transfers. Arkansas ranked eighth in the On3 Team Transfer Portal Rankings. New players included Steven Soles from Kentucky and Jasper Parker from Michigan.\n\nMississippi State also had 38 players leave. Jeff Lebby enters his third year as head coach. The Bulldogs lost several starters, including Jayvin James to Alabama and Zack Owens to Missouri. Jayven Williams transferred to BYU, while Kedrick Bingley Jones went to Alabama. Quarterback KaMario Taylor stayed and is expected to start in 2026. Mississippi State added 24 transfers, including seven offensive linemen. Wide receiver Marquis Johnson joined from Missouri.\n\nWest Virginia continued reshaping its roster under Rich Rodriguez. The Mountaineers lost 44 players to the portal and added 34 new ones. Quarterback Michael Hawkins transferred from Oklahoma and is expected to start. Experience was lost on the offensive line with Donovan Haslam heading to Tennessee. Wide receiver Cam Vaughn transferred to Miami. The program remains in rebuild mode.\n\nPenn State fired James Franklin in October. That move opened the door for mass departures in January. A total of 46 players left the program. New coach Matt Campbell kept linebacker Tony Rojas and cornerback Daryus Dixson. Several players followed Franklin to Virginia Tech. Twelve Penn State players transferred to Blacksburg, including quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer and tight end Luke Reynolds.\n\nIowa State saw 54 players enter the portal after Matt Campbell left for Penn State. His exit ended a long era with the Cyclones. Top players who left included Rocco Becht, Benjamin Brahmer, Marcus Neal and Jeremiah Cooper. Campbell brought 23 Iowa State players with him to Penn State. Jimmy Rogers was hired from Washington State to replace him. He added 48 new players to stop the losses. Replacing that level of talent will be difficult.\n\nOklahoma State led the nation with 64 transfer portal exits. Mike Gundy was fired three games into the 2025 season. That move opened a 30 day portal window for players. A second window in January raised the total even higher. New coach Eric Morris arrived from North Texas and rebuilt the roster fast. He added 54 new transfers. Quarterback Drew Mestemaker and running back Caleb Hawkins followed him from North Texas. Notable losses included Wendell Gregory, Jaylen Lloyd and Noah McKinney.\n\nThe transfer portal changed the direction of many programs this cycle. Coaching changes caused the largest waves of exits. Oklahoma State and Iowa State were hit the hardest. Penn State and West Virginia also saw major losses. Other teams balanced departures with strong transfer classes. How well these schools recover will shape the 2026 season.\n\nThe post Schools with highest college football transfer portal departures appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "The day has arrived where Olympians like Eileen Gu are making millions, not by what she does on a ski slope, but through content she creates for Instagram.",
    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — On Jan. 9, freestyle skier Eileen Gu posted on Instagram a “Day in my life” video commemorating the one-month countdown to the Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\nGlimpses of Gu brushing her teeth, eating breakfast, riding a ski lift, practicing tricks on a giant airbag, cooling down with a 5 kilometer run, talking to the media, completing a doping test and reading a book while she’s in a hyperbaric chamber were all stuffed into a 29-second Instagram reel.\n\nWithin 10 days, it generated more than a million views.\n\nSo it’s probably no coincidence that Gu, the American-born dual gold medal winner who chose to compete for China in 2019, was the fourth highest-paid female athlete of 2025.  According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of her $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nWhile sponsorships have always been crucial to the earning potential of Olympic athletes, who generally aren’t raking in huge sums of prize money, financial success no longer hinges on whose image lands on the Wheaties box.\n\nNow most of it happens on social media, where the line between Olympic athletes and influencers has been blurred — usually to the benefit of their pocketbooks as this Winter Games draws close.\n\n“The number of Olympians who have become more popular and made money in the Olympics has grown exponentially,” said Doug Shabelman, the CEO of Chicago-based Burns Entertainment, a firm that matches celebrities and athletes with marketing opportunities. “Now everybody, whether you win or lose, can be an influencer. Before you had to win gold medals, you had to do something special. Now social media has leveled the playing field, and the marketability of these athletes is 365 days a year.”\n\nGu is among the handful of Olympic athletes at the top of that food chain along with the likes of Simone Biles and Lindsey Vonn. It’s no surprise given Gu’s success in the sport and her endorsement potential in China, which likely played at least some role in her choice to represent her mother’s homeland rather than the more crowded American market.\n\nBut you don’t need to be the most successful winter sports athlete in a country of 1.4 billion people to leverage social media for endorsement dollars.\n\nTake freestyle skier Alex Ferreira. Once a year, he puts on a prosthetic mask, a gray wig and fake facial hair to make him look like a skiing has-been, goes to the slopes with a film crew, talks trash to younger skiers and shocks crowds as executes Olympic-level tricks.\n\nThe character, “Hot Dog Hans,” was inspired by Kyrie Irving’s portrayal of streetball legend “Uncle Drew.” Though it started out as a one-time gag a few years ago, Ferreira realized within 15 minutes of his first day in costume that it was something he could draw out into a multi-episode series of short films.\n\nThe full Hans skits now generate hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube, with the clips drawing millions on Instagram. And while it may have started as a fun distraction, it has become a high-profile example of how an Olympic athlete who is not particularly famous in the mainstream world can find a niche that leads to dollars.\n\n“We’re in this day and age where your main job is to compete, learn new tricks, go to these contests and win them,” Ferreira said. “But the other half of the business is gaining sponsors, so you need to create content as well. I’m a professional skier, but I’m also an influencer in a way. Basically, when you think the job is over, you have to get back and get on the computer and start cranking out content. When I started, it was much less than that.”\n\nThough the content game does require more time outside of traditional training and media obligations, it keeps many athletes in the mix during those four-year gaps between Olympics when they don’t get as much mainstream attention. And then, once an Olympics begins, you never really know what’s going to hit.\n\nOne of the biggest social media stars of the Paris Games was Henrik Christiansen, a Norwegian swimmer who did not finish better than 20th in any of his three events but went viral for videos about chocolate chip muffins in the athletes’ village. The “Muffin Man” now has more than 500,000 followers on TikTok and is still trading off the joke. One of his most popular recent videos from last October shows him whisking cocoa powder into a mixing bowl trying to replicate a recipe he’s watching on television.\n\n“I’m 56, and our generation, we still look at it like, ‘We want to see the winners and the great stories,’” Shabelman said. “But a different generation has different things they’re more interested in, and there are so many different avenues now, so many different ways to get your story and your personality out that it changed the game in a big way on the marketing side.\n\n“It’s not just the winners anymore. Engagement on social media with fans is so important to marketers because they don’t just want to see how many people look at videos. They want to see who’s engaging, who has that accessibility and who has something that other people don’t.”\n\nIt also helps that Olympic sports, particularly in the winter, have great visuals that lend themselves to social media. Whether it’s a striking costume being worn by a figure skater, a gravity-defying trick on a snowboard or simply the backdrop of a snow-capped mountain, Winter Olympians don’t necessarily have to stretch far outside their comfort zone to create eye-catching content.\n\nMany of Gu’s posts, for instance, have nothing to do with sports and fall more into the category of modeling or a peek into the lifestyle of a rich, young woman who travels the world like a true celebrity and hangs out with other celebrities. They are slickly produced and undeniably targeted to demographics that are not watching the Freestyle Ski World Cup.\n\n“We are still a society that does value attractiveness and different elements that we all have come to know about people who are endorsers,” Shabelman said. “But then you also add on being really good at building great content, you have a lot of (famous) friends you might tag in a post and that might get you even more followers.”\n\nThough not every Olympic athlete handles their social media as seriously or professionally as Gu, it’s now just a fact of life that maximizing endorsement potential — which is what keeps many of these Olympians going in sports that don’t offer big prize money — often runs through Instagram or TikTok.\n\n“Content creation is what’s happening right now,” snowboarder Jamie Anderson said. “It’s bigger than almost anything. There are YouTubers making more money than NFL players. So it really doesn’t matter what I think about it, it’s happening. You kind of have to move with the waves. It’s definitely the future of marketing and sports. Times have changed quick.”",

    "description": "Listen to Falcons president Matt Ryan indirectly prove why the Bears are being cheated out of compensatory picks for Ian Cunningham.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears have seen several departures in the front office and coaching staff this offseason, including assistant general manager Ian Cunningham taking the Atlanta Falcons' GM job.\n\nIt's a departure several years in the making as Cunningham was always primed for a promotion, and the consolation prize for Chicago was always going to be two third-round compensatory picks (one for two consecutive NFL drafts). But, at least right now, the Bears aren't slated to receive comp picks for Cunningham given Matt Ryan is the Falcons' President of Football Operations and Cunningham wouldn't be the main guy in charge.\n\nBut from everything that we've heard, Cunningham would be the guy steering the ship in Atlanta, which means Chicago should be receiving comp picks following his loss (via the Rooney Rule). But don't take it from me. Hear it straight from the mouth of Ryan, who explains that Cunningham will be in charge of the roster, which indicates a promotion and would warrant compensatory picks.\n\n#Falcons president Matt Ryan says GM Ian Cunningham will be the one driving the ship and in charge when it comes to the draft and free agency.\n\n(🎥 @NFLonCBS) pic.twitter.com/i9jg4OKM1K\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) February 5, 2026\n\n\"Ian's in charge,\" Ryan told NFL on CBS. \"Ian's in charge of (free agency and the NFL draft). I'm looking forward to learning about this. I said it the other day in Ian's presser, I've never sat in a draft meeting. Monday's going to be the first time I'm sitting in a draft meeting, so I've got a lot to learn. Sitting, observing, being a fly on the wall. If there's something Ian has a question about or something I can help with, I'm all ears and I'm happy to share my opinion. But Ian is driving this boat, and he is the one leading us moving forward.\"\n\nThe NFL typically awards compensatory picks in early-to-late March, so nothing is official right now. And if the Bears want to appeal the league's potential stance on no comp picks for Cunningham, this video of Ryan describing how Cunningham will indeed be running the Falcons would certainly help Chicago's case.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Matt Ryan's comments prove Bears are getting cheated out of comp picks",

    "fullText": "Yongin FC may be new to the K League stage, but they appear ready to upset the old guard. Backed by a city hall with deep pockets, Yongin have snapped up several big-name free agents. Is this a recipe for success, or are Yongin about to become an expensive retirement home?\n\nThe most important thing to understand is that Yongin FC are a brand-new club. They have never played a competitive match of football. Yongin are a K League 2 side because the local city hall applied for membership and met the minimum requirements set out by the governing body.\n\nThey boast a training centre and a modern 35,000-capacity stadium that has already hosted international football, AFC Champions League fixtures, and K League matches. Not to mention, they have assembled a playing squad dripping with experience.\n\nFormer Gwangju striker Gabriel returns to Korea after an unsuccessful spell in Japan. At 24, the Brazilian forward is at an ideal age, especially given his prior K League experience. He scored eight goals and provided five assists in 33 matches during the 2024 season. The powerful striker has the physique and attributes to excel in K League 2.\n\nAside from his military service with Sangmu, Kim Bo-sub has been with Incheon United since his teens. A two-time K League 2 champion, he has over 200 appearances across multiple positions. Korean clubs value versatile, two-footed players, and Kim fits that mould perfectly.\n\nKim Min-woo will aim to bring all his experience to Mireu Stadium.\n\nKim Min-woo is another highly experienced, multi-position free agent to sign on for the Yongin project. He also brings 23 Korea Republic caps, along with experience in Japan, China, and domestically with Suwon Bluewings and Ulsan HD. However, he failed to make a significant impact after returning to Suwon last summer.\n\nWhen Portuguese goalkeeper Emanuel Novo signed on New Year’s Day, he did something no foreign goalkeeper had done in the 21st century: he registered with a K League club. The 26-year ban on foreign goalkeepers is officially over. Novo has played in Portugal, Saudi Arabia, and Romania, and will face competition from former Incheon United keeper Hwang Seong-min.\n\nAt 37, Shin Jin-ho’s best days may be behind him, but he can still have a very positive impact on the squad. When players gather for the first time, they will see a midfielder with 430 career appearances, two K League 1 titles, and AFC Champions League experience.\n\nAside from a stint in the Arabian Gulf, Shin has represented Pohang, Ulsan, FC Seoul, Incheon United, and Sangmu. He arrives from Seongnam with a K League 2 trophy and proof that he can still perform at this level.\n\nTwenty-one-year-old striker Lee Gyu-dong joins on loan from K League 1 champions Jeonbuk Hyundai. Born in neighbouring Suwon, he spent 2024 on loan with the Bluewings.\n\nLee Gyu-dong represents Jeonbuk U-18.\n\nInterestingly, that period coincided with Suwon’s temporary move to Yongin due to pitch repairs at Big Bird. As a result, Lee is already familiar with Mirue Stadium, having played five matches there. He scored twice for Suwon as their promotion bid ended early, and his impact in Yongin should be stronger.\n\nAre Yongin primed for an immediate playoff push?\n\nWhen Ko Jeong-woon guided Gimpo FC from the semi-professional K3 League into K League 2 in 2022, expectations were low. Gimpo had always been competitive in K3—never champions, but regularly finishing in the top three—yet the step up was seen as too big for a small, city-owned club on the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.\n\nInstead, Gimpo exceeded expectations. Their debut season ended with an eighth-place finish (out of 11), followed by a heartbreaking playoff defeat to Gangwon FC the following year.\n\nProgress has since stalled, but Yongin appear to be attempting something similar. “Very, very rich” was how one rival club official described Yongin to me. 2026 is the perfect time to enter K League 2 with lofty ambitions. Two teams earn automatic promotion, with another qualifying via the playoffs. A fourth promotion place is also possible, depending on where Gimcheon Sangmu finish in K League 1.\n\nLooking across the 17 squads, Yongin are arguably a top-five team on paper. What a story that would be.\n\nIt isn't Yongin's fault, but there is'new club fatigue' amongst K League 2 fans. On the surface, Yongin offer nothing we haven't seen before - a new club with a very small fan base, an oversized stadium with a running track, and a club based in Gyeonggi, a region of the country now completely over-represented at this level.\n\nWhat sets Yongin apart is their ambition. Every club will talk about winning the league, earning promotion and eventually to qualify for continental football. It all feels a little hallow. Yongin are different. They recruited Anyang's team manager, who has experience building a squad to escape K League 2. And, aside from the players mentioned above, 34-year-old Suk Hyun-jun is also in the squad.\n\nSuk is a 15-times Korean international, who's played for Ajax Amsterdam, FC Porto, and Al-Ahli. Suk's time is coming to an end, but look out for another striker, Jardel, who has been capped by Guinea-Bissau, and former Seoul E-Land defender Kwak Yun-ho. Yongin's ambitions are clear. Can they break the understandable new club fatigue?",

    "fullText": "Open Source Policy Summit 2026 European tech leaders are waking up to the risk of the US simply turning off their IT services.\n\nThe Register FOSS desk attended the 2026 Open Source Policy Summit in Brussels last week. The tone of the event was distinctly different to that of the same event three years ago. We encountered new notes of determination, expressed forcefully by Finnish MEP Aura Salla:\n\nIn case some listeners didn't see the problem with that:\n\nThe US could turn us off inside one hour.\n\nThe Reg has quoted Salla before. She has been making this point for a while, with increasing directness, but just over a year into Donald Trump's second term as president of the United States, it continues to grow in importance.\n\nAs we covered in October last year, one of the leaders in this effort is the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which switched away from Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook to Open-Xchange and Mozilla Thunderbird. The head of Schleswig's Chancellery and Minister for Digital Transformation, Dirk Schrödter, gave a keynote saying: \"We are free; now everyone must follow.\"\n\nHe noted that although it had saved the state government money, it wasn't without cost. The process had required significant expenditure, but that was good for European businesses that had helped the state in its transition. We liked his summary of the status quo:\n\nWe're in the habit of exporting public money out of Europe, and importing dependencies.\n\nIn a later panel on \"Open Source and Economic Security,\" he noted that digitization in Germany can be difficult, partly due to its state-level IT management and strategy. He recommended a pragmatic approach:\n\nDon't look at the big mountain in the distance. Look at concrete steps you can take to start.\n\nSo, for now, Schleswig is still running Windows, but has replaced Microsoft Office with LibreOffice on \"nearly 100 percent\" of machines. It's using Thunderbird for email, calendars, and contacts, talking to Open-Xchange on the back end, alongside the Matrix-based Element for chat and Nextcloud for collaboration.\n\nOther speakers on the same panel made the point that FOSS doesn't mean free of charge, but spending money with European companies means benefits to European economies – keeping more of the EU's vast public spending inside the EU. As Leontina Sandu put it: \"We spend 0.4 percent of EU money on software licenses. It's a lot – public sector spending is half of the EU's GDP.\" Blogger Markus Sandelin estimates that the EU spends over €200 million a year just on Microsoft 365 licenses.\n\nCompanies working on open source in Europe, of course, stand to profit significantly from this. Thales's Daniel Glazman put it more bluntly: \"Open source will succeed when we forget the word 'cost.'\" IBM's Jochen Friedrich shared a pithy one-line summary of how Europe needs to transform its economies away from old heavy industries and into open \n\nThe Eclipse Foundation's Mike Milinkovich echoed Salla's earlier point that Microsoft effectively had a kill switch over Office 365, but pointed out that the company has more such controls: it also owns GitHub. As he put it, \"more or less every company and organization in Europe pulls from GitHub, because it uses JavaScript and Maven, so this applies to them too.\"\n\nPortuguese professor Mario Campolargo flipped the equation around. Any part of the EU paying for software should be sharing the code it's paying for:\n\nIf the money is public, the code should be public.\n\nOf course, this isn't just a European problem. It applies just as much to the nearly 200 countries of the United Nations. A short item, oddly described as an \"intervention,\" talked about the upcoming UN Open Source Week 2026 and the UN Open Source Principles – including that the city of Barcelona just adopted them.\n\nTo most people working with FOSS, they probably seem simple and reasonable, but having the UN on board adds considerable clout, and spelling them out is the sort of thing that reassures technophobic politicians:",

Build whatever you like, from your next startup to an alternative Counter-Strike. Sign up and build your first app in minutes\nGPT 5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6 shipped within minutes of each other. How well do they compare building a multiplayer Counter-Strike?\nWe tried and found out. Here's how the gameplay feels:\n\nAnd if you're curious, you can play it yourself:\n\nGPT 5.3 Codex's attempt: https://53strike.vercel.app/\nClaude Opus 4.6's attempt https://46strike.vercel.app/\n\nWe have a full recording of us building it here.\nHere's what surprised us:\nBoth models were a leap over any previous generation\nYou can compare the results with our last benchmark. These models made much more realistic maps on the first try. Their weapons were better. And they got much more right on the first shot. Codex had some issues with accounting for HP under respawns, and Claude has some issues spawning inside obstacles. But a simple paste got them fixing it. At no point did they get stuck and require guidance.\nGPT 5.3 Codex was much faster than Claude\nIn just about every prompt GPT 5.3 Codex finished in about half the time. This could be because of the harness: We noticed Claude Code did much more upfront research than Codex.\nClaude Opus 4.6 performed better on 5/6 prompts\nBut perhaps the upfront research came to good use, because Claude Opus 4.6 beat out GPT 5.3 Codex on all prompts but one (and the last one was a tie).\n\nGPT 5.3 CodexClaude Opus 4.6FrontendBoxes + Physics🥈🥇Gun + Creativity🥈🥇Sounds + Animations🥈🥇BackendMultiplayer🥈🥇Maps🥈🥇Bonus🤝🤝\nClaude drew more interesting maps. Claude made a nicer weapon. The gameplay UI was much nicer on Claude's first try.\nBoth models struggled a bit with physics\nAt this point, neither model had issues drawing out the UI, setting up the backend, or getting caught up in bugs from three.js. The frontier now seems to be about physics.\nFor example, Claude generated maps where players could end up stuck. Here's Claude's \"inferno valley\" and \"nuke zone\" produced 4-wall obstacles in the center:\n\nThere would be no way for users to leave. Codex also had trouble with direction. The enemy's \"point of view\" was coming out from the back of their had, rather than the front.\nWith both models you could shoot through obstacles. Claude Opus 4.6 at least made it so you couldn't walk through the obstacles -- but with Codex you could.\nWith either one, it was fun to build and play!",

    "description": "Docker ships with an undocumented API for spawning isolated microVMs. Here's how to use it for more than just AI agents.",
    "fullText": "Docker ships with an undocumented API for spawning microVMs. We reverse-engineered it and built the open-source Sandbox Agent SDK to allow orchestrating coding agents inside of them.\n\nDocker & containers are the standard for how we’ve been running backends. Recently, more workloads have been moving to sandboxes for untrusted code execution, which Docker is not suitable for.\n\nWith the launch of Docker Sandboxes, Docker quietly shipped an undocumented API for microVMs that can power sandboxes.\n\nThis looks promising to be a unified way of managing sandboxes on your own infrastructure using microVMs, just like Docker did for containers 10 years ago. (Today it only supports macOS/Windows. Requires nested virtualization.)\n\nDocker Sandboxes (launch post) are Docker’s solution for running AI coding agents safely. Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini need to run arbitrary code, install packages, and modify files. MicroVMs let them run --dangerously-skip-permissions without being dangerous.\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a glorified docker run command, but under the hood Docker is using a completely different technology: microVMs.\n\nContainers are what most developers know and love when they run docker run. They provide basic file system, network, and process isolation between the host machine.\n\nHowever, it’s a common misconception that containers are good enough for running untrusted code (AI agents, user-submitted scripts, multi-tenant plugins).\n\nIn order to achieve better security, products like AWS Lambda, Fly.io, and most sandbox providers use microVMs for lightweight virtual machines with separate kernels for better security. It’s lighter than a full virtual machine, but does not carry as much overhead. This is considered the gold standard of isolating user code. There are many other documents that better describe microVMs & Firecracker if you’d like to read more.\n\nThis is why Docker built Sandboxes on microVMs instead of containers while remaining compatible with Docker containers.\n\nThis opens up use cases that containers can’t safely handle:\n\ndocker sandbox run is strictly limited to Docker’s whitelisted agents: Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Kiro, and Cagent. It currently does not let you run your own Docker containers.\n\nSo naturally, I went down the rabbit hole to see if I could reverse engineer the underlying microVM API in order to run any code I’d like inside of sandboxes.\n\nDocker’s sandboxd daemon manages all of the virtual machines and listens on ~/.docker/sandboxes/sandboxd.sock.\n\nThe VM name follows the pattern {agent_name}-vm. socketPath is your per-VM Docker daemon, which we’ll use in the next step.\n\nNormally all containers share /var/run/docker.sock. Anyone with socket access can see and control every other container.\n\nSandboxes flip this. Each microVM gets its own Docker daemon at ~/.docker/sandboxes/vm/<name>/docker.sock for maximum isolation. Containers run like normal inside the microVM, but are completely isolated from the host and other VMs.\n\nTo target different daemons, we will need to override the Unix socket path using curl --unix-socket ... or docker --host unix://....\n\nNew VMs are completely isolated from the host, so we need to manually load images we’ve built into the VM.\n\nWe do this by building, archiving, and loading the image into the VM like this:\n\n$VM_SOCK is the socketPath from the earlier step.\n\nNow the fun part: we can finally run our image and work with it like any other Docker container.\n\nmicroVMs route outbound traffic through a filtering proxy at host.docker.internal:3128. Your container needs these env vars:\n\nThe proxy does man-in-the-middle on HTTPS (hence NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0) for network policy enforcement. For production use, install the CA certificate from ca_cert_path in the VM response instead of disabling TLS verification.\n\nWorkspace syncs at the same absolute path, so volume mounts just work:\n\nDocker Sandboxes require Docker Desktop 4.58+ on macOS or Windows. Linux is not supported since Docker Desktop uses platform-specific virtualization (Apple Virtualization.framework on macOS, Hyper-V on Windows).\n\nThe raw microVM API is powerful, but building a production agent orchestration system on top of it requires handling:\n\nWe built the Sandbox Agent SDK to handle all of this. It wraps the microVM API and provides a simple interface for spawning and interacting with AI coding agents:\n\nSee the full guide on deploying with Docker Sandboxes.\n\nDocker’s microVM API opens up secure isolation for any workload, not just the handful of agents Docker officially supports. Whether you’re building an AI coding assistant, running untrusted user code, or isolating multi-tenant plugins, the /vm API gives you the primitives to do it safely.\n\nThe API is undocumented and subject to change, but it works today on Docker Desktop 4.58+. If you’re building something with it, we’d love to hear about it.",

    "fullText": "Transfer of subjects of acclaimed film about inhumane prison conditions described as ‘straight-up retaliation’\n\nThe Alabama prison system has moved three well-known incarcerated activists who supported a 2022 prison strike and were featured in an Oscar-nominated documentary about the troubled system to isolated cells with little contact with others, family members and attorneys said.\n\nFamily members of the three men said they fear for their loved ones’ safety and are concerned the moves to solitary confinement are a form of retaliation for outspokenness about problems within the prison system. Robert Earl Council, Melvin Ray and Raoul Poole were transferred two weeks ago from their existing prisons to solitary confinement at the Kilby correctional facility outside Montgomery, their lawyers said. The transfers come as some groups have encouraged a new prison labor strike this year.\n\n“This is straight-up retaliation,” said Julie Sledd, who is close to Poole and spoke to the Associated Press about his situation. “They’ve all three been very involved in standing up for the rights of incarcerated citizens.”\n\nCouncil, Ray and Poole were featured in The Alabama Solution, a documentary about the state prison system that relied heavily on cellphone footage from inmates. The film has been nominated for an Academy Award in the documentary category.\n\nSledd said she had been able to talk to Poole once since the transfer and he told her the men are being held in separate cells on an isolated and closely guarded floor.\n\n“Since their arrival, the men have been cut off from contact with their families and are being held in isolation with no contact with other prisoners or prison staff except for a small group of guards and supervisors,” lawyers representing the three men said in a statement.\n\nThe attorneys said the prison system did not provide a reason for the move and said the restrictions “far exceed standard administrative segregation protocols”.\n\n“Given [the Alabama department of corrections’] decade-long documented history of excessive force against prisoners and its pattern of retaliation against these specific individuals – including a prior 2021 incident in which four guards nearly killed Robert Council – their attorneys fear for the activists’ safety and well-being,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe Alabama department of corrections cited security concerns as the reason the men were moved, but did not elaborate.\n\n“The transfer of inmates is based on intelligence that they are engaged in activity that is detrimental to the safety and security of the facilities and the public,” prison officials said in an statement emailed by a spokesperson, Kelly Betts.\n\nThe statement added that “all inmates are safe, secure and receiving regular meals and other services as needed”, and that they have had legal visits and phone service.\n\nEarnestine Council said on Wednesday that she had received little information about her son and had not been able to speak with him. Ann Brooks, Ray’s mother, said she had not been able to reach her son, although he was able to make one call to his brother.\n\n“I don’t know what is going to happen or what could happen,” Brooks said.\n\nThe moves come as some have pushed for a new prison labor strike this year similar to one in 2022 that drew national attention. Thousands of Alabama inmate workers went on strike that year, refusing to work in prison kitchens, laundries and factories to protest against conditions in the state lockups.\n\nSeveral inmates told the AP that prisons had recently reduced the amount of food and other items they can buy each week at the prison commissary, a move that could prevent items from being stockpiled ahead of any strike.\n\nThe prison system said in a statement that food service had been contracted out to a new vendor, Aramark, but did not elaborate.\n\n“We’re really concerned because they’ve had retaliation and abuse in response to all of their activism,” said Andrew Jarecki, director of The Alabama Solution.\n\n“It’s particularly ironic that these men who are incredibly brave – and frankly, scholars – and have learned the law and have been leaders and always observe nonviolent means of protest, are always met with violence by authorities.”",

    "fullText": "The Royal Government of Bhutan has moved over $22 million in BTC out of sovereign wallets over the past week alone, drawing attention from the crypto community.\n\nOne transaction, 5 days ago, was directly sent to addresses linked to market maker QCP Capital, Arkham data revealed. The moves align with Bhutan’s periodic sales of BTC since it began mining the crypto in 2019.\n\n“From our observations, Bhutan periodically sells BTC in clips of around $50M, with a particularly heavy period of selling around mid-late September 2025,” Arkham wrote.\n\nBesides, the Himalayan Kingdom’s crypto portfolio has gone down more than 70% from its $1.4 billion peak to $412 million, following market depreciation.\n\nPer Bitcoin Treasuries, Bhutan remains the seventh-largest government Bitcoin holder.\n\nBhutan has been mining Bitcoin since 2019 and saw more than $765 million in BTC profit.\n\n“They mined most of their BTC before the halving in 2024, and tapered heavily after that,” said the Arkham report. “This is because the cost to mine a single Bitcoin roughly doubled, which made mining less efficient.”\n\nFurther, the nation seems to have mined 8,200 BTC in 2023 alone, making it the heaviest mining year. It approximately mined 1800 BTC in 2022 and 300 BTC in 2024.\n\nThe BTC transfers from the government wallet in the past week come after Bitcoin has been slumping to $70,000. The largest crypto has tumbled 7.36% over the last 24 hours, outpacing the broader crypto market’s 6.39% fall.\n\nDespite the heavy transfers, blockchain data analysts note that they are more likely to be internal reallocation or custodial arrangements rather than liquidation. The country’s wallet balances remain largely unchanged.\n\nBhutan has made similar mass wallet moves in the past without triggering market crashes.\n\nRead original story Bhutan Quietly Sells Over $22M in Bitcoin, Triggers Speculation Over Possible Sell-Offs by Sujha Sundararajan at Cryptonews.com",

    "fullText": "A defenseless toddler was almost run over — twice — after the child tumbled out of an SUV when the car door suddenly flew open.\n\nAccording to Fullerton, Calif., police, the vehicle was making a turn when the front passenger door opened and a 19-month-old baby fell onto the roadway. The mom, who’s been identified as Jacqueline Hernandez, 35, of La Habra, Calif., then stopped short, nearly causing the car behind her to rear-end her, per New York Post.\n\nA video released by police shows another car almost running over the tyke, but its driver managed to slam on the brakes just feet away from the baby.\n\nHernandez is then seen running around to the passenger side to pick up the child.\n\nPolice were only alerted to the incident when a witness came forward and reported it. The information enabled them to identify the mother. Hernandez was then arrested on suspicion of felony child abuse, the Fullerton police said in a statement.\n\nThe toddler was injured in the fall but was expected to make a full recovery after being treated at a hospital.\n\n“Why was the baby in the front seat, and not in a car seat in the back buckled up,” asked one commenter on Instagram.\n\nUnder California law, children under 2 need to be placed in a rear-facing car seat, and until age 8, children must ride in the back seat.\n\n“This made me sick to my stomach,” another viewer commented on Instagram. “So happy the baby will make a full recovery.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie’s Brother Issues New Emotional Plea for Missing Mom as First Ransom Deadline Passes\n\nPatrick Mahomes Sr. Reportedly Remains in Jail, Could Face 10-Year Sentence for Violating Probation\n\nKaroline Leavitt ‘Can’t Guarantee’ ICE Agents ‘Won’t Be Around a Polling Location’ During Elections\n\nThis story California Woman Arrested on Felony Child Abuse After 19-Month-Old Baby Tumbles Out of SUV first appeared on National Enquirer.

    "fullText": "Tech has been clobbered by a broad rotation taking place in 2026, and the latest sell-off in software stocks has only added to the pain. Yet, on the other end of that pain has been a $24 billion gain for short-sellers.\n\nThe software rout took off this week, but some of the biggest names in tech have been struggling all year, battling both micro and macro forces that have hurt demand for high-flying AI plays.\n\nFor short-sellers betting against these stocks, the last six weeks have been a windfall. A report from data analytics firm S3 Partners reveals that short-sellers have netted billions in paper profits as they bet tech would drop from nosebleed levels.\n\nThe firm noted that while short sellers have been betting against some of the biggest names in software all year, they have been increasing their bearish positions recently as conditions shifted and volatility surged.\n\n\"U.S. Software stocks have generated $24 billion in MTM PNL for short sellers YTD, while the market capitalization of the sector has declined by $1 trillion,\" the firm's report reads.\n\nS3 highlighted several software stocks that short sellers have been increasingly betting against\n\nOf the software stocks on the list, Microsoft stands out, the firm said, because of the way short-seller behavior around it has changed amid its sharp decline this year.\n\n\"Historically, MSFT behaves like a reversal stock, with shorts covering on the way down,\" S3 noted. \"Now it is trading like a momentum-driven, distressed name, with shorts increasing into weakness.\"\n\nWhile the AI trade has faced intensifying scrutiny lately, the firm sees the widespread bearish trade as specific to software stocks, as short interest in the overall Magnificent 7 and the Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, has been flat.\n\nS3 maintains, though, that hedge funds are focused on increasing their short positions in large-cap tech, even as many sector leaders have already logged big declines.\n\n\"Contagion is visible across short books, with AVGO and AMZN seeing short-interest increases of 15% and 10%, and AVGO down 10% YTD,\" he stated.",

    "description": "The lake scene between Sophie and Benedict in \"Bridgerton\" season 4 is changed from the book. Here's why that's a good thing.",
    "fullText": "Mr. Darcy and Anthony Bridgerton, please welcome Benedict Bridgerton to the \"emerging out of a lake\" hall of fame.\n\nThere are a few monumental scenes straight from the pages of Julia Quinn's books that fans demanded be included in the Netflix adaptation. You know the ones — remember the carriage scene from season three? Or the mirror scene that ended up being the longest sex scene in the show's (steamy) history? Or maybe you're more of a Kanthony fan, which means you were eagerly anticipating a certain bee sting.\n\nThis season's monumental scene was known by the fans as \"the lake scene.\" It's a big moment for Benedict (Luke Thompson) and Sophie (Yerin Ha), the leads of season four. They've fully warmed up to each other after a few days at My Cottage, and it's become difficult to ignore the simmering tension between them.\n\nSo, when Sophie accidentally comes upon a nude Benedict taking a swim in the lake in episode three … well, you can guess what happens next.\n\nIt would seem these two have decided to wade into deeper waters..for now. pic.twitter.com/3gvGiXkhXd\n\nBut it actually goes down quite differently in Quinn's book, \"An Offer From a Gentleman.\"\n\nIt's a short (but impactful) scene in the show.\n\nAfter recovering from a fever brought on by injuries he sustained while protecting Sophie's honor — long story — Benedict and Sophie are spending time at Benedict's (charming, if inaccurately named) My Cottage so he can recuperate.\n\nWhile taking a walk, Sophie accidentally spots a naked Benedict taking a swim in the lake. Of course, he promptly spots her and begins teasing her for ogling.\n\nBut it takes a turn when Sophie blurts out she \"can't help but notice\" Benedict, wherever he is. The two share a passionate kiss before Benedict backs away, apologizing.\n\nThe two then go their separate ways, with Benedict (as usual) being charmed by Sophie's awkwardness.\n\nThe lake scene occurs in chapter 11, about 40% of the way through the book — and it's a much longer encounter.\n\nFirst of all, the kiss is a lot more intense, lasts a lot longer, and has some more flirty banter, including Sophie accidentally calling Benedict by his first name (which he loves) and telling him that she doesn't normally do this kind of thing.\n\nWhere it gets a bit dicey, though, is that this is when Benedict asks Sophie to be his mistress after deducing that she's been lying about her parentage.\n\nAs she does when he makes this offer in episode four, Sophie says no. We don't know how Benedict will react to this refusal in the show, but we can be almost certain that it won't be what his literary counterpart does: Blackmail Sophie into working for his mother.\n\nYes, you read that right. When Sophie refuses to be Benedict's mistress, he tells her she can either work for Violet or he'll report her to the police for stealing from him.\n\nUnderstandably, Sophie is furious about this — and actually punches Benedict in the face when he says she's \"not being intelligent\" — but ultimately accepts the offer to work at Bridgerton House.\n\nOf the many changes \"Bridgerton\" showrunner Jess Brownell has made from the source material, this is one we're quite relieved about.\n\nIn the book, Benedict isn't trying to be slimy when he does this. Ultimately, he's trying to protect Sophie from having to navigate the world on her own (and he's basically accepted the fact that he loves her and can't live without her), but that doesn't make it any less icky to read.\n\nInstead, the show has actually leaned into the tricky power dynamic between Benedict, a member of the Ton, and Sophie, a maid. Soon after the lake scene in the show, he has a conversation with Mrs. Crabtree, one of the caretakers of his cottage, who warns him that the inherent power imbalance between him and Sophie means that a relationship between them can never truly be equal.\n\nIt's a surprising bit of reality from an otherwise fantastical show.\n\nThe mistress offer comes a bit later during what's been dubbed the \"staircase scene\" — a show invention — after Benedict has seen that a friend of his has a mistress he's truly fallen in love with, and, by all accounts, the two seem happy. Benedict is genuinely trying to make it work with Sophie as best as he can.\n\nBut we'll have to wait until part two on February 26 to see how Sophie responds.",

    "description": "At the National Prayer Breakfast, Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) called on the president to “be invested in the alleviation of suffering” across America.",
    "fullText": "With President Donald Trump standing awkwardly behind him, a Democratic congressman used his prayer at the National Prayer Breakfast to urge Trump to “think of families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nSpeaking at the bipartisan Washington, D.C., event on Thursday shortly after Trump gave a rambling address, Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) offered a prayer for “the future of this nation,” and asked God to “lead this president into greater levels of compassion.”\n\nNews: Minneapolis Mayor Shreds ‘Thoughts And Prayers’ Over School Shooting: Kids ‘Were Literally Praying’\n\nJackson, the son of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, said, “Today, we remind him that the lives of millions of people are in his hands, and that he has the power to turn mourning into dancing or to reduce the country into a cosmic elegy of chaos and suffering.”\n\nJackson continued by calling on Trump to be “mindful of the poor” and “be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening on farms in the Midwest, in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nHe added that “we are all Americans, all made in the image of God, and that none of us are free unless all of us have our freedoms protected.” (Watch video at the end of the story.)\n\nWhen the prayer finished, Trump shook Jackson’s hand and appeared to say, “Great words.”\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nDuring his address, the Republican president said he didn’t know “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”\n\nThe plea to Trump came amid weeks of chaos in Minnesota as a result of his administration’s immigration crackdown, with the president’s rhetoric helping to sow discord.\n\nPolitics: Hillary Clinton Pulls No Punches In Fiery Response To GOP Congressman\n\nThe president has baselessly accused the state of harboring thousands of violent undocumented immigrants, calling them the “worst of the worst.”\n\nAgainst a backdrop of protests against the influx, federal agents have shot dead two U.S. citizens ― 37-year-old Renee Good and Alex Pretti, also 37 ― in separate incidents.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it is scaling back immigration operations around Minnesota by withdrawing about 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal officers sent to the state.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News later that day, Trump admitted he could have adopted “a little bit of a softer touch” in the region.\n\nwow -- with Trump standing behind him, a man (not sure who he is) offers this prayer: \"We pray that he would be mindful of the poor and that he would be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.\" pic.twitter.com/toJk9vIboF\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter Setting Minneapolis Ablaze, Trump Now Appears Interested In Dampening The Flames\n\nJD Vance Won't Apologize For Amplifying Smears Against Alex Pretti\n\nTrump's Border Czar Announces 700 Immigration Officers To Immediately Leave Minnesota",

    "fullText": "Tesla is only a few months away from its planned Roadster demo, and it might be getting a fresh new logo to boot.\n\nThe automaker filed two new trademark applications on Tuesday with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. One of the filings shows a sleek design featuring three minimalist lines that appear to form a vehicle.\n\nThe second application is for the styling of the name. The company submitted protections for \"Roadster\" in an all-caps styling with a stretched shape and segmented letters.\n\nPer both filings, the logos haven't yet been used on commercial vehicles.\n\nTrademark attorney Josh Gerben wrote in a blog post that companies often file trademark applications on an \"intent to use basis\" ahead of a public launch.\n\n\"By filing early, Tesla locks in a nationwide priority date, preventing third parties from attempting to register the same or confusingly similar marks after the logos are publicly announced,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe electric-car maker ramped up work on the Roadster last summer, Business Insider previously reported. Designs for the Roadster that were seen by insiders last year showed a two-seater with butterfly doors. At the time, a source with knowledge of the issue said the vehicle was at least two to three years from production.\n\nElon Musk has hyped up the revamped Roadster over the past few months. He has said the vehicle will be able to fly.\n\nIn a January interview, Musk said \"if safety is your number one goal, don't buy the Roadster,\" adding that it would be the \"best of the last of the human-driven cars.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO said during the company's third-quarter earnings call that the new Roadster will be unveiled on April 1, joking that April Fools' Day will give him \"some deniability.\"\n\n\"I could say I was just kidding,\" he said.\n\nHe had previously said Tesla planned to unveil the vehicle by the end of 2025.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "I tried six brands of store-bought tater tots from Sonic, Ore-Ida, Cascadian Farm, McCain, Signature Select, and Alexia Foods to find the best ones.",
    "fullText": "Tater tots, potato puffs, potato rounds, potato barrels — these crispy, slightly snacks go by many names.\n\nThey've followed me from the middle-school cafeteria to late-night study sessions in college and always hit the spot.\n\nTo find the best, easy-to-make frozen tots, I reviewed the offerings from six brands: Sonic, Signature Select, Ore-Ida, Alexia Foods, McCain, and Cascadian Farm.\n\nFor consistency's sake, I bought the most basic flavor from each brand and followed each package's cooking instructions.\n\nHere's how I'd rank the store-bought tater tots from my least favorite. to my top pick.\n\nMy expectations for the Sonic tots were already low because I don't love the fast-food chain. However, even when I put my bias aside, they still disappointed me.\n\nI baked the tots at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 18 minutes. When I pulled them out of the oven, they looked crispy and brown.\n\nUnfortunately, the crispiness was all these tots had to offer.\n\nThough the outer texture was good, the tater tots didn't have much flavor. I thought the soft interior kind of just tasted like plain, undercooked potato.\n\nOre-Ida created the original Tater Tot and owns the trademark, so I expected the brand to set the standard for the rest of the potato-based snacks.\n\nI cooked them in the oven at 425 degrees for 25 minutes until golden brown.\n\nIf you love the thin, crispy fries at the bottom of a takeout bag, these tots are probably for you. They had the crispiest texture of all the brands I tested.\n\nBut even though they were supposedly seasoned according to the package, I didn't think these had much flavor. Compared to some of the others, they left something to be desired.\n\nI had high expectations for Cascadian Farm's organic spud puppies because I have enjoyed other frozen products from the brand.\n\nOut of the bag, these tots were a darker shade of brown than Sonic or Ore-Ida. The color only deepened when I baked them at 450 degrees for 18 minutes.\n\nThey almost felt and tasted like a lighter version of tater tots — they definitely weren't as greasy as some of the other brands I tried.\n\nThe spud puppies were decently crispy, but unfortunately, I found the flavor a little underwhelming.\n\nMcCain offers a quicker-cooking bag of frozen tots. I baked them at 425 degrees for 12 minutes.\n\nThey were less crispy than some of the others, but I still enjoyed the texture.\n\nDespite what the packaging said, the taters didn't appear to be heavily seasoned. When I tried them, though, I tasted a hint of onion.\n\nThe flavor almost reminded me more of a latke. Unfortunately, this is a tater-tot comparison, not a latke review; otherwise, I would've ranked these higher.\n\nAlexia Foods' seasoned tater tots have flavors listed on the packaging — roasted garlic, cracked black pepper, sour cream, and chives — so I was hopeful.\n\nI baked them in the oven at 425 degrees for 18 minutes. These puffs were crispy, herby, and had a good russet-potato flavor.\n\nWithout question, Alexia Foods ranked first on my list. The light garlic and pepper flavors set them apart from the other options.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 5, 2025, and most recently updated on February 5, 2026.",

    "title": "I asked an insider what went wrong at Jeff Bezos' Washington Post",
    "description": "After Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013, the billionaire was considered a model owner. Not anymore. I asked an insider what happened.",
    "fullText": "Lots of people are angry at Jeff Bezos because of the massive cuts he's ordered at his Washington Post. But a decade ago, Bezos was widely celebrated for his ownership of the Post, which he had bought for $250 million in 2013.\n\nUnder Bezos' ownership, the Post made huge investments in tech and staff. And readers loved the results — especially during the first Trump era, when the paper turned profitable.\n\nNow things are very different: The Post says it has been losing gobs of money for the past few years, and Bezos has made a series of moves interpreted as a shift toward Trump — which spurred reader revolts, which made things even worse. And all of that led to this week's cuts.\n\nI talked to Erik Wemple, a New York Times media reporter who previously worked at the Post for 14 years, to try to reconcile the two eras of Bezos and the Post, and to get a sense of what might happen next. You can hear our entire chat on my Channels podcast; what follows is an edited excerpt from our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: What shape was the Post in when Bezos bought it in 2013?\n\nErik Wemple: The Graham family, which had owned the Post forever, was an amazing steward for the paper. But they had to scale back their newsroom, because the internet had blown holes in classified ads. Classifieds used to be huge at The Washington Post.\n\nAt the time Bezos bought it in 2013, it was not dysfunctional. These were really good journalists, but the paper was in a bit of a funk. It wasn't a reclamation project, but it had seen better days.\n\nIt was faded when he bought it.\n\nCorrect. And when Bezos came in 2013, he really wowed the staff. We all asked him questions. He answered those questions with tremendous enthusiasm and competence. He seemed really energized by this.\n\nWhat did he think he was going to do?\n\nWhen he came in, he was energetic, but deferential on the particulars of running the newspaper. He's like, \"You know what? I'm not in this business, but I do know how to organize discussions about the future of a business.\" And that's what he did. I was in one of them; it was really remarkable.\n\nHe had these things that he believed in. He was important in guiding conversations. And it was really remarkable because he backed it up with money. He invested in the newspaper. He invested in political coverage, big time. Investigative went up. International got a huge, huge boost. And the technology did too.\n\nThis is exactly what you want from your billionaire tech owner: Give us a bunch of money. Improve our tech. Also, stay away. Don't tell us what to do.\n\nThat was exactly the sentiment. And one of the things you mentioned in there is really worth pausing on for a second, which is the lack of intervention, the lack of meddling. He just sort of looked on. And the newsroom really, really, really roared. Especially in the first Trump period.\n\nSo not only does this produce great journalism, it seems like it becomes a business success story — the paper becomes profitable again. Then, after Trump left the White House, there was a lot of hand-wringing about what happens after the Trump bump. People expected audiences to decline across lots of different publications, and that happened, so it makes sense that the Post would struggle a bit. But the numbers you hear about the reported losses — $77 million in 2023, $100 million in 2024 — are staggering. I still don't understand how you can swing to losses like that just because your traffic goes down. What am I missing?\n\nOne of the things that has been reported and pretty well substantiated is they may have over-indexed on staff growth. They vaulted up over a thousand in early 2021, up to 1,100. So I think they got ahead of themselves, and they had to pair that back. That's one of the things.\n\nAnother consideration is that the digital advertising market sort of dried up, so that was a big deal.\n\nIt's all somewhat of a mystery, but I don't doubt that there are meaningful losses.\n\nCan this just be as simple as the Post overhiring? Lots of companies have done that — the tech guys did during the pandemic.\n\nNo, I don't think so. Especially if you look at the more recent past, when they tinkered with the opinion side and shot themselves in the foot.\n\nIn October 2024, the Post announced it would not be endorsing a candidate in the presidential election. And that happened after the Washington Post editorial board had drafted an editorial in favor of Kamala Harris. And hell broke loose — a subscription desertion of hundreds of thousands.\n\nThat's an astonishing number. I remember thinking that it couldn't be real.\n\nThe cause and effect could not have been more direct. People said, \"No way. I'm not giving my money to this organization.\"\n\nThe Post has continued to do lots of news reporting that is critical of the Trump administration. Which made me curious about this line in editor Matt Murray's explanation of the cuts this week. He praises the work the paper has done, and then points out problems, and says \"even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\"\n\nIt almost sounds like what David Ellison and Bari Weiss say about remaking CBS News. Does that mean we should expect the Post's news reporting to change in some sort of ideological way?\n\nIf Matt Murray or any of his top editors had actually edited that memo, they would've asked for specifics. And they would've put a big question mark alongside that and ask, \"What the hell are you talking about here? Why are you speaking in such elliptical language? Why are you trying to whisper to the newsroom some message that you're not willing to articulate?\"\n\nWe need to ask him exactly what he's saying. I think that that is coded language, and I think that could be political.\n\nIt's a strange thing for the executive editor to be saying. It's almost as if he's asking for some force to adjust the newsroom cadence and its sensibility — when he has the power to do that.\n\n(Editor's note: The Post's PR department on Thursday afternoon referred Business Insider to an interview Murray had with The Wall Street Journal: \"You have to be where users are,\" he said. \"We have to do great journalism that people engage with.\" He said that included an effort to \"talk to a lot of different kinds of people and reflect the full diversity of life,\" the Journal reported.)\n\nWhy does Jeff Bezos own The Washington Post? It seems to be nothing but a headache for him the last few years. It doesn't seem like it helps him curry favor with Donald Trump. It's not like he's using it to buy the \"Melania\" documentary for $75 million. What is the upside for him, and why does he continue to own it, do you think?\n\nErik Wemple: I have no idea. That is something all of us in the media trade have been trying to figure out. It is entirely a black box.\n\nMany years ago, he seemed to be deriving a great deal of satisfaction from this. There was a close bond between The Washington Post Establishment and Bezos. I'm pretty sure it isn't as strong as it once was.\n\nSo I think that the enjoyment he got from his association with his institution has probably faded.\n\nBut in 2024, he said, \"We saved The Washington Post once, and we're going to save it a second time.\" So there's another challenge, right? I guess that that would be something that he would derive some pleasure from. And I would imagine that if he wanted to get really involved and engaged, the way he was back in 2013-2015, the newsroom would welcome that.\n\nA lot of the success stories we hear about in digital media these days are specifically publications that are focused largely or entirely on Washington, DC: Politico, Axios, Punchbowl, Semafor. Some of them have direct DNA from The Washington Post. Is there any chance of the Post reclaiming any of that, either through an acquisition or just by focusing on Washington and policy?\n\nThey have this Washington Post Intelligence thing now, which is sort of akin to that. But I don't know if there are new streams of revenue opening up at the Post. And I think that that's one of the reasons that the staff is so disaffected and so disappointed in the current management — they don't see any sort of progress towards new business.\n\nI think they're seeing cuts. And also a fair amount of silence. I don't think that they're getting the feedback from management that they deserve.",

    "fullText": "A California man whom an FBI official slammed as a \"total imposter\" was arrested and charged Thursday over allegations that he sent a fake ransom demand for Nancy Guthrie, the mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.\n\n\"Did you get the bitcoin were [sic] waiting on our end for the transaction,\" Derrick Callella texted two family members of Nancy Guthrie on Wednesday, following reports of a ransom demand tied to the elderly woman's disappearance that listed a Bitcoin wallet address, his criminal complaint said.\n\nThe complaint, filed in Arizona federal court, said Callella admitted to sending the messages. It was not immediately clear whether Callella had retained an attorney.\n\nAuthorities believe the 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie was taken from her ranch-style home just outside Tucson, Arizona, in the Catalina Foothills five days ago.\n\nFBI Phoenix's special agent in charge, Heith Janke, announced the arrest on Thursday at a press conference over Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.\n\nThe FBI official said the arrest was related to an \"imposter ransom demand\" for the woman. \"It was someone that was trying to profit from it — a total imposter,\" Janke said.\n\nJanke also issued a message to anyone involved in Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, urging them to \"do the right thing.\"\n\n\"This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well-being,\" Janke said.\n\nThe FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance, Janke announced.\n\nAuthorities said that an additional ransom letter regarding Nancy Guthrie, sent to local and national media outlets, is being taken \"seriously.\"\n\nThat note made a monetary \"demand\" for 5 p.m. local time Thursday, said Janke.\n\n\"If a transfer wasn't made, then I think a second demand was for next Monday,\" Janke said, declining to provide other specifics.\n\nAn Apple Watch and a floodlight were also mentioned in ransom letters, Janke said.\n\n\"We're not going to go into specifics. It's very important that we keep this investigation moving forward, and we don't want to put more facts out there that others then can use to try to profit from this,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities revealed new details around the timeline of Nancy Guthrie's disappearance on Thursday and confirmed that the blood discovered on the elderly woman's porch belonged to her.\n\nNancy Guthrie was dropped off at her home by her family just before 10 p.m. on January 31. At 1:47 a.m. MST the next day, the woman's doorbell camera disconnected, police said.\n\nAt 2:12 a.m., the doorbell software detected a person on the camera, but there was no available video footage, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said during the Thursday press conference. Minutes later, Nancy Guthrie's pacemaker app showed a disconnect from her phone.\n\nHer family checked in on her at 11:56 a.m. and called 911 shortly after, police said.\n\nNanos said that Nancy Guthrie's doorbell camera had also been removed. No suspects or persons of interest have yet been identified in the case, the sheriff said.\n\nOn Wednesday, in an emotional video post alongside her siblings, Savannah Guthrie pleaded to her mother's possible abductors to \"please reach out to us.\"\n\n\"We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk,\" the famed NBC anchor said, adding, \"We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.\"\n\nNancy Guthrie suffers from physical ailments and requires daily medications that, if not taken every 24 hours, could have life-threatening consequences.\n\n\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" Nanos said.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors plan to increase incentives for companies that cooperate during criminal investigations, including ​promises not to prosecute them, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan said ‌on Thursday.\n\nJay Clayton's remarks at an industry conference come as the Justice Department is scaling back ‌corporate crime enforcement and refocusing on immigration and drug cases under the Trump administration.\n\nWhat new incentives will prosecutors offer cooperating companies?\n\nHow is Justice Department changing corporate crime enforcement?\n\nWhich sectors will face increased white-collar crime scrutiny?\n\nWhat are Clayton's criticisms of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?\n\nCompanies need to know there is a specific benefit to cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in rooting out wrongdoers, Clayton said at the Securities Enforcement Forum in ⁠New York.\n\nThat includes offering companies ‌so-called non-prosecution agreements, or NPAs -- deals which Democrats have criticized in the past.\n\n\"Our approach is going to be: let's ‍get an NPA signed as quickly as possible that calls for continued cooperation,\" he said.\n\nClayton, an appointee of President Donald Trump, said the different approach on cooperation would ​benefit shareholders, too. He previously led the Securities and Exchange Commission, a ‌civil regulator, during Trump's first presidential term, and focused on retail investors at the time.\n\nThose retail investors continue to be among his top priorities on white-collar crime issues, he said, noting he has an eye on misconduct in small-cap stocks, private funds and prediction markets. When asked if he foresees ⁠prosecutions in those so-called event contracts, he ​said: \"Yes.\"\n\nClayton also criticized past enforcement of the ​Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 law that bans companies that operate in the U.S. from bribing foreign officials.\n\nThe Justice Department ‍paused the law's enforcement ⁠last year and resumed it with a plan for a more scaled-back approach. Clayton criticized the law for putting the U.S. at ⁠a disadvantage to other countries and penalizing companies instead of targeting individual wrongdoers.\n\n\"I hate corruption ‌of foreign officials,\" Clayton said. \"I hate the FCPA as applied.\"",

    "description": "An active-duty enlisted member of the US military said their unit was \"pressured\" into seeing Amazon's \"Melania\" documentary about the first lady.",
    "fullText": "It was the story of the weekend: \"Melania,\" Amazon's documentary on first lady Melania Trump, beat expectations at the box office, becoming one of the best-performing documentaries in recent years with an opening weekend gross of $7 million across 1,778 screens. (Whether it makes back its $75 million investment is another story.)\n\nDespite dismal critic reviews, the numbers suggest audiences turned out for \"Melania\" to support the first lady. One advocacy group suggests the reality may be more complicated.\n\nMikey Weinstein, the president and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the nonprofit received reports from eight bases around the world that U.S. military members were being \"pressured\" to see \"Melania.\"\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Weinstein, a former Air Force officer and attorney who said his group is made up of nearly 100,000 current and former members of the U.S. military and represents those who feel pressured or coerced into unconstitutional religious observances. \"They were pressured to see the movie.\"\n\n\"Your military superior, that's not your shift manager at Taco Bell or Starbucks. They have complete and total control over you.\"\n\nIn an email Weinstein shared with Business Insider, an active-duty enlisted member of the US military said they were writing on behalf of a dozen of their unit members and their families who felt \"pressured\" by their unit commander to see the movie. The MRFF did not disclose the name of the person who sent the email.\n\nIn the email, this person said their commander suggested the unit and their family members join him, his wife, and their children at a showing of \"Melania\" at an off-base movie theater.\n\nThe screening was designated as one of the commander's \"Unit Activity Events,\" morale-boosting activities that can range from flag football and barbecues to movie nights, the email said. The military member who sent the email said the unit is required to attend at least three of the four UAEs that are scheduled each month or face a penalty.\n\nAsked if any of the MRFF members who contacted him skipped the movie, Weinstein said: \"Every one of our clients who came to us either went to see it or suddenly got sick.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Department of Defense official told Business Insider, \"There is no Department of War directive requiring service members to see this film, though the film is fantastic.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street is looking to Amazon with high hopes after a rough week in tech, as silver plunges again and bitcoin drops near $65,000.",
    "fullText": "US stocks took sizable hits again on Thursday in a fruitless search for a reprieve from a building tech sell-off as investors awaited Amazon earnings, assessed Alphabet's big AI spending plans, and digested jobs data that signaled fresh weakness in the labor market.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved roughly 1.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost over 1.1%, or more than 500 points.\n\nThe market is in the midst of a full-on tech wipeout, as investors weigh whether some software stocks took too big a beating. The losses have been spurred by worries about AI disruption to established software players — a risk that had been overlooked by investors focused on the fallout from massive AI spending until recently.\n\nWall Street is still digesting the latest batch of corporate earnings, with Big Tech's AI build-out and demand in high focus. Alphabet (GOOG) shares slid, but pared losses, after the Google parent outlined a significant ramp-up in AI investment — to as high as $185 billion — in its quarterly results late Wednesday.\n\nThe countdown is now on to Amazon's (AMZN) report, set for release after Thursday's market close. Eyes are on the all-important AWS cloud unit, expected to deliver a 21% jump in sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market flashed fresh signals of weakness: Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected, and job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020, while a new report found that last month marked the worst January for layoff announcements since 2009. The government's monthly jobs report is due next Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver (SI=F) plunged as much as 17%, erasing all of its two-day recovery as Chinese buyers dumped holdings. Wall Street is debating whether the recent record rally in silver and gold (GC=F) ran too high, too fast — and if a further slump awaits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also plunged to its lowest level since 2024, wiping out all of the gains accumulated during President Trump's second term. The token broke below $63,000 — amid a crisis of confidence.\n\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n\nSilver (SI=F) prices tumbled 14% on Thursday to hover above $75 per ounce, erasing gains from the past two days. Gold (GC=F) futures also slipped to $4,900 per ounce after both metals had risen for a second consecutive day following last Friday’s sell-off.\n\nAnalysts warned that silver’s short-term rebound remains volatile, though they remain bullish on bullion prices over the medium term, despite last week’s dramatic pullback that interrupted a blistering rally over the past year.\n\n\"The widening divergence between gold and silver performance reinforces a recurring theme: silver behaves less like a monetary metal during periods of stress and more like a high-beta hybrid, amplifying both optimism and fear,\" Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's commodity strategy head, wrote on Thursday.\n\n\"History suggests that silver tends to stabilise only once realised volatility falls and speculative positioning is reset — conditions that are not yet fully in place,\" he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\n\nMortgage rates barely budged this week: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged higher to 6.11% from 6.10%, while the 15-year fixed averaged 5.50% ticked up to 5.5% from 5.49% last week.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick and Laura Grace Tarpley note that the 10-year Treasury note, a pricing indicator for 30-year fixed mortgage rates, has hovered above 4.2% since mid-January. However, the spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates has narrowed recently, and the 30-year has resisted a substantial move higher.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nCheck out frequently asked questions about mortgage rates and our mortgage calculator here.\n\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\n\nCheck out the top takeaways from Sozzi and Schwab's conversation here.\n\nIt hasn't been a great day for jobs data, with the delayed JOLTS report serving as the final piece in a trifecta of negative news about layoffs, hiring, and unemployment claims.\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled below $64,000 on Thursday, its lowest level since October 2024.\n\nThe token is down nearly 50% from its all-time high last year, erasing all the gains made during President Trump's second term. Investors had been optimistic that the administration's crypto-friendly policies would lift digital-asset prices.\n\n\"Bitcoin remains in a larger bear-market structure,\" read a 10X Research note on Thursday. \"In the absence of a strong catalyst and with positioning still stretched, downside risks remain elevated.\"\n\nNotably, the firm points to a significant overhang — overexposed bitcoin ETF holders who are underwater, with an estimated average acquisition price near $90,000.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with ether (ETH), which tumbled 13% on Thursday. Investors holding Ethereum ETFs are down approximately 31% from their average cost basis, according to 10X Research data.\n\n\"Under these conditions, attracting incremental allocations from Wall Street investors becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when many existing holders likely regret not reducing exposure at significantly higher levels,\" the note said.\n\nAbsent a significant catalyst, the firm doesn't see a bottom to crypto's bear market until possibly the summer.\n\n\"As we have previously outlined, a cycle low around the FIFA World Cup this summer could mark a more compelling long-term buying opportunity,\" 10X Research analysts said.\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings and announced its CFO will be exiting.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) shares soared as much as 9% as the company said it will begin selling compounded copies of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy pill. The pill from Hims & Hers would cost about $100 less than Novo's, Reuters reported.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) both saw shares tumble about 7% on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks have been hammered in the past few days, accelerating a months-long decline as investors become more fearful of disruption risks posed by new artificial intelligence tools — particularly those from Anthropic.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the market belief that software stocks are losing ground during a call with analysts following the Google parent's earnings report Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe CEO said: \"Look, at least from my vantage point, I definitely see we have very, very good SaaS (software as a service) customers who are leaders in their respective categories.\"\n\nThose customers include Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), and Salesforce (CRM), per Bloomberg data.\n\nPichai continued: \"And what I see the successful companies doing is they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows, be it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it to drive efficiency within their organizations.\"\n\n\"[J]ust like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services.. I think the [software] companies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHis comments echo those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week.\n\nRead more about what's driving fears over AI eating into the competitive moats of SaaS leaders here.\n\nThe performance of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, AWS, will be keenly examined when its earnings report lands later, after Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged last week, in part due to a slowdown in cloud growth.\n\nThis was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.\n\n“It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space,” said David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios. “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”\n\n... Amazon’s results come against a backdrop of anti-software sentiment that’s weighing on the entire tech sector as investors try to sort the winners and losers from the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, invited new questions about when these investments will pay off more substantially.\n\n“It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”\n\nAt the market open, US stocks plunged for a third day as a broad sell-off in tech names continued.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, sinking 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.5%.\n\nUS weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased by more than expected last week, as snowstorms across much of the country may have led more people to file for assistance.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 increased by 22,000 to 231,000 claims, exceeding economists' forecasts, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nContinuing claims, a proxy for the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, increased to 1.84 million.\n\nDistortions from winter weather notwithstanding, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits suggests the labor market remains broadly stable if not cooling gradually.\n\nThough in a sign of cracks appearing in the \"low hire, low fire\" trend that has characterized the labor market for over a year, layoffs jumped in January to their highest level for that month in 17 years, according to Challenger data (scroll down for more on this).\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports:\n\nJeff Bezos came, he saw, he conquered.\n\nMaybe not in the way you'd expect from a onetime financial savior of an iconic newspaper. There are now two Bezos eras at the Washington Post: The first started when he rescued it in 2013. The second began when he saw it gutted, blessing mass layoffs the company executed on Wednesday.\n\n... On social media and in news coverage in the aftermath, Post employees, the labor union, and alumni (myself included) strongly criticized the decision.\n\nOthers have pointed to more recent moves by Bezos.\n\nLeading up to the Post's deep cuts, several media observers highlighted Amazon's enormous budget to produce and market the new documentary \"Melania,\" about first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAmazon's extraordinary spending prompted questions about the movie working as a kind of bribe from Bezos to the White House. (Amazon says they licensed the movie because they think people will love it. The film's Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office numbers have inspired a news cycle of their own.)\n\nBut the splashy Melania rollout provided an ugly contrast to the austerity Bezos was serving down to the Post's newsroom. In the worst light, critics said Bezos was willing to burn money to please the president but was now unwilling to do so for journalism in the public interest.\n\nRead more here in the takeaway from today's Morning Brief.\n\nChinese EV maker Nio (NIO) sent its shareholders a profit alert on Thursday morning, letting them know that the company expects to post its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio said it will see an adjusted profit from operations of 200 million Chinese yuan (approximately $29 million) to 700 million yuan (approximately $100 million).\n\nThe company attributed the profit to sustained sales growth, improved margins from its product mix, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.\n\nNio stock popped 6% in premarket trading.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, as tariff woes sent the beauty group's shares tumbling.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) stock fell over 5% during premarket hours on Thursday after bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below 70,000. Strategy is one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency.\n\nTapestry (TPR) stock rose 5% before the bell. Coach's parent company beat analysts' estimates on revenue and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) US-listed shares rose 5% before the bell on Thursday after announcing plans to issue its first dividend to shareholders, along with a three-year stock buyback program worth $5 billion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled, falling $71,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the leading cryptocurrency was paring deeper overnight losses in the wake of Bessent's comments, after entering the key mid-$70,000 support region.\n\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferré and Grace O'Donnell report:\n\nSnap (SNAP) stock galloped higher after a strong holiday quarter for advertising lifted earnings above Wall Street's estimates.\n\nSnap stock rose 6% before the bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the video messaging app reported revenue of $1.71 billion and earnings per share of $0.03. That beat Wall Street estimates of $1.7 billion in revenue and a $0.03 loss per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise.\n\nThe affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85.\n\nThe stock soared by as much as 8% in premarket trading on Thursdayas the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs.\n\nLast year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow market share and deliver best-in-class growth in beauty, as reflected by our raised fiscal 2026 outlook.\"\n\nRead more about e.l.f.'s quarter from Reuters.\n\nArm Holdings shares fall as licensing sales miss estimates.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock rose 5% before the bell on Thursday following Alphabet's (GOOG) capital expenditure plans, which surpassed analysts' expectations.\n\nGoogle's parent company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of $180 billion, news that is a potential boon to Broadcom, which partners with Alphabet on custom chips.\n\n“That is an incredible number. We are laughing because that number is so good for the Google cohort,” Ben Reitzes, Melius Research head of technology research, told CNBC.\n\nGoogle is not the only company increasing its capex spend to build AI data centers: Oracle (ORCL) is doing the same and raised its forecast to around $50 billion.\n\nGoogle's AI software doesn't just use Nvidia (NVDA) chips, but it also uses its own tensor processing units (TPUs). For Gemini 3, Google used TPUs, which Broadcom helped to make.\n\nSilver (SI=F) fell sharply, wiping out a two-day recovery, as the white metal struggled to find a floor following a historic market rout. Gold (GC=F) also declined.\n\nSpot silver plunged as much as 17% on Thursday, having flickered briefly above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. After a record-breaking rally that appeared to run too far, too fast, the metal has retreated by more than a third from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29.\n\n“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. This has created “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity,” he said.\n\nThe sudden and sharp decline in precious metals also weighed on sentiment in base metals markets, with copper falling more than 1% to slip below $13,000 a ton. Meanwhile, spot gold dropped as much as 3.5% in choppy trading.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) stock fell around 11% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market.\n\nSecond quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87).\n\n\"While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release.",

    "title": "Redditors Have Figured Out a Way to Save Hundreds on a Whoop Subscription",
    "description": "You'll have to be lucky at discount shopping, but cheap Whoops are out there.",
    "fullText": "I’ve always said there’s no good reason to buy an older model Whoop band, since the company will give you the latest model for free when you subscribe. But on Reddit, some people who already own Whoop 5.0 bands are buying up old 4.0 bands to get a bargain on the subscription price.\n\nThere have been a few posts on this, but perhaps the master of this hack is Redditor u/thelifeofcb, who found Whoop 4.0 bands, new in box, at a T. J. Maxx store for $39 each, and bought several. This allowed them to extend their existing subscription—they wear a Whoop 5.0—for several years at essentially a $200/year discount.\n\nWhen new Whoop bands are sold through retailers, they come packaged with a one-year subscription. The idea is that you’ll create an account on the app, pair the band you bought through the app, and get credit for a 12-month subscription—since that was the main thing you paid for when you bought the band at full price.\n\nBack in the Whoop 4.0 days, there was only one tier of membership. When tiers were introduced, those subscriptions rolled over to a Peak subscription, the one that currently goes for $239/year. That means a 4.0 device—however much you pay for it—can give you a year-long Peak subscription.\n\nRedditors have found that pairing one of these new Whoop 4.0 devices added a year’s subscription to their accounts, whether they were a new customer or not. That means you can buy a few discount bands, pair them all, and enjoy several years’ worth of discounted membership. That $39 band is thus a $200 discount on each year’s membership. Some say that they received an offer to upgrade to a Whoop 5.0 band if they added two years' worth of membership (paired two bands).\n\nThat $39 price is an unusually good one, but you can still get a significant discount anywhere new Whoop 4.0 devices are sold. For example, Amazon has 4.0 devices right now for $124, which is still about half the price of a Peak subscription. You can find them cheaper on eBay, but I’d be wary of buying a box that may have been opened. I’ll explain that below.\n\nWhile Redditors say this works—and it does fit with my understanding of how subscriptions are paid for and claimed in the app—there are a few pitfalls to beware of.\n\nThe first is that this applies to new-in-box devices that (1) are sold with a subscription, and (2) have never been paired. The hack would not work with a hand-me-down device that has already been used, nor with a new one that has already been paired and its subscription claimed. For example, you can’t pass the same band to a friend and expect it to give both of you a subscription.\n\nThis means you have to be sure the band you buy has not been opened. If a store accepts returns of opened items, they may not realize that the valuable item here—the digital subscription—has already been claimed. If they put it back on the shelf, and you buy it, you’re out the purchase price and you still don’t have a subscription.\n\nThe other issue is just the e-waste that this causes. You’re buying a device just to throw it in the trash. But I’d argue that’s Whoop’s fault, not yours—those devices are obsolete and headed for the landfill (or responsible electronics recycling program, if you can find one) regardless of what you do.",

    "title": "The Top 10 TV Series This Month, According to Streaming Data",
    "description": "It's a really good time to stay inside and watch a ton of television.",
    "fullText": "January 2026's ten most-streamed TV series are a balanced group, including six reality-based dramas and four fantasy/sci-fi hits. One the side of realism, we've got medical drama vérité The Pitt, a pair of spy shows (The Night Manager and Ponies), and a gay hockey romance in Heated Rivalry. The fantasy side includes the post-apocalyptic black humor of Fallout, the suburban supernatural series Stranger Things, and a trip back to Westeros with A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nA more important running theme this month: These shows are all critical darlings, including a couple perfect Rotten Tomatoes 100% winners (The Night Manager and Pluribus) and five other shows above 95% (The Pitt, Fallout, Heated Rivalry, Ponies, and A Knight of Seven Kingdoms). Even the \"worst\" of the bunch, Landman, is sitting at a solid 78%. Good job watching good shows, America!\n\nHere's the full list of the top 10 most-streamed shows of January 2026 across all major streaming services, as compiled by JustWatch.\n\nIf you're into high-stake international espionage, you have to check the most-streamed series this week. The Night Manager is based on John le Carre's best-selling novel and stars Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine, an MI-6 agent whose mission is to infiltrate the inner circle of dangerous arms trader Richard \"Dickie\" Onslow Roper, played by Hugh Laurie. It has been ten long years since the show first premiered, but both seasons of this BBC-made series are available in full as of Feb. 1, so binge it up, man. Stream The Night Manager on Prime Video.\n\nHBO's gritty, hyper-realistic medical drama has earned acclaim from critics and audiences for its relentless pace, following a single 15-hour shift at the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. Starring Noah Wyle as Dr. Michael Robinavitch, The Pitt ditches the \"disease-of-the-week\" format of many medical shows in favor of a study of the toll the modern medical system places on everyone involved. Season one earned five Emmy awards, and judging from the first few episodes, season two might win more. Stream The Pitt on HBO Max.\n\nPost-apocalyptic action-comedy Fallout is like nothing that’s been on TV before. Staying true to the gritty, gruesome, and irreverent spirit of the video games upon which it is based, it follows naive former vault dweller Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) as she leaves her protected bunker to track down her father in the irradiated Wasteland. The show’s standout characters include Lucy’s duplicitous pop (Kyle MacLachlan), conflicted mech-warrior Maximus (Aaron Moten), and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), the walking, talking, noseless, undead remains of a pre-apocalypse Hollywood cowboy. Season one earned a staggering 17 Emmy nominations in 2024, and the just-finished season two earned even greater critical acclaim for its expansion into the iconic ruins of New Vegas. Stream Fallout on Prime Video.\n\nIf you want explicit hockey player-on-hockey player action with a 98% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, HBO's Heated Rivalry is a must-watch. Set against the hyper-masculine, hyper-homophobic world of professional sports, the series brings emotional depth to the story of a years-long secret romance between Canadian \"golden boy\" Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Russian bad boy Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie). Stream Heated Rivalry on HBO Max.\n\nA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms takes fans back to Westeros, 100 years before the events of Game of Thrones. Based on George R.R. Martin’s Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas, the series is less about world-spanning politics and more about smaller, character driven moments in the lives of humble, towering knight Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey) and his diminutive, mysterious squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). It's shorter, lighter, and funnier than its forebears (but not too light—this is still Westeros, after all). Stream Knights of the Seven Kingdoms on HBO Max.\n\nA veritable streaming institution, Stranger Things reached its end with season five. Set in November 1987, the final chapter follows the Hawkins gang in a mission to find and kill Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) while navigating a town under strict military quarantine. From Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) evading a new government threat to Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) unlocking his psychic potential to protect his friends, the series remains an emotional masterclass in supernatural sci-fi horror—despite a divisive finale. Stream Stranger Things on Netflix.\n\nCreator and executive producer Vince Gilligan takes a hard turn from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul with Pluribus, a slow-burn post-apocalyptic sci-fi series starring Rhea Seehorn as Carol Sturka, a stubborn and irascible novelist in Albuquerque who finds herself one of the last 13 individuals on Earth in the wake of viral outbreak that has turned the rest of the species into a hive mind. \"They\" aren't (isn't?) exactly evil, but they are extremely persistent about trying to get the mysteriously immune Carol to join their ranks (as nicely but firmly as possible). Stream Pluribus on Apple TV+.\n\nYellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan's Landman is is a gritty modern Western set in the oil fields of West Texas. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Tommy Norris, a \"crisis executive\" for an oil company who must navigate a law-light landscape of roughnecks, billionaires, and dangerous drug cartels in order to make sure fuel keeps getting dug out of the ground. Stream Landman on Paramount+.\n\nBased on the 2020 novel by Alice Feeney, His & Hers is a twisty mystery thriller series that stars Tessa Thompson as Anna Andrews, a disgraced Atlanta journalist who returns to her small Georgia hometown to cover a brutal murder, only to find her estranged husband, Detective Jack Harper (Jon Bernthal), leading the investigation. As the former couple competes to solve the case, each grows more suspicious that the other is the killer. The six-episode run makes it a great series if you're longing for an engaging drama with a definite conclusion. Stream His & Hers on Netflix.\n\nIn international espionage parlance, \"ponies\" are \"persons of no interest.\" In this case, that Bea (Emilia Clarke) and Twila (Haley Lu Richardson), two American women in Cold War Moscow whose \"normal\" lives are upended when their CIA agent husbands die in a mysterious plane crash. The pair convince the U.S. government to let them try to infiltrate the KGB and find out the truth of what happened, using their ordinariness as the ultimate cover. Boasting a 96% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the eight-episode season balances steamy romance with intense espionage. Stream Ponies on Peacock.",

    "title": "Car Icons Are Disappearing From Google Maps in Android Auto (but You Might Be Able to Fix It)",
    "description": "How to fix disappearing car icons when using Google Maps with Android Auto.",
    "fullText": "Android Auto users are reporting a bug that is making their cars disappear from the road—ok, not literally, but within Google Maps. On both Reddit and Google's own support forums, drivers now say their car icons are sporadically disappearing from their navigation screens while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. Some users have discovered workarounds, but the fixes don't appear to be consistent for everyone. Here's what's happening, and what you can do to try to fix it.\n\nThe news first started popping up six days ago, on a Reddit thread where multiple users reported problems with their car icons disappearing while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. According to these drivers, when the bug was triggered, the map would move around normally, and traffic data and navigation instructions continued to display as expected. However, the icon indicating their car's position would suddenly disappear from their screen, making it difficult to know where exactly they were in comparison to the road. That's not ideal if you're trying to judge when your next turn is coming up.\n\nAccording to the thread's original poster, the issue popped up for them on the Android Auto version 16.1 release, although others mentioned the issue occurring as far back as version 15.9. The bug doesn't appear to happen all the time, but \"reliably\" appears when leaving Google Maps, opening another app in fullscreen, and either returning to Google Maps in fullscreen or pulling it up alongside the new app in a splitscreen view. To get their icon back, the original poster had to force quit Google Maps on their phone, but this wouldn't stop the bug from occurring again in the future. Google itself has not yet offered public comment on the issue, although I've reached out to the company and will update this post when I hear back.\n\nIf you're encountering a disappearing car icon while using Google Maps through Android Auto, there are a few fixes that have worked for community members, although whether they'll work for everyone appears to be inconsistent.\n\nThe timing of this bug appears to line up with the Android Auto v16.1 release, which launched last week. While the bug has been reported appearing on older versions of the app, like Android Auto v15.9, it could be worth trying out another version of Android Auto to see if it clears up the issue. For instance, one user mentioned that installing Android Auto V16.0.66 fixed the issue for them. If you're on an older version, you can update to a newest one from the Android Auto listing on the Play Store. If you're on a newest version and want to try an older one, though, you'll need to uninstall your Android Auto app and manually sideload the older version using a trusted APK file. Because these can be tricky to verify, this might not be the best option for most people.\n\nMultiple users in the original Reddit thread, including the original poster, pointed out that the bug only seems to affect them when using a non-default car icon. Until Google issues a fix, one solution might be to change your car icon back to the standard white arrow within a blue circle. To change your car icon in Google Maps, open the app on your phone while not connected to Android Auto. Start navigating to a location. Tap on your car icon, and swipe left or right to adjust the icon until you land on the default white arrow within a blue circle. The next time you connect your Google Maps app to Android Auto, your car's icon should be updated. Note that this isn't a guaranteed fix. One user on a Google support forum, for instance, said that their arrow icon also disappeared from Google Maps in Android Auto when returning from another app.\n\nIf there is one saving grace to this bug, it's that the circumstances for triggering it seem to be pretty consistent. That means you can largely avoid it if you simply don't leave the Google Maps app once you open it. But while that might be OK for short trips, it's not ideal for longer ones, where you might want to adjust a podcast or playlist during your drive. You can manually restart your Google Maps app on your phone every time the bug pops up, but not only is that annoying, it's possibly dangerous if you're in the middle of a drive.\n\nIf none of the above fixes work for you and you want to retain the ability to exit your fullscreen navigation app without losing your car icon, it might be worth putting Google Maps to bed for now and using an alternative navigation app. Google's own Waze app, for instance, works with Android Auto and does not seem to have this bug right now. Alternative navigation apps do have their own pros and cons, as Waze focuses less on comprehensive mapping and more on real-time crowdsourced traffic information when determining routes. However, it might be worth a shot. If Waze doesn't work for you, other popular navigation apps compatible with Android Auto include Sygic GPS and TomTom - Maps & Traffic (formerly TomTom AmiGo).",

    "title": "Apple's 'Lockdown Mode' Could Stop the Government From Breaking Into Your iPhone",
    "description": "Lockdown Mode saved a journalist's iPhone from the FBI. Do you need it?",
    "fullText": "In January, the FBI made headlines after it raided the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson. It was a shocking case of law enforcement not just overriding one journalist's privacy, but the integrity of the entire news organization. The devices the FBI seized—which included personal devices as well as a Washington Post-issued laptop—contained Natanson's personal contacts, correspondences, and the Slack channels of the Washington Post itself.\n\nBut while the FBI was able to access some of the devices, it was not able to access Natanson's iPhone. That's because the device was in Lockdown Mode, which prevented the FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) from breaking into it. This isn't a setting that is exclusive to journalists: You have this option baked into your iPhone as well, and can choose to turn it on at any time. The thing is, unless you're a high-profile target, you probably don't want to.\n\nLockdown Mode is an option on iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs, designed for users who could be the target of sophisticated cyberattacks. Think politicians, businessmen, activists, and, of course, journalists—really, anyone high-profile that works or takes action in a way that could draw the ire of powerful organizations or governments.\n\nBecause attackers target devices with spyware, the goal of Lockdown Mode is to reduce the attack surface of your device in order to prevent potential cyberattacks from working. Attackers can install spyware on a target's device in a number of ways, through links, attachments, wired connections, and file downloads, the same way you can install malware by clicking a malicious link in an email, or downloading a corrupt extension from the web. Lockdown Mode locks down these vulnerabilities and eliminates as many potential attack routes as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, Lockdown Mode severely impacts a number of functions you may use on your device every day. According to Apple, that includes the following:\n\nMessages: Lockdown Mode will block most message attachment types, other than \"certain images, video, and audio.\" Links and link previews are blocked.\n\nWeb browsing: The feature blocks \"complex web technologies,\" which could impact how certain websites load or function. You may not see certain web fonts, and you may see missing image icons in place of pictures.\n\nFaceTime: Incoming FaceTime calls are blocked, except for contacts you have called within the past 30 days. You can't use SharePlay or take Live Photos in FaceTime calls.\n\nApple services: Invitations to Apple services like invites to manage a smart home are blocked, unless you have previously invited that person. GameCenter will not work, and Focuses will not work \"as expected.\"\n\nDevice connections: Your device needs to be unlocked before it can communicate with another computer. In addition, your Mac also requires your explicit approval before the connection can be made.\n\nWireless connectivity: You won't automatically join non-secure wifi networks, and you will disconnect from existing non-secure wifi networks. Lockdown Mode also blocks 2G and 3G cellular support.\n\nConfiguration profiles: You can't install configuration profiles, and the device can't enroll in Mobile Device Management.\n\nApple makes a point to say that phone calls and \"plain text messages\" will work as normal, however incoming calls won't ring on your Apple Watch. Emergency SOS also will continue to work.\n\nThese restrictions make it much more difficult for a bad actor to install spyware on your device, though it also makes it more difficult to use your device. A shared album invite could contain malware, but by removing the feature entirely, you miss out on photos from friends and family. Any spyware coming from a malicious link or image will be blocked, but if you frequently send photos, videos, and other attachments in Messages, you'll miss out.\n\nThat's why these measures are really designed only for individuals who think they'll be targeted by sophisticated actors. It seems that could include governments secretly installing spyware on targets' devices, or the FBI stealing your device in a raid. It's worth noting that the FBI was able to access Natanson's other devices, including a MacBook Pro that unlocked with her fingerprint. The agency's warrant compelled Natanson to unlock her devices with biometrics if they were enabled. Lockdown Mode could not have prevented that, so it's not clear why the FBI didn't force Natanson to unlock the iPhone in question, too.\n\nIf you understand the restrictions, but still want to try Lockdown Mode, you'll need to be running the following software version on each of the Apple devices you want to use Lockdown Mode with:\n\nApple Watch: watchOS 10 or later\n\nApple says \"additional protections\" are available for iOS 17, iPadOS 17, or macOS Sonoma or later. In addition, you should update your device to the latest software version before turning on Lockdown Mode if you want all the latest protections.\n\nYou can turn on Lockdown Mode on any of your Apple devices, but you must do so individually on each. You'll find the option at the bottom of the \"Privacy & Security\" section in Settings (System Settings on Mac). Hit \"Turn On Lockdown Mode,\" then review the pop-up that appears and choose \"Turn On Lockdown Mode\" again. You'll need to choose to \"Turn On & Restart,\" then enter your device's password or passcode for the feature to take effect.",

    "title": "FBI Makes 1st Arrest Related to Savannah Guthrie Mom’s Abduction Case After the Host Pled Her Kidnappers to ‘Bring Her Home’",
    "description": "The FBI is looking into all leads.",
    "fullText": "The investigation continues into the disappearance of Today host Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy Guthrie, but the FBI just made their first arrest related to the case.\n\nFBI Phoenix Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke announced at a press conference on February 5 that a suspect was arrested in connection with the fake ransom note sent to news outlets on February 3, which the FBI later denied the validity of. “We have made one arrest related to an imposter ransom demand, and a complaint will be presented to a magistrate judge later today,” Janke said. “You will get more on that from the FBI and our U.S. Attorney’s office here in Arizona when it becomes available.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie's Sister Recalls Her Mom's Last Movements as Police Address Reports Her Husband Is the Prime Suspect in the Abduction Case\n\nOfficials Reveal if They Think Savannah Guthrie's Mom Is Still 'Alive' After Concerning Evidence Sparked the Involvement of Homicide Detectives\n\nHe continued, “There’s no evidence to connect this to Nancy’s case. It was someone that was trying to profit off it.”\n\nJanke also issued a warning against those planning to offer fake evidence as a way to secure the $50,000 reward for Nancy’s whereabouts. “My next message is to those imposters who are trying to take advantage and profit from this situation. We will investigate and ensure you are held accountable for your actions,” Janke said. “This is an 84-year-old grandma that needs vital medication for her well being. You still have the time to do the right thing before this becomes a worse, much worse scenario for you.”\n\nTMZ reported on February 3 that it received an alleged ransom note demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin for the release of Savannah’s mother. According to TMZ, the note was sent on Tuesday morning and included a specific Bitcoin address for the payment to be sent, which the outlet verified was real.\n\nThe FBI’s arrest over the fake ransom note came less than a day after Mary Coleman, an anchor for Arizona’s KOLD 13 News, which also received the note via email, claimed it was “clear after a couple sentences” that it “might not be a hoax.”\n\n“A lot of it is information that only someone who was holding her for ransom would know,” she said in an appearance on CNN on February 4. “Some very sensitive information and things that people who weren’t there when she was taken captive wouldn’t know.”\n\nShe continued, “We immediately sent that information over to the sheriff’s department … One of the detectives did get back to us and asked us for some more information so that they can start searching for an IP address, things of that nature, to try and figure out what people are responsible here.”\n\nColeman added that the note “included a dollar amount, a deadline” and other dteails that only “Guthrie’s abductor might know, so that definitely raised some red flags.”\n\nThe arrest over the bogus note also comes after Savannah and her siblings, sister Annie and brother Camron, posted an Instagram video with a plea to Nancy’s potential abductor. “We too have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,” Savannah said. “As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please, reach out to us.”\n\nSavannah went on to call Nancy “our heart and our home,” before expressing her concern for her mother’s health “She is 84 years old,” Savannah said. “Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,” she said.\n\nShe continued, “On behalf of our family, we want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too. Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She is funny, spunky, and clever. She has grandchildren that adore her and crowd around her and cover her in kisses. She loves fun and adventure. She is a devoted friend. She is full of kindness and knowledge. Talk to her and you’ll see.”\n\nShe ended the video with a message to her mother, “Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God’s precious daughter, Nancy. We believe and know that even in this valley He is with you. Everyone is looking for you mommy, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again. We speak to you every moment and we pray without ceasing and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you.” She captioned the post, “Bring her home.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "A brief video of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking at a church celebration surfaced online this week. It went viral, with millions of views and many comments that focused more on her appearance than on what she was saying.\n\nThe 33-second video, which initially aired on C-SPAN on September 22, 2022, shows Rep. Ocasio-Cortez celebrating the First Baptist Church of Corona for its 100th anniversary. In the video, she talks about the church’s longstanding food pantry program, its employment programs for young people, its pandemic relief efforts, and its service to its diverse immigrant community in Queens.\n\nThe video went viral when someone posted it on X with the caption “Jesus Christ.” It earned over 3 million views. Many of the comments were crude jokes and memes about Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s looks. Some inappropriate jokes and quotes included her picture and made political and socialist jokes.\n\nJesus Christ pic.twitter.com/SvmXVLiLIO https://t.co/WDpEjOGjdW\n\n(@SavinTheBees) February 5, 2026\n\nAmong the comments were mixed views. For example, one person said, “Goddamn it, we’re gonna lose the midterms.” The following comment said, “Call her anything but not ugly.” The following comment said, “It’s beautiful, I’m team AOC 2028.”\n\nThe viral video and comments were distracting many from what Rep. Ocasio-Cortez initially talked about. For example, she spoke about the First Baptist Church of Corona and its role as an anchor in the community under Pastor Patrick H. Young.\n\nThe post Old Church Clip of AOC Goes Viral as Internet Fixates on Her Outfit Instead of Her Words appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.",

    "title": "Why Man Utd are taking their time over manager decision",
    "description": "Some are calling for Michael Carrick to be made permanent Man Utd manager, but the club will not rush a decision.",
    "fullText": "Michael Carrick has made an impressive start to his second stint as Manchester United head coach.\n\nThree games, three wins, with Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta and Marco Silva the managers beaten. A place in the top four - enough to secure a return to the Champions League next season - beckons, barely a month after many feared a second consecutive campaign with no European football.\n\nLittle wonder there are some observers who already think United should give Carrick the job permanently.\n\nMost still caution against - for now.\n\nUnited themselves are staying silent.\n\nWhen they dismissed Ruben Amorim on 5 January, club insiders vowed to run a 'proper process' during which they would assess all suitable candidates. Speaking to people with an understanding of the situation, that has not changed.\n\nThere are some very valid reasons why it might be quite a while before United announce their decision.\n\nMan Utd prepare to honour Munich disaster victims\n\nWhen United sacked Jose Mourinho in December 2018, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was given the job until the end of the season.\n\nIt was hoped the club legend's general positivity could raise spirits.\n\nThe results were spectacular. United won the first eight games of Solskjaer's tenure, including a Premier League match at Tottenham and an FA Cup tie at Arsenal.\n\nThe only defeat in his first 17 games was at home to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League - a result United overturned three weeks later as a Marcus Rashford penalty completed a victory that ranks alongside any in the club's illustrious history.\n\nThree weeks later, Solskjaer was given a three-year contract.\n\nUnited won two and lost eight of their final 12 games.\n\nThat loss of form fuels the argument United blundered in moving too early and that Solskjaer would not have got the job had they waited until the summer.\n\nA different man - Sir Jim Ratcliffe - is running football operations these days, but that historical example alone suggests United are better off waiting.\n\nThe other major reason to delay a decision is because a number of potential candidates who are currently in jobs will become available.\n\nIn the Premier League alone that includes Oliver Glasner, who has already said he will be leaving Crystal Palace, Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola and Fulham's Silva.\n\nYet Glasner is an example of how short-term results can affect long-term thinking.\n\nA Europa League winner at Eintracht Frankfurt, he won Palace the first silverware in their history when they beat Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final. They also won the Community Shield against Liverpool.\n\nBut things have unravelled this season.\n\nGlasner left key players out of Palace's final Conference League game in December. A home draw with Finland's KuPS meant Palace missed out on direct entry to the last 16 and must play Bosnian outfit Zrinjski in the play-offs later this month.\n\nThe KuPS game was in the early part of an ongoing run of 12 games without a win.\n\nThe eight defeats in that sequence include an embarrassing FA Cup loss at National League North outfit Macclesfield. Palace are 15th in the Premier League - nine points above third-bottom West Ham - and it is not certain Glasner will see out the season.\n\nThen there are the international managers.\n\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel spoke to United before and after the 2024 FA Cup final as the club deliberated about Erik ten Hag's future. United have also long been linked with Mauricio Pochettino, who is in charge of the US national side.\n\nThat duo, plus Carlo Ancelotti (Brazil) and Julian Nagelsmann (Germany), are other highly regarded coaches likely to be on United's radar.\n\nBut hiring a national team boss around a major tournament is fraught with issues.\n\nIn 1990, England boss Bobby Robson was referred to by some as a \"traitor\" for agreeing a post-tournament contract with PSV Eindhoven, even though he had been pilloried for the previous two years.\n\nJulen Lopetegui was sacked by Spain two days before the start of the 2018 World Cup after Real Madrid confirmed he would join them after the tournament.\n\nSpeaking to a source with first-hand knowledge of appointing managers and coaches at club and international level, it became clear signing a contract with the likes of Tuchel before the tournament is not advisable.\n\n\"Even if there are private conversations between senior club representatives and a coach at a major country, there is no way that can become a formal agreement pre-World Cup,\" they said.\n\n\"If it came out, it would balloon in the face of whichever coach it was. It would be massively destabilising. It's just not worth it.\n\n\"You can have discreet meetings - they happen all the time in football - but it would be much more beneficial to do groundwork.\n\n\"There are a few issues anyway. If they agreed privately with someone at the end of April, what would happen if Michael Carrick had a fantastic end to the season? Depending on how the World Cup went - good or bad - you must think of the impact it might have on reputation.\n\n\"Manchester United have to let it breathe a little bit.\"\n\nThe counterargument is players want clarity.\n\nDefender Harry Maguire is out of contract in the summer, and United have targets to pursue, with midfielders Elliott Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba high on their list.\n\nIt does not seem unreasonable for those players to ask who their manager would be.\n\nThe uncertainty did not help Ralf Rangnick, who presided over a 2021-22 campaign that unravelled spectacularly - winning just five of the last 19 games, including an FA Cup defeat at home to Championship outfit Middlesbrough.\n\nCarrick does not see the same situation unfolding under him.\n\n\"I've got no concerns,\" he said. \"The lads have been better than you can imagine.\n\n\"We're all aware of the bigger situation and what might happen but as a player, you focus on what's ahead of you and try to achieve what you can.\"\n\nUnited clearly want to get the decision right, but as the demands on managers increase, the time they are given to succeed is reduced.\n\nEven if Carrick were to leave at the end of the season, his 17 games in charge would not even make the top eight of shortest reigns at a Premier League club - and would exceed Ange Postecoglou, who only lasted five games and 39 days at Nottingham Forest this season.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Holders Newcastle United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Manchester City on Wednesday night and a challenging season shows no sign of relenting.",
    "fullText": "Newcastle United players waited impatiently in the tunnel at the Etihad.\n\nIt was three minutes until kick-off and the Carabao Cup holders were desperate to get going as a bemused Kieran Trippier looked around and wondered where his counterparts from Manchester City were.\n\nThere was no sign of Pep Guardiola's team.\n\nThe hosts took their time to emerge from the dressing room, but they quickly left Newcastle in a daze after racing into a 3-0 lead in the second leg of their semi-final.\n\nOn a day chief executive David Hopkinson doubled down on his assertion that Newcastle will be competing for the biggest prizes by 2030, the naive visitors looked a long way off in that first half.\n\nHead coach Eddie Howe certainly did not hold back in the away dressing room as he made a triple change at half-time.\n\n\"I was really annoyed,\" he said.\n\nNewcastle managed to rally after the break and pulled one back through substitute Anthony Elanga as they bowed out with a 5-1 defeat on aggregate.\n\nDespite the loss, those 5,400 supporters in the away end repeatedly chanted \"Eddie Howe's black and white army\", in recognition of the head coach who ended the club's seven-decade wait for a major domestic trophy in this very competition.\n\nBut this has been a challenging season for Newcastle and it shows no signs of relenting.\n\nIn truth, Newcastle have yet to catch fire six months into the campaign.\n\nThat may seem a curious statement.\n\nNewcastle have reached a third EFL Cup semi-final in four years.\n\nHowe's side remain favourites to progress past Qarabag into the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nThey could still get back to Wembley through the FA Cup - even if an awkward fourth-round tie against Aston Villa awaits next week.\n\nBut Newcastle sit in 11th place in the Premier League.\n\nThe players previously spoke among themselves about trying to make history once again by becoming the first Newcastle side to qualify for the Champions League in successive campaigns.\n\nHowever, this travel sick team have only won two away games in the top flight this season.\n\nHowe's men have picked up just 11 points from a possible 36 against those sides currently above them in the division.\n\nThey have dropped 16 points from winning positions.\n\nIt has felt like a season of transition, following the damaging departure of top scorer Alexander Isak, and Howe's response was telling when asked if he could tolerate such a word this week.\n\n\"I can,\" he said. \"Transition from the team is an obvious one because we brought players in from the summer and we lost players in the summer.\n\n\"There was always going to be a change to the team. Now change doesn't have to be negative - it can be positive. We are trying to find that flow and rhythm that we have been searching for all season, really.\n\n\"In terms of the club, it's growing and changing all the time and I think will continue to change in the next few years, probably at a rapid pace at some stage. The club is definitely in transition - but transitioning for the positive in my opinion.\"\n\nThere have certainly been glimpses of what this team could be in recent weeks.\n\nThere was a devastating first-half display against Chelsea, a spirited hour away to Paris St-Germain and a fine opening half an hour or so at Anfield.\n\nBut games are not won in snatches.\n\nIt has been a frustration of the coaching staff that they have lacked the training time during an unrelenting run of fixtures to really work on things and piece it all together like they have during previous sticky spells.\n\nInstead the players have come to rely on meeting rooms, analysis sessions and walk-throughs.\n\nThis is the reality of life at clubs who aspire to fight on multiple fronts, of course, but competing in four competitions was an unprecedented feat for Newcastle going into February.\n\nThe relentless nature of the schedule has had a knock-on effect on the squad - Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Tino Livramento and Fabian Schar are all currently sidelined, while Anthony Gordon hobbled off with a hamstring issue on Wednesday night.\n\nIt has also had an impact on the adaptation of Newcastle's summer signings who, aside from defender Malick Thiaw, are still finding their feet at the club.\n\nThiaw, Jacob Ramsey, Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa all joined in the final fortnight or so of a turbulent window, in which the club operated without a sporting director and missed out on a host of top targets.\n\nNewcastle, remarkably, are still searching for a settled combination in the final third despite spending £179m on forwards.\n\nElanga enjoyed a lively second-half cameo at the Etihad, but Woltemade was substituted at half-time - having failed to score since December - while the rusty Wissa missed a host of good chances in both legs.\n\nIt leaves Newcastle with more questions than answers as they embark on a crunch run of fixtures.\n\n\"Where does that leave our season?\" Howe asked. \"We're still fighting on several fronts.\n\n\"The games are coming thick and fast. There's no let-up for us. We need to get back to winning ways as quickly as possible. It's the only thing that gives you new energy.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL in the British amateur game with the London Warriors.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Tries: Bielle-Biarrey 2, Jalibert, Ollivon, Attissogbe Cons: Ramos 4 Pen: Ramos\n\nTries: Timoney, Milne Cons: Prendergast 2\n\nRuthless France inflicted more pain on Ireland as the Six Nations holders opened their title defence with a bonus-point victory at a buoyant Stade de France.\n\nHaving crushed Ireland's title hopes in emphatic fashion in Dublin last year, Les Bleus - with returning captain Antoine Dupont pulling the strings - roared into a 22-0 half-time lead following a one-sided first half that was not without controversy.\n\nFrance's first try was scored by the electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey, but only after what appeared to be a forward pass in the build-up.\n\nMatthieu Jalibert and Charles Ollivon also crossed in the first half, before 2025 top try-scorer Bielle-Biarrey's stylish second secured France's bonus point seven minutes after the interval.\n\nAt that point, France looked poised to surpass the 42 points they managed in Dublin last year, but Ireland refused to give in and narrowed the deficit with tries from replacement forwards Nick Timoney and Michael Milne.\n\nThe hosts, however, had the final word when Theo Attissogbe capped a thoroughly satisfying evening for the tournament favourites.\n\nThe Irish leave the French capital bruised and empty-handed and must regroup in time to face Italy in Dublin on 14 February, with France travelling to Wales the following day.\n\nIreland well beaten by France to start Six Nations - reaction\n\nWith an extensive injury list, this was always going to be a big ask for Ireland.\n\nSeverely depleted at both prop positions and without potential gamebreakers like Hugo Keenan and Mack Hansen, Farrell's hand was weakened before he brought his squad back to the scene of their agonising World Cup quarter-final loss to New Zealand in 2023.\n\nBut even if Ireland feel hard done by calls that did not go their way, there is no question they were simply outplayed at times by a scintillating French outfit driven on by a delighted Parisian crowd.\n\nWhile Ollivon's knock-on denied France a second-minute try, Bordeaux speedster Bielle-Biarrey beat Jamison Gibson-Park, rode Sam Prendergast's tap tackle and ghosted past Jacob Stockdale to finish a move that featured a suspected forward pass from Nicolas Depoortere to Yoram Moefana.\n\nThe high-intensity, unstructured nature of the game suited France's fleet-footed backline, but it was an Irish defensive lapse that led to the home side's second try.\n\nAfter Tommy O'Brien was forced to dot the ball down in the Irish in-goal area and concede a scrum, Dupont - making his Test return after suffering a serious knee injury against Ireland 11 months ago - popped the ball to Jalibert for the fly-half to mark his first international appearance since last year's Six Nations with a well-taken try.\n\nWith Ireland already on the ropes, Ollivon surged past Caelan Doris and slid across the whitewash to give the hosts a commanding halfway lead.\n\nIt was also the first time Ireland were held to zero points in a first half since 2020.\n\nWhen Bielle-Biarrey scampered clear for his second - after a Dupont chip and outrageous volley with the outside of his left boot from Thomas Ramos - and France's fourth try, Ireland looked on course to be on the end of one of their heaviest defeats.\n\nBut a gutsy second-half display - that echoed November's chaotic defeat by South Africa - allowed them to at least get a few scores on the board, with Timoney finishing after a line-break from his Ulster team-mate Stuart McCloskey.\n\nThen replacement tight-head prop Milne marked his Six Nations debut when he burrowed over after another McCloskey surge.\n\nA third Irish try would have stirred French nerves but, while Farrell's side applied pressure, France's defence stood firm, allowing their backs to finish with a flourish as Attissogbe crossed in the corner to complete a miserable Stade de France return for Ireland.\n\nWithout established Test veterans Uini Atonio, Gregory Alldritt, Damian Penaud and Gael Fickou, this was a glimpse into France's destructive potential.\n\nFor Ireland, however, they face into a difficult week following their autumn losses to New Zealand and South Africa with another humbling reverse against a fellow member of the world's top five.\n\nFrance: Ramos; Attissogbe, Depoortere, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Dupont (capt); Gros, Marchand, Aldegheri, Ollivon, Guillard, Cros, Jegou, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Mauvaka, Neti, Montagne, Auradou, Meafou, Nouchi, Serin, Gourgues.\n\nIreland: Osborne; O'Brien, Ringrose, McCloskey, Stockdale; S Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Loughman, Sheehan, Clarkson, McCarthy, Beirne, C Prendergast, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: Kelleher, Milne, Bealham, Ryan, Conan, Timoney, Casey, Crowley.\n\nAssistant Referees: Angus Gardner (Aus) & Jordan Way (Aus)\n\nTelevision match official: Ian Tempest (Eng)\n\nFoul play review officer: Richard Kelly (NZ)",

    "fullText": "Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend insists he and his side have learned from their autumn failings before they start their Six Nations campaign against Italy in Rome on Saturday.\n\nBookended by comfortable wins against the United States and Tonga, the Scots threw away a 21-point lead to lose against Argentina and were unable to capitalise on a wave of second-half momentum in their defeat to New Zealand in November.\n\nTownsend will reach his 100th match in charge of the national team during the Six Nations but has faced criticism from some fans and pundits who feel he has taken Scotland as far as he can.\n\nThey finished third in the 2018 tournament - Townsend's first campaign - and have not bettered that in the seven editions since, also coming third in 2023.\n\n\"It's something we definitely have addressed and looked at,\" Townsend said when asked about Scotland's propensity to fall away at the end of matches.\n\n\"A lot of it is on me as a coach. I think the use of the bench and how we bring on players potentially together rather than ones or twos, a real focus on what we do in that final quarter.\n\n\"I'd never seen the team do something like they did [against Argentina] and we just didn't have a response.\n\n\"Every time I've seen this team go behind, we have had a response. So that was disappointing. We learned a lot that day, things that will be really valuable when we go into the Six Nations.\"\n\nPodcast: Townsend speculation & bold team selection\n\nScotland leave out Van der Merwe, Kinghorn & Graham\n\nScotland's Townsend denies signing Newcastle deal\n\nScotland's rising star poised for sliding doors moment\n\nTownsend has named a surprising team for Scotland's Six Nations opener in Italy, leaving out Duhan van der Merwe, Darcy Graham and Blair Kinghorn, while including a strong contingent from in-form Glasgow Warriors.\n\nDespite Glasgow's storming season in both the Champions Cup and United Rugby Championship, Scottish expectations are still relatively low heading into the Six Nations, largely because of the underwhelming autumn series.\n\n\"We want to set out to play a consistent level of rugby close to our best,\" Townsend said when asked what success would look like in this year's tournament.\n\n\"I know if we say we're going to play our best rugby for five games, that's unrealistic, but a consistent level that puts us in positions to win.\n\n\"We believe in our squad. We believe in what they can achieve and what they've done at times for over 80 minutes.\n\n\"We know what we've got and we know we've got this run of games that we've got to attack with real confidence, but we also know all the other teams are saying the same things and they are planning to get three, four or five wins.\n\n\"But that's a great thing about the Six Nations, it's very competitive right now.\"\n\nScotland have lost only one of their past 15 matches against Italy, but that came on their last visit to the Stadio Olimpico in 2024.\n\nThat was another Scottish second-half collapse as the hosts came from behind to win 31-29.\n\nTownsend is not underestimating the Italians as the Scots aim to start well before facing England at Murrayfield and Wales in Cardiff.\n\n\"It's a tough one to play away from home against a team that's been more than competitive,\" Townsend said.\n\n\"We've had some real tough battles with them. They beat us in Rome two years ago. They're getting sell-outs in that stadium now. It's a really noisy atmosphere.\n\n\"They have a cohesive team and players who have played together for a number of years, real talented individuals. We know it's a very tough game.\n\nBefore he brings up his century, Townsend says he never expected to be in the job this long, while insisting his hunger for the role remains.\n\nHe also played down a report suggesting he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nThe 52-year-old added: \"I remember when I first got into coaching and especially when I became a head coach at Glasgow, I thought: 'I'm loving this. I'm going to give it everything and if it doesn't work out, it's not meant to be'.\n\n\"I've tried to have that mindset all the time. It is something I love doing, but I just feel so privileged and lucky to have had the opportunity after the playing career.\n\n\"To get nine seasons and to be coming into 100 [matches in charge], it's above what I would have expected or dreamed of.\"",

    "fullText": "The Saudi Pro League has warned Cristiano Ronaldo \"no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club\" amid doubts over his future at Al-Nassr.\n\nThe Portugal forward, 41, was left out of Al-Nassr's squad for Monday's Saudi Pro League game against Al-Riyadh.\n\nPortuguese outlet A Bola, external reported Ronaldo refused to play, having grown dissatisfied with how the club was being run by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).\n\nBBC Sport has been told former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema's move to league leaders Al-Hilal from Al‑Ittihad earlier this week was the principle reason for Ronaldo's frustration at Al-Nassr.\n\nFrench striker Benzema, 38, scored a hat-trick on his debut for Al-Hilal in a 6-0 win over Al-Okhdood on Thursday.\n\nBoth Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal - the country's most successful club with 19 league titles - are among the teams controlled by the PIF, which also backs Newcastle United.\n\nRonaldo posted a picture of himself back in training on Wednesday, but BBC Sport understands Saudi Pro League officials are unsure if he will play against Al‑Ittihad on Friday.\n\nWhat is going on with Ronaldo in Saudi Arabia?\n\nIn a statement issued to BBC Sport, a Saudi Pro League spokesperson said: \"The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules.\n\n\"Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.\"\n\nRonaldo joined Al-Nassr in 2022 after leaving Manchester United mid-season, becoming the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of £177m, but has only won the Arab Club Champions Cup with them.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner signed a new two-year contract in June 2025.\n\nBefore he agreed the new deal, however, there was speculation he might leave Al-Nassr with a loan move to rivals Al-Hilal among those touted.\n\n\"Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al-Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition,\" added the Saudi Pro League spokesperson. \"Like any elite competitor, he wants to win.\n\n\"But no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club.\n\n\"Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.\"\n\nAl-Nassr only signed Iraq Under-23 midfielder Hayder Abdulkareem in the January transfer window.\n\nAl-Hilal are unbeaten in the league this season and lead with 50 points after 20 games, while Al-Nassr are four points behind in third place, although they have a game in hand.\n\nThe Saudi Pro League spokesperson said: \"The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.\n\n\"The focus remains on football - on the pitch, where it belongs - and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympics athlete, you pick yourself up and try again.",
    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training;  when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "fullText": "Celtic interim chairman Brian Wilson has called for \"unity behind the team\" amid plans from some fans to boycott Saturday's Scottish Cup match against Dundee.\n\nSupporters' groups have urged, external fellow fans not to attend the last-16 tie at Parkhead as they continue to demand change at the club.\n\nSections of the support remain unhappy with the board following what they perceived as another underwhelming transfer window.\n\nFans have also criticised a lack of engagement from the Celtic hierarchy, but Wilson hopes supporters can unite behind Martin O'Neill's side.\n\n\"I don't expect suddenly all the issues to go away,\" he told Celtic TV. \"What I've asked for, and what I think the great majority of Celtic supporters want to see, is unity behind the team.\n\n\"Let's sort out these other issues - and in no way am I dismissing them or marginalising them. Short term, it's imperative to support the team.\n\n\"It's up to each individual to decide whether a boycott inside the stadium or outside the stadium helps that. That's for people to judge.\"\n\nFree agent Oxlade-Chamberlain close to Celtic move\n\nCeltic query late Aberdeen postponement with SPFL\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nHaving recently replaced Peter Lawwell - who stood down as Celtic chairman at the end of December, citing \"abuse and threats\" - Wilson accepts \"there hasn't been as much engagement [with the fans] as I would've liked\" in the past month.\n\nWilson says that has mainly been down to the transfer window being the priority, while he also praised O'Neill, assistant coach Shaun Maloney and the Celtic players for pulling themselves back into Scottish Premiership title contention.\n\nCeltic's winter window was disrupted by the sackings of manager Wilfried Nancy and head of football operations Paul Tisdale in early January.\n\nThe club had recruited five players by the deadline, all of which were loans, and rejected a bid of up to £25m from Nottingham Forest for midfielder Arne Engels.\n\nThey are also in talks to sign former Arsenal and Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n\nAfter a \"turbulent\" month, Wilson says the club have \"reached out to every supporters' group\" and he is hopeful meetings can take place \"within the next week or so\".\n\n\"Let's see if we can go forward,\" he added. \"There's no reluctance on my part to engage and I hope that can be put into practice soon.\n\n\"We're not going to agree on everything, but we can talk about [the issues]. But don't let it distract from what's going on inside the stadium, that's all I'm asking for.\"",

    "fullText": "Jack Draper says he is \"winning by being here\" as he made an emphatic return after a lengthy injury lay-off to help Great Britain take control of their Davis Cup qualifying tie against Norway.\n\nBritish number one Draper has spent five months on the sidelines with a bruised bone in his service arm.\n\nHis comeback was delayed twice by the injury and he missed January's Australian Open to complete his recovery.\n\nHowever, he served well, moved sharply and showed some brutal ball-striking to bear Viktor Durasovic 6-2 6-2 in his first competitive match for 164 days.\n\nSterner tests will await world number 13 Draper, who is ranked 300 places above Durasovic, but he will be relieved to have rattled through a convincing win after a long spell out.\n\n\"Tennis is a bubble, and sometimes you can get distracted that it's all that matters in life,\" the 24-year-old told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.\n\n\"When you have time out, I used it wisely I think to try and make sure that when I try and come back to tennis, that I'm ready to go all the way again.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that I'm on a really good path. I'm winning by being here.\"\n\nCameron Norrie then gave Britain a 2-0 lead with a characteristically gritty 6-4 6-4 win over teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer.\n\nLloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash can wrap up the best-of-five tie for Britain at the earliest opportunity if they triumph in Friday's doubles.\n\nIf not, Draper and Norrie will have to take to the court again for the reverse singles.\n\nThe winner of the tie in Oslo will face either Australia or Ecuador for a place in November's eight-team Finals.\n\nDavis Cup qualifying: GB lead Norway 2-0 after Norrie & Draper win\n\nRaducanu storms into Transylvania semi-finals\n\nEnglishman Draper said he had \"lots of dark moments\" during the injury lay-off that disrupted his breakout season.\n\nDraper had won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French Opens before being impacted by the injury in his left arm.\n\nHe suffered a second-round exit at Wimbledon and played just one match after before ending his season early.\n\nThere were very few signs of rust against Durasovic, with Draper dropping just 10 points on serve, hitting eight aces and winning 88% of first-serve points.\n\nHe produced three glorious passing shots - two off the backhand and one off the forehand - and moved well behind the baseline to suffocate Durasovic.\n\nHe went a quick break up in both sets and did not face a single break point.\n\nDraper was only taken to deuce once, and that was when he served for the match at 5-2 up in the second. A thumping forehand and a long backhand from his opponent was enough to help the Briton wrap up victory in only 61 minutes.\n\n\"I definitely have to be wary of how the injury is progressing,\" Draper added.\n\n\"I wouldn't be back playing again if me and my team weren't really confident that I can start to build back on the tour again.\n\n\"I definitely have to be sensible at times.\"\n\nNorrie later came back from a 4-1 second-set deficit to see off world number 133 Budkov Kjaer.\n\nBudkov Kjaer, a former Wimbledon junior champion, converted just one of his four break opportunities against Norrie.\n\nDraper looked sharp on his return and there was little sign of rust in what turned out to be a very gentle stroll past Durasovic.\n\nThe 24-year-old had support from a vast travelling Lawn Tennis Association team as well as his new coach Jamie Delgado.\n\nPersonal coaches do not usually travel to Davis Cup ties, but this was the first chance Delgado has had to see Draper in action since succeeding James Trotman in the autumn.\n\nDraper and Delgado are scheduled to head to Rotterdam after this tie for the British number one's return to the ATP Tour.\n\nHow much to play, and how often to rest, will be a delicate balance to strike over the next few months.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Ireland's heavy defeat by France to open the Six Nations will only further press questions raised by a lacklustre autumn.",
    "fullText": "On an earlier than usual Six Nations opening night, Ireland fluffed their lines in Paris on Thursday, beginning their 2026 campaign with a resounding 36-14 defeat by France that was as bruising to the ego as it was the body.\n\nThese sides may have won the past four titles in this competition between them but, for the second season in a row, there was only one winner when they went head-to-head.\n\nAn Ireland performance that was described by their head coach Andy Farrell as lacking \"intent\" continued a number of worrying trends from both the autumn and prior.\n\nComing into the game as considerable underdogs, the head coach had tried to reframe the changing narrative as his side now being the hunter rather than hunted.\n\nFor much of the 80 minutes in Paris, they looked like easy prey for superior opposition.\n\n\"It's coming again next week [against Italy],\" former Ireland lock Donncha O'Callaghan told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This Irish team are on the ropes and everyone is coming after them - they might be the hunted again. They have to find the answers because Six Nations rugby is ruthless and they need to stop the rot.\"\n\nRuthless France thrash Ireland in Six Nations opener\n\nFrance comfortably beat Ireland in Six Nations opener\n\nIreland well beaten by France to start Six Nations - reaction\n\nWith Farrell rolling the dice in his selection - dropping James Lowe as well as giving Cian Prendergast a rare start - there were interesting subplots aplenty as the game neared.\n\nSuch was the nature of the Paris performance, however, that few such themes could be given fair scrutiny.\n\nIreland had picked a team to compete in the air but rarely challenged in that regard with the new-look back three of Jamie Osborne, Tommy O'Brien and Jacob Stockdale largely on the periphery.\n\nWhile the loss of both usual starting props to injury, as well as two back-ups on the loose-head side, was unwanted, it gave the opportunity for others to step up and show what they can do, yet the set-piece was rendered a virtual non-factor.\n\nIndeed, Ireland won a scrum penalty in the 45th minute but, such was the lack of pressure elsewhere, it was the first time Les Bleus had drawn a whistle from Karl Dickson.\n\nDiscipline had been a key area to improve after the autumn but, while Ireland did concede only six penalties, they frequently did not get close enough to infringe either, with 38 missed tackles on the night.\n\nIreland's failure to get to grips with the non-negotiables - what Farrell called the \"main part of the game\" - left little point in sifting through much else.\n\n\"I think you make your own luck in this game,\" said Farrell.\n\n\"Without the ball, I thought we lost that battle in the first half. The things like the high ball and winning the scraps on the floor, running through tackles or missing tackles etc - that's the main part of the game.\n\n\"We certainly came off second best in that regard in the first half. Our response was gallant, but that's not what we want to be, we don't want to be a responding team. We needed to show it from the get go.\"\n\nIrrespective of another World Cup quarter-final exit in 2023 - against, it should be remembered, a New Zealand side who produced a brilliant performance on the night - Ireland felt on par with the very best in the game just a little over two years ago.\n\nThey appeared to put paid to any notion of a World Cup hangover when they opened the 2024 Six Nations against France, winning 38-17 against 14 men in Marseille, but it has subsequently been a very different story.\n\nIn the nine games since against the four sides currently above them in the world rankings, Ireland have won two and lost seven.\n\nFive of the losses, and none of the wins, have been by margins of 10 points or more and there were times, especially when 29-0 down early in the second half, when this appeared the widest gap of the lot.\n\nIreland remain admirably consistent in winning the games that they should win. But winning those that they could win increasingly looks like a bridge too far.\n\nFew sides in the world could cope with losing three players in one position, especially one as specialised as loose-head prop.\n\nJeremy Loughman had just five caps before Thursday's game, while Michael Milne's only previous Tests were as a replacement against Georgia and Portugal.\n\nWhile that certainly speaks to Ireland's injury problems, it is worth noting that even before Ireland's loose-head stocks were decimated, Andrew Porter's two primary back-ups, Jack Boyle and Paddy McCarthy, still have just eight caps between them.\n\nThat can be said to be a legacy of the continued reliance on Cian Healy right up to the point of his retirement last year but the situation in not confined to just one position.\n\nInjuries are inevitable. Yet in the main, Ireland's squad - outside their starting XV and a handful of select others - feels underexposed to the highest level of Test rugby.\n\nFor instance, reserve scrum-half Craig Casey has been part of the squad for almost five years and won his 25th cap from the bench in the Stade de France but has never started a Six Nations game against opposition other than Italy - he saw only seven minutes of action on Thursday.\n\nNick Timoney led the resurgence off the bench. The unwaveringly consistent Ulster back row scored his side's first points of the game and led the belated charge at France.\n\nAlmost five years after his debut, and six months beyond his 30th birthday, this was his first Six Nations cap.\n\n\"You could use the excuses and they are there, the injuries, we haven't the depth of squad to go that deep, but there's been a fundamental thought of relying on the Leinster base and for the last few years that hasn't gone as well for the Leinster team,\" said O'Callaghan.\n\n\"You're trying to integrate players and it's just been too much of a gap.\"",

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.
