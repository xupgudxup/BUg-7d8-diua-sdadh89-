    "description": "Minnesota has now won nine games in a row",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Golden Gophers women’s basketball team remained on a roll after upsetting #10 Ohio State 74-61 at Williams Arena on Wednesday night. The Gophers have now won nine games in a row—their second longest Big Ten winning streak in program history only behind the eleven in a row the 2003-04 team won en route to the Final Four that season. It was Minnesota’s first win over the Buckeyes since 2016 and puts them currently alone in 4th place in the Big Ten standings with just two games remaining in the regular season.\n\nThe Gophers got off to a bit of a slow start against the Buckeyes before dominating the final 25 minutes of the game. The Gophers took a 14-11 lead but then allowed the Buckeyes to close out the first quarter and the start of the second quarter on a 12-0 run to extend their lead to 23-14 with 7:48 to play in the second quarter. The nine point lead would be the biggest the Buckeyes had the rest of the way as Minnesota began chipping back slowly across the rest of the second quarter. A quick 6-0 run cut the Buckeye lead to three at 23-20, and the teams traded baskets the rest of the way allowing for Ohio State to take a three-point lead into halftime 29-26.\n\nMinnesota needed to find their offense at halftime. The Gophers only trailed by three and shot an abysmal 27.5% in the first half including just 2-0 from beyond the arc. Ohio State was successful from three shooting 45% , but Minnesota had limited the damage. The game was in their hands if they could execute.\n\nAnd execute they did in the third quarter. Minnesota dominated the Buckeyes in the period starting on a 9-0 run. Ohio State tried to limit the damage, but the Gophers kept coming and coming and would outscore the Buckeyes 27-13 in the quarter to take a 53-42 edge into the final ten minutes. The Gophers found their shot shooting 66.6% from the field and 4-6 from beyond the arc in the quarter.\n\nThat trend would continue in the fourth quarter. The Gophers jumped out with a 7-2 run again and stretched their lead to sixteen points at 60-44. Minnesota slowed down some committing a few bad turnovers and missing some easy shots allowing OSU to get back in the game. The Gophers weathered some Buckeye runs and answered with huge shots of their own. After Ohio State got the lead down to seven with 3:38 to play it was Mara Braun with a huge three to push the lead back to ten. One last Buckeye push cut the Gopher lead to six with 2:08 to play, but the Gophers stars were not going to let this one slip away. After Amaya Battle had her shot blocked she grabbed the rebound and called timeout with just 3.8 left on the shot clock. The Gophers worked up a perfect play out of the timeout and found Braun for a wide open jumper to go up eight. The Buckeyes came down and missed a jumper with some great defense by Tori McKinney. Battle picked up the rebound and the Gophers showcases some great ball movement skipping it across court to McKinney who drove and got stopped and fed Sophie Hart in the high post who found a wide open Grace Grocholski at the top of the key who drained the dagger three to lock up the game.\n\nGRACE FROM DOWNTOWN AND THE BARN CAN FEEL IT 🍿\n\n📺: B1G+ pic.twitter.com/Sj2TiRPZPQ\n\n— Minnesota Women's Basketball (@GopherWBB) February 19, 2026\n\nA pair of missed Buckeye shots and a pair of Braun free throws later, the celebration was on after the massive upset victory.\n\nANOTHER TOP 10 WIN? YOU BETCHA!!!! pic.twitter.com/Kiag7FJ7eW\n\n— Minnesota Women's Basketball (@GopherWBB) February 19, 2026\n\nCellys caught in 4K🎥 pic.twitter.com/Su61A8KyK4\n\n— Minnesota Women's Basketball (@GopherWBB) February 19, 2026\n\nMinnesota’s stars came out to play in the game. Hart and Battle each finished with double-doubles. Hart scored 18 points and added 10 rebounds, five of which were offensive. Battle finished with 13 points and a team high 12 rebounds. She also added five assists, and with her pass to Brun for a three-pointer in the third quarter passed Lindsay Whalen for #2 in the all-time Gopher assist list.\n\nBraun added 18 points to lead the way along with Hart, and Grocholski added 12 and McKinney nine. In our three keys preview post we said that the Gophers needed to do three things. First keep Buckeye star Jaloni Cambridge in check. Cambridge did score 23 points, but on a very inefficient 10-27 from the field. McKinney played magnificent defense on the Buckeye star and limited her influence on the game.\n\nSecondly the Gophers needed to deal with the Buckeye full court press. They did then mostly successfully as well. OSU got a couple of steals on their full court pressure, but Minnesota only committed nine turnovers—two less than their average and 12 less that the Buckeyes opponents were averaging this season. The Gophers actually flipped the script forcing 11 OSU turnovers, and more importantly scoring 17 points off of those turnovers compared to just 10 for the Buckeyes.\n\nThirdly the Gophers needed to rule the boards and get second chance opportunities. They absolutely dominated this aspect of the game. Minnesota outrebounded Ohio State 47-32 and recorded 15 offensive rebounds compared to the Buckeyes seven. Minnesota scored 17 second chance points compared to six from OSU—that’s your winning margin right there. The Gophers dominated the paint again outscoring OSU 32-16. That’s how Minnesota wins.\n\nWith the win the Gophers now sit in fourth place in the Big Ten standings at 12-4. They have just two regular season games remaining—hosting #18 Michigan State on Senior Day at The Barn on Sunday and then finishing out at Illinois on Sunday March 1st. Ohio State sists in 5th place at 11-4, but the Gophers will own the tiebreak over the Buckeyes for fourth place. Iowa sits ahead of Minnesota at 11-3, but again the Gophers would own the tiebreak with the Hawkeyes. Iowa finishes the regular season at Purdue, and home against Michigan and Illinois. The third seed in the Big Ten Tournament is in reach if the Gophers can close out with a pair of wins to stretch their winning streak to 11—which would tie the all time Big Ten winning streak the 2003-04 and 2004-25 teams achieved.\n\nThe win also moved Minnesota up to #8 in the NET rankings which help decide the NCAA field. Minnesota is a lock to make the field at this point, but is still jockeying for seeding. Prior to the Buckeye game the Gophers were looking at either a five or six seed, but if Minnesota can win out, a four seed is very much a possibility. Why is a four seed so huge? If the Gophers can earn a four seed they would host the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament at Williams Arena. A huge advantage for this team as they head into March Madness.\n\nThe next step is adding one more home ranked win. #18 Michigan State comes to the Barn on Sunday for Senior Day where the Gophers will honor Hart, Battle, Finau Tonga, Brylee Glen and Tracy Bershers. Hopefully they can close out the regular season in successful fashion and make sure those five ladies get at least one more home game.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHall of Famer Michael Irvin criticized San Francisco as the worst Super Bowl LX host he’s experienced, urging the league never to return the championship game to the Bay Area.\n\nIn a recent YouTube video, Irvin said the game at Levi’s Stadium was overshadowed by a lackluster host-city experience. He described the week as “blah” and said San Francisco “just wasn’t jumping” like a Super Bowl city should.\n\n“This was a horrible Super Bowl,” Irvin said. “They should never ever, ever, ever bring the Super Bowl back to San Francisco. In all the years of going to a Super Bowl, this was the worst.”\n\nIrvin spent the week leading up to the game working Radio Row at Moscone Center and attending league- and sponsor-run events across the city. He said the atmosphere around those festivities, from the streets to the parties didn't match the magnitude of the big game.\n\n“The people, blah. The buildings out here looked blah. When you go into events it was blah,” Irvin said. “I’m thinking there should be so much money out here because the tech is out here, right? But it all looks so blah.”\n\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion also criticized traffic and street closures in downtown San Francisco, saying it was nearly impossible to get around during the days leading up to the game.\n\n“I hope the people of San Fran don’t hate me for it, because I’ve had great times here,” Irvin said. “But this, no more.

    "fullText": "Coco Gauff cruised past Alexandra Eala in straight sets, sending the Filipina star out of the Dubai Open.\n\nAfter a 6-0 opening set and a 4-0 deficit in the second, there were fears she might not get on the scoreboard at all.\n\nEala did show some resilience to pull a few games back, but Gauff closed it out comfortably, despite much of the crowd clearly hoping for an upset.\n\nEven though most of the support was against her, Gauff appreciated how vocal the fans were for Eala throughout.\n\nSpeaking on court, Gauff rated her performance, having dominated throughout despite a small wobble in the second set.\n\nShe said: “It was a bit better today. I could have served a little bit better, but I made it in when it mattered. Alex is a tough competitor, and I knew that she could come back at any given moment. I have seen her do it before.”\n\nThe Filipina crowd was clearly the source of that fear, which Gauff went on to acknowledge: “Thank you guys for coming out here. I know you were mostly supporting Alex, but I have to say that it’s great to be on a crowded court. I have played this tournament for many years, and to see the stadium full means a lot.\n\n“Also, I would like to thank Alex for bringing a new demographic to the sport. I really appreciate it. It’s great, I know sometimes it’s tough when you’re playing against a home crowd, but I think it’s great for the sport. So keep being enthusiastic and rooting for your player.”\n\nGauff explained she used a similar approach in Paris last year when facing Lois Boisson, another match where she was not backed by the home fans.\n\n“I had a similar match at the French Open last year, so I brought that mindset today.\n\n“Whenever you guys were cheering for Alex, I was pretending it was my name, and I think that helped me a lot. If you can’t beat them, join them!\n\n“It’s just confidence and the serve. Just being confident with that shot. Each match has gotten better. I wasn’t in good spirits before this tournament, but one match can change everything.\n\n“I didn’t think I would be in the semis to start the week, but I’m happy that I’m here.”\n\nEala’s strong showing in Dubai comes at a good time, especially with the Miami Open just around the corner, where she will have points to defend from last year’s semifinal appearance.\n\nIt was that run in Miami that first got people talking about her, and she hasn’t looked back since.\n\nHer Dubai campaign started with a win over Hailey Baptiste, who retired early in the second set.\n\nShe then knocked out Jasmine Paolini for her third top-ten victory, setting up a meeting with Sorana Cîrstea in the Round of 16.\n\nFacing Cîrstea was no small task, but the 20-year-old handled it well and ended the Romanian’s seven-match winning streak without too much trouble.\n\nWhile Gauff ultimately proved too strong this time, Eala’s profile continues to rise as she gains more experience against top-level opponents.\n\nNick Kyrgios reacts on social media after being mentioned in rap song\n\nAmanda Anisimova reflects on seeing Andreeva in tears after their Dubai Tennis Championships match",

    "fullText": "Fondazione Milan is celebrating its 23rd anniversary alongside Alessandra Locatelli, Minister for Disabilities, and Paolo Scaroni, Chairman of AC Milan and Fondazione Milan. On this occasion, the organisation is unveiling a new accessibility project for people with visual impairments, developed together with Sara Assicurazioni, the Club's Official Insurance Partner.\n\nThe anniversary event - which also featured the Milan City Councillor for Sport, Tourism and Youth Policies Martina Riva, the Lombardy Regional Councillor Lisa Noja, AC Milan Brand Ambassador and Fondazione Milan Board Member Daniele Massaro, as well as Sara Assicurazioni's Marketing, Brand and Customer Experience Director Marco Brachini - took place today, Thursday 19 February, at the Mondo Milan Museum. To mark the celebration, the room dedicated to the charity's initiatives has been given a refreshed look.\n\nThrough photographs and memorabilia, the exhibition traces a story of continuous commitment and evolution, highlighting the organisation's focus on key social issues and its use of sport to drive positive change. Since 2003, more than €13 million has been invested in social projects, directly improving the lives of over 200,000 beneficiaries through 288 initiatives carried out across Italy and in 24 countries worldwide. Starting from Milan and expanding internationally, Fondazione Milan has become one of the most established philanthropic entities in the European sports sector.\n\nWith this new project, presented jointly by the charity and Sara Assicurazioni, AC Milan becomes the first club in Italy to adopt Tag System technology, ensuring even greater accessibility at its headquarters and museum for visitors with visual impairments. By scanning more than 50 tags installed throughout Casa Milan and the Mondo Milan Museum - the first museum in Milan and the second in Italy to use this solution - visitors can access contextual, multilingual audio instructions through a free app, helping them navigate the space and immerse themselves in the Rossoneri world.\n\nDesigned to meet a specific accessibility need and transformed into an inclusive experience for all visitors, this tool overturns traditional paradigms by strengthening the bond between the Club and its community, reaffirming the headquarters as an inclusive space open to AC Milan supporters, sports enthusiasts, and the city as a whole. This development further enhances the Club's longstanding commitment to inclusion, already recognised as best practice thanks to initiatives such as the audio‑descriptive commentary for matches at San Siro and real-time LIS interpretation of the press conferences for the men's First Team.\n\n\"I sincerely thank Fondazione Milan and Sara Assicurazioni for choosing to invest in a new project that places accessibility and human dignity at its core,\" said Minister Alessandra Locatelli. \"The adoption of Tag System technology represents an important step toward a more inclusive society, one capable of breaking down sensory and cultural barriers. Making an iconic place like AC Milan's home fully accessible to people with visual impairments means affirming a fundamental principle: access to sport, culture, and events must be guaranteed to every person. And together, we must continue to work - with ever more courage - toward this goal. Collaboration at every level generates valuable opportunities, as this initiative demonstrates, and it is the path toward building communities that are truly more attentive and welcoming to all.\"\n\n\"Over the past 23 years, Fondazione Milan has become a fundamental pillar of what our Club represents,\" added Paolo Scaroni, Chairman of AC Milan and Fondazione Milan. \"With over €13 million invested and more than 200,000 beneficiaries reached in Italy and around the world, its impact is both tangible and measurable. Today, we celebrate this journey at the Mondo Milan Museum, a symbolic place in our history, together with the Minister for Disabilities, Alessandra Locatelli, whom I thank for her presence. We look to the future with a new accessibility project that brings together technological innovation and social responsibility.\"\n\n\"We are proud to support Fondazione Milan in this important milestone and to have actively helped make Casa Milan and its Museum even more inclusive. As an insurance company, the protection and wellbeing of people are at the heart of what we do, which is why we chose to support the adoption of Tag System technology, enabling architectural and sensory barriers to be removed through digital innovation. Standing alongside the first football club in Italy to implement this solution confirms our commitment to promoting a culture of accessibility that allows every visitor, without exception, to fully experience the passion and history of the Rossoneri,\" said Alberto Tosti, General Manager of Sara Assicurazioni.",

    "fullText": "Where is Nancy Kerrigan now? Inside the Olympic figure skater's life after Tonya Harding scandal originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTonya Harding's attack on Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 Winter Olympics will forever go down as one of the most shocking moments in Olympics history.\n\nKerrigan was famously attacked with a baton in her right thigh on Jan. 6, 1994 at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, less than two months before the Winter Olympics in Norway.\n\nNot long after, it came out that American figure skater, Harding, was behind the attack, along with her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly and bodyguard Shawn Eckardt.\n\nThe man hired to carry it out, Shane Stant, told Inside Edition the plan to take Harding's competitor out was even worse.\n\n\"There was initial talk of cutting her Achilles tendon, which obviously would cripple her,\" Stant told the outlet. \"I didn't think it was necessary. I wasn't willing to do that.\"\n\nHarding denied any involvement, but was later convicted of conspiracy to hinder a prosecution's investigation into the incident. As a result, she was sentenced to three years probation, 500 hours of community service, and a $160,000 fine. She was also banned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association for life.\n\nDespite the horrific incident, Kerrigan, 56, went on to win silver at the '94 Winter Games and gained a ton of notoriety from the ordeal.\n\nThree decades later, her life is very different from the high-pressure world she once lived in.\n\nHere's what Kerrigan's up to today.\n\nOne year after her attack, Kerrigan married her longtime agent, Jerry Solomon, in 1995.\n\nThe couple went on to have children, Matthew, Brian, and Nicole, however, their road to parenthood wasn't exactly an easy one.\n\nKerrigan suffered six miscarriages in eight years, which left her feeling like a \"failure.\" The experience also had an impact on her marriage to Solomon, she later admitted, although the two are still happily married today.\n\n“Since I was 10 years old, I always wanted to have three kids by the time I was 30, sort of like what my mom had done,” the two-time Olympic medalist said back in 2017. \"It was pretty awful. You feel guilty. Like, what did you do wrong? It makes you feel like a failure.\"\n\nThe former Team USA figure skater was forced to turn to IVF treatments, which ultimately gave her the three children she was hoping for.\n\nKerrigan hasn't stepped away from figure skating completely.\n\nAfter being inducted into the Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2004, she went on to serve as a special correspondent during several Olympic Games. She still laces up her skates sometimes, too.\n\nIn January, the two-time Olympic medal winner hit up the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in St. Louis and a few months earlier, she took part in the \"Holiday Spectacular on Ice,\" at The Gateway Playhouse in Bellport, New York.\n\nIn 2024, Kerrigan showed off the fact that she's got some skills on the ice in a video promoting an adult ice skating camp shared via Instagram.\n\nOutside of the rink, Kerrigan returned to the spotlight in 2017 to compete in the ballroom dancing reality show \"Dancing With The Stars.\"\n\nPartnered with dance pro Artem Chigvintsev, Kerrigan finished sixth during her Season 24 appearance.\n\nShe shared an emotional post that year via Instagram after being eliminated to sum up her experience on the reality show.\n\n\"This picture says so much. I loved my time on #dwts. I will miss everyone involved. You are remarkable! Artem THANK YOU you made it all worth it and special!\" Kerrigan captioned the post.\n\nKerrigan released her first children's book, \"Stranger Than She Thinks,\" in December 2023.\n\nThe book follows an 8-year-old skater named Nancy, who puts in the hard word and dedication to master her first jump, the axel.\n\n\"So happy for the book for book promise.

    "fullText": "What country is AIN? Explaining abbreviation for Russian figure skater at 2026 Winter Olympics originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFigure skating is one of the Winter Olympics' signature offerings. No event within its orbit carries more weight than its last — the women's singles.\n\nWomen's singles has long served a platform for the sport's finest talents to shine. From Katarina Witt's dominance with East Germany in the 1984 and 1988 Games to Tara Lipinski's triumphs in the 1998 tournament, the event is a memorable one, offering a spotlight for the sport's finest talents to flaunt their gifts.\n\nThe 2026 iteration of the competition is no exception. Ami Nakai, Kaori Sakamoto and Alysa Liu are some of the standouts who have captivated the masses thus far. So too has Adeliia Petrosian, an 18-year-old who could compete for a podium place.\n\nWhen she takes to the ice, Petrosian sports an unfamiliar flag — one that includes the \"AIN\" abbreviation on it. Just what is Petrosian's country of origin? And why must she compete under the AIN banner? Here's what you need to know.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\n\"AIN\" is the country code for \"Individual Neutral Athletes\", referred to as Athlètes Individuels Neutres in French. The team consists of Russian and Belarusian athletes who meet several criteria, one of which bars athletes who \"actively support\" Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine.\n\nRussian athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) banner during the 2022 Winter Olympics, an aftershock of a doping scandal which brought about a two-year ban from all major sporting events.\n\nLike FIFA and UEFA, the IOC swiftly moved to bar Russia and Belarus from international competition following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. They've been inconsistent in their willingness to apply that tactic elsewhere: Israel has fielded teams for the 2024 Summer Olympics and 2026 Winter Olympics despite the country committing a genocide against Palestinians, as laid out by numerous human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, the United Nations and Human Rights Watch.\n\nTwenty athletes are presently playing under the AIN banner, including Petrosian and Nikita Filippov, a Russian ski mountaineer who claimed silver in the men's sprint in 2026.\n\nMORE: What's the story behind Alysa Liu's teeth piercings?\n\nPetrosian hails from Moscow. The 18-year-old is widely considered one of Russia's best skaters, capturing three Russian national championships and three Russian Grand Prix Final titles.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics represents just the second time Petrosian has competed in a senior-level event outside of Russia since 2022. Her performances are artful and athletic, pockmarked by dizzying spins and quadruple jumps, the hardest skill to master in the sport.\n\nHer inclusion on the AIN roster has made her the subject of some controversy. Petrosian has never tested positive for steroids or been implicated in doping. But the ROC had its 2022 team event gold medal stripped when one of Petrosian's training mates, then-15-year-old Kamila Valieva, tested positive for a banned substance thought to improve stamina and endurance.\n\nValieva served a four-year ban as a result of the alleged misdeed. The rest of her team — including coach Eteri Tutberidze and choreographer Daniil Gleikhengauz — were spared punishment. Gleikhengauz is Petrosian's coach at the 2026 Winter Olympics, while Tutberidze — officially serving as one of Georgia's figure skating coaches — reportedly accompanied Petrosian during practices, according to The New York Times.\n\nMORE: Youngest, oldest American Olympians in 2026\n\nPetrosian satisfied the International Skating Union's requirements to return to competition as an unaffiliated athlete. The pathway required athletes to complete several steps. The IOC ruled that AIN athletes had to disavow Russia's war with Ukraine and \"not have any ties to military agencies in their countries,\", according to NBC.\n\nMORE: Explaining the differences between ice dancing and figure skating\n\nRussians have found plenty of success in the women's singles event in the Winter Olympics. They nearly swept the podium places in 2018 and 2022, taking gold and silver in each tournament. However, athletes were unable to perform under Russia's banner following the suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee amid the country's doping scandal.\n\nThe last time a Russian won a medal in the women's singles event while competing for Russia was in 2014, when Adelina Sotnikova outshined Japan's Yuna Kim and Italy's Carolina Kostner for the prize.\n\nMORE:Full guide to figure skating scoring system",

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nOne of the D-Backs’ major storylines coming out of the 2025 season was how they would address the bullpen. After once having a stable and consistent pitching staff in 2023 that helped lead them to the World Series, the next two years were different.\n\nThe club ranked near the bottom of the league in relief pitching. They finished with one of the five worst ERAs in MLB at 4.82 and had 29 blown saves. Last year, the bullpen was hit with injuries throughout its depth — including to Justin Martinez and A.J. Puk, who were seen as anchors among the relievers. However, this year, many new faces are joining Arizona for a chance to compete for a roster spot.\n\nGinkel says this year feels different from the last few years.\n\nFeb 10, 2026; Scottsdale, AZ, USA; Arizona Diamondbacks pitchers Merrill Kelly (29) (left) and Ryan Thompson (81) (right) throw in sync during workouts at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick. Mandatory Credit: Allan Henry-Imagn Images\n\n“I know it’s kinda the cliche coming into a Spring Training, but I love our bullpen right now,” Ginkel said during Wednesday’s Playmakers Classic. “I’m excited to see some guys get into games, the young guys we have that I know are going to help contribute to some wins this year.”\n\nIt isn’t just new faces joining the organization, but also the emergence of an old and familiar face in the desert. Earlier this month, former Diamondbacks closer Paul Sewald re-signed with the club and will also be looking for a different type of year than 2025.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks pitcher Paul Sewald during spring training workouts at Salt River Fields on Feb. 16, 2026, in Scottsdale. © Rob Schumacher/The Republic / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nAfter the 2024 season, Sewald moved on from the Valley, signing with the Cleveland Guardians before being traded to the Detroit Tigers at the 2025 trade deadline. While his season consisted of a 4.58 ERA through 19.2 innings, Ginkel believes a bounce-back and his veteran presence will be difference-makers this season.\n\n“I feel like with Sewald back, from a leadership perspective and him holding guys accountable, is going to be a great spot for him to be,” he said. “I think he’s hungry to come back and have the year that he wants to have.”\n\nAs Spring Training progresses and each pitcher has the chance to showcase what they can do to be part of the Arizona bullpen, Ginkel is confident the group has the depth necessary to make this year different.\n\n“I’m excited,” the D-Backs reliever said. “I think our pitching and our defense are gonna be a huge piece of our team and our success this year.”\n\nThe Diamondbacks begin their Spring Training schedule against the Colorado Rockies on Friday, Feb. 20, at 1:10 p.m.\n\nCorbin Carroll talks community, outlook on Diamondbacks’ 2026 season at Playmakers Classic",

They have generated 95 slot shots while conceding 38, good for a tournament-leading 71.4% share.\n\nSlovakia lags well behind. They’ve earned just 53.4% of the slot shots, by far the lowest mark among the four remaining teams.\n\nUSA should control possession and pile up the chances throughout. While Slovakian goalie Samuel Hlavaj has held up well to date, it’s important to remember he owns subpar AHL numbers and has made ECHL appearances in consecutive seasons.\n\nUSA’s high-powered offense should break through and make it hard for Slovakia to keep up.\n\nimg src=\"https://img.covers.com/betting/sportsbooks/142/fanatics.svg\" alt=\"Bet99\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"194\" height=\"62\"\n\nUSA has scored at least five goals in three of four games, which is impressive considering they’ve faced established NHL netminders three times.\n\nTheir offense is loaded with firepower and will be difficult for a thin Slovakian team to slow — especially if Hlajav is overmatched, as he should be.\n\nSlovakia has scored at least twice in all of their games, including against quality opponents like Finland and Sweden. If they can chip in a goal or two, this number should sail Over.\n\nMoneyline: USA -1000 | Slovakia +640\n\nPuck Line: USA -2.5 | Slovakia +2.5\n\nOver/Under: Over 5.5 | Under 5.5\n\nMilano Santagiulia Arena, Milan, Italy\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Any Olympic sport requires rigorous training, preparation and immense talent. Every four years, athletes from across the globe compete in the toughest competitions of their lives for the chance at a medal.\n\nHowever, during Wednesday's women's cross-country skiing team sprint race, it was proven that you don't have to be a superhuman to compete in the Olympics.\n\n🐶\nDuring the competition, which involves a six-mile sprint through the snow, Croatian skier Tena Hadzic was making her final stretch toward the finish line when a Czechoslovakian wolfdog managed to enter the course in Tesero, Italy. The two-year-old dog named Nazgul trailed not far behind Hadzic when he managed to cross the finish line among cheers from fans in the stands.\n\nAfter his triumphant Olympic participation, Nazgul was then captured by race officials and returned to his home at a local bed and breakfast near the track. While some may say Nazgul has an unfair advantage in racing in the snow, his viral moment was the highlight performance for many this Olympic season.\n\nNPR interviewed the owners, who revealed, \"He was crying this morning more than normal because he was seeing us leaving — and I think he just wanted to follow us.\" Describing him as \"stubborn, but very sweet,\" Nazgul was reported safe and unharmed during his Olympic run, not before posing for his unofficial bronze medal performance.\n\nAlthough the incident occurred in the midst of a preliminary qualifying round, the top medal contenders had already concluded their participation by the time Nazgul arrived, ensuring no official medal contention was jeopardized.\n\nHadzic also revealed to NPR that although it did cost \"some seconds,\" the entire ordeal was not a \"big deal, because I'm not fighting for medals or anything big.\"\n\nOther athletes, like Greece's Konstantina Charalampidou, told ESPN, \"He was chasing the camera that goes up and down the finish line. He was cute but not aggressive. I wanted to pet him, but I didn't have the time, and I couldn't find him afterwards.\"\n\nWhile it looks like Nazgul won't be returning to fight for an official podium finish, many pet parents are starting to gear up their own pets for the potential of a Pet Olympics in the future, where Nazgul may defend his title.\n\nIn the meantime, the Olympics organization has released Nazgul's photo finish as a testament to his participation in the Olympics, a feat that not many humans will be able to replicate.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea return to Premier League action on Saturday as Burnley make the trip to Stamford Bridge.\n\nLiam Rosenior’s side were left frustrated after surrendering a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at Leeds last time out, missing the opportunity to climb into the top four.\n\nThey now welcome a Burnley side reeling from a shock FA Cup exit and looking to steady themselves in league play.\n\nChelsea vs Burnley is scheduled for a 3 pm GMT kick-off on Saturday, February 21, 2026, at Stamford Bridge.\n\nDue to the traditional Saturday 3 pm blackout in the UK, the match will not be shown live on television. Supporters can catch free highlights via the Sky Sports app and YouTube channel from 5:15 pm, while Match of the Day will air on BBC One at 10:30 pm GMT.\n\nFans wanting live coverage can follow minute-by-minute updates through dedicated matchday blogs, with on-the-ground analysis and reaction throughout the afternoon.\n\nCole Palmer is expected to return to the Chelsea squad after being left out previously, as his minutes are managed. Romeo Lavia is also back in contention, providing a boost in midfield.\n\nMarc Cucurella will miss out due to a hamstring injury sustained against Leeds, with no confirmed timeline for his return.\n\nJamie Gittens, Filip Jorgensen, and Dario Essugo are not expected back before the end of the month, while Levi Colwill remains a long-term absentee.\n\nBurnley have fewer concerns, with Axel Tuanzebe the only player nearing a return from injury, though he is not expected back until March.\n\nChelsea will be eager to respond to their recent slip and should carry enough quality to control proceedings at home. Burnley’s struggles on the road suggest the Blues can reassert themselves and build momentum ahead of a key clash with Arsenal next week.\n\nPrediction: Chelsea 3-0 Burnley.",

    "description": "The Chicago Bears have released a new statement on a potential new stadium as Indiana lawmakers moved forward with a bill to bring the team to Hammond.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears have released a new statement on a potential new stadium as Indiana lawmakers moved forward with a bill to bring the team to Hammond.\n\nThe Bears said in a statement, \"The passage of SB 27 would mark the most meaningful step forward in our stadium planning efforts to date. We are committed to finishing the remaining site-specific necessary due diligence to support our vision to build a world-class stadium near the Wolf Lake area in Hammond, Indiana. We appreciate the leadership shown by Governor Braun, Speaker Huston, Senator Mishler and members of the Indiana General Assembly in establishing this critical framework and path forward to deliver a premier venue for all of Chicagoland and a destination for Bears fans and visitors from across the globe. We value our partnership and look forward to continuing to build our working relationship together.\"\n\nThursday morning legislators voted unanimously to push a bill out of the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThe bill would create the Northwest Indiana Stadium authority similar to Illinois Sports Facilities Authority.\n\nThis could convince the Chicago Bears to cross state line and build a new stadium.\n\nLawmakers said the Bears would pay $2 billion toward construction costs.\n\nThe proposal includes new food, beverage, and innkeepers taxes in Indiana's northwest counties to help pay for the stadium and infrastructure.\n\nAmong the people who spoke during Thursday's hearing include Hammond's Mayor Thomas McDermott Jr and the Indiana Speaker of the House Rep. Todd Huston.\n\n\"Hammond is ready to partner with the Chicago Bears, basically Hammond would do whatever it takes to help make this project a success,\" Mayor McDermott Jr. said. \"Hammond is uniquely positions for this moment, we are part of the Chicagoland region.\"\n\n\"We've had excellent conversations with the Chicago Bears and we are forging a relationship that would be a foundation for a public/private partnership leaned on construction of a world class stadium,\" Speaker Huston said.\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Braun said in a statement, \"\"Indiana is open for business, and our pro-growth environment continues to attract major opportunities like this partnership with the Chicago Bears. We've identified a promising site near Wolf Lake in Hammond and established a broad framework for negotiating a final deal. The amendment to Senate Bill 27 puts forward the essential framework to complete this agreement, contingent upon site due diligence proceeding smoothly.\"\n\nThe news comes as an Illinois House committee that could have brought the Bears a step closer to a new stadium in Illinois was canceled.\n\nThe House Revenue and Finance Committee canceled a meeting Wednesday to hear the \"Mega Project\" bill.\n\nNo date has been set on a new hearing.\n\nSEE ALSO | Talks of Bears moving to suburbs progressing, Pritzker says, amid attempts to lure team to Indiana\n\nThe bill could give the Bears a long-term property tax break for their proposed stadium in Arlington Heights.\n\nWATCH: Gov. Pritzker says Bears statements on Indiana stadium 'was a surprise'\n\nGovernor JB Pritzker speaking Thursday said the news was disappointed by the Bears statement.\n\n\"It was a surprise to us,\" Governor Pritzker said. \"The Bears actually, yesterday, we completed more than three hours, my team did, of discussions with the Bears, very positive discussions and mostly agreed on a bill that would move forward this morning, but they asked us not to move forward with it this morning because they said they wanted to tweak a couple of items in the bill that were things that we were working on them and so to have a statement put out by the Bears...Now they saying to us that that statement is not some confirmation that they are moving to Indiana but rather that Indiana had asked them to say that they are going to move forward with the negotiations in Indiana, but I have to say it is very disappointing to hear that they would put that statement out but not saying about the advancement that has been made in Illinois. We are waiting to hear from the Bears what they would like to do next.\"\n\nPritzker and his staff, and lawmakers have been meeting with Bears brass behind closed doors.\n\nGary Mayor Eddie Melton released a statement saying, \"Today's announcement that the State of Indiana has selected Hammond for the new Bears stadium marks a major shift for our region. While Gary presented a compelling case, the State's decision now sets the stage for a new chapter in Northwest Indiana.\n\n\"While I would be less than honest if I said there isn't some level of disappointment, I am encouraged to see meaningful progress in this process. Major decisions like this require movement, clarity, and commitment - and today represents a step forward for Northwest Indiana.\n\n\"My primary concern remains ensuring that previously committed funding, particularly the innkeeper's tax revenue designated for the operations of the Lake County Convention Center in Gary, is protected and honored. We must safeguard investments that support our long-term growth and stability.\n\n\"Regional success benefits us all. Should this project move forward following the Bears due diligence exorts in Hammond, I will join leaders from across the state in welcoming the Bears to Northwest Indiana. A development of this magnitude creates a rising tide for the entire region. Gary is uniquely positioned to amplify this economic momentum-serving as the western gateway to the Indiana Dunes National Park, served by three major interstate corridors and an international airport.\n\n\"Gary's progress does not depend on one opportunity. Gary's comeback is real, it is measurable, and its momentum continues.\n\n\"Hammond, don't fumble, we're ready to recover\"",

    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah has opened up about the most technically skilled players he has played with at Liverpool.\n\nAccording to him, Philippe Coutinho and an English teammate stand out for what they did during training sessions.\n\nSalah has spent years at Anfield playing alongside some of the biggest names in football, but his pick for training pitch excellence is a bit more surprising.\n\nDespite ongoing fitness issues, this player’s technical quality left a lasting impression on one of the club’s all-time greats.\n\nDuring a media appearance for Liverpool and AXA, Salah was asked which player stood out to him most in training when he first arrived at the club.\n\nThe ‘Egyptian King’ wasted no time in naming Adam Lallana and Coutinho as the two who regularly caught his eye during sessions at Melwood and the AXA Training Centre.\n\nLallana may not have been the headline act during his six years at Liverpool, but his technical quality was never in question.\n\nTo be spoken of alongside Coutinho, whose £142 million move to Barcelona was built on similar qualities, is a huge compliment from someone of Salah’s standing.\n\nInjuries were a constant obstacle throughout Lallana’s career, and Salah’s remarks leave many wondering how much more he could have achieved if he had stayed fit.\n\nThe Egyptian legend’s appreciation for technical quality is now being mirrored in his growing partnership with Florian Wirtz, who joined the club ahead of the new campaign.\n\nAfter settling in following his high-profile move from Bayer Leverkusen, Wirtz has started to demonstrate the kind of half-turn and vision that made him a standout in Germany. His ability to spot runs and break down tight defences has been exactly what Salah needs to play off.\n\nAs the season progresses, there is potential for them to build a real understanding on the pitch – one that could play a crucial role in whatever silverware Liverpool are able to chase down this season.\n\nAllan Elias breakdown: What Liverpool could get from the 21-year-old Brazilian talent\n\nArne Slot says blaming former Liverpool coach would be unfair",

    "description": "Zach Azzanni brings track record of development to Raiders",
    "fullText": "Previous Role: Wide Receivers Coach\n\nPrevious Team: Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe Raiders officially hired wide receivers coach Zach Azzanni on Wednesday, and the longtime NFL assistant will bring a long list of development, high end receivers, and NFL pedigree to the Raiders receiver room. The Raiders have three young receivers that will require key development, and Azzanni will be tasked with developing them, a rookie, and likely another free agent as well.\n\nZach Azzanni has been named Wide Receivers Coach 🏴‍☠️\n\n— Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) February 18, 2026\n\nThe 49 year old started his career at Valparaiso from 1999-2000 before joining Bowling Green from 2001-2006 as a GA and receivers coach. Azzanni then moved to Central Michigan in 2007 where he stayed till 2009 as a receivers coach, then Florida in 2010 as a WR coach and pass game coordinator, and Western Kentucky in 2011 as the OC. Azzanni then worked for Wisconsin in 2013-2016 as a WR coach and pass game coordinator after Wisconsin in 2012. He made the jump to the NFL in 2017 with the Bears as their receivers coach, the Broncos from 2018-2022, Jets in 2023, and Steelers from 2024-2025.\n\n*I won’t be touching on experience more than a decade old, for any of these breakdowns unless it’s a very key thing to note*\n\nAzzanni would work to develop 5x All-Pro and 7x Pro Bowler Antonio Brown at Central Michigan where Brown would record 305 receptions, 3199 yards, and 22 touchdowns through three seasons with Azzanni as his WR coach.\n\nAzzanni recruited and developed 2017 Bengals 4th rounder Josh Malone & 2020 49ers WR Jauan Jennings at Tennessee. Jennings would record 54 receptions, 729 yards, and 7 TD in his first two seasons with Azzanni and Malone 104 receptions, 1608 yards, and 14 touchdowns in his three seasons. Additionally, he would help recruit Josh Palmer, Ty Chandler, and Marquez Callaway but never coach them as he left for the NFL. He also spent 2015 & 2016 as the Volunteers pass game coordinator where they ranked 92nd in 2015 and 62nd in 2016.\n\nJauan Jennings kick ass player. Will be a free agent this offseason. Does so much more than just catch the ball for the 49ers. Elite blocker at WR and brings an identity to that unit. pic.twitter.com/whfBhfWsJg\n\n— Justin Penik (@JustinPenik) January 4, 2026\n\nIn his first season as the Bears WR coach, Kendall Wright logged 59 receptions, 615 yards, and a touchdown with Josh Bellamy 24 receptions, 376 yards, and a touchdown. Dontrelle Ingram also added 23 receptions, 334 yards, and a touchdown while Deonte Thompson added 11 receptions, 125 yards, and a touchdown. Overall the Bears offense ranked 32nd in the NFL with just 13 passing touchdowns. Wright would not record another NFL game after 2017 and Ingram just 648 yards in his next 26 games. Bellamy’s 376 yards in 2017 were a career high and he logged just 127 yards in the next 23 games before retiring in 2020.\n\nAzzanni joined the Broncos, and in his first season saw Emmanuel Sanders log 868 yards, 71 receptions, and four touchdowns while Courtland Sutton posted 42 receptions, 704 yards, and 4 touchdowns as a rookie. Sanders’ 2018 production was his most since 2016 and the highest yardage he recorded for the remainder of his career in San Francisco, New Orleans, and Buffalo. Tim Patrick also added 23 receptions, 315 yards, and a touchdown as a rookie. The Broncos also saw positive impact from Demaryius Thomas & DaeSean Hamilton. 2019 saw Courtland Sutton post a career high in yards (1112) and his second most receptions with 72. Additionally, he’d make his first of two Pro Bowls. Tim Patrick would add 218 yards and 16 receptions in 8 games. DaeSean Hamilton added 28 receptions, 297 yards, and 2 touchdowns. In 2020, the Broncos drafted rookie Jerry Jeudy who in three seasons with Azzanni would post 157 receptions, 2295 yards, and 9 touchdowns while posting the 2nd, and third most yards of his career, a career high in touchdowns, and the 2nd most receptions of his career. Additionally, Jeudy saw his 10 drops in 2020 drop to 1 in 2021 and 5 in 2022, the two lowest marks of his career. Tim Patrick added 742 yards and 6 touchdowns with rookie KJ Hamler adding another 30 receptions, 381 yards, and 3 touchdowns. Hamler would record 42 receptions, 620 yards, and 3 touchdowns in three seasons, and has not recorded an NFL reception since.\n\nZach Azzanni mic'd up when he was with Broncos a few years ago #Steelers #NFL pic.twitter.com/35bIRyakdw\n\n— Steelers Depot 7⃣ (@Steelersdepot) February 8, 2024\n\nJeudy led rookie WR’s in EPA/target and was 12th in the NFL overall. Additionally, Jeudy ranked 8th in separation, while Sutton ranked top 30 in both separation & EPA/target in both 2018 and 2019. 2021 would see Sutton bounce back from injury with 58 receptions, 776 yards, and 2 touchdowns with Patrick posting 734 yards and 5 TD. Patrick ranked 33rd in EPA/target which was the 2nd time in his career he was inside the top 30th. 2022 continued to be strong for Azzanni and the Broncos receivers with Jeudy logging 972 yards and 6 touchdowns, a near career season and he also ranked top 20 in separation and 32nd in EPA/target.\n\nAzzanni joined the Jets in 2023 following the firing of Broncos head coach Nathaniel Hackett. Rookie Garrett Wilson logged 83 receptions, 1103 yards, and four touchdowns while being named the NFL ROTY as well. His 1103 yards is a career high, and his 83 receptions are the third most in his career. Wilson ranked top 15 in separation and EPA/target, the 3rd rookie WR to do so since 2018 (Jefferson & Chase). Additionally, he’d log just 5 drops, a career low. Allen Lazard posted 23 receptions, 311 yards, and a touchdown while UDFA Xavier Gipson added 21 receptions and 229 yards while posting just 8 receptions, 45 yards, and a touchdown since then.\n\nGarrett Wilson’s 8 REC, 102 yard, 2 TD performance against the Browns in his 2nd career game 🔥 pic.twitter.com/ELI7Psbaj4\n\n— Dylan (@nyjetsfansonly) July 17, 2025\n\nFollowing the struggles in 2023, Azzanni joined the Steelers in 2024 seeing George Pickens post 59 receptions, 900 yards, and three touchdowns along with 15.3 yards/reception. Pickens 6 drops were a career high, though he also ranked 18th in the NFL for EPA/target & 24th in separation through only 14 games. Additionally, Calvin Austin would record a career highs of 36 receptions, 548 yards, and 4 touchdowns while also ranking 12th in separation and 44th in EPA/target. Austin’s 2 drops were a career low, and he’d go on to post 31 receptions, 372 yards, and three touchdowns in 2025 through roughly 200 less snaps. Austin developed into a quality third receiver and a consistent slot option. Van Jefferson posted 24 receptions, 276 yards, and 2 touchdowns the most of his career since 2022. After trading Pickens, the Steelers added DK Metcalf who logged 59 receptions, 850 yards, and 6 TD while also ranking 23rd in EPA/target. The Steelers didn’t see a ton of production from other receivers with Calvin Austin having the 372 yards as noted above, 2nd year receiver Roman Wilson 12 receptions, 166 yards, and 2 touchdowns along with also having production from Adam Thielen, Marques Valdez-Scantling, and Scotty Miller.\n\nAzzanni focuses heavily on blocking, and an emphasis on high effort, lack of mental mistakes which did cause issues in 2025 with the Steelers having a rough go with blocking and penalties at receiver. Azzanni has been noted as being demanded, but players understand his passion and knowledge, which pushes him towards getting the most out of his players. Azzanni focuses his players on the little things, consistently getting strong route runners, high end YAC production, and he’s consistent with producing versatile options at receiver.\n\nJauan Jennings is slated to hit free agency, and beyond his connections to Klint Kubiak from their time with the 49ers, Jennings and Azzani are close with the former recruiting him to Tennessee. Additionally, free agent Calvin Austin is set to hit free agency, and the Raiders should be interested trying to find a possible slot option and ST player which Austin can contribute. Additionally, Cowboys WR George Pickens is slated to hit free agency, but that’s unlikely with the Cowboys expected to place a franchise tag on the superstar receiver.",

    "fullText": "Roger Federer is one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and he has plenty of records to prove it.\n\nFederer boasts an unmatched Grand Slam record, more Wimbledon titles than anyone else, and five consecutive US Open crowns.\n\nHe also holds the record for the most ATP singles titles ever, having won 103 tournaments throughout his career.\n\nAlong the way, Federer built a reputation for stopping long winning runs from some of the biggest names in tennis history.\n\nFederer’s influence stretched across generations, and it started with his win over Sampras at Wimbledon. The American had claimed four straight titles between 1997 and 2000.\n\nThat run was halted by a 20-year-old Federer, who won their fourth-round clash in five sets. It marked a significant shift in the tennis landscape.\n\nThe Swiss legend also ended Nadal’s remarkable 81-match winning streak on clay, which spanned from 2005 to 2007.\n\nThey met again in the final of the Hamburg Masters that year, where Federer managed one of the rare victories over Nadal on clay, taking the title in three sets.\n\nEnded Sampras’ 5 year unbeaten streak at Wimbledon\n\nEnded Nadal’s 81 match winning streak on clay\n\nEnded Djokovic’s 41 match winning streak in 2011\n\nEnded Djokovic’s 4 year unbeaten run in China in 2014\n\nDjokovic opened that season with a 41-match winning streak and picked up seven titles before Roland Garros. It was Federer who handed him his first defeat of the year, knocking him out in the semi-finals.\n\nThe Shanghai Masters semi-final saw Federer hand Djokovic his first loss there after four unbeaten years. It added another chapter to their rivalry and showed just how consistently Federer could disrupt even the best runs in tennis.\n\nFederer didn’t just end other players’ streaks – he built plenty of his own. One of his most remarkable runs came on grass, where he won 65 straight matches from 2003 to 2008.\n\nThat stretch began at the Halle Open and included ten titles along the way, highlighted by five consecutive Wimbledon championships.\n\nThe streak finally ended in the 2008 Wimbledon final against Nadal, a match that many still consider one of the greatest ever played.\n\nWhile Federer had earlier broken Nadal’s clay court run, this was Nadal’s chance to return the favour on grass.\n\nCoco Gauff shares words for Alex Eala faithful following convincing Dubai victory\n\nNick Kyrgios reacts on social media after being mentioned in rap song\n\nAmanda Anisimova reflects on seeing Andreeva in tears after their Dubai Tennis Championships match",

    "fullText": "Ex-leader sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour over failed martial law declaration in 2024\n\nA South Korean court has sentenced the former president Yoon Suk Yeol to life imprisonment with labour over his failed martial law declaration in December 2024, finding him guilty of leading an insurrection and making him the first elected head of state in the country’s democratic era to receive the maximum custodial sentence.\n\nThe Seoul central district court found that Yoon’s declaration of martial law on 3 December 2024 constituted insurrection, carried out with the intent to disrupt the constitutional order.\n\nJudge Jee Kui-youn said the purpose was “to send troops to the national assembly to blockade the assembly hall and arrest key figures, including the assembly speaker and party leaders, thereby preventing lawmakers from gathering to deliberate or vote”.\n\nIn sentencing Yoon on Thursday, the court pointed to his lack of apology throughout the proceedings, his unjustified refusal to attend hearings, and the massive social costs his actions inflicted on South Korean society.\n\nThe court said the martial law greatly damaged the political neutrality of the military and police and caused South Korea’s political standing and credibility in the international community to decline, leaving society “politically divided and experiencing extreme confrontation”.\n\nThe court opted for life imprisonment over the death penalty, noting that while the crime was grave, Yoon’s planning did not appear meticulous, he had attempted to limit the use of physical force, and most of his plans ultimately failed.\n\nIn a historical digression, the judge traced the history of insurrection law and cited the 1649 execution of England’s Charles I, who led troops into parliament, to establish that even heads of state can commit insurrection by attacking the legislature.\n\nThe verdict was broadcast live on national television, capturing Yoon briefly smiling on arrival and later displaying no visible reaction as the sentence was delivered.\n\nUnder South Korean law, the charge of leading an insurrection carries three possible penalties: death, life imprisonment with labour, or life imprisonment without labour.\n\nProsecutors had sought the death penalty, arguing that Yoon committed “a grave destruction of constitutional order” by mobilising troops to surround parliament and attempting to arrest political opponents during the six-hour crisis.\n\nThe verdict came 14 months after events that marked the most serious threat to South Korea’s democracy in decades.\n\nThe charges stem from events on the night of 3 December 2024, when prosecutors said Yoon attempted to use military force to paralyse the legislature, arrest political opponents and seize control of the national election commission. Yoon claimed he was rooting out “anti-state forces” and alleged election fraud without providing evidence.\n\nWithin hours of the declaration, 190 lawmakers broke through military and police cordons to pass an emergency resolution lifting martial law. Parliament impeached Yoon within 11 days, and the constitutional court removed him from office four months later.\n\nOutside the courthouse, hundreds of Yoon supporters – waving South Korean and US flags and chanting “Yoon again” – initially cheered when the judge dismissed some prosecution evidence but turned hostile as the ruling progressed. Some supporters shouted “political judge, step down” and hurled profanities at journalists.\n\nWhen the sentence was announced, some collapsed in tears, crying “the country is finished”. About 500 metres away, progressive groups erupted in cheers and embraced one another, though some expressed disappointment the death penalty had not been imposed.\n\nYoon faces six additional criminal trials, two of which arise from the martial law crisis, including a treason charge alleging that he ordered drone incursions into North Korean airspace in an attempt to provoke a confrontation that could justify military rule. He has already been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for obstructing his own arrest.\n\nThursday’s verdict follows a series of related rulings that formally established the events of 3 December constituted an insurrection.\n\nIn January, the former prime minister Han Duck-soo was handed a 23-year prison sentence in a ruling that described the martial law attempt as a “self-coup” by elected power that was more dangerous than traditional uprisings. The sentence far exceeded prosecutors’ 15-year demand, indicating judicial willingness to impose severe penalties.\n\nOn 12 February, the former interior minister Lee Sang-min was jailed for seven years for his role in the insurrection, including relaying Yoon’s orders to cut power and water to media outlets.\n\nLegal experts said the rulings created a sentencing environment that made the most severe punishment more likely in Yoon’s case.\n\nThe court also sentenced seven co-defendants: Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister, to 30 years; Noh Sang-won, a former intelligence commander, to 18 years; Cho Ji-ho, the former police chief, to 12 years; and Kim Bong-sik, the former Seoul police chief, to 10 years. Mok Hyun-tae, a police commander, received three years. Two defendants, Kim Yong-gun and Yoon Seung-young, were acquitted.\n\nYoon’s legal team released a statement calling the verdict “a predetermined conclusion” and a “show trial”, saying they could not bring themselves to respect the judgment.\n\nThey accused the judiciary of “kneeling to incited public opinion and political power” and applying double standards, pointing to President Lee Jae Myung’s suspended trials and opposition politicians acquitted on illegal evidence grounds.\n\nThe legal team vowed to fight “to the end”, saying truth would eventually be revealed “in the court of history”. Yoon is expected to appeal.\n\nLife imprisonment carries no fixed release date, with parole theoretically possible after 20 years, on demonstration of good conduct and remorse.\n\nThe former president Park Geun-hye was initially sentenced to a combined 32 years in prison for corruption and related offences in 2018. The term was later reduced on appeal and ultimately erased by a presidential pardon in 2021.\n\nIn 1996, the military dictators Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo received death and 22-and-a-half-year sentences, respectively, for their roles in a 1979 coup and subsequent massacre in Gwangju. The sentences were later reduced on appeal, and both men were eventually pardoned.\n\nEvery South Korean president who has served a prison sentence has ultimately been pardoned.",

    "fullText": "Music theorists have studied many fractions of the form\n\nthat are close to 1. They’re called 5-limit commas. Especially cherished are those that have fairly small exponents—given how close they are to 1. I discussed a bunch here:\n\nand I explained the tiniest named one, the utterly astounding ‘atom of Kirnberger’, here:\n\nTwo pitches differing by this ratio sound the same to everyone except certain cleverly designed machines. But remarkably, the atom of Kirnberger shows up rather naturally in music—and it was discovered by a student of Bach! Read my article for details.\n\nAll this made me want to systematically explore such tiny intervals. Below is a table of them, where I list the best ones: the ones that are closest to 1 for a given complexity. The first eleven have names, and many of them play important roles in music! But beyond that point, all but one remain unnamed—or at least I don’t know their names. That’s because they’re too small to be audible, and—except for one—not even considered to be of great theoretical importance.\n\nI’ll list these numbers in decimal form and also in cents, where we take the logarithm of the number in base 2 and multiply by 100. (I dislike this blend of base 2 and base 10, but it’s traditional in music theory.)\n\nMost importantly, I list the monzo of each numbers. This is the vector of exponents: for example, the monzo of\n\nIn case you’re wondering, this term was named after the music theorist Joseph Monzo.\n\nFinally, I list the Tenney height of each number. This is a measure of the number’s complexity: the Tenney height of\n\nThe table below purports to list only 5-limit commas that are close to 1 as possible for a given Tenney height. More precisely, it should list numbers of the form 2i 3j 5k that are > 1 and closer to 1 than any number with smaller Tenney height—except of course for 1 itself.\n\nYou’ll see there’s a big increase in Tenney height after the schisma. This is very interesting: it suggests that the schisma is the last ‘useful’ interval. It’s useful only in that it’s the ratio of two musically important commas, the syntonic comma and the Pythagorean comma. Life in music would be simpler if these were equal, and in well-tempered tuning systems it’s common to pretend that they are.\n\nAll the intervals in this table up to the schisma were discovered by musicians a long time ago, and they all have standard names! After the schisma, interest drops off dramatically.\n\nThe atom of Kirnberger has such amazing properties that it was worth naming. The rest, maybe not. But as you can see, I’ve taken the liberty of naming the smallest interval in the table the ‘quark of Baez’. This is much smaller than all that come before. It’s in bad taste to name things after oneself—indeed this is item 25 on the crackpot index—but I hope it’s allowed as a joke.\n\nI also hope that in the future this is considered my smallest mathematical discovery.\n\nHere is the Python code that should generate the above information. If you’re good at programming, please review it and check it! Someone gave me a gift subscription to Claude, and it (more precisely Opus 4.5) created this code. It seems to make sense, and I’ve checked a bunch of the results, but I don’t know Python.\n\nIn studying this subject I discovered that tiny 5-limit intervals were studied by Gene Ward Smith, a mathematician I used to see around on sci.math and the like. I never knew he worked on microtonal music! I am sad to hear that he died from COVID-19 in January 2021.\n\nI may just be redoing a tiny part of his work: if anyone can find details, please let me know. In his memory, I’ll conclude with this article from the Xenharmonic Wiki:\n\nGene Ward Smith (1947–2021) was an American mathematician, music theorist, and composer.\n\nIn mathematics, he worked in the areas of Galois theory and Moonshine theory.\n\nIn music theory, he introduced wedge products as a way of classifying regular temperaments. In this system, a temperament is specified by means of a wedgie, which may technically be identified as a point on a Grassmannian. He had long drawn attention to the relationship between equal divisions of the octave and the Riemann zeta function.[1][2][3] He early on identified and emphasized free abelian groups of finite rank and their homomorphisms, and it was from that perspective that he contributed to the creation of the regular mapping paradigm.\n\nIn the 1970s, Gene experimented with musical compositions using a device with four square-wave voices, whose tuning was very stable and accurate, being controlled by a crystal oscillator. The device in turn was controlled by HP 9800 series desktop computers, initially the HP 9830A, programmed in HP Basic, later the 9845A. Using this, he explored both just intonation with a particular emphasis on groups of transformations, and pajara.\n\nGene had a basic understanding of the regular mapping paradigm during this period, but it was limited in practice since he was focused on the idea that the next step from meantone should keep some familiar features, and so was interested in tempering out 64/63 in place of 81/80. He knew 7-limit 12 and 22 had tempering out 64/63 and 50/49 in common, and 12 and 27 had tempering out 64/63 and 126/125 in common, and thought these would be logical places to progress to, blending novelty with familiarity. While he never got around to working with augene, he did consider it. For pajara, he found tempering certain JI scales, the 10 and 12 note highschool scales, led to interesting (omnitetrachordal) results, and that there were also closely related symmetric (MOS) scales of size 10 and 12 for pajara; he did some work with these, particularly favoring the pentachordal decatonic scale.\n\nGene was among the first to consider extending the Tonnetz of Hugo Riemann beyond the 5-limit and hence into higher dimensional lattices. In three dimensions, the hexagonal lattice of 5-limit harmony extends to a lattice of type A3 ~ D3. He is also the first to write music in a number of exotic intonation systems.\n\n• Usenet post from 1990 by Gene Smith on homomorphisms and kernels\n\n• Usenet post from 1995 by Gene Smith on homomorphisms and kernels\n\n• Microtonal music by Gene Ward Smith\n\n• Hypergenesis58 (a scale described by Gene Ward Smith)\n\n[1] Rusin, Dave. “Why 12 tones per octave?”\n\n[2] OEIS.

    "description": "The Carthaginian general famously used elephants during the Punic Wars. But until now, archaeologists had never found skeletal remains linking the animals to the conflict",
    "fullText": "In 2019, archaeologists unearthed a strange bone alongside a trove of ancient catapult projectiles in Córdoba, Spain. According to a study published this month in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, the bone may be from one of Hannibal’s war elephants, which the Carthaginian general used against Romans in the Second Punic War.\n\nThe bone “could prove to be a landmark,” lead author Rafael Martínez Sánchez, an archaeologist at the University of Cordoba, tells Live Science’s Tom Metcalfe. Until now, “there has been no direct archaeological testimony for the use of these animals.”\n\nThe dig was conducted ahead of construction for a medical facility on the Colina de los Quemados archaeological site. Archaeologists documented evidence of occupation at the site across hundreds of years beginning around the Late Bronze Age. However, their most intriguing discoveries date to the late Iron Age.\n\nAlong with stone artillery and coins, researchers unearthed a “short, cube-shaped bone,” measuring nearly four inches long. Eventually, they determined that the bone likely came from the right leg of an African or Asian elephant.\n\n“It could belong to the period of the Punic Wars,” Martínez Sánchez told El Pais’ Vicente G. Olaya in 2023. “It could be the first of Hannibal’s elephants to be discovered. We can’t know for sure, but it was certainly a sizable beast.”\n\nIn the years since, researchers have continued studying the bone. Because it is poorly preserved, DNA and protein analyses have proved inconclusive. The species of elephant also remains unconfirmed. However, after radiocarbon testing, researchers were able to conclude that the elephant died between the fourth and third centuries B.C.E.\n\nThis timeline aligns with the Second Punic War, which occurred in the third century B.C.E. This conflict was part of the series of wars between Rome and Carthage, an ancient city in modern-day Tunisia.\n\nStudy co-author Agustín López Jiménez, an expert at the archaeology company Arqueobética, which excavated the site, told El Pais that researchers found the elephant foot bone beneath some collapsed adobe walls dating to around the third century B.C.E. According to the study, the same area revealed 12 three-pound stone balls, which were “unquestionably artillery projectiles for lithoboloi,” a kind of catapult.\n\nThe Second Punic War began after Hannibal attacked Saguntum, a city on the Iberian Peninsula that had allied with Rome. When Carthage refused to withdraw, Rome declared war in 218 B.C.E.\n\nHannibal led his forces northeast from the Iberian Peninsula, aiming for the Alps. The general planned to enter Italy from the north and attack, forcing the Romans to defend their turf. Hannibal’s army reportedly included some 30,000 soldiers, 15,000 horses and 37 war elephants. The mountain march was brutal, and he lost many of the elephants along the way.\n\nDespite the historical record, archaeologists had never found skeletal remains of elephants connected to the Punic Wars—until the Córdoba bone. The researchers say that this bone didn’t come from “one of the mythical specimens Hannibal took across the Alps.” However, Martínez Sánchez tells IFLScience’s Russell Moul, the discovery “is the first time an elephant bone remnant linked to that chronology has been found in Iberia and, to our knowledge, in Europe.”",

    "title": "Verizon acknowledges \"pain\" of new unlock policy, suggests change is coming",
    "description": "Report: Verizon's goal is \"immediate unlock for all payment methods really soon.\"",
    "fullText": "Following our report last week that Verizon is forcing people to wait 35 days for phone unlocks after paying off device installment plans, Verizon is apparently trying to eliminate the inconvenient delay. But Verizon hasn’t confirmed the plan to Ars, and a Verizon statement published by Android Authority yesterday did not provide any timeline for implementing the change.\n\nAs a refresher, an update to Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposed a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off the remaining balance of a device installment plan online, in the Verizon app, or with a Verizon gift card. There’s also a 35-day waiting period after paying off an installment plan over the phone or at a Verizon Authorized Retailer.\n\nSaying restrictions are needed to counter fraud, Verizon will only unlock a phone immediately when someone pays off their device-plan balance at a Verizon corporate store or when someone pays off an installment plan on schedule via automatic payments. If you’re partway into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and pay off the remaining balance early, but without making a trip to a Verizon corporate store, you’d have to wait 35 days for an unlock that would allow you to switch the phone to a different carrier’s network.\n\nVerizon reportedly said it is trying to change that “really soon,” but provided no specific or even estimated rollout date. Android Authority reported yesterday that it received a statement from Verizon saying, “we’ve already rolled out immediate unlocking for customers who pay at our corporate stores or use automated payment methods, since those systems can validate transactions in real-time. For other channels such as our app or authorized retailers, the 35-day window is strictly focused on fraud prevention, ensuring payments are fully cleared. That said, we recognize this is a pain point for our customers and our goal is to provide an immediate device unlock for all payment methods really soon. Our teams are diligently working to bridge that gap and we’ll update the website/policy when this is possible.”\n\nVerizon did not mention this plan when we contacted the company’s public relations team on Friday. At the time, Verizon confirmed the current policy but didn’t say whether it had any plans to change it. We contacted Verizon again yesterday morning and today about the statement reported by Android Authority and have not received a response.\n\nShortly after or around the time this article was published today, PCMag reported that it received a statement from Verizon indicating that the 35-day delay will be dropped for online payments in a matter of weeks. A Verizon spokesperson “said that several weeks from now, the company would add an extra layer of authentication to its site for credit-card payments that would exempt device payoffs from the 35-day hold,” according to PCMag.\n\nUntil recently, Verizon had the most consumer-friendly unlocking policy of the major nationwide wireless carriers in the US. This was because of rules imposed on Verizon’s 700 MHz spectrum licenses and merger conditions on the firm’s purchase of TracFone, which resulted in phones being unlocked after 60 days.\n\nVerizon used to sell phones that were already unlocked, but in 2019, it obtained a waiver from the Federal Communications Commission allowing it to lock phones for 60 days to deter fraud. Verizon subsequently claimed that even the 60-day period wasn’t long enough to stop fraud, and last month received another waiver that lifted the unlocking requirement.\n\nVerizon started overhauling its unlocking policies after receiving the latest waiver, and the rollout has been confusing. When the new policy was put online with an effective date of January 27, it applied the 35-day delay only to cases in which a customer uses a Verizon gift card to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance.\n\nAs we reported, Verizon last week changed that language on the policy page to apply the 35-day delay in more scenarios, but did not change the January 27 effective date. The Verizon statement quoted by Android Authority yesterday said the full terms were presented to customers starting on January 27 even though those terms weren’t fully described on the webpage.\n\n“Regarding the website update timing, the new device unlocking policy went into effect on January 27th,” the Verizon statement said. “Customers purchasing or upgrading from that date were (and are being) presented with the full terms of the new policy at their point of sale. We’ll make sure all our public-facing info is also clear and consistent across channels.”\n\nBut information still is not “clear and consistent across channels,” even when it comes to terms presented directly to phone buyers. For example, the version of the device unlocking policy on Verizon’s webpage for ordering an iPhone 17 says the 35-day delay only applies when a customer uses a Verizon gift card to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance. We found the same language today in Verizon’s listings for other iPhones and devices made by Google, Samsung, and Motorola.\n\nThis version of the policy presented to phone buyers would lead a consumer to believe that a phone will be unlocked automatically once the device financing agreement balance is paid in full, as long as a gift card isn’t used. That is not accurate, as we described in this article and our article last week.\n\nIn one more development we found after this article published, Verizon changed its device unlocking policy again today and updated the effective date to February 18. The new policy is similar to an older version; it details the 35-day unlocking delay after gift card payments but deletes the part that applied the 35-day delay to payments made online or in the Verizon app. This omission is curious because Verizon’s statements to other media outlets indicate that the 35-day delay is still in place for online payments.\n\nThe omission is apparently explained by new language in the policy that says, “A secure payment method is required to unlock a device immediately when paying the full device balance.” But as far as we know, the only “secure payment methods” that currently result in an immediate unlock require paying in a Verizon corporate store. While a separate Verizon FAQ still describes the in-store limitation, a user reading the policy after today’s update may be given the false belief that paying off a device on Verizon’s website will result in an immediate unlock.\n\nThe Verizon unlocking policy discussed so far in this article is for postpaid customers. Verizon’s policy for prepaid customers locks phones to its network “until the completion of 365 days of paid and active service.”\n\nAT&T’s unlocking policy says postpaid phones purchased at least 60 days ago can be unlocked when the device is paid in full. The T-Mobile policy says postpaid phones active on the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days can be unlocked after being paid in full. AT&T imposes a six-month waiting period for unlocking prepaid phones, while T-Mobile has a 365-day waiting period for prepaid phones.\n\nThis article was updated with another change to Verizon’s unlocking policy and a statement reported by PCMag.",

This progress helps drive investment into the power systems where we operate, expand clean energy supply and advance broader energy innovation.\n\nWhat began in 2013 with a single 110 megawatt (MW) power purchase agreement (PPA) in Texas — a small first step to demonstrate how corporate procurement could scale clean energy(3) — has evolved into one of the largest clean energy portfolios in the world. This first deal not only supported Microsoft’s early cloud services but also set in motion a decade of commercial partnerships and learning-by-doing that served to demonstrate how corporate demand for advanced energy solutions can help to achieve a more affordable and sustainable power system, while supporting reliability for customers.\n\nSince our carbon negative announcement in 2020, we have contracted 40 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable energy supply across 26 countries, working with more than 95 utilities and developers across 400+ contracts and counting. To put that amount in perspective — that’s enough energy to power about 10 million US homes. Of that contracted volume, 19 GW are now online, delivering new clean energy supply to the power grid, while the remainder are slated to come online over the next five years.\n\nOur new renewable energy procurement continues to deliver significant environmental benefits, including the reduction of Microsoft’s reported Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 25 million tons(4) and the mobilization of billions of dollars’ worth of private investment in regions where we operate.\n\nMicrosoft is among the early pioneers in developing technical and commercial practices that help advance bankable, repeatable and scalable procurement tools suitable for each market. Our clean energy purchasing navigates a global patchwork of power market designs, requiring creativity in how we balance cost, time to market and project sizing in our portfolio across planning, contracting and management.\n\nOur work has benefited from a broad coalition of partners helping to build this market together. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more than 200 global corporations collectively purchased nearly 200 GW of clean energy around the world since 2008. Working alongside other clean energy buyers — as well as hundreds of utilities, manufacturers, financiers, developers and engineers — we have helped reduce transaction costs, expand developer access to financing and streamline procurement approaches that other buyers can adopt.\n\nThis global flywheel of partnership, investment, technology and policy innovation is expected to continue to facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of investment into infrastructure and jobs. And as we’ve seen repeatedly, when Microsoft sends a clear market signal for world-class, first-of-a-kind technologies and infrastructure, the power sector rises to the challenge. Our procurement over the past decade has demonstrated that partnerships, communities and innovation are essential ingredients that help to accelerate first-of-a-kind technologies and infrastructure at scale.\n\nCritical to Microsoft’s success in expanding digital infrastructure and supporting our local communities is our ability to build trusted partnerships with the over 95 global energy suppliers that support our clean energy portfolio. We have sourced clean energy through multiple requests for proposal or information, bilateral engagements and clean tariffs to evaluate over 5,000 unique carbon-free energy projects around the world.\n\nToday, Microsoft has six energy company partners with which we have over 1 GW of contracted renewable energy capacity, and more than 20 energy supplier partners where each partner has at least five separate renewable energy projects with Microsoft — evidence of the durable, repeatable relationships necessary to scale clean energy. Combining scale with speed, Microsoft’s landmark 10.5 GW framework agreement with Brookfield sends a long-term, 2030 demand signal to the market that enables developers to raise funding more efficiently, bolster supply chains, hire engineers and construct world-class energy infrastructure.\n\nOur renewable energy procurement has mobilized billions of dollars in private investment, supported thousands of jobs across the communities where we operate and delivered meaningful co-benefits. Through partnerships with developers and nonprofit organizations, we’ve worked to embed community-driven benefits into our energy portfolio. These benefits include robust infrastructure, economic inclusion and support for community-focused organizations.\n\nOur support for communities shows up in projects like our 500 MW PPA with Sol Systems, or our 250 MW PPA with Volt Energy Utility that provided local training and jobs, as well as grants to community nonprofit organizations and habitat restoration. We’ve also signed over 1.5 GW of distributed solar, bringing clean energy directly into hundreds of communities around the world. Landmark agreements like our 500 MW offtake with Pivot Energy, or our 270 MW offtake with PowerTrust are expected to foster employment, energy cost savings and grid resilience in communities across the United States, Mexico and Brazil. More details on the above examples and our approach to community benefits in clean energy agreements can be found in a dedicated Microsoft whitepaper.\n\nMicrosoft’s clean energy procurement continues to play an important role in catalyzing technical, commercial and regulatory innovation. Our commercial efforts have helped lower barriers to entry into new markets and expand access into multi-technology contracts that accelerate decarbonization.\n\nIn Japan, Microsoft signed one of the first corporate PPAs in the country’s restructured power market. Our 25 MW, 20-year agreement with Shizen represents the first single-asset virtual PPA executed in the country, which helped pave the way to over 2GWs of corporate procurement since 2024, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Alongside opening new markets, we have structured several multi-technology offtakes in nascent markets for corporate procurement. In India, Microsoft purchased a combined 437 MW solar/wind hybrid offtake from Renew, where our projects will support energy access and rural electrification. In Microsoft’s home state of Washington, our datacenters in Douglas County are supplied by 100% carbon-free energy, as we leverage a creative blend of new wind power and hydropower storage to deliver around-the-clock clean energy.\n\nIn 2025, the International Energy Agency (IEA) described a new “Age of Electricity,” marked by accelerating electricity demand from electric vehicles, air conditioners, data centers and heat pumps. As the world electrifies more of the economy, the demand for affordable, reliable and clean electricity will continue to rise.\n\nOur experience building Microsoft’s clean energy portfolio both reflects and furthers global trends. According to IEA data, since 2000, renewable energy generation has expanded nearly four-fold. In many power markets across the world, clean energy is one of the fast-growing sources of generation, and often the one with the fastest time-to-market. Corporate buyers like Microsoft continue to serve as an important catalyst in driving commercial demand for innovation and infrastructure across the power industry.\n\nAs we continue our journey toward becoming carbon negative by 2030, Microsoft will continue to push for an expansive focus on adding all forms of carbon-free electricity solutions, complementing and adding to our portfolio of renewable energy resources. We recognize that the world’s rising electricity needs require a balanced, all-of-the-above decarbonization strategy to meet global economic growth and environmental goals, and our sustainability goals will continue to support this approach moving forward. Such a strategy requires a broader set of carbon-free energy and grid-enabling technologies, including nuclear energy, next-generation grid infrastructure and carbon capture technology. Just as renewable energy was a relatively small part of global energy grids in 2013 when we signed our first PPA, today many advanced energy technologies remain early in their development but offer significant promise to accelerate progress towards an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy future.\n\nMicrosoft has already taken early steps to support the advancement of a broader set of carbon-free energy technologies as we partner with Helion and Constellation Energy on a 50 MW fusion project in Washington state and work with Constellation to restart the 835 MW Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania. Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund has allocated $806 million of capital to 67 investees, with 38% directed toward Energy Systems — advancing carbon-free power and fuels, energy storage and energy management solutions.\n\nWe welcome continued collaboration with our power sector partners to bring these innovations to market and incorporate new technology tools in the process to accelerate their development.\n\nWe will continue to build and leverage new AI-driven tools to design, permit and deploy new power technologies that help expand and more efficiently operate the electricity grid, bringing more clean energy online faster. This work is exemplified by our recently announced collaborations with Idaho National Laboratory and the Midcontinental System Operator, among other examples.\n\nAnd as we advance innovative energy technologies, we recognize that standards must evolve alongside innovation. That is why we will continue participating in industry forums that strengthen carbon accounting frameworks — so that our clean energy procurement is measured with greater accuracy and delivers real world emissions reductions, with a continued focus on maintaining the high level of integrity that the world has come to expect from Microsoft.\n\nOur carbon negative commitment remains a call to action — for Microsoft, our customers and the broader technology sector — to invest in an affordable, reliable and sustainable power system. As we look toward 2030, that call to action has never been clearer.\n\nToday’s milestone represents a shared achievement among the utility professionals, clean energy developers, community leaders, technology innovators and forward-thinking policymakers who continue the deployment of renewable energy. Meeting today’s milestone shows what partnership can deliver in bringing big ideas to life. The future of carbon-free energy is one that we will create – together.\n\nAs Microsoft’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Melanie Nakagawa leads the company’s targets to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. She brings deep experience at the intersection of policy, business, and technology to advance climate and sustainability solutions globally.\n\nAs President of Cloud Operations + Innovation at Microsoft, Noelle Walsh leads the organization that powers the global Microsoft Cloud. She oversees the company’s physical cloud infrastructure and operations, with a charter focused on safety, security, availability, sustainability, and competitive infrastructure growth—bringing decades of global operational leadership.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s top aides have warned his administration to stay on message as the midterm elections approach in a bid to counter the president’s unpredictable behavior and tendency to go wildly off-script.\n\nAt a strategy session for dozens of administration officials on Tuesday night, the president’s inner circle also acknowledged that affordability would remain a major issue for voters, especially if they didn’t feel the gains Trump often talks about.\n\nThe meeting, on Capitol Hill, was hosted by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, with presentations by her deputy, James Blair, and GOP veteran pollster Tony Fabrizio.\n\nAnd while Trump was not in the room, his longstanding concern—that it is rare for the president’s party to win in midterm elections—was front and center, according to sources.\n\nDuring the two-hour session, Blair, a 36-year-old former political consultant, presented historical trends to this effect.\n\nHe also acknowledged that Trump could be unpredictable and was likely to say and do as he pleased, without necessarily focusing on data. Therefore, he said, it was crucial for everyone else to remain on message, disciplined, and data-driven as the campaign ramped up.\n\nHe also suggested that there was no point in talking about wages going up (something that Trump cites regularly) unless voters feel the impacts of the administration’s economic achievements.\n\nA similar challenge confronted former President Joe Biden, who repeatedly touted the value of so-called “Bidenomics”—even as millions of Americans struggled with cost-of-living pressures.\n\nThe session, which took place at Washington’s Capitol Hill Club, was attended by dozens of administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nThey were told that they would be required to be more active as surrogates for the midterms, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, along with a third of the seats in the 100-member Senate.\n\nLosing in November could ultimately dent Trump’s legislative agenda for the next two years and result in articles of impeachment against him and members of his Cabinet.\n\nWhile Trump is not on the ballot for the midterms, Wiles revealed last year that the White House had shifted its strategy and would make him “campaign like it’s 2024” in the hope that more voters would turn out for the GOP.\n\n“Typically in the midterms, it’s not about who’s sitting at the White House—you localize the election, and you keep the federal officials out of it,” she told conservative group Moms of America.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot because so many of those low propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nBut the president faces a number of headwinds ahead of November, from sinking approval ratings and a fracturing MAGA base, as well as firestorms on everything from the Epstein files to ICE and immigration.\n\nHis bombastic tendency to go wildly off-script is also an issue, such as describing affordability as a “con job” or claiming that the Epstein files are a Democratic “hoax”.\n\nFabrizio took the group through a series of data outlining the issues that matter to voters in targeted seats, with the economy being the top-tier issue, which he said resonated more than border security.\n\nHe also suggested focusing more on podcasts and social media, rather than traditional interviews and news outlets, to get the message out.\n\nBut whether a more disciplined approach will be enough to counter the president’s unpredictability is yet to be seen, according to some Republicans.\n\n“If they stay on message, it’s a good thing,” said Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon. “They get sidetracked… they’ve got to stay focused.”\n\nCritics have also accused Trump of “gaslighting” Americans by trying to spotlight affordability and drug prices on the campaign trail.\n\n“Trump running on affordability is laughable,” said Protect Our Care president Brad Woodhouse.\n\n“Republican policies have only made life more expensive for hard-working families, and nothing has made that more clear than the GOP’s catastrophic cuts to health care.”",

    "description": "\"Not you making me agree with PetSmart.\"",
    "fullText": "A TikToker is going viral after claiming PetSmart employees refused to sell her a juvenile bearded dragon because she didn’t have a large enough tank at home.\n\nWhile Allyssa (@allyssamullins) framed the interaction as unfair, viewers for the most part, were quick to flip the narrative, many of them arguing the store was prioritizing animal welfare over what they called an impulse purchase.\n\nThe initial clip of her interaction with the PetSmart employee reached 7.2 million views and drew more than 31,000 comments.\n\nAccording to the TikToker, store employees told her they could deny the sale at their discretion. They explained that the in-store enclosure exceeded what she planned to use at home.\n\nAlthough she said her setup would be temporary, staff said it failed to meet their standards for the welfare of the animal.\n\nDuring the exchange, employees stressed that their policies allowed flexibility. Therefore, they could refuse a sale if they believed an animal might suffer.\n\nAllyssa described feeling blindsided by the refusal and claimed that she planned to buy a properly sized tank later. That detail quickly became the center of the online backlash on her videos.\n\nViewers noted that the explanation was logical for basic animal welfare. The staff wanted proof of a suitable habitat before selling an exotic animal, not that they wanted her to buy a tank from PetSmart specifically. Instead, they wanted assurance that the bearded dragon would have adequate space to thrive.\n\nIn follow-up videos, Allyssa said the small tank would only be used briefly. First, she claimed it would be two weeks. Later, she shortened that timeline to a day and a half.\n\nBecause of that shift, commenters on both TikTok and X questioned her intentions.\n\nMany accused her of trying to impulse buy an exotic pet. She also complained that the larger tank didn’t look aesthetically pleasing to her, and claimed that commenters wanted her to put a tank on the floor of her house.\n\nReptile owners were annoyed at her focus on aesthetics and argued that looks mattered less than proper care of a living creature.\n\nSeveral people broke down the costs. One commenter wrote, “Hi! Bearded dragon owner\n\nsooo that tank is cheaper than the food you will constantly have to buy each week.” They added, “Baby, leave that beardy there.”\n\nAnother warned, “Bearded dragons cost minimum 700$ to set up proper. 150$ just for lighting. 100 for food monthly.”\n\nOthers echoed that logic. “If you can’t afford the proper tank for the animal then you [can’t] afford the animal,” one person wrote.\n\nOn one of her complaining videos, a reptile owner wrote, “Always best to do research before hand to ensure they have the best life possible from the beginning, not eventually when you can get the things it needs to have a thriving environment.”\n\nPetSmart and @allyssamullins did not respond immediately to the Daily Dot’s request for comment via email and TikTok DM, respectively.\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — He was reportedly his mother Queen Elizabeth II’s favorite, but the former Prince Andrew has long been a headache for Britain's royal family.\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested Thursday, his 66th birthday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office in an inquiry stemming from his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. He is the first senior British royal to be arrested since King Charles I, almost 400 years ago.\n\nBorn a prince in 1960, Andrew is the third child and second son of the queen and her husband Prince Philip. His elder brother Charles was destined for the throne. Andrew took a tried-and-tested route for younger royal sons: military service.\n\nAfter 22 years in the Royal Navy, including combat operations as a helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands War, Andrew was named Britain’s special representative for international trade and investment in 2001. His frequent taxpayer-funded travel saw him dubbed “Air Miles Andy” by the press.\n\nThe current police investigation stems from that period. It follows documents in recently released Epstein files that suggest Andrew passed on official government documents to the late financier when he was a trade envoy. The former prince has not been charged with a crime. He has long denied any wrongdoing over his Epstein links.\n\nOnce a subject of media fascination for his love life, the man the tabloids dubbed “Randy Andy” became a regular source of headlines because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including Epstein, the American financier and convicted sex offender.\n\nThe then-prince's business associations were the subject of tabloid stories stretching back to at least 2007, when he sold his house near Windsor Castle for 20% over the 15 million pound asking price. The buyer was reported to be Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of then-Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, raising concerns that the deal was an attempt to buy influence in Britain.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor was forced to step down from the trade role in 2011 amid growing concern about his friendship with Epstein, who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution.\n\nIn 2015, U.S. court documents contained allegations that Andrew had sex with a woman three times between 1999 and 2002 in London, New York and on Epstein’s private Caribbean island, including when she was a minor under U.S. law. He denied having ever met the woman, later identified as Virginia Roberts Giuffre.\n\nAfter Epstein was arrested again in 2019, Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC’s Newsnight program, in which he tried to explain away his contacts with Epstein. It backfired — he was widely criticized for giving unbelievable explanations and failing to show empathy for Epstein’s victims.\n\nAmid the backlash, Andrew announced on Nov. 20, 2019, that he was giving up public duties and charity roles “for the foreseeable future.”\n\nIn August 2021, Giuffre sued Andrew in a New York court, alleging that the prince had sex with her when she was 17. Andrew continued to deny the allegations, but he was stripped of all military affiliations and royal charity work.\n\nAndrew ultimately settled the case for an undisclosed sum. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. Giuffre died by suicide in April 2025, aged 41.\n\nIn 2024, a court case revealed Andrew’s relationship with a businessman and suspected Chinese spy who was barred from the United Kingdom as a threat to national security. Authorities were concerned that the man could have misused his influence over Andrew, according to court documents.\n\nAfter emails emerged showing Andrew remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously claimed and Giuffre's posthumous memoir brought new allegations, King Charles III in October stripped his brother of his titles of prince and Duke of York and evicted him from his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor.\n\nThe release of millions of pages of Epstein files by the U.S. Department of Justice last month sparked new scrutiny.\n\nNow Andrew is in police custody. Despite being stripped of his title, he remains eighth in line to the British throne. A law would have to be passed to remove him from the line of succession.\n\nHe married Sarah Ferguson in 1986 and they had two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, before divorcing a decade later. Ferguson also is facing questions about her friendship with Epstein.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Andrew is the third child of Queen Elizabeth II, not the second.",

    "fullText": "Late last year, as a US government shutdown cut off the Snap benefits that low-income families rely on for groceries, videos on social media cast the fallout in frantic scenes. “Imma keep it real with you,” a Black woman said in a viral TikTok post, “I get over $2,500 a month in stamps. I sell ’em, $2,000 worth, for about $1,200-$1,500 cash.” Another Black woman ranted about taxpayers’ responsibility to her seven children with seven men, and yet another melted down after her food stamps were rejected at a corn-dog counter.\n\nVisible watermarks stamped some videos as AI-generated – apparently, too faintly for the racist commentators and hustlers more than happy to believe the frenzy was real. “You got people treating it like a side hustle, selling the stamps, abusing the system,” the conservative commentator Amir Odom whinged. Fox News reported on the Snap deepfakes as if they were authentic, before issuing a correction. Newsmax anchor Rob Schmitt claimed people were using Snap “to get their nails done, to get their weaves and hair”. (Lost in the outrage was a basic fact: white Americans make up 37% of Snap’s 42 million beneficiaries.)\n\nThe fake videos are mere shards in the widening mosaic of digital blackface, a pattern that’s spiked in the past two years as generative AI video tools have become widely accessible. “There’s been a massive acceleration,” says Safiya Umoja Noble, a UCLA gender studies professor and author of Algorithms of Oppression, which focuses on digital biases against Black women in particular. “The digital blackface videos are really pulling from the same racist and sexist stereotypes and tropes that have been used for centuries.” The net effect is a patina of Blackness stripped of cultural obligation or stewardship – minstrelsy in a nutshell.\n\nCoined in a 2006 academic paper, the term digital blackface describes a form of Black cultural commodification repurposed for non-Black expression online. Examples run the gamut: posts in African American Vernacular English, the use of darker-skinned emojis, reaction memes featuring Beyoncé, Katt Williams and other exemplars of Black cool.\n\n“The early research that was done on digital blackface started with white gamers using bitmojis of a different race and changing their vernacular to represent themselves,” says Mia Moody, a Baylor University journalism professor whose forthcoming book, Blackface Memes, links the role of Black users in starting and spreading online trends to subsequent digital blackface. “That’s part of the cultural appropriation, gaining the cultural capital. Maybe you’re a nerdy white guy, but if you use this cool avatar of a Black guy with dreadlocks, people will give you respect. You’re interesting all of a sudden.”\n\nDuring memeology’s expansion into short-form video, Black expression has increasingly been divorced from authorship, context or consequence. Internet culture scholars say some non-white online creators use AI-generated avatars modeled on familiar Black faces – the beauty influencer, the culture podcaster, the man-on-the-street interviewer; they slip into feeds alongside real Black content creators. Large language models scour digital spaces that gained cachet from Black speech and humor, absorbing their tone and slang. Hume AI is one of many firms that offer synthetic voices for podcasts and audiobooks such as “Black woman with subtle Louisiana accent”, or “middle-aged African American man with a tone of hard-earned wisdom”. In most cases, creators whose speech is scraped from YouTube, podcasts and social media receive no compensation, much less even know their personalities shaped these models.\n\nThe Snap reaction clips, however, were a notable escalation in the mainstreaming of digital blackface – less blending in, more weapons-grade stereotyping. Many of those videos were created with OpenAI’s text-to-video app Sora. As Sora’s popularity surged in 2025, users exploited its hyperrealism to sully Martin Luther King Jr’s image, sparking ethical debate around “synthetic resurrection”. Deepfakes showed him shoplifting, wrestling Malcolm X, and swearing through his I Have a Dream speech. Conservative influencers swamped feeds with AI-generated embraces between King and Charlie Kirk, conflating their clashing legacies and cultural martyrdom. Bernice King, MLK’s daughter and the director of his Atlanta-based non-profit, criticized the slopaganda as “foolishness”.\n\nInevitably the Trump White House has gotten into the act. In January the official White House X account posted a doctored photo of Minnesota activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, darkened and weeping, in the wake of her arrest at a non-violent anti-ICE demonstration. Earlier this month an image portraying the Obamas as apes was circulated via Trump’s own Truth Social account.\n\nBlackface abides at the underbelly of American mass media even as it evolves at breakneck pace. Its roots trace to the minstrel revues of the early 19th century; white performers smeared grease paint made from charred corks on their faces and plastered on oversized white lips to caricature Black features, and performed exaggerated routines of Black laziness, buffoonery and hypersexuality. Thomas D Rice, a Manhattan playwright, shot to fame in the 1830s playing a loping trickster named Jim Crow – a name that quickly became shorthand for the forced racial segregation policies in the American south that endured until the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nIn their heyday, minstrel shows were the dominant form of American entertainment – reflected in newspaper cartoons and the enormously popular Amos ‘n’ Andy radio shows. After the civil war, Black performers were largely forced into adopting minstrel elements, at the expense of their personhood once more, just to gain any footing on stage. “The objectives were, first, to make money to help educate our younger ones, and second, to try to break down the ill feeling that existed toward the colored people,” explained Tom Fletcher, a vaudeville minstrel and actor for almost 70 years who died in 1954.\n\nEven as minstrelsy faded from the spotlight by the early 20th century, its toxic residue lingered in American culture – from the shuffling crows of Disney’s Dumbo, to Ted Danson’s infamous 1993 blackface roast of Whoopi Goldberg, to the annual parade of white Halloween revelers in racial masquerade. A decade ago, when the internet was still a black box of sorts, researchers such as Noble and MIT’s Joy Buolamwini were sounding the alarm about the inherent racial biases in the coding of algorithms related to medical treatment, loan applications, hiring decisions and facial recognition. Now it’s out in the open, smearing wider and deeper than any burnt cork routine ever could.\n\nTech firms have made some effort to stem the tide of digital blackface. Bowing to public backlash, the King family and more prominent estates, OpenAI, Google and the AI image generator Midjourney disallowed deepfakes of King and other American icons. In January 2025, Meta deleted two of its own AI blackface characters – a retiree called Grandpa Brian and Liv, described as a “proud Black queer momma” and “truth-teller” – after allegations of their non-diverse development team fueled a tempest of criticism. Instagram and TikTok and more have made some attempts to scrub viral digital blackface videos, to tepid results. Last summer, efforts to replicate Bigfoot Baddie – the AI avatar of a Black woman as a human-yeti hybrid in pink wigs, acrylic nails and hair bonnets, created by Google’s Veo AI – erupted into a full-blown social media craze, with some users even hustling how-to courses. The avatar is still on socials.\n\nBlack in AI and the Distributed AI Research Institute (Dair) are among the handful of affinity groups that have pushed for diversity and community input in AI model-building to address programming bias. The AI Now Institute and Partnership on AI have highlighted the risks of AI systems learning from marginalized communities’ data and noted that tech companies could provide mechanisms such as data opt-outs to help limit harmful or exploitative uses. But widespread adoption has been glacial.\n\n“YouTube alone has something like 400 hours of content per minute being uploaded,” Noble says. “With AI generation, these tech firms cannot manage what’s coming through their systems. So they don’t. Or they do what’s absolutely imperative to the US government. But if you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propaganda.”\n\nAlthough the precise impact of AI-generated digital blackface is difficult to quantify, its use by the Trump administration highlights its potential as a powerful tool of official disinformation. The Obama Truth Social entry revived a slur that has festered for years in darker online corners, and one that rhymes with Trump’s sustained efforts to denigrate the former first family. (Trump disclaimed direct responsibility and refused to apologize for that post, which was taken down.) Meanwhile, the White House’s doctored image of Armstrong, altered from an actual photo taken by the Department of Homeland Security and published on their official Twitter account, scanned as a psyop by a government working closely with tech firms to track activists and other perceived enemies of the state.\n\nBeyond laundering bigotry as news, digital blackface exposes Black users to a level of personalized abuse and harassment that harkens to a minstrelsy heyday when racists were fully empowered to express their bigotry unbidden. And then just as now, it seems there is little that can be done to curb the vitriol. “We are living in a United States with an open, no-holds-barred, anti-civil-rights, anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ, anti-poor-policy agenda,” Noble says. “Finding the material to support this position is just a matter of the state bending reality to fit its imperatives. And that’s easily done when every tech company lines up behind the White House.”\n\nEven so, Moody remains hopeful that the current fascination with digital blackface will soon be as outdated and uninviting as the analog variant. She has seen this play before, after all. “Right now people are just experimenting with AI technology and having a ball seeing what they can get away with,” she says. “Once we get beyond that, then we’re going to see less of it. They’ll move on to something else. Or they’ll be up for a job, and it’ll be embarrassing. Just look at the history.”",

    "fullText": "In 2026, it’s a scary time to work for a living.\n\nGone are the days of quiet quitting, the Great Resignation, and the highly visible union-organizing battles that began the decade and signaled that perhaps worker power was on the rise again in the US. Instead, much of that momentum is being crowded out of our minds by anxieties: a worsening affordability crisis, geopolitical instability, and the specter of artificial intelligence looming over the workplace.\n\nFor the tech CEOs leading the AI race and enriching themselves as they jostle for dominance, AI isn’t a phantasm at all, but a glimmering unicorn. When they predict AI is just months away from being able to do everything a software engineer does, or that it will one day take over CEOs’ jobs, their excitement for the future is palpable. For the rest of us, it’s hard to feel confident in their offhand remarks about how “some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs will be created”. A 2025 Pew survey found that “64% of the public thinks AI will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”, which is probably why only 17% of Americans say AI will have a positive effect on the US over the same time period.\n\nUncertain times like these call for scrutiny. Throughout 2026, the Guardian will publish Reworked, a reporting series that centers the human stakes as AI disrupts our workplaces, in ways both thrilling and alarming. Like this essay, the stories in this series will focus on workers’ real-world power and plights as well as the realities and exaggerations of the hype surrounding AI’s transformative possibilities.\n\nSo which version of the future of work awaits us? It is yet to be settled, which means there is still time to shift course.\n\nBlue-collar workers who have long grappled with algorithmic surveillance and optimization at work are now worrying that technological advancements will only make their jobs more dehumanizing. “[For] lower wage workers, there is concern about being replaced by robots. But on the other hand, there’s a lot of concern about being turned into robots,” Lisa Kresge, a senior researcher at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, told me.\n\nAnd white-collar workers are now wondering if their work will begin to resemble blue-collar labor – either because they will be similarly tracked and managed, or because they will need to switch to more manual work that’s resistant to being taken over by AI.\n\nIt may seem that workers haven’t been this vulnerable in a long time. In some ways, that’s true. But this is also a pivotal moment, one in which something unexpected is happening: society’s collective anxiety over AI is catalyzing workers to push back.\n\n“It is creating an opportunity,” Sarita Gupta, the Ford Foundation’s Vice President of US Programs and co-author of The Future We Need: Organizing for a Better Democracy in the Twenty-First Century, told me. “When you have a young Silicon Valley software engineer realize that their performance is tracked or undermined by the same logic as a working class warehouse picker, class divisions dissolve, and larger working-class movements for dignity are possible. That is what we’re starting to see.”\n\nPeople across industries and income brackets are anxious and frustrated, quite like they were when the Covid pandemic placed punishing demands on frontline workers and erased the boundaries between work and life for everyone else. Those struggles prompted power shifts: At the same time that workers led unionization efforts at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks locations around the US, the Great Resignation saw a record number of employees quit their jobs, and the ones who remained in the workforce began negotiating for and gaining better pay and conditions.\n\n“It was not a pretty time for a lot of workers. And so part of the resurgence of labor organizing from that period of time was in response to a lot of fears,” Kresge said.\n\nShe also sees the rise of AI as an opening for the labor movement to regain some of the power it’s lost after decades of attacks from employers. “I’m hopeful about the opportunity for technology to lift up some of the issues that have been under way in our economy for decades … in terms of how workers are treated and how we are distributing the rewards of productivity.”\n\nConditions for workers have been rough for a long while now. “Over time, unions have lost collective bargaining power, and a lot of that is due to the lack of laws that we need and enforcement of laws,” Gupta said. “For four decades, productivity soared while wages stayed flat, and unionization hit historic lows.” In 2025, only 9.9% of US workers were union members – the same percentage as 2024, but still the lowest numbers in almost 40 years.\n\nToday, the advent of AI is drawing the world’s attention to the extreme imbalance of power between employers and their employees – and people are getting worked up. Even if the outcomes are still undetermined, that’s a glimmer of possibility in bleak times.\n\nAI is still a nascent technology. Many of the predictions about what it will be capable of and how it will transform labor and the economy are just that – predictions. The question of worker power in the age of AI hasn’t been decided yet, even if billionaire CEOs with a vested interest in the unregulated dominance of AI keep implying that it has.\n\n“There is a concerted effort among many tech leaders to basically create mystification around AI as a tactic, to a large extent, to disempower workers, policymakers, and anyone who might be critical of the growing concentration of funding and resources in our society toward this goal,” Kresge told me.\n\nIn other words, take what these billionaires say with a grain of salt. The rise of AI is already transforming society, the economy, and our relationship to work, but a lot of these shifts are anticipatory, based on our belief in the potential of a technology that’s still being built.\n\n“We have to always remind ourselves that the direction of technology is a choice, right? We can use AI to build a surveillance economy that squeezes every drop of value out of a worker, or we can use it to build an era of shared prosperity,” Gupta said. “We know if technology were designed and deployed and governed by the people doing the work, AI wouldn’t be such a threat.”",

    "description": "IN FOCUS: EXCLUSIVE: South Carolina parents living in the state’s measles epicenter tell Rhian Lubin of their devastation after their unvaccinated 7-year-old son, Ethan, developed encephalitis, a comp...",
    "fullText": "Six weeks ago, Ethan Moran Lopez was like most 7-year-olds — spending the weekend riding his new bike or playing Minecraft on his iPad on a rainy day.\n\n“He just learned how to ride, he got the hang of it right away,” Ethan’s dad, Luis Moran Lopez, said proudly. “He wanted to go outside because he wanted to jump on his bike…it was an amazing thing for him.”\n\nInstead, since late January, the schoolboy has been confined to a hospital bed with measles encephalitis, a complication that causes swelling and inflammation in the brain. “He's pretty much as if he was paralyzed,” his devastated father, 41, told The Independent in a phone interview from his son’s hospital bedside.\n\nEthan’s parents decided not to immunize him against measles as they did with his three brothers. Three out of four of them contracted measles. Still, despite Ethan’s ordeal, his mom stands by their decision. “We’re not blaming God for this,” said 35-year-old Kristina Moran Lopez. “Yes, it hurts, of course, it hurts. But God has chosen Ethan for a reason. God is doing something, and we're gonna glorify his name regardless.\n\n“And we wouldn't change it any other way,” the mom continued. “If I knew this could be the outcome, I still wouldn't have given my son the vaccine.”\n\n“Our biggest reason why we didn't do it is just with all the unnecessary stuff they add into it,” Kristina added, referring to her beliefs about the vaccine.\n\n“With my own eyes, I have seen the damage it does to kids who are perfectly normal, and then once they get it, they're not the same anymore,” she claimed.\n\nHer stance on the vaccine is not unique these days, even though it is so effective that by the year 2000, measles had been declared all but extinct in the U.S. by both the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. And doctors praise it as highly effective at preventing serious complications like encephalitis.\n\nBut, like several other childhood vaccines, it has been caught in a political tug of war that includes a good measure of conspiracy theory and skepticism fueled by unproven claims.\n\nThat anti-vax position is only growing under MAHA Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s anti-vaccine policies, which medical experts say have undermined public trust in immunizations by promoting unproven theories about the dangers of vaccines.\n\nNow, once-dormant measles is surging across the U.S. as vaccination rates continue to drop.\n\nThe Moran Lopez family live in South Carolina’s Spartanburg County, the epicenter of the outbreak where cases of the highly contagious virus have exploded in recent months. There have been 962 confirmed cases in the state since the outbreak began in September 2025, surpassing the 762 cases reported in West Texas last year.\n\nKristina explained her anti-vaccine reasoning as based on what she claims to have seen in the children of friends who have had the measles shot, or from what she’s read about other cases.\n\n“They think it’s so safe,” she said of the vaccine. The mother of four also questioned the number of vaccinations children are recommended to take nowadays compared to when she was growing up — echoing a sentiment that has been publicly shared by both Kennedy and President Donald Trump.\n\n“Why do we need to add so much to our children’s bodies?” she asked.\n\nIn October 2025, under Kennedy, the Department of Health and Human Services reduced the number of routine vaccines recommended for use by all children in the U.S. from 13 to 7, though the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was not one of them.\n\nThe parents said that they hope sharing their son’s story might help other families going through a similar ordeal.\n\nAbout 1 child out of every 1,000 who get measles, which has no cure, will go on to develop encephalitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition can result in permanent brain damage and is fatal in 10 to 15 percent of those cases.\n\nWhen Ethan contracted the measles around January 20, his parents hoped he would shake it off and “bounce back” like his brothers, aged 2 and 4, did when they came down with it a week or so prior. Ethan was not so lucky.\n\nLuis, an electrician, has been unable to work while he and Kristina, a stay-at-home mom, watch over Ethan in the hospital. The wider family has rallied around them; their three other boys Elijah, 9, Edward, 4, and Ezekiel, 2, are being looked after by an uncle, while another relative has launched a GoFundMe page to support the couple with bills.\n\nEthan came down with a severe rash and a fever on January 21. In the days that followed, his appetite diminished and he grew weak to the point where he could no longer stand up by himself. He began to fade in and out of consciousness.\n\n“Something's wrong,” Kristina recalled thinking as she looked at her son on the couch that week. “He was just sleeping. And anytime I would ask him a question, he'd just look at me and fall back asleep.”\n\nEthan’s parents took him to the emergency room at Spartanburg Medical Center, where he was admitted overnight and put on antibiotics. Doctors at the hospital told the parents their son could be suffering from measles encephalitis, but they couldn’t be sure until they ran further tests the next day.\n\nHowever, an MRI and spinal tap— a procedure that can diagnose conditions that affect the brain— did not give any indication of swelling or inflammation, the parents said. “He got the MRI in the morning, and it came back clean,” said Kristina.\n\nIn the hospital, Ethan grew more and more distressed. “He just wanted to get out. He wasn't eating the hospital food. He was just screaming,” she recalled. “Seeing him like that was like…This is not my son, like he needs to go home.”\n\nYou don't get measles encephalitis unless you have measles, and we have a very good vaccine for measles. As somebody who treats the worst of these encephalitis cases, it's hard to swallow that we have a vaccine-preventable infection and we're seeing encephalitis from that.\n\nDr Kiran Thakur, Herbert Irving associate professor of neurology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital\n\nDoctors suggested Ethan’s parents could take him to Greenville Memorial Hospital, a larger facility with more specialists. Because their son was in so much distress, his parents decided to take him home and keep a close eye on him.\n\n“If all they're doing is antibiotics, maybe he'll be more comfortable at home, and we don't have to put him through this,” his mom said, explaining her thought process, and encouraged by the fact that Ethan appeared to have regained some strength; he could drink water by himself and walk a short distance to the bathroom.\n\nLess than 48 hours later, though, on Jan. 30, Ethan’s condition deteriorated to the point where he had “no movement at all,” his mom said.\n\n“It felt like his body was slowly losing all mobility,” she recalled.\n\nKristina rushed Ethan to see the local doctor, who took one look at him and told the mom to get him to Greenville Memorial Hospital, about a 36-mile drive, right away.\n\n“They immediately started giving him fluids, taking blood again, doing all the tests again,” Kristina said, panicking as she watched her son being hooked up to machines.\n\nThen Ethan’s heart rate started dropping.\n\n“The machine started beeping,” she recalled. “And we were really concerned … doctors kept coming in and so then we asked, ‘What number do we need to be concerned?’ And [the doctor] said, ‘Anything that goes under 50.’\n\n“And all of a sudden, his heart rate went under 50,” Kristina said.\n\nEncephalitis causes the brain to become inflamed, most commonly due to infection or the immune system attacking the brain. For many people affected, it can feel as though their brain is literally on fire.\n\nThe F.L.A.M.E.S acronym, developed by Encephalitis International, provides a clear prompt for the most serious and common symptoms that should never be ignored.\n\nE – Emotional or behavioral changes\n\nThe mom recalled that a nurse then shouted, “Ethan, you gotta wake up, you gotta wake up,” and started “pounding” on her son’s chest, before calling for more medics to help.\n\n“It was just one of those moments you just think…no, no,” the mom said, through tears. “This can't be.”\n\nTo the parents’ relief, doctors were able to stabilize Ethan’s heart rate and he was admitted to the intensive care unit, where his mom and dad sat by his bedside all night anxiously watching the heart rate monitor. The next morning, Ethan underwent another MRI and second spinal tap.\n\n“That's when they told us that there's inflammation in the center of his brain, and they were waiting for the spinal tap to confirm that it is measles encephalitis,” Kristina said.\n\nDoctors explained to the couple that the swelling on the brain would impact Ethan’s movement and speech.\n\n“It’s why he’s…he’s pretty much as if he was paralyzed,” Luis said.\n\n“He can't move his body, but his brain, his mind… My son is 100 percent there,” Kristina added. “He understands everything. He hasn't lost any of his memory or anything.”\n\nIn the first few days in the hospital, the parents were communicating with Ethan by asking him questions and telling him to squeeze their fingers, or blink, but they could sense their son was growing frustrated. “You feel helpless,” said Luis. “Now we're in this kind of battle of trying to understand each other, to make him feel comfortable.”\n\nDoctors were initially bleak about Ethan’s prognosis, his parents said, but there is some hope on the horizon.\n\nWhile it can’t reverse the damage, Kristina and Luis are hopeful that plasma exchange treatment could help their son’s condition by subduing the inflammation in the brain.\n\nAnd Ethan’s neurologist told his parents at the weekend that while some inflammation in the brain remains, some areas have shown signs of improvement, Luis said. “He is no longer on any meds and is communicating a lot better, and moves his arms,” the dad said.\n\n“Walking will be a process,” he added, and said Ethan should soon be able to begin physical therapy.\n\n“He’s on the road to recovery,” said Luis.\n\nAs of February 17, 913 of South Carolina’s 962 cases are in Spartanburg County near the North Carolina border, according to the latest figures from the state’s Department of Public Health. The department confirmed to The Independent that there have been two cases of measles encephalitis since South Carolina’s outbreak.\n\nMeasles is so highly contagious because it spreads through very fine droplets and can stay in the air for up to two hours. Out of 962 measles cases in the Palmetto state, 893 occurred among unvaccinated people. Broken down by age group, 868 cases hit minors, under age 18, according to the data.\n\nDr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said the MMR shot is one of the safest and most well-studied for safety concerns of any modern vaccine.\n\n“The MMR vaccine itself contains a weakened measles virus that stimulates the immune response but does not cause disease, as well as stabilizers like sugar, amino acids and gelatin, and small amounts of protein and antibiotic,” Bell told The Independent.\n\n“It does not contain mRNA, aluminum, preservatives like thimerosal, or fetal tissue. The ingredients contained in the MMR vaccine are only there to promote a robust immune response and provide lifelong immunity from the potentially devastating effects of measles infection,” Bell continued.\n\n“Measles encephalitis is a well understood, well documented outcome of measles infection which can be fatal or lead to lifelong complications from brain injury; complications which may require lifelong care and treatment,” Bell said. “By contrast, the MMR vaccine does not cause this same outcome.”\n\nDr. Andrew Bernstein, a pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, warned that as vaccine rates decline and measles cases increase, “we are going to start, unfortunately, seeing cases like this child with encephalitis, or unfortunately, people who can die from measles.”\n\nAnd Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, Stanford Professor of pediatrics-infectious disease and epidemiology and population, warned that South Carolina is “the canary in the coal mine.”\n\n“Once you start introducing unvaccinated people into a population, they can not only get infected themselves, but they can serve as very efficient and very deadly carriers of this disease, which then can spread, not only in your community, but into adjacent communities,” Maldonado warned. “Viruses aren’t restricted by borders.”\n\nThe leading epidemiologist also outlined how unvaccinated people pose a risk to those who cannot receive the MMR vaccine if they are immunocompromised.\n\n“In the United States, there are at least 11 million people, and probably more now, who have immuno-compromising conditions of certain sorts,” Maldonado said. “If they're exposed to other people, not only can they get sick, but they can actually die from measles.”\n\nWhen it comes to encephalitis, outcomes of patients vary depending on the severity of the inflammation, according to medical experts.\n\nEarly supportive care and rehabilitation “can lead to better outcomes,” said Dr. Kiran Thakur, Herbert Irving associate professor professor of neurology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\n\n“Oftentimes,” Thakur added, “we will see things like developmental issues, seizure disorders, and learning difficulties in children in the aftermath of encephalitis.”\n\nEthan’s mom believes that “there will be a miracle.”\n\n“That’s what’s keeping us strong, and being able to be here with him,” she said from Ethan’s bedside. “We know it's in God's hands.”\n\nWhen asked to describe their son and the things he loves to do most, the parents paused.\n\n“He loves playing with his brothers. He has an iPad, and he loves to play on Minecraft,” Luis replied. “He is creative to the max; he will build whatever you ask him to. And we're amazed with the things he's created...”\n\n“And so we've always told him that he's going to be an engineer when he grows up.”",

    "description": "Germany is considering ordering more U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets, two sources told Reuters, a move that would deepen Berlin's",
    "fullText": "BERLIN/WASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Germany is considering ordering more U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets, two sources told Reuters, a move that would deepen Berlin's reliance on American military ‌technology as its joint next-generation fighter programme with France falters.\n\nOne source said Berlin was in talks that ‌could lead to the purchase of more than 35 additional jets. A second source did not specify the number. Both sources cautioned that ​the outcome was still uncertain.\n\nAsked for comment, a German government spokesperson denied any current plans to purchase additional F-35 fighter jets.\n\n\"There are no plans, and there is no decision,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nA spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said in a statement there were currently \"no concrete plans or political decisions\" for the procurement of more F-35s.\n\nIn 2022, Germany purchased ‌35 of the aircraft, which are due ⁠to begin delivery later this year.\n\nFRANCO-GERMAN FIGHTER JET COLLABORATION ON THE ROCKS\n\nThe potential acquisition of more Lockheed Martin stealth fighters, at a cost of more than $80 million each, comes ⁠as Germany and France are deadlocked on their Future Combat Air System (FCAS) programme.\n\nThe 100-billion-euro ($118-billion) project, launched in 2017 to replace France's Rafales and Eurofighters from 2040, has been stalled by industrial rivalries.\n\nInsiders expect Germany and France to abandon the development of a ​joint ​fighter jet but continue cooperation on drones and the so-called ​combat cloud, the digital backbone linking manned and ‌unmanned platforms within the FCAS system.\n\nPurchasing more F-35 jets would buy Germany time to figure out a solution for the development of a sixth-generation fighter jet and find a partner for such a project.\n\nA spokesperson for defence contractor Lockheed Martin said the company was focused on building F-35s already ordered by Germany. A Pentagon spokesperson referred questions to Germany.\n\nExpansion of Germany's F-35 fleet would mark a significant strategic shift toward deeper military integration with the United States ‌and away from European defence autonomy, a priority for fellow ​European Union member France.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz questioned on Wednesday whether developing ​a manned sixth-generation jet, as FCAS has sought ​to do, still made sense for his country's air force.\n\n\"Will we still need a manned ‌fighter jet in 20 years' time? Do we ​still need it, given that ​we will have to develop it at great expense?\" Merz said on the Machtwechsel podcast.\n\nThe F-35 aircraft will succeed the Tornado jets in their role of carrying U.S. nuclear bombs stored in Germany in the ​event of a conflict.\n\nGerman Defence Minister ‌Boris Pistorius said last week the fate of FCAS would become clear within days.\n\n(Reporting ​by Mike Stone in Washington and Sabine Siebold in Berlin, additional reporting by Andreas Rinke in ​Berlin; Editing by Chris Sanders, Cynthia Osterman and Joe Bavier)",

    "fullText": "The parents of a West Virginia boy who was sent to school with cockroaches in his backpack and bug bites covering his body have been arrested on child neglect charges, according to authorities and news reports.\n\nDwayne and Dorothy Hickman’s son and daughter have since been removed from their Doddridge County home, where authorities found “deplorable living conditions,” according to the Doddridge County Sheriff’s Office, WDTV reported, citing court documents.\n\nThe investigation into the couple started on February 10, when a staff member at a local preschool, the Doddridge County Early Learning Academy, shared their concerns about two siblings attending the school, according to a criminal complaint obtained by WBOY.\n\nThe school employee reported that one child had cockroaches inside his backpack and that they noticed bug bites on his “face, hands and bottom,” the criminal complaint says, the TV station reported.\n\nThe boy’s sister told teachers her clothes were “very dirty” and asked them to wash her clothing, according to court filings, WDTV reported.\n\nFlorida Parents Arrested After Roaches Were Seen ‘Crawling Over’ Baby in Moldy Infested Home\n\nFollowing the report, deputies alerted Child Protective Services and accused Dwayne, 37, and Dorothy, 29, of child neglect, according to authorities, WBOY reported.\n\nChild Protective Services visited the Hickmans’ home as a result and took custody of their children, according to WBOY. The children’s ages were not specified by law enforcement.\n\nThe Hickmans are both charged with two counts of gross neglect of a child creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, court records viewed by Us Weekly on Wednesday, February 18, show.\n\nThey both pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday, February 13, according to court records.\n\nDefense attorneys separately representing Dwayne and Dorothy did not immediately return requests for comment from Us.\n\nDwayne and Dorothy’s bonds were initially set at $20,000, court records show.

    "description": "Piers Morgan is certain that UK Prime Minister Starmer is a \"political dead man walking\" thanks to Epstein revelations.",
    "fullText": "Following former Prince Andrew’s arrest in connection to the Epstein files on Thursday, and the resignation of several political players for the same reason, Piers Morgan says U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is “a political dead man walking.”\n\nAppearing on Fox News on Thursday morning, Morgan called the arrest of the former royal “an absolute bombshell,” but one that was “not completely surprising” given the tone of the statement by King Charles III last week in which he said police would have the crown’s full cooperation. Morgan then speculated that the arrest could be “an existential threat to the monarchy itself.”\n\nSo, the “Fox & Friends” hosts wondered what it means for the rest of the government, considering people like Ambassador Peter Mandelson and the Chief of Staff who recommended him are now out of their jobs over Epstein ties. Specifically, they wondered if Prime Minister Starmer will stay in office, or if he’s run out of good will.\n\nWatch the Fox News segment below:\n\n“Yeah, I think he’s a political dead man walking,” Morgan said. “And it’s all centered around what happened with Lord Mandelson.”\n\nMorgan explained the timeline of when Starmer appointed Mandelson, noting that Starmer admitted he knew about Mandelson’s ties to Epstein when he appointed the man, despite Mandelson saying he cut off Epstein after he was convicted of sex crimes.\n\n“So, I think Starmer is in serious trouble,” Morgan said. “I would be astonished if he is still Prime Minister in two to three months. We have the local elections in May. It’s very likely that Labor will get an absolute shellacking then. And I think that will be the tipping point for Starmer.”\n\nYou can watch Piers Morgan’s full appearance on “Fox & Friends” in the video above.\n\nThe post Piers Morgan Says UK Prime Minister Is ‘Dead Man Walking’ After Former Prince Andrew Arrest Over Epstein | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine's popular ex-military chief has provided new details of a rift with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, threatening to deepen a long-simmering conflict between the ‌two wartime leaders amid new speculation around post-war elections.\n\nGeneral Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, who served as ‌Kyiv's top commander until February 2024 and is now its ambassador to London, told the Associated Press in an ​interview published on Wednesday that he felt threatened by a 2022 raid by security agents and blamed Zelenskiy for a major battlefield failure.\n\nThe remarks provide fresh context to a potential rivalry that has long gripped Kyiv's political class.\n\nOpinion polls have consistently shown Zaluzhnyi to be Zelenskiy's main challenger in any ‌future election, although he has ⁠never voiced any ambition to run for office.\n\nZelenskiy, facing U.S. pressure to quickly secure a peace deal in Russia's four-year war, has signalled his readiness ⁠to hold elections when fighting ends.\n\nHis office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Zaluzhnyi's remarks on the 2022 raid. In his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelenskiy did not directly ​comment on ​the AP interview but spoke of the importance ​of national unity and working together to ‌ensure Ukraine’s survival.\n\n\"Any other politics in Ukraine is absolutely unnecessary at present… Personal matters (are for) later,\" he said.\n\nSECURITY RAID, MILITARY MISMANAGEMENT\n\nSpeaking in London, Zaluzhnyi described how his office was raided in September 2022 by dozens of agents from Ukraine's SBU security service, which answers to Zelenskiy.\n\nZaluzhnyi said he then called Zelenskiy's chief of staff with a warning that he would deploy troops to ‌protect his command centre, having already called in reinforcements ​to Kyiv.\n\nThe SBU's press service told Reuters an address used ​by Zaluzhnyi as a covert post ​had been listed in an unrelated organised crime case, and that no ‌searches were carried out.\n\nZaluzhnyi also pinned the failure ​of a much-vaunted 2023 ​counteroffensive on Zelenskiy, saying he did not commit the necessary resources to the campaign.\n\nAimed at breaking Russian defences, it ended mostly in an embarrassing string of defeats for Kyiv. ​Zaluzhnyi said his original plan ‌to focus on a single axis had been overridden by Zelenskiy's order to push ​across much of the front line.",

Everyone understands this is playing with fire.\"\n\nBoosting tensions, he said, could undo the ​positive steps ​of recent years, including improved relations between ​Iran and nearby countries, notably Saudi ‌Arabia.\n\nA senior U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday that Iran was expected to submit a written proposal on how to resolve its standoff with the United States after the talks in Geneva.\n\nU.S. national security advisers met in the White House on Wednesday and were told all U.S. military forces deployed to the region should be in place ‌by mid-March, the official said.\n\nThe United States wants ​Iran to give up its nuclear programme, and ​Iran has adamantly refused and denied ​it is trying to develop an atomic weapon.\n\nLavrov said Arab countries ‌were sending signals to Washington \"clearly calling ​for restraint and a ​search for an agreement that will not infringe on Iran's lawful rights and ... guarantee that Iran has a purely peaceful nuclear enrichment programme\".\n\nRussia, he said, remained ​in close, regular contact with ‌Iran's leaders \"and we have no reason to doubt that Iran sincerely wants ​to resolve this problem on the basis of observing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation ​Treaty\".",

    "fullText": "Police arrived in response to a fire alarm at the University of Iowa in November 2024 and found a bunch of blindfolded fraternity pledges packed into a basement at the Alpha Delta Phi house, according to authorities and online video that’s resurfaced.\n\nThe video that’s been buzzing on social media lately shows cops arriving in a cluttered and dark basement and bumping into 56 pledges, most of them shirtless and blindfolded. The cops are heard asking what they’ve gotten themselves into and who’s in charge.\n\nAccording to the authorities and the video that’s resurfaced online, the incident occurred when the cops arrived in response to a fire alarm at the frat house in Iowa City. While responding to the fire alarm, the cops found the pledges gathered in the basement.\n\nIn the video, the cops repeatedly tell people to leave the room as they try to find out who was in charge, but no one cooperates or gives them answers about what was going on. At one point in the video, the cops ask the participants what they were there for as they stood quietly, hands at their sides.\n\nPolice raided the University of Iowa’s Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house, and bodycam footage shows pledges in the basement during hazing rituals.\n pic.twitter.com/NIW5YMrACu\n\n— FearBuck (@FearedBuck) February 18, 2026\n\nAccording to the cops, a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of interfering with official acts after stepping between the cops and the witnesses while they were investigating the incident. The charges were dropped later on.\n\nAccording to the cops, the president of the fraternity told them that the gathering was part of a ritual before initiation where the pledges were blindfolded and “messed with.”\n\nThe University of Iowa initiated an investigation into the incident. The University of Iowa suspended the fraternity on Feb. 25, 2025. According to the University of Iowa, the fraternity is suspended from the university until at least July 1, 2029.\n\nThe University of Iowa hasn’t shared any further details from its investigation, but confirmed that the suspension is in place.\n\nThe post Bodycam Footage Reveals 56 Blindfolded Pledges Packed Into Fraternity Basement During Alleged Hazing Ritual appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.",

    "fullText": "The Illinois House committee meeting that was scheduled for Thursday to discuss funding a new stadium for the Chicago Bears has been canceled. That development makes a potential Bears move to Indiana feel like a very real proposition.\n\nThe notion of the #Bears moving to Indiana grows. Illinois House committee meeting that was scheduled for today to discuss funding for a stadium has been canceled. Indiana hitting the gas while Illinois is stalled. https://t.co/T3WYucdiYT\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) February 19, 2026\n\nAn amended version of Indiana Senate Bill 27, which allows the Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority to issue bonds to finance, build and lease a stadium, was passed unanimously (24-0) by the Indiana House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday. The state of Illinois was ready to move forward following a three-hour meeting Wednesday, but it was reportedly paused by Bears leadership so it could make tweaks to the bill.\n\nIllinois legislators were surprised to see the team's statement this morning in favor of Indiana.\n\n\"We are committed to finishing the remaining site-specific necessary due diligence to support our vision to build a world-class stadium near the Wolf Lake area in Hammond, Indiana. We appreciate the leadership shown by Governor Braun, Speaker Huston, Senator Mishler and members of the Indiana General Assembly in establishing this critical framework and path forward to deliver a premier venue for all of Chicagoland and a destination for Bears fans and visitors from across the globe,\" the team said. \"We value our partnership and look forward to continuing to build our working relationship together.\"\n\nIndiana lawmakers had previously expressed how they needed the Bears to show serious interest in moving to Northwest Indiana. Indiana Gov. Mike Braun has been outspoken in favor of his state's pursuit of the Bears.\n\n\"Indiana is open for business, and our pro-growth environment continues to attract major opportunities like this partnership with the Chicago Bears,\" Braun said in a statement. \"We’ve identified a promising site near Wolf Lake in Hammond and established a broad framework for negotiating a final deal. If approved, the proposed amendment to Senate Bill 27 puts forward the essential framework to complete this agreement, contingent upon site due diligence proceeding smoothly.\"\n\nHammond is just the latest proposed location for the new home of the Bears, in addition to Gary and Portage in Indiana, and Des Moines, Iowa. The Bears have explored a new lakefront site near Soldier Field, as well as a mixed-use development on land they purchased in suburban Arlington Heights. Both of those options would require more than $1 billion in taxpayer support.\n\nThe Bears have floated both a lakefront site near Soldier Field and a development in the suburb of Arlington Heights, both of which would require more than a billion dollars in taxpayer support.\n\nIndiana lawmakers feel like this is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” for the state.\n\n“Hammond is uniquely positioned for this moment. We're part of the Chicagoland region. We're only 20 minutes from Soldier Field,\" Sen. Ryan Mishler said Thursday. “We're ready to help write Indiana’s next great chapter.”",

    "description": "Lauren Rose Kocher never worked full-time in the US, so her understanding of corporate culture was formed almost entirely in Japan.",
    "fullText": "Lauren Rose Kocher, now 39, grew up in Indiana and became fascinated with Japan as a kid.\n\nShe studied Japanese in college and has built her career — and started a family — in Japan.\n\nAs CEO of a Tokyo-based marketing agency, she's learned not to assume silence means satisfaction.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lauren Rose Kocher, 39, an American entrepreneur and CEO of Vegas PR Group in Tokyo. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in a small town in Indiana, but my interest in Japan started early. I still remember watching a \"Sesame Street\" episode where Big Bird visits Japan. That image stuck with me.\n\nIn college, that curiosity took shape: I studied Japanese at the University of Chicago and spent a summer in Hokkaido. After graduating, I moved to Japan in 2008 to teach English, though a career in teaching was never my goal.\n\nI wanted to work for a Japanese company and use the language skills I'd built in school. I'd never worked full-time in the US, so my understanding of corporate culture has been formed almost entirely in Japan.\n\nAfter teaching, I transitioned into corporate roles in Japanese companies. I spent three years as an assistant and international concert promoter before joining Sony Music's business development division for four years. I later became the cofounder and COO of a VC-funded ticketing platform.\n\nAfter nearly a decade inside corporate Japan, I stepped into senior leadership.\n\nNow, I'm the CEO and sole founder of Vegas PR Group, a Tokyo-based marketing agency focused on culture, the arts, music, and fashion. Our bilingual team of nine works across Japanese and international clients.\n\nSince 2024, I've also overseen two businesses founded by my late husband, a sandwich restaurant and a clothing brand.\n\nI plan to stay in Japan long-term. My two children are half-Japanese, and I value raising them here.\n\nJapanese business culture relies heavily on consensus-building, often through \"nemawashi,\" the process of privately aligning stakeholders before any formal decision is announced.\n\nFeedback is similarly indirect. Japanese teams are often hesitant to raise concerns openly, which means issues can remain unspoken until they surface all at once. Decision-making is cautious and risk-averse, and change tends to be incremental rather than dramatic.\n\nI've learned to factor this into timelines, particularly when working with Japanese clients who require internal alignment before moving forward. The people I hire tend to defy that stereotype and slot easily into our open, international culture.\n\nI wouldn't say my management style is particularly American, but my American communication style and entrepreneurial instinct certainly are. I try to respect local expectations, though I know my tendency to move quickly and take decisive swings has occasionally come across as abrasive in a culture where decisions are slow, and relationships are built with great caution.\n\nBecause all of my work is rooted in the Japanese market, I encourage international staff to follow Japanese work customs when dealing with local clients, while leaving room for each person to navigate what they're personally comfortable with.\n\nPunctuality is one example. In many countries, joining a Zoom call a minute or two late is inconsequential. In Japan, it's not. Logging in at 9:01 a.m. for a 9 a.m. meeting is considered late, and I enforce that expectation.\n\nThe same applies to in-person meetings, where arriving at least 10 minutes early is standard. When doing business in Japan, being on time is non-negotiable.\n\nMy leadership philosophy is rooted in servant leadership. I'm heavily invested in the success of the people I work with, and that approach has helped me build trust across Japanese and international teams.\n\nAs a white American woman in Japan, I'm perceived first as foreign. I'm also conscious of the privilege I carry. For anyone moving to Japan to lead a team, my advice is to be slow and deliberate.\n\nDeliver important news one-on-one before making major announcements. Don't expect clear or immediate feedback, and don't assume silence means satisfaction. It's also critical to respect people's attachment to their roles, hierarchies, and existing relationships, which hold significant weight in Japanese workplaces.\n\nI learned all of these lessons firsthand.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working abroad?

    "fullText": "A Darien man is suing a New York auto repair shop, contending the business owner has refused to release his Jeep Wrangler after he paid more than $12,000 to revamp the vehicle.\n\nPaul DeRose says in the complaint against Mad Dog Service Inc. of Port Chester and owner Jon Lovallo that the garage ghosted him when he sought updates on the work, and then demanded more money when he arrived with a tow truck to remove it, according to the suit filed in Westchester County court.\n\nThe suit accuses Mad Dog and Lovallo of fraud and breach of contract, among other claims.\n\nLovallo could not be reached for comment Wednesday.\n\nThe alleged illegal conduct, according to the complaint, \"is not an isolated incident, but part of a long-standing pattern.\" The suit lists four other similar complaints against Mad Dog, all of which resulted in default judgments.\n\nDeRose left his 2013 Wrangler at the garage in January 2025 for installation of suspension components, wheels, tires, lighting and related accessories. He paid the garage $12,730.12 in advance for the work, the complaint says.\n\nOver the next several months, Lovallo refused to respond to DeRose's requests for updates, the suit says. On Sept. 20, DeRose came to the garage and called a tow truck to retrieve the Wrangler, the complaint says. The shop refused to release it, however, claiming DeRose owed an additional $7,000 that had to be paid first, according to the lawsuit. DeRose called Port Chester police, but the garage did not release the vehicle and still has it, the lawsuit says.\n\nLovallo's continued possession of the vehicle \"is wrongful, unlawful, and without justification,\" the suit says. Also, the defendants failed to get written authorization for the additional work they claimed to have done, the complaint says.\n\nThe lawsuit demands immediate return of the Wrangler, compensation for not being able to use the vehicle and restitution for \"unjust enrichment.\" DeRose is entitled to punitive damages \"sufficient to punish defendants and deter similar conduct in the future,\" the complaint says.\n\nThis article originally published at CT man paid $13,000 to customize Jeep Wrangler - but auto shop refuses to give him back SUV: Lawsuit.",

    "fullText": "Canadian travellers are still unhappy with President Donald Trump, and that's affecting the 2026 outlook of visitors to the US from Canada.\n\nIn 2025, there was a noticeable travel chill from the US's northern neighbor, following President Donald Trump's quips about the \"51st state\" and the levying of hefty tariffs.\n\nA January survey of more than 1,000 Canadian prospective travelers found that they remain hesitant to travel to the US and would rather support domestic tourism, according to Longwoods International, a tourism industry market research company.\n\nAccording to Longwoods International, 55% of surveyed Canadian travelers report that they intend to travel to the US within the next 12 months, which remains mostly unchanged from 54% reported in October 2025. Among those who intend to make the trip, only 9% say they have already made bookings.\n\nIn 2025, 4 million fewer Canadian travelers visited the US than the previous year, marking a 22% drop, according to the US Commerce Department's National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nSeventy-three percent of Canadian respondents to the latest survey, who said they changed their 2026 travel plans to avoid the US, cited economic policies and tariffs.\n\nOther factors are also at work. More than 40% of respondents told Longwoods International that they strongly or somewhat disagree that the US is a place that values international travelers, welcomes travelers with diverse backgrounds, is a safe place to visit, and feels welcoming in general, and the number of Canadians who agree that the US feels safe to visit has been declining over the past year.\n\nPopular destinations for Canadian snowbirds, such as southern California and Florida, have been trying to woo them back. But it appears that those attempts have fallen flat as Trump continues to threaten Canada with tariffs and recently threatened to delay the opening of a bridge Canada paid for.\n\nIn 2025, California's Gov. Gavin Newsom began trying to convince Canadians with targeted video campaigns that California welcomes them. Recently, heart-shaped banners featuring the Canadian flag also popped up in Palm Springs, which, according to the Los Angeles Times, is feeling a chill this winter from fewer Canadian tourists.\n\n\"Sure, you-know-who is trying to stir things up back in DC, but don't let that ruin your beach plans,\" Newsom said in a campaign video. \"California is the ultimate playground — over 2,000 miles from Washington and a world away in mindset.\"\n\nAccording to Visit California, the number of Canadian visitors to the state still fell by over 18% in 2025 compared to the year prior, slipping to 1.4 million. In 2024, Visit California showed that 1.7 million Canadians visited the state and spent around $3.7 billion.\n\nEven Disney, the happiest place on earth, is feeling the impact as international travelers skip the US. In the Walt Disney Company's first-quarter earnings report earlier in February, the company said it is facing \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks, including Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California.\n\nVisit Florida lists Canada as the state's top source of international visitors, with around 3.4 million travelers from Canada to the state in 2024. In 2025, the state saw a 15% year-over-year drop, according to Visit Florida, with only 2.9 million visitors from Canada.\n\nCanadian airlines Air Transat and WestJet are also suspending all or some flights from Canada to the US this summer.\n\n\"We saw a notable decline in transborder travel demand throughout 2025,\" Julia Kaiser, media relations advisor for WestJet, told Global News earlier in February. \"As a result, we made timely decisions to modify our network to stay aligned with where Canadians want to go.\"\n\nThe slowdown in trips to the US doesn't mean that Canadians are no longer traveling. Longwoods International said that 45% of Canadian travelers who changed their plans for a US trip now say they would substitute it with a domestic trip, while about a quarter of prospective travelers are looking toward Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n\nAs of February 17, China also opened up visa-free entry for all Canadian citizens, allowing up to 30 days of travel for business, tourism, family visits, or transit.",

    "description": "After my favorite mountain towns started to get too crowded with tourists, I found a new favorite entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.",
    "fullText": "I've been visiting the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee since I was a child.\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park was our go-to destination for family vacations, and I've carried that tradition into adulthood with my husband and two children.\n\nGrowing up, we always stayed in Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge. Sadly, large crowds of tourists, heavy traffic, and seemingly endless car fests have made these areas less than ideal for a relaxing weekend.\n\nSo, I started looking for alternative destinations nearby that could check all our boxes. We first visited Bryson City, North Carolina, on a whim, not knowing much about the town other than that it was close to the national park.\n\nThat was enough reason to visit, and once we did, we fell in love with the slower-paced vibe and the minimal crowds — things we'd been missing on previous mountain vacations.\n\nA hidden gem on the edge of the Smoky Mountains, Bryson City is a little town about 15 minutes from Cherokee. It's also closer to my home in Georgia, which has saved us more than an hour of driving each way.\n\nBryson City is not the place you go for elaborate mini-golf courses, luxury hotels, or quirky attractions.\n\nHowever, it's perfect if you want to appreciate the Great Smoky Mountains National Park for what it is: a haven for all things nature.\n\nCamping and cabin rentals are popular here, along with fishing, tubing, and white-water rafting. Hiking trails and waterfalls are abundant, especially in the Deep Creek area, which is the gateway to the national park.\n\nThe hiking trails haven't ever been too crowded when we've visited, so it feels like a true escape from civilization. We've never had to sit in heavy traffic, and wait times at restaurants have been minimal.\n\nWe're also not constantly competing for space on the sidewalk while exploring, which is a pleasant change from the crowded streets of Gatlinburg.\n\nIn town, there are several great local eateries and shops. Our favorite is The Tuck and Table, which is a beautiful lodge-style restaurant on the river.\n\nShopping at Market on the Square is a must for toys, candy, and gifts. We usually stop for giant cookies at Honey Bear's Cupcakery and sweets from The Chocolate Shoppe.\n\nThe downtown area is also home to the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad, a scenic train experience with beautiful mountain views.\n\nWe can usually finish exploring the town, meal included, in just a few hours. It's small enough so that we can walk almost anywhere.\n\nDespite the limited number of activities, what Bryson City offers is enough for my family. Our trips there are pretty affordable, too.\n\nHiking at Deep Creek only costs a small parking fee, and exploring the city is free. Accommodations here are less expensive than what we've typically seen in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, so our weekend trips as a whole are usually cheaper.\n\nBryson City's energy is noticeably different from Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge. With under 2,000 residents, the town's population is about half the size of Gatlinburg's and a third of Pigeon Forge's.\n\nIt's cozier and calmer, with a non-touristy atmosphere that I love. It lacks the overdone mountain kitsch of the bigger tourist towns in the Smokies, offering a more natural ambience.\n\nAlthough this is my new favorite place, finding it has inspired me to visit other towns in the area as well. I'll always treasure my childhood vacation hot spots, but branching out has given me a new appreciation for my happy place.\n\nBryson City proves that a mountain weekend escape can still feel like a true getaway, especially when I want to spend my time relaxing and reconnecting with nature instead of sitting in traffic on the Parkway.",

    "description": "Ukrainian troops cut fiber-optic drone wires they find — even at the risk of disabling their own — to stop Russian attacks.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian soldiers are out cutting and snapping any fiber-optic drone cables they come across, regardless of which side they belong to. They use scissors, knives, even their bare hands.\n\nTroops say it doesn't matter if a drone is Ukrainian or Russian. If they're not sure, they just assume it's hostile.\n\nThese unjammable drones controlled by long, thin cables have flooded the battlefield as a countermeasure to the electronic warfare that often renders radio-frequency drones inoperable.\n\nAs these drones have become increasingly prolific, the result has been forests and trenches snarled with discarded and active cables.\n\nDimko Zhluktenko, an analyst with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, said that he always carries scissors so that he can \"cut each and every optic fiber that we see.\"\n\nHe said that his unit \"actually stopped considering them friendly or foe. We think that all of them are kind of the enemy drones.\"\n\nIn a YouTube video about the gear he carries, Zhluktenko said scissors became so essential that when his unit started operating in areas littered with fiber-optic cables, every team member was required to carry a pair. He said that he bought retractors for his team so no one would lose them.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier who spoke with Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said troops can often break the thin strands with their hands; that isn't often necessary, though. Soldiers in his unit already carry scissors for medical purposes. Many also have knives.\n\nHe said that there can be so many cables about on the battlefield that \"you don't know if it's a new thread or if it's an old one that's been lying around for a long time.\" So his unit severs any they find as often as possible.\n\nOther similar behaviors have been observed on the battlefield.\n\nThere are sometimes so many drones in the sky that soldiers looking up from the ground can't even begin to tell which is friendly and which is hostile. In such cases, soldiers can be ordered to shoot down any drone they see.\n\nSoldiers in charge of electronic warfare systems sometimes panic and jam everything in the air when they can't tell drones apart, Zhluktenko previously told Business Insider.\n\nZhluktenko told Business Insider that cutting the fiber-optic cables is not something that he had to do often, as his unit was typically working in areas further from the front-line fighting that had fewer of the fiber-optic drones. He described it as something that they \"sometimes\" encountered.\n\nSoldiers in Ukraine's 15th Mobile Border Detachment \"Steel Border\" previously said in a video for Ukraine's state border service that using scissors is a reliable way to disable the Russian drones. Russian soldiers have reportedly done the same.\n\nIf the cable is intact on an active and operational drone, the only other way to stop it is to physically shoot it (troops say a shotgun works best); that requires a mix of skill and luck, though.\n\nFiber-optic drones are a relatively new feature in this war that have not previously been fielded at this scale. That these drones can be disabled with simple tools — scissors, knives, bare hands — underscores a broader pattern in Ukraine: sophisticated systems are often countered with low-tech fixes.\n\nIn many cases, some of the most effective counters to advanced technology have been older or improvised combat tools — from shotguns used against small drones to nets draped over vehicles and positions to blunt aerial attacks. Even the drones themselves are cheap innovations designed to overcome more expensive equipment and wartime demands.",

    "description": "A woman reflects on growing up distant from her sister and how adulthood revealed a deeper, quieter form of sisterhood and support.",
    "fullText": "I recently asked my mom what my younger sister, Hannah, and I were like together when we were little girls. \"You played parallel to each other,\" she told me.\n\nThis didn't come as a surprise, because as a teenager, I remember it exactly this way. Living parallel lives together as sisters.\n\nIt was only ever the two of us, and with our ages so close together — I'm not even two years older — you might think we were inseparable. It just wasn't how it was.\n\nWe were night and day different then. I woke early; she woke late. I was out with groups of friends at every opportunity; she had a couple of close friends she was content to see occasionally. I was meticulously tidy; she was unabashedly quite messy (we shared a room, so this posed problems).\n\nThe list of differences was endless, but one thing we both had in common was that we could wind each other up as no one else could.\n\nWe also both liked the series \"Pride and Prejudice.\" Many afternoons were set aside binging the Bennet sisters' woven-tight relationship. I remember thinking my sister and I weren't like the Bennets at all. They depended on each other in a way Hannah and I didn't.\n\nWhen we went our separate ways in college, I rarely contacted her, and she rarely contacted me. Occasionally, we'd send each other a text, but other than that, we just saw each other briefly on the weekend at home or during the holidays.\n\nOnce we finished college, I moved to the UK to marry a Welsh man, and later settled here to raise my family.\n\nIt was around this time that social media began to take off.\n\nI remember watching videos, reading articles, and flicking through pictures of sisters on Facebook who were what I'd describe as \"bosom friends,\" thinking I wish I had the same with Hannah.\n\nIt was also during these early years in Wales that I felt desperately lonely. I craved deep, abiding female friendship, and thought that if only Hannah and I were closer friends, perhaps I wouldn't feel so lonely.\n\nIf we texted and phoned every day, sharing our deepest, darkest secrets which no one else knew, and lived in each other's pockets, that would fill the friendship void.\n\nI imagined sisters all around the world had this kind of intimate friendship, and we were just missing out. Where had we gone wrong? How did we miss out on what sisters everywhere were experiencing?\n\nDuring this decade, there have been some significant events in my life that have nearly broken me. And one of the few people who was there throughout was Hannah.\n\nHannah checked in via text consistently. She came and visited from the US, eventually moving to London for work three years ago. Now, we see each other four to five times a year. She's taken phone calls where I have just cried.\n\nShe shows up, over and over again.\n\nNot just for me, but for my three boys. Being involved in their lives is of utmost importance to her, and because we don't have much family around, of utmost importance to me too.\n\nAlthough I have friends, I have no friend who is quite like my sister.\n\nWe still aren't what I would consider stay-up-into-the-night-talking-endlessly friends, and are still completely opposite in so many ways, but I've come to realize that my sister really is the closest female friendship I have.\n\nShe knows my history in full. I know hers. We've walked — even if in parallel — with each other since childhood. No one else knows her as I do, and no one knows me as she does. If something were to happen to my husband and me, it is Hannah I would trust more than anyone with my children. We can fall out briefly, but never forever. She'll always be there for me, and I'll always be there for her. We're bound together.\n\nSisterhood isn't a one-size-fits-all. Each of our sister bonds is unique and doesn't have to look like the others. It was only once I accepted and believed this that I could fully appreciate the eternal relationship I have with my sister.\n\nHannah and I still live parallel lives. We certainly aren't the Bennet sisters, or giddy besties who do every single thing together. But neither of us is going anywhere. Sisters forever.",

    "fullText": "Last year, my husband and I decided to celebrate his birthday in Hawaii.\n\nWe fell in love with Maui's natural beauty and endless beaches, and a few short months later, found ourselves returning to the state to spend time in Kona on the Big Island, where the laid-back atmosphere enchanted us.\n\nI spent a decent amount of time before we left for Maui strategically planning what to bring, and then used the lessons from that trip to streamline the packing for our stay in Kona.\n\nHere are four things I'm glad I packed and two I wish I'd left at home.\n\nAs someone who lives in Phoenix, I always have a pair of sunglasses with me. Knowing we'd be spending a lot of time outside in Hawaii, I wisely chose to bring my pair with polarized lenses.\n\nUnlike my cheaper, everyday sunglasses, these help protect my eyes from glare from reflective surfaces, which was especially helpful when swimming or looking out across the ocean. They also help reduce eye strain.\n\nIt was the right swap, and the quality of the lenses meant that the colors and hues of Hawaii weren't diminished when I wore them.\n\nNaturally, I had sandals and flip-flops stuffed into my bag, but I made sure to bring one pair of comfortable sneakers too.\n\nThey were my go-to each day, and I found it easy to go on hikes and explore around volcanic rocks in them.\n\nIn my opinion, one of the best parts of visiting Hawaii is exploring on foot, and coming prepared with the right footwear really helped.\n\nHawaiian law prohibits the sale and distribution of sunscreens that contain oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are damaging to reefs.\n\nSo, all travelers are asked to use only reef-safe sunscreen, which is the type sold locally on the islands.\n\nI'm not usually a fan of checking luggage, but for our trip to Maui, we chose to bring a checked bag for our snorkeling gear. But in the end, the equipment was never used.\n\nWe were so busy exploring the island that we didn't spend time snorkeling at the numerous beaches while driving around Maui. Plus, our time in the ocean was spent at the resort, where snorkel sets were provided by the hotel.\n\nIn the future, this gear will only come with us if we plan some dedicated off-property snorkeling time in advance.\n\nMaui felt like the perfect place to debut several new swimsuits, especially because I'd be in the water so frequently.\n\nIn reality, though, I found myself consistently choosing my favorite (and most practical) swimsuit almost every time. I just hung it out to dry every evening to ensure it was ready for the next day.",

    "description": "Janice Min, editor of The Ankler, offers an un-sunny assessment of the world's entertainment capital: \"There is definitely a Detroit vibe underway.\"",
    "fullText": "The streaming boom that fueled a ton of production in the last decade-plus is gone, and lots of the remaining work is going overseas. No one really knows how AI will affect the movie and TV business, but there's lots of fear it won't be good. And barring something truly surprising, Warner Bros., one of Hollywood's most important movie and TV studios, is going to get swallowed up in the next year or so, which will mean even more consolidation.\n\nBut don't take it from me: Ask Janice Min, who has spent a couple decades enmeshed in Hollywood. First as the editor of the Hollywood Reporter, and now as CEO of The Ankler, an industry trade built for the Substack Age.\n\nThat means she's not a disinterested observer at all: If the center of the movie and TV industry is shrinking, that's bad news for the advertising, subscriptions, and events businesses she's trying to build.\n\nI talked to Min about all of that on my Channels podcast, and you can listen to the whole thing here. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: If you had to bet right now, who wins the newly reopened bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery?\n\nJanice Min: Doesn't it really depend if Netflix decides they're going to step it up? So far, it seems like they will. But Netflix is a pretty ruthless company: Season two isn't working out, it's not driving as many subscribers as season one, your show is canceled. Or cofounder Reed Hastings' famous \"keeper test\": You aren't performing well. You're out.\n\nAnd shareholders are not loving this pursuit of Warner Bros. At some point, they will cut it off. They're a very pragmatic company.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Netflix would really like this deal, and that Paramount has to have this deal. Do you agree?\n\nI do. If you're David Ellison and you've assembled probably the most expensive leadership team in history, you are prepping to have Warner Bros. David Ellison was not prepping to have the seventh-biggest studio or the seventh-biggest streamer.\n\nIn the end, if he doesn't have that, you're kind of left holding the bag that nobody wanted. How do you win?\n\nYou are holding the thing that Shari Redstone was desperately trying to get rid of.\n\nThat's important context. This battle is so interesting to me because Warner Bros. is such a stinker, with so much debt, that they are being forced to sell. They had no other outcome. Paramount was such a stinker that Shari Redstone couldn't get the stink off of her fast enough. And there was basically, in the end, one bidder [for Paramount].\n\nThat one bidder is now one of two bidders for the other thing. We get caught up in the excitement that these are huge prizes, but they're just these debt-stuffed, slow-moving beasts that need to have someone who has an emotional attachment to them for them to make sense as a buyer.\n\nAfter Netflix won the first bidding round in December, there was an immediate negative reaction from Hollywood. What's the current vibe when it comes to Netflix vs. Paramount as WBD's future owner?\n\nI think for most people it's Sophie's Choice. There are two potential bad outcomes here.\n\nOn the plus side for David Ellison: People love that he loves movies.\n\n\"I love movies. You guys make movies. I'm gonna make more movies. You should work with me.\"\n\nIt's not a sophisticated business argument, but everyone here has dollar signs spinning in their eyes, everyone's looking for the next deal for themselves. So they like that. Perhaps David Ellison will pay and maybe even overpay for what you are making. And it's exciting that it'll create a big buyer in the market.\n\nThe flip side of that is, Hollywood is not a particularly pro-Trump industry. I don't think they like a lot of the things they are seeing happening at Paramount right now, like the situation that happened with Stephen Colbert and James Talarico. They certainly don't like what's happening with CBS News.\n\nFundamentally, though, it does come down to your bottom line. The industry is struggling. People are having a hard time having the careers they had 10 years ago. So people like the idea of a buyer with deep pockets, even if it's daddy's money.\n\nThere is a steady stream of stories and social media posts about how AI is going to disrupt Hollywood. How much of that concern do you see reflected in day-to-day conversations?\n\nThe thing with AI right now in Hollywood: Everyone's lying just a little bit. Studios are lying about how much they're using it.\n\nCompanies are lying about the capability of their products. And for creative people, they're lying about the fact that they're not using it. I dare you to find a screenwriter who is staring at a blank page and not talking to Claude or ChatGPT at the same time.\n\nIt seems clear that it's going to be a big deal for people working in visual effects, and that was already a challenged industry.\n\nI have a friend who's been sending me LinkedIn posts that are showing up in his feed, and it is so grim. It's people largely who have worked in VFX, and they are posting this full-on bleed out, like \"I will be homeless by next Thursday if I don't have work.\"\n\nIt doesn't appear they're being hyperbolic.\n\nI guarantee that every single studio, every single streamer, they are all completely doing this. During last year's Oscar race, [there was a controversy about] \"The Brutalist,\" and how Adrian Brody's voice was made more Hungarian-accented through technology.\n\nThis year, it is crickets. Even the Academy, the most precious, legacy-protecting institution in Hollywood, has not come out in a really firm way about AI. They basically have a don't ask, don't tell policy. I would say with some certainty that every single best picture nominee this year has used AI in its production process.\n\nWhat's the story people outside Hollywood are missing about your industry right now?\n\nYou look at LA and you think it's sunny and amazing and people are happy. People are having a hard time here. The unemployment rate of Los Angeles is much higher than the national average.\n\nYou're seeing a city that is so big and sprawling, with a kind of rudderless feeling: Who's going to stop this? There is definitely a Detroit vibe underway if things don't course correct.\n\nAnd you're seeing a paralysis: Hollywood used to be a place that had a lot of protests, spoke out, was always fighting the so-called man. And it is pretty much crickets now, because everyone is scared.\n\nI was struck by the fact when you saw the Grammys, you have these musicians getting up on stage, — Billie Eilish, Bad Bunny — and really sticking it to the president and ICE. And you compare that with the Golden Globes, where it was sponsored by Polymarket, and no one's saying anything.\n\nWhen you think about how to capture young people, who are the pipeline for everything — they love this culture of rebellion and revolt and speaking out. I worry about Hollywood containing itself so much to the point that it stops speaking to the audience.",

    "title": "Fed confirms it obeyed White House request for an unusual ‘rate check,’ weakening the dollar against foreign currencies",
    "description": "“Something like this is extremely rare in foreign exchange markets,\" ING says.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed yesterday that its trading desk did conduct a rare “rate check” on the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen on behalf of the White House earlier this year. The move is often regarded as a precursor to actively intervening in currency markets. In this case, the implication would be that the U.S. Treasury wanted to strengthen the yen versus the dollar (or, vice versa, weaken the dollar versus the yen).\n\nIndeed, that is exactly what happened on the foreign exchange markets on January 23 of this year. The dollar had been trading at ¥158.50 but then collapsed suddenly to ¥152.45 by January 27—a relatively sharp move for such large international currencies.\n\nIn the minutes of its last meeting, the Fed said that private markets had expected the dollar to continue weakening this year but the U.S. economy had done so well that those expectations had “moderated quite a bit.” The dollar was slowly gaining strength versus the yen, approaching ¥160.\n\nBut then, the Fed said, U.S. Treasury officials asked the Fed’s trading desk to get a quote for a significant purchase of yen—a move that would weaken the dollar again and bid up the Japanese currency. As a result, “the dollar…depreciated markedly after reports that the Desk had made requests for indicative quotes, known as ‘rate checks,’ on the dollar–yen exchange rate. The manager noted that the Desk had requested those quotes solely on behalf of the U.S. Treasury in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s role as the fiscal agent for the U.S.”\n\nThe implication of the move is that the White House wants the dollar to remain weak compared to foreign currencies. A weak dollar means U.S. goods and services are cheap, by comparison, for foreign businesses and investors. It’s a way of boosting U.S. exports and foreign investment into America.\n\nING analyst Chris Turner was shocked by the move. “What also stood out to us in the minutes was the Fed’s full disclosure on the USD/JPY rate check. The minutes confirmed that the New York Fed did check rates in USD/JPY on behalf of the US Treasury and in its role as the fiscal agent of the US. This likely happened at 5:00pm London time on Friday, 23 January, when USD/JPY was trading around 157,” he told clients this morning.\n\n“Something like this is extremely rare in foreign exchange markets and is a sign of a more activist White House when it comes to FX [foreign exchange]. The move was clearly designed to deliver maximum impact and reflects the shared desire from both Washington and Tokyo that USD/JPY does not sustain a move through 160.”",

    "title": "Emails show 'Godfather of AGI' Ben Goertzel courted Epstein for funding and congratulated him on jail release",
    "description": "Ben Goertzel accepted money from Jeffrey Epstein to build the \"Sputnik of AI.\" He says he \"made a mistake\" by not doing due diligence.",
    "fullText": "In January 2013, Jeffrey Epstein sent a blunt email to the computer scientist Ben Goertzel. Epstein had funded Goertzel's research in artificial intelligence and was frustrated with a lack of progress. However, on this day, the disgraced financier wasn't writing to discuss algorithms or neural networks — he wanted to discuss Goertzel's hair.\n\n\"I think it is now time for you to drop the hippie look,\" Epstein wrote, warning Goertzel that his \"disheveled 80s appearance\" was an \"unnecessary hindrance\" to securing the capital that might one day help the two men achieve AGI — artificial general intelligence, a hypothetical level of computer intelligence that could surpass that of humans. Epstein compared the scientist's ponytail to \"spinach in the teeth of a friend.\"\n\n\"I would be willing to cut my hair for a lot of AGI money,\" Goertzel replied.\n\nThe exchange was among dozens between Epstein and Goertzel in files released by the Department of Justice, chronicling Epstein's fascination with the potential of AI. Goertzel, a researcher who helped popularize the term AGI and develop the humanoid robot Sophia, courted Epstein for money over several years, promising he could build the \"Sputnik of AI,\" the emails show.\n\nIn an online résumé that has since been removed, Goertzel said Epstein gave him a $100,000 research grant in 2001. Emails reviewed by Business Insider show Epstein agreed to give Goertzel at least another $100,000 between 2008 and 2018, spread out across multiple transfers. It could not be learned how much of the money Goertzel ultimately received.\n\nThe emails show Goertzel was aware of Epstein's criminal charges. In a 2010 email, Goertzel congratulated Epstein on his release from the Palm Beach County Jail. In 2008, Epstein had pleaded guilty to two sex charges, including solicitation of a minor. In 2015, several days after Prince Andrew was named in a lawsuit over underage sex claims related to Epstein, Goertzel wrote about \"utterly idiotic negative publicity in the news\" and said he was sorry Epstein's camp had to deal with it.\n\n\"Maybe some variation of what is alleged did happen, but if so it was surely an occurrence among reasonably mature people who mutually consented at the time, so why is it anybody else's business?\" Goertzel wrote, before asking for $25,000 for a \"corporate contribution\" to one of his companies.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Goertzel said he \"made a mistake\" in accepting Epstein's money. He said he regretted not doing due diligence on Epstein's crimes and that he had \"basically zero knowledge of Epstein's sexual peculiarities and exploitative practices.\"\n\nHe added: \"I deeply regret being social-engineered by this terrible human being and not doing more research into him decades ago. I won't make this sort of mistake again.\"\n\nGoertzel is currently the CEO of SingularityNET, an AI and blockchain company. He is also chair of The AGI Society, a nonprofit that holds an annual AI conference.\n\nHis correspondence with Epstein was among millions of documents released by the Justice Department. The files have reverberated through the business world, revealing emails between Epstein and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Virgin founder Richard Branson, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, among others. The fallout for some people named in the files has been swift. Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, Kathryn Ruemmler, resigned in mid-February, and Brad Karp resigned as chairman of the law firm Paul Weiss, among others.\n\nAppearing in the files does not necessarily suggest that a person has engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nIn one of the emails released by the Justice Department, Goertzel said he had known Epstein since 2001. Epstein took an interest in what labs like MIT and Google were doing in the AI field. Goertzel, who some consider one of the \"godfathers of AGI,\" coauthored a 2006 book on the topic, and in 2008, he created OpenCog, an open-source project to try to architect human intelligence. Goertzel told Business Insider that he met Epstein through \"mutual friends\" in New York City.\n\nEpstein appeared concerned in some emails by the lack of support for Goertzel's AGI theories among mainstream experts. \"i believe in you. i can't figure out why i am in the minority,\" he told Goertzel in 2010. In a 2011 email, Goertzel asked if Epstein would fund half of a $3 million grant over four years to fund a \"full speed ahead toward AGI\" plan, which included building AI that could control a video game character and a humanoid robot.\n\n\"Of course, US$3M is a lot of money. However, this would be the 'Sputnik of AGI' -- it would set the development of AGI on a whole new course,\" Goertzel wrote.\n\nIn his statement to Business Insider, Goertzel said, \"I had basically zero knowledge of Epstein's sexual peculiarities and exploitative practices and have no orientation toward that sort of thing and little understanding of it -- it was all about being overly desperate at that stage for any source of $$ to fund innovative frontier science, which Epstein did recognize as valuable but mainstream science at the time did not.\"\n\nEpstein sometimes pushed Goertzel for more tangible proof of breakthroughs and tried to influence some research directions, the emails show. In February 2013, he emailed Goertzel and suggested that having an AI system pass \"iq tests for children\" would provide a concrete research milestone. Goertzel agreed to pursue the idea.\n\n\"Epstein was very smart and fairly technically savvy and had a lot of ideas about AI, which were not terribly stupid nor terribly brilliant,\" Goertzel told Business Insider. \"I did not pay much attention to them nor did they influence my work in any way.\"\n\nEpstein used corporate and foundation vehicles to send money to Goertzel, including his Southern Trust Company, registered in the US Virgin Islands, the emails show.\n\n\"As before, we can do this as a tax-deductible donation to a nonprofit, assuming that's still your preference,\" Goertzel said in a September 2010 email to Epstein.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, Goertzel, who spent some of his time in Hong Kong, requested that the money be sent to different nonprofits' accounts, the emails show. In 2014, Goertzel requested that Epstein send the money to Humanity+, a nonprofit focused on transhumanism that he was vice president of. Goertzel said it would act as a fiscal \"pass-through\" so the money could be diverted to himself and other researchers.\n\n\"Yes all this was totally legit, the funding was going to open-source AGI R&D for the good of humanity and its future, which was very much within the mandate of Humanity+ as a 501-3c nonprofit,\" Goertzel told Business Insider.\n\nGoertzel told Business Insider he \"reconnected\" with Epstein in 2008 after several years of no contact, and that Epstein told him about his legal situation.\n\n\"He framed it as a politically motivated prosecution for involvement with a consenting adult. I believed him. I should not have,\" Goertzel told Business Insider.\n\nSeveral emails show Goertzel and Epstein arranging to meet in person. Goertzel told Business Insider they met on several occasions at Epstein's New York and Florida offices. \"I never hung out with him in a social setting, never went to the island or flew in the jet or saw him partying with girlfriends or anything like that,\" he said.\n\nIn 2015, Goertzel was following up on a payment he hoped to receive from Epstein. Richard Kahn, Epstein's accountant, responded that it had to be put on hold due to \"bad press.\" The Guardian had reported days earlier that Prince Andrew was named in a US lawsuit involving Epstein.\n\n\"I don't want to push you guys at a difficult time, but given my own situation I do feel moved to ask if Jeffrey might still be able to help with $25K for my 'corporate contribution' to the OpenCog Hong Kong project,\" Goertzel wrote. \"He has helped in this way every year since 2010, usually via a donation to Humanity+.\"\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported earlier on some of the payments Epstein made to Goertzel to help him secure Hong Kong grants.\n\nEpstein responded, \"yes 25,\" and Goertzel thanked him and said he hoped to resume conversations \"once this current moronic media shitstorm blows over.\"\n\nEmails between the men continued for several years. In December 2018, a few days after the Miami Herald published an investigation into Epstein that contributed to his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges the next year, Goertzel sent an email inviting Epstein to an AI and blockchain event in New York. Alternatively, he said, they could find another time to meet in the city.\n\n\"let me know if you're in town and might spare a few moments,\" Goertzel wrote. \"it's been a while!\"\n\nHave something to share?

    "title": "I moved to Italy without ever visiting. Here's how I chose a home city — and why I don't regret my unconventional approach.",
    "description": "Using research and simple tools, I made my decision to move to a place without visiting it. Now I'm an American happily living in Florence, Italy.",
    "fullText": "As I stepped off a train in Florence into heat so brutal it felt like the city was actively trying to kill me, I wondered if I'd made the right decision.\n\nThis was my first time in Italy, yet I'd already committed to leaving the US and calling it home.\n\nI'd dreamed of living in Europe ever since my semester abroad in college, but here I was — overstimulated, sweating, and on my way to move into an apartment I'd only seen through WhatsApp video calls.\n\nConventional wisdom says you should visit a place before moving to it and that committing to a city you've never set foot in is reckless. However, for single women without the budget or time for multiple international scouting trips, that advice feels paralyzing.\n\nI'm glad I didn't follow it and happy to report that about eight months later, I'm happily settled in Florence with my 60-pound pit-lab-boxer mix, Archie.\n\nIn January, I started looking into where I might want to move by putting together the unsexy stuff: a massive spreadsheet tracking visa requirements, pet import rules (Archie is non-negotiable), and cost of living across multiple countries.\n\nDespite never setting foot in the country, Italy won me over purely on logistics. Its digital-nomad visa seemed achievable, the country had few dog restrictions, and the visa income requirements were something I could easily meet with my freelance work.\n\nFrom there, I had to pick a city. That's where things got less straightforward.\n\nI built a custom GPT to synthesize research my ADHD brain couldn't organize on its own and asked it everything: What's the cost-of-living breakdown in different Italian cities? Where's the sweet spot between budget, safety, and actual vibes?\n\nI used Google Street View to virtually walk neighborhoods, \"visit\" apartments, and check for green spaces for Archie. I watched travel series and documentaries, and asked friends who had been to Italy about where they think I'd fit.\n\nEventually, I narrowed my options to the Tuscany region because it's centrally located in Italy — the perfect home base to explore a country I've never been to before.\n\nSoon, I ruled out smaller towns on my list, like Montepulciano, because I'd have to travel to a bigger city like Florence just to get anywhere else. I wasn't moving to Europe only to not be able to travel frequently.\n\nBecause I contain multitudes, I also consulted my astrocartography chart. Florence came up as a place that could offer me career recognition, creativity, and (most importantly) rest.\n\nLogic said Italy. The stars said Florence. And, if I'm honest, my heart said Florence all along. Something about the place I saw through travel documentaries, blogs, social media, and research called to me.\n\nIt felt like a Goldilocks city — big enough to have a bustling social scene, but small enough that I could walk the whole thing in a night.\n\nIt's also got a lot of English-speaking people, which I figured could be helpful as I learn Italian.\n\nOnce I decided, I started pulling together my documents, looking for apartments, studying Italian, and selling just about everything I own to fund Archie's portion of the move.\n\nSix months later, I found myself sweating in a country that would become home.\n\nWithin a few weeks of moving, I realized there was a lot my research didn't prepare me for.\n\nFor one, I didn't realize how overstimulating coming from rural Tennessee to a busy Florentine street with a tram running outside would be for Archie and me.\n\nPlus, moving in the middle of June was a mistake. The heat made leaving the apartment nearly impossible for weeks, which made daily life feel hard and overwhelming.\n\nI couldn't have anticipated the mental exhaustion that would come with every errand and interaction, either. Not only was I navigating a new neighborhood and new routines, but I was also doing so in a second language (that I'm still learning).\n\nAfter a few months in Florence, though, I felt like I could slow down and finally feel present in a way I never had in the US.\n\nJust as in many parts of Europe, life here feels more peaceful, slower, and less tied to hustle culture.\n\nArchie's also been doing well —fortunately, many Italians really love dogs. I couldn't anticipate how much of my social life would only exist because of him.\n\nFrom day one, the ladies at the café downstairs spoiled Archie and knew his name before they knew mine. The same happened with the owner of the local pub on the corner, where I made my first Italian friend.\n\nEven if people never learned my name, they knew of me — and they looked out for me. It was the sense of community I'd been searching for my whole life.\n\nI've made a lot of big, scary moves in my life, and I can honestly say that my only regret about this one is doing it in the dead heat of summer.\n\nAlthough this unconventional approach to moving has paid off for me so far, it's certainly not ideal for everyone. It's not for people who think staying put is the safer choice, or who need certainty before they can take the leap.\n\nHowever, it could work well for those who don't have disposable income for multiple scouting trips, and who understand that tomorrow isn't promised. It's for people who are 100% committed, trust their research, and trust themselves.\n\nI made the decision using a mix of spreadsheets, AI, Google Street View, and astrology. A few months later, I'm standing in a city I'd never visited, and I've never felt more at home.",

    "fullText": "CNN’s studio mic caught an anchor’s unvarnished reaction to an aside from President Donald Trump that involved his lack of affection for “handsome men.”\n\nTrump gave a speech Thursday morning at an event promoting his Board of Peace at the contentiously renamed “Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace.”\n\nAccording to pool reports, there were pro-Palestinian protesters across the street from the building “with big signs yelling ‘Donald Trump go to hell.’”\n\nThe president’s speech featured the usual stylistic flourishes and characteristic deviations — including one aside that caught CNN anchor Sara Sidner off guard.\n\nSidner and co-anchors John Berman and Kate Bolduan covered the speech live on Thursday’s edition of CNN News Central, during which the network cut in midway through Trump’s remarks.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He’s a great guy. They’re all great. But I was very proud of it.\n\nPresident Penna (Peña) of Paraguay is here. President. President, thank you very much.\n\nYoung, handsome guy. It’s always nice to be young and handsome. Doesn’t mean we have to like you.\n\nI don’t like young, handsome men.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Women, I like. Men, I don’t have any interest.\n\nCNN ANCHOR JOHN BERMAN: Right. President Trump is speaking to his Board of Peace. This is the organization he founded first to help rebuild Gaza.\n\nTrump riffed freely as he introduced the other leaders at the event, as well.\n\nElsewhere in the speech, Trump appeared to try and assuage concerns about his entity being at odds with the United Nations, claiming his goal was to “strengthen up” the UN:\n\nThe Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly. But we’re going to strengthen up the United Nations. We’re going to make sure it’s facilities are good if they need help, and they need help, money wise, we can help them money wise. And we’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable.\n\nWatch above via CNN News Central.\n\nThe post Hot Mic Catches CNN Anchor’s Stunned Reaction to Trump Blurting He Doesn’t ‘Like Handsome Men’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the king said, adding that he would not be commenting further amid the investigation into his brother, and that the rest of the royal family would “continue in our duty and service to you all.”\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s net worth was previously reported to be $3 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. However, the site has not reported his current net worth.\n\nWhen his titles were stripped, The Guardian reported that his only public stream of income was from his pension he gets from from his service in the navy between 1979 and 2001, which amounted to £20,000 a year. E! News also reported that Charles would not be stripping his brother of his funds. The BBC shortly reported after that Andrew was paid tens of thousands of pounds by a British businessman linked to a wealth management company which ripped off pension savers.\n\nIt’s estimated that Andrew had received £13M ($17.5M) at today’s prices in official payments for his work as a royal in the four decades leading up to his infamous 2019 BBC Interview. Queen Elizabeth also reportedly gave Andrew an allowance of £250K ($336K) annually, but he has not received money following her death.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that he helped Greek and Swiss firms who were bidding for large contracts in Kazakhstan in 2011 was to have been paid a commission of 1%, or £3.85M ($5.1M), for helping broker a successful deal, according to the reports.\n\nWhile his luxurious lifestyle was often questioned by the public and media, his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein might have added some money to his bank. The convicted sex offender had given £15K ($20K) to Sarah Ferguson to reduce some of her debts.\n\nRight before his arrest, royal author Robert Hardman told The Daily Telegraph that the tensions between King Charles and his brother has left Andrew in a “poverty-stricken exile.”\n\n“There was a time I think people expected, when Charles came to the throne, that he was going to be very tough on Andrew, he was going to kick him out of the house,” he said. “Charles was pretty charitable certainly for the first couple of years but the more pig-headed Andrew’s been about moving out of that house … then it turns out he hasn’t been telling the truth about his relationship with Epstein, it’s caused irreparable damage”.\n\n“Up until the summer, Andrew’s view was, ‘I’ve got a lease on the house, I’m going to stay there and pursue private business activities and pay my own way’,” the author observed. “Now it turns out that he wasn’t strictly true about Epstein so the King has taken all his titles, all his business deals have fallen apart, the guy’s got no money, he can’t keep the house standing.\n\nWhile it isn’t public knowledge of what Prince Andrew will be leaving his daughters, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice, they will not be inheriting his coveted Royal Lodge following his eviction.\n\n“[This] would only have been possible while the lease remained in place,”  property expert Elliot Castle said. “Once that lease is surrendered or terminated, there is nothing to pass on. From a property standpoint, that closes the door entirely. Royal Lodge would revert fully to the Crown Estate, with no residual claim for Andrew or his daughters.”\n\nA source told RadarOnline: “Neither princess needs Royal Lodge for housing, but losing a $40million asset changes the shape of their futures,” adding, “They feel they are paying the price for decisions they did not make. The anger is real, and it is directed squarely at how their father’s scandal keeps shrinking their options.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "description": "Top economist Mohamed El-Erian said that systemic risk from the rapid expansion of private credit is an \"elephant in the room.\"",
    "fullText": "Mohamed El-Erian thinks a recent development in private credit contains echoes of the financial crisis.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Thursday, the former PIMCO CEO flagged a Financial Times report that said private credit giant Blue Owl Capital is permanently halting withdrawals in its Capital Corporation II fund, a private debt fund that's open to retail investors.\n\nThat move could be seen as a parallel to what happened in the months leading up to the last financial crisis, El-Erian said. In August 2007, BNP Paribas froze three of its funds due to a decline in liquidity in the securitization market, which made it impossible to \"value certain assets fairly,\" it said at the time.\n\nNearly two decades after the Great Financial Crisis, BNP Paribas's move is regarded by some as the start of the downturn that led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers the following year.\n\n\"Is this a 'canary-in-the-coalmine' moment, similar to August 2007?\" El-Erian wrote. \"There's also the 'elephant in the room' question regarding much larger system risks (nowhere near the magnitude of those which fueled the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, but a significant — and necessary — valuation hit is looming for specific assets),\" he added.\n\nHuge volumes of investment capital have poured into the private market in recent years. Assets under management in private credit investments rose to $2.2 trillion last year, an 86% increase from levels five years ago, according to data from the analytics firm Preqin.\n\nBut investments in the space carry more risk amid lower liquidity and less transparency. Private firms, for instance, are not required to publicly disclose their earnings and financials, and private assets tend to be more illiquid than investments in public firms or public credit funds.\n\nEl-Erian said he believed there was a risk the \"investing phenomenon\" in the private markets had already \"gone too far overall.\"\n\nThe investing approach that some firms in the space take also seems subject to the \"'markets for lemons' risk,\" he added, referring to a situation where firms offering high-quality goods exit the market, as they're unwilling to accept the price buyers will pay to account for the risk of purchasing a low-quality good, or a lemon.\n\nOther Wall Street forecasters have warned of potential issues in private credit following the high-profile collapse of Tricolor Holdings and First Brands last year.\n\nFollowing those blowups, JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon now-famously quipped that more \"cockroaches\" are likely lurking in private credit.\n\nLloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs CEO who ran the bank during the GFC, also said he believed credit markets could be the source of the US economy's next big problem.",

    "description": "US-Iran tensions could push oil prices higher, says Goldman Sachs. The bank's co-head of commodities research said the market sees the situation escalating.",
    "fullText": "Oil is spiking on the latest bout of tensions between the US and Iran, and Goldman Sachs's top commodities researcher says more volatility may be coming.\n\nDaan Struyven, the bank's co-head of global commodities research, told CNBC that he thinks the market sees tensions escalating further between the US and Iran, a likely catalyst for price hikes and longer-term volatility. Both US and international oil prices were up about 2% on Thursday.\n\n\"Both prediction markets and oil markets are pricing some near-term moderate escalation as the base case,\" he said.\n\nOne area in focus is the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway in the Middle East that handles 20% of both the global oil and liquified natural gas supplies.\n\nStruyven highlighted the passage's importance for international oil flows, adding that Goldman's base case assumes shipping through the strait will continue and that his team is not anticipating any long-term disruptions.\n\nHowever, Iran is one of the world's leading oil suppliers, and its government has made it clear that it intends to retaliate if President Donald Trump moves forward with his threats against it. This could mean attempting to block or restrict access to the Strait of Hormuz, throttling supply.\n\nIf this were to curtail flows by 1 million barrels per day for an entire year, Struyven predicted that would justify an $8 per barrel price increase, a roughly 11% jump from Thursday's price for Brent crude around $71.50. However, he also noted that fear among traders could push prices even higher, adding to the volatility in the market.\n\n\"Markets are continuously reassessing, not only the base case, but especially the probability of this tail risk of large oil disruptions in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nOil prices have risen this year after tumbling throughout 2025. The volatility in energy markets follows bouts of volatility related to the US attack on Venezuela in January and continued saber-rattling on Iran.",

    "description": "You don't have to count calories to lose weight and eat well, says a doctor who specializes in helping high performers like CEOs get in shape.",
    "fullText": "On a recent trip to France, Dr. Meghan Garcia-Webb was struck by an age-old paradox.\n\nEverywhere she looked, she saw people enjoying cheese, wine, and bread — yet the average person seemed much healthier than the typical American.\n\nIn France, despite their reputation for rich cuisine, the obesity rate is a fraction of what we see in the United States, for all our calorie-counting and protein maxxing.\n\n\"There isn't this pervasive diet culture of going to a restaurant and seeing how many calories are in this and how many carbs,\" Garcia-Webb told Business Insider. \"I do find it is refreshing in the sense that there's not this fear around food, and the food is very satisfying.\"\n\nIt's just one example of how stressing less about your diet can lead to better weight loss and long-term health, she said.\n\nIn her concierge medicine practice, Garcia-Webb specializes in helping high achievers, such as CEOs and attorneys, manage their weight. A lot of her job is pushing back on extreme diet fads, including the trend of tracking everything.\n\n\"I really enjoy food and the more I do this work, the more compelled I feel to show people that it actually is possible to be healthy and really like to eat,\" she said.\n\nGarcia-Webb said her favorite food hack makes it easy to eat well without turning your food journal into a full-time job. Here's how to try it at home for more nutritious meals.\n\nEveryone loves a food hack, and Garcia-Webb said hers is simple: when you prepare a meal, start by making half the plate fruits and non-starchy vegetables.\n\n\"It's actually very easy,\" she said. \"You don't even have to cook them if you don't want to.\"\n\nThink carrots, cucumbers, peppers, greens, tomatoes, berries, grapes, citrus — anything you'd find in the produce aisle (except potatoes). To make it even easier, opt for pre-cut options that are ready to eat or frozen produce, which is as healthy as fresh.\n\nFrom there, Garcia-Webb builds a full meal by adding a source of protein, like lean meats or fish, to fill another quarter of the plate. The last quarter of the plate is for starchy foods like whole grains, pasta, rice, or potatoes.\n\nThe strategy makes it simple to get five servings a day of fruits and veggies. Each serving is about a handful when you're eyeballing it.\n\nAs you fill up on produce, the high-volume, high-fiber food keeps you full and satisfied after eating, so you're less likely to reach for junk food later. That means you'll find yourself eating healthier without having to count a single calorie or even measure a portion.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with tracking your eating habits, and calculating every gram of protein is fine if that works for you.\n\nStill, for most people, too much tracking can be a burden, taking away the enjoyment of food and making you less likely to stick to your healthy habits long-term.\n\nInstead of trying to track everything you eat forever, Garcia-Webb recommends keeping a food log for a few days: it can give you a baseline sense of your current habits and what you can change to move toward your goals.\n\n\"You build this intuitive knowledge, and then you have a rough sense of what it looks like for you,\" she said.\n\nA temporary habit of food tracking can be helpful if you feel like you're doing everything right and wonder why you aren't losing weight.\n\nGarcia-Webb said if you've never tracked your habits, it's common to eat more and exercise less than you realize.\n\nThese days, plenty of convenience foods disguise ultra-processed junk with a \"health halo\" of added protein or other nutrients to make you believe you're making a nutritious choice.\n\n\"People think that they're eating healthier than they are,\" Garcia-Webb said. \"Something that we can all fall prey to is very good marketing.\"",

    "description": "As a Pittsburgh local, my recommendations for the best places to visit and things to do include underrated gems like Regent Square shops or Garfield.",
    "fullText": "Growing up in a small town in Western Pennsylvania, I visited Pittsburgh often when I was younger.\n\nI thought I knew it really well until I actually moved there in 2010 and realized some of the city's best parts really exist outside of downtown and the touristy areas I saw as a kid.\n\nAt the risk of blowing up my own spots, here are a few neighborhoods and areas that feel habitually overlooked by visitors — and some of my best recommendations for experiencing the authentic Steel City.\n\nLocated along the Allegheny River, Millvale feels like a small town plopped down in the city, complete with a \"main street\" of locally owned shops along Grant Avenue.\n\nThe standout highlight of the borough is Mr. Smalls, an 18th-century church turned music venue that books national names along with local acts.\n\nHowever, my personal favorite Millvale venue is Poetry Lounge, a bar with nightly live entertainment that also publishes poetry, where you can order chapbooks or zines off the menu alongside drinks.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, there are also three breweries — Grist House, Strange Roots, and Burghers — and several neighborhood bars between the brick row houses of Grant Avenue if you want to kick back like a Yinzer (Pittsburgh native).\n\nGarfield hosts Unblurred, Pittsburgh's longest-running free art crawl. Every first Friday, the galleries on Penn Avenue open to the public, usually with some live entertainment to accompany the art.\n\nIf you'd rather get hands-on, the Pittsburgh Glass Center offers glass-blowing classes along with exhibits.\n\nMy go-to spot in Garfield is Bantha Tea, a Star Wars-themed café with delicious tea (I recommend the Bloomfield Fog) and evening events like poetry readings and a recurring music improv lab.\n\nGarfield also has a slew of restaurants, including my favorite pho spot in the city (Pho Minh), Pittsburgh's best vegan pizza (Spak Brothers), and an excellent Indian lunch buffet (People's Indian Restaurant).\n\nOne of Pittsburgh's most unique museums is here, too: The Center for PostNatural History, which is focused exclusively on animals and organisms intentionally altered by humans.\n\nPittsburgh today is more \"eds and meds\" than soot and steel, but it's kept the blue-collar vibe from its industrial past. I'd say Homestead is the best place to see traces of this history.\n\nUntil 1986, the Homestead Steel Works was one of the world's largest steel-producing plant. It was mostly demolished to make way for the sprawling open-air Waterfront shopping center, where you can find everything from independent comic shops to big-box retailers.\n\nThe Steel Works smokestacks still loom over the AMC Theater as an incongruous reminder of the past.\n\nEast from the stacks is the Pump House, one-time setting of the violent 1892 Homestead Strike that is now a trailhead of the Great Allegheny Passage, a roughly 150-mile trail that connects to Maryland.\n\nAcross the Monongahela is Carrie Blast Furnaces, another Steel Works remnant that hosts events like graffiti tours, blacksmithing workshops, and the annual Festival of Combustion.\n\nPoint Breeze also has steel-era history, though here it's all about the Fricks — specifically Henry Clay Frick, who managed the Homestead Steel Works throughout the 1890s.\n\nFrick Park (Pittsburgh's largest park) is named for him, and the Frick family is buried in Homewood Cemetery to its north.\n\nNear the cemetery is the former Frick estate, now the Frick Museums and Gardens, which is free to enter.\n\nJust southeast of Frick Park is Regent Square, a commercial stretch that feels like a small-town downtown. My personal highlight here is the community-focused bookstore Stay Gold Books.\n\nI've also downed my share of Yuenglings while playing pool at Murphy's Tap Room, and there are plenty of other bars and restaurants along South Braddock Avenue if a semi-divey Irish pub isn't your speed.",

    "fullText": "Arguably, no one can nail classic, \"cool-girl\" style quite like Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy did.\n\nBessette-Kennedy shot to prominence in the mid to late '90s as the girlfriend and then the wife of John F. Kennedy Jr., the son of former President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, and her older sister, Lauren Bessette, were killed in a plane crash on July 16, 1999. There were no survivors from the accident, which happened off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.\n\nBefore her passing, Bessette-Kennedy was known as a fashion icon, thanks to her minimalist outfits, which embodied what we now call the quiet-luxury aesthetic and featured a color palette of mostly black, white, beige, and navy blue.\n\nHer personal style is now coming back into the zeitgeist with the release of Ryan Murphy's \"Love Story,\" which chronicles the couple's seven-year relationship.\n\nHere are 11 of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's best, most timeless looks.\n\nPictured here with John F. Kennedy Jr. in front of their Tribeca apartment in New York City, Bessette-Kennedy embodied classic autumnal fashion by pairing patent-leather brown boots with a simple black sweater and a camel-colored, calf-length skirt.\n\nShe accessorized with an understated black-leather bag and swept her blonde hair back into a low ponytail.\n\nBessette-Kennedy knew how to ace perfectly tailored, classic pieces similar to the ones Klein is known for, like this structured white button-up and black mermaid-tail skirt.\n\nVogue called this minimalist look \"the epitome of uptown glamour without compromising her pared-back aesthetic.\"\n\nPictured here with her husband at the Municipal Art Society Gala in 1998, Bessette-Kennedy wore a strapless black column gown, velvet gloves, and pointed strappy stiletto heels.\n\nIn 1996, while walking around New York City, she was photographed wearing a flowy summer dress with a bright floral print, black strappy heels, and a black, patent-leather handbag.\n\nThis classic look, from the black sleeveless tank to the brown-and-cream heeled sandals, would still be stylish now.\n\nThese rounded black sunglasses paired with a black button-up and green cargo pants epitomized '90s fashion.\n\nWhile heading to the airport to catch a flight for Bill Clinton's inauguration in January 1997, Bessette-Kennedy was photographed wearing a camel-colored skirt, black leather boots, and a belted black suede coat.\n\nShe finished the look with a tortoise-shell headband and a pair of oval sunglasses.\n\nWhen attending the Newman's Own George Awards in 1999, she paired a black coat with ruffled detailing with simple black pants and strappy heels.\n\nIn this 1996 ensemble, she layered a grey Miu Miu dress beneath a sleek black coat, striking a balance between understated elegance and effortless cool.\n\nTall black boots elongated the silhouette, while a glossy patent-leather bag added a more playful touch.\n\nBessette-Kennedy effortlessly blended elegance and simplicity in her fashion, becoming one of the decade's most recognizable style icons.\n\nThere's no arguing that Bessette-Kennedy, through her iconic minimalist style, made a lasting impact on the fashion world. She showed that while fast-fashion trends come and go, simple elegance lasts forever.",

    "description": "Tesla said it only hired US-based human helpers to assist its robotaxis, after Waymo came under fire for using remote workers in the Philippines.",
    "fullText": "Tesla and Waymo's battle to win the robotaxi race is getting catty.\n\nIn regulatory comments published on Wednesday, Tesla said it only hired US-based human helpers to assist its robotaxis when they get stuck, after Waymo came under fire for using remote workers in the Philippines to guide their autonomous vehicles out of sticky situations.\n\nThe two robotaxi rivals have been engaged in regulatory sniping as they jockey to shape California's new autonomous vehicle regulations.\n\nIn comments submitted to the state's Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday, Tesla referred to the December 2025 San Francisco power outage that left some Waymo vehicles stranded in traffic.\n\nWaymo later said the blackout caused a spike in requests from its robotaxis to the company's remote assistance (RA) team, who assist the company's robotaxis when they get into unusual situations. The surge in requests ultimately overwhelmed the system, Waymo said.\n\nIn its comments to California regulators, Tesla said its ride-hailing service in the state — which uses human drivers overseeing the automaker's Full Self-Driving software — was not impacted by the outage.\n\nTesla said that the Waymo shutdown raised \"important questions\" over the reliability of robotaxi fleets, adding that all of its remote robotaxi operators are based in the US.\n\n\"Tesla is working to ensure that its autonomous technology is developed, manufactured, and supported in the US,\" the company said.\n\nTesla added that domestically-based remote operators are more familiar with local road rules, more reliable at intervening when robotaxis run into trouble, have superior \"network connectivity,\" and are less vulnerable to cybersecurity threats.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment. Waymo declined to comment.\n\nWaymo has faced significant heat in recent weeks over its practice of employing remote workers to assist its autonomous vehicles, a common practice in the robotaxi industry.\n\nIn a Senate hearing earlier this month, Waymo chief safety officer Mauricio Peña was grilled by Sen. Ed Markey over the hiring of remote workers in the Philippines to assist its robotaxis in difficult situations, which Markey called \"unacceptable\" and suggested could pose safety and cybersecurity issues.\n\nWaymo defended its remote assistant program in a letter to Markey sent on Tuesday.\n\nIn the letter, Waymo said its RA agents do not directly drive their robotaxis but only provide \"advice and support\" when the self-driving system encounters a driving situation it can't handle.\n\nThe company said it had around 70 RA agents on duty at any given time, with half based in the US and half in the Philippines.\n\nWaymo added that its agents in the Philippines are required to have a local driver's license and receive training in US road laws, and said that more complex driving scenarios are handled exclusively by a specialist team based in the US.\n\nThe Google-backed robotaxi firm has continued to face pressure from lawmakers over its foreign remote assistance teams. On Monday, House Rep. Earl Carter sent a letter to Transport Secretary Sean Duffy calling for an investigation into robotaxi companies using \"foreign-based Remote Assistance Operators.\"\n\nWaymo and Tesla are racing to roll out robotaxis in a host of US cities this year. Waymo recently announced plans to test its vehicles in Sacramento and Boston, while Tesla began offering autonomous rides without a safety driver in Austin last month and has begun production of its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi, which does not have a steering wheel or pedals.",

    "title": "This over-the-toilet shelf transformed my tiny bathroom without a remodel",
    "description": "My tiny bathroom lacked storage. Umbra's Bellwood Over-the-Toilet Shelf adds extra space without remodeling and looks stylish.",
    "fullText": "When I bought my first home nearly five years ago, I spent a lot of time planning out the living areas and bedrooms. The bathrooms, however, were somewhat of an afterthought — especially my half bath. Primarily used by guests, the previous owners renovated it prior to selling with a new countertop and mosaic wall tiles. I liked the look and simply added a towel on a hanging rack and called it a day.\n\nBut as time went on, I realized this room was lacking. The sink's open-format design lacked cabinetry or storage of any kind, and the bathroom itself seemed unfinished, despite its diminutive size. Eager for a fix that didn't involve remodeling, I gave Umbra's Bellwood Over-the-Toilet Shelf a try.\n\nI couldn't be happier with the results.\n\nAs a mom of two managing a busy household — and a freelance writer who specializes in testing and reviewing many home and furniture products — I found it to be an excellent solution for adding shelving in a small space without spending thousands of dollars or ripping out walls. Better yet, it was easy to assemble and elevated the entire look of my bathroom. I only wish I hadn't waited five years to try it.\n\nUmbra's Bellwood shelf is a sleek, stylish storage solution for small bathrooms.\n\nThe last time I used an over-the-toilet storage rack was in college. One narrow bathroom counter wasn't going to cut it with four girls, and we picked up a cheap metal rack that I happily parted ways with after graduation. Far from what I used in my undergrad days, Umbra's Bellwood Shelf offers a grown-up solution to the storage space problem.\n\nThe shelf arrived in a box that was taller than me — at 5'7,'' I estimated that the shipment stood around 6 feet tall. It was packaged efficiently, with each piece packed tightly in cardboard or styrofoam. Nothing arrived broken or scratched.\n\nI decided to challenge myself to build the shelf in the approximately 30 to 40 minutes I had between my husband leaving to pick up our kids from school and returning home. At that point, my task would assuredly turn into pure chaos.\n\nI opened the box to find multiple planks of wood, 10 bags of small tools and parts, and only one page of slightly vague, image-led directions. I immediately worried I should have kicked the job off earlier.\n\nFortunately, my pangs of regret were unnecessary. Once I understood the gist of the directions and got going, things moved quickly. I'm not the most handy person, and usually leave heavy assembly to my husband, yet I only experienced a single hiccup while building the shelf. .\n\nAll in, from opening the box to standing back to admire my work took 40 minutes — and successfully before my kids got home.\n\nBefore adding the shelf, I had no storage in this bathroom. Zero. Zip.\n\nThe exposed piping under the sink counter and the fact that my bathroom was oddly shaped with one slanted wall had me scratching my head for solutions. I could have inserted a slim storage caddy with drawers or a cart with shelves next to the toilet, but it felt like too much of a squeeze.\n\nThat's why this shelf is such a unicorn.\n\nIt helped me to add storage in a small space where it completely didn't exist previously, while also working well in an awkwardly-shaped area. Everything was added vertically, leaving the bathroom feeling clean and uncluttered.\n\nPlus, over-the-toilet shelves are widely recommended by interior designers, who agree they fit well over any standard toilet without taking up additional room. As such, I think the Umbra Bellwood is a great choice for anyone who wants to add space-saving storage in bathrooms that have tight nooks or untraditionally-shaped dimensions.\n\nOnce the Bellwood shelf was in place, it felt like my bathroom had been missing a vital piece for five years. The light natural wood was nearly identical to my countertop and took the bathroom from stark to styled. On top of the three wooden tiers, I added a long, leafy plant for a burst of color, as well as candles and a basket filled with toilet rolls and miscellaneous small items, which had previously been positioned next to the sink.\n\nInitially, I worried that adding an open shelf might introduce clutter without the safety of cabinet doors to hide behind. But adding these select pieces felt curated and transformed the space into something that looked like it was created by a designer — except I didn't hire one. Nor did I have to take on any pricey remodeling to add cabinetry.\n\nWhile I have noticed that the legs wobble a tad, everything has stayed in place. Overall, the shelf feels pretty sturdy, with each shelf capable of holding 29 pounds. According to Umbra, the shelf is sourced from a combination of \"renewable wood sources\" as opposed to 100% solid wood. Despite being made from MDF, it's sturdier than you might think.\n\nWhile I didn't initially plan to place a shelf in my bathroom — evidenced by the five years I neglected the room, despite it being a high-traffic area for guests — I'm so glad I did. I just wish I had added it sooner.\n\nI'm in love with the overall style of my bathroom, and the fact that I finally have a designated place to store toilet paper rolls, toiletries, and anything else without adding cabinets or crowding the sink with bulky baskets is an added bonus. I also think the shelves offer ample space to add items without appearing cluttered.\n\nWhile the natural wood color was a great fit for my bathroom, I also appreciate that it's available in a darker walnut shade. The classic, slightly rustic hue will add versatility for many home styles. Overall, this shelf is a great choice for anyone looking to quickly add storage and maximize a small bathroom without spending a ton of money",

    "description": "Everyone talks about the challenges empty nest parents face, but no one talks about the youngest kid left behind. I'm worried for my daughter.",
    "fullText": "I'm in the middle of what feels like a long transition period.\n\nOne of my four kids is a young adult who has already moved out on his own. Another one of them graduates this year and will likely move away to college. Another opted for a community college but plans to move out in the next few years.\n\nI've been thinking about what I want my life to look like when I become an empty nester. I've already been making changes — like trying to make some new friends — with that life in mind.\n\nBut recently, it hit me that my youngest daughter will probably have some similar \"empty nest\" feelings when she's the last sibling stuck at home with her parents.\n\nAs the youngest of four, my daughter probably hasn't known a totally peaceful day since she arrived home from the hospital.\n\nShe was the travel baby — waking up in her infant seat to discover she'd been carted to a school play, T-ball practice, or school pickup. She had built-in playmates right from the start, though, of course, they bickered and fought like any other siblings.\n\nSince I was a stay-at-home mom, even when her brothers and sister were in school, she was always going somewhere. We headed to the library, to storytime, or out hiking in the mornings because neither of us liked being stuck at home.\n\nAnd now, when all of my kids are teens or young adults leading busy lives, we still have noisy dinners or pile on the couch together to unwind with a TV show before bed. Our house is still pretty active, and her siblings might take her on a coffee run or to the thrift store on a Saturday to hang out.\n\nIt seems likely that my daughter will have some time living with just me and her dad after everyone else has moved out. I can't even comprehend what that will be like.\n\nThe thought of just one child here at every dinnertime or weekend? We haven't had that in 20 years.\n\nBut it goes beyond just the fact that the house will be quieter. She tells her sister about school drama, and they hash things out together. Her brother jokes around with her, or they talk about mutual friends and after-school activities. They're involved in her life in ways that I can't be, and I think she's going to be lonely when they're not there.\n\nI wanted advice from an expert on all of this, so I spoke with child therapist Alisha Simpson-Watt of Collaborative ABA Services. She told me that yes, the transition can be hard for some kids.\n\n\"Siblings often serve as companions, role models, and sources of emotional support. When that daily interaction changes, younger children may experience feelings of loss, loneliness, or uncertainty,\" Simpson-Watt told me.\n\nShe also said younger kids can get clingy, moody, or anxious when a sibling moves out. The best thing parents can do for their younger kids is to prepare them and communicate a lot.\n\nMy daughter is older, but I know she'll still need some extra attention, and we'll need to communicate well with her. We'll also need to be ready to listen to her.\n\nSimpson-Watt said, \"Research consistently shows that children who feel heard and supported during family transitions demonstrate stronger emotional adjustment.\"\n\nWe may be missing the other family members, but we'll have time to spend together as a smaller family. Simpson-Watt also said it's important to continue with our regular family routines to give everyone a sense of stability and security.\n\nI'll encourage my daughter to keep up her relationships with her siblings, even if they're not physically here as much. When my oldest son moved out, we all stayed in touch with texts and phone calls. He only lives about an hour away, so we also see him often, which has helped with the transition.\n\nIn fact, my husband and I were out of town one weekend, and my son invited his siblings over for dinner. He cooked for them, they played games, and they all watched the Grammys together. I was kind of sorry I missed it, to be honest. But it makes me very happy to know that my kids are forging relationships with each other that go beyond my husband and me.",

    "fullText": "Ryan Cohen seems to be doing his best Warren Buffett impression, just like Michael Burry suggested.\n\nThe billionaire GameStop CEO and Chewy cofounder channeled the legendary investor in a lengthy X post titled \"The Hollow Men\" on Wednesday.\n\nCohen railed against a \"new, parasitic class of corporate bureaucrat: The Risk-Free Insider.\"\n\nHe lambasted independent directors who don't dare rock the boat and risk losing their cushy, well-paid jobs.\n\nHe berated corporate bosses who balk at tying their fortunes to their company's success — they collect big bonuses if its stock price rises, and receive huge payouts if they tank the business and leave.\n\nHe also chastised managers who avoid accountability by hiring expensive consultants to blame if things don't work out.\n\nCohen labeled those three groups the \"hollow men of the boardroom\" who \"wear the right suits\" and \"say the right buzzwords\" but have little skin in the game.\n\nRisking your own bottom line is the \"only thing that keeps a business honest,\" Cohen wrote. He called for a return to an \"owner's mentality,\" where bosses treat shareholders' money as if it were their own.\n\nHe warned that failure to change would mean \"iconic American franchises hollowed out by fees, managed for the benefit of the Insiders, while the true owners — the shareholders — are left holding the bag.\"\n\nRyan has rougher edges than Buffett, but that just makes him more modern in approach. https://t.co/p0R06M2Ojr\n\nBurry shared Cohen's post and wrote: \"Ryan has rougher edges than Buffett, but that just makes him more modern in approach.\"\n\nThe investor-turned-writer of \"The Big Short\" fame and GameStop shareholder has been touting the opportunity for Cohen to transform GameStop through acquisitions, drawing parallels to how Buffett reshaped Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile mill into a $1 trillion conglomerate over six decades.\n\nBuffett, who recently stepped down as Berkshire's CEO, has frequently taken aim at crony directors, overpaid executives, and costly consultants.\n\nIn his shareholder letter for 2019, he bemoaned that many independent directors don't spend a penny of their own money on shares of the companies they're overseeing — and high fees heavily incentivize them to be compliant in the hope of landing additional, lucrative board seats.\n\n\"When seeking directors, CEOs don't look for pit bulls,\" Buffett wrote. \"It's the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.\"\n\nBuffett joked that he was the \"Typhoid Mary of compensation committees,\" as he'd only ever been appointed to one despite sitting on 18 different boards up to that point.\n\nTime and again, Buffett has espoused an owner's mentality, underpinned by having more than 99% of his net worth in Berkshire stock.\n\n\"We want to make money only when our partners do and in exactly the same proportion,\" he and the late Charlie Munger wrote in their \"Owner's Manual\" for Berkshire shareholders.\n\n\"Moreover, when I do something dumb, I want you to be able to derive some solace from the fact that my financial suffering is proportional to yours,\" Buffett added.\n\nCohen has diverged from Buffett's playbook in some ways, such as buying bitcoin for GameStop last year, and recently agreeing a compensation package worth tens of billions if he hits certain market-value and profit milestones.\n\nBut he's also refused a salary as GameStop CEO, built a roughly 9% stake in the video-game retailer, urged frugality across the business, and even modeled its investor-relations website on Berkshire's homepage.\n\nCohen's tirade against the \"Risk-Free Insider\" is certainly rooted in Buffett's philosophy too, even if he's harsher in his wording as Burry said.",

    "description": "Richard Boccato turned his bartending career into a successful, multimillion-dollar ice business serving top NYC bars and restaurants.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Richard Boccato, owner and operator of Hundredweight Ice in Queens, New York City. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor years, I made my living bartending in New York City. I recognized early on that ice was perhaps the most important and overlooked ingredient in the modern cocktail.\n\nIf you're going to take measures to use fresh ingredients, squeeze your juice à la minute (just before serving), make your syrups in-house, procure the finest spirits, and then marry all of that to an inferior quality of frozen water, it would amount to a fool's errand in the glass, especially in exchange for top American dollar.\n\nThat said, never, at any point when I was bartending, would I have imagined that I would one day be a business owner of an ice company. My path to becoming an ice man began with a freezer full of rust-colored ice.\n\nWhile bartending at two of the best bars in New York City, I was fortunate to rise through the ranks enough that the owner of those bars asked me if I wanted to go into business with him and open a bar together. We called it Dutch Kills.\n\nWhen the day came to get ready to open Dutch Kills for the first time in 2009, I opened the chest freezer and saw a rust-colored, reddish-brown block of cloudy ice. The pipes coming into the building were not suitable for the quality of water that I wanted to serve, so instead I decided to source crystal-clear blocks of ice from a local ice sculptor.\n\nCustomers were immediately impressed by the opulence, beauty, and clarity of the sourced ice. Ultimately, we were making enough money as a business that it seemed viable to reinvest some of it in our own ice block maker.\n\nAt the time, though, I was only interested in making enough ice for our bar, not starting a business with it. By 2011, however, word had gotten around about the quality of our drinks, and a lot of bars were interested in obtaining ice from us.\n\nI didn't have the money or the infrastructure to launch a cocktail ice business, but I decided to do it anyway. I called it Hundredweight Ice.\n\nThe way that we used to make our ice is vastly different from how we make it today.\n\nIn the early days, it was me, Pedro, my first full-time employee, and Ian, my business partner, in the back of Dutch Kills, breaking down 300-pound blocks of crystal-clear ice with chainsaws and finishing the cubes by creasing all six sides with clothing irons to achieve smooth surfaces and clean edges.\n\nObviously, our techniques and practices weren't sophisticated at all in the beginning. If I had been an outsider walking into the storage room of that bar and saw the setup we were working with, I'd have thought, \"These people have no chance of survival.\"\n\nMany of my industry peers and former co-workers did, in fact, tell me that I was crazy for thinking this would ever work.\n\nOver the years, we kept making ice and the business kept growing. I had to stop bartending and focus my attention on the ice business. At a certain point, it dawned on me that I wasn't a full-time bartender anymore. I was an ice man now, and that was somewhat of a difficult and unexpected career transition to accept, but it was also very empowering because it meant we had succeeded in doing what we had set out to do.\n\nWe were forced to move the ice business back into the back house of Dutch Kills. We struggled from ruin to recovery, and toward the end of 2021, we broke ground on a new warehouse just a stone's throw from the old one, which is still where we make our ice today — having just expanded to an additional 3,000 square feet next door.\n\nWe now deliver ice to over 20 Michelin-starred restaurants, and our clients in New York City number in the triple digits.\n\nIn 2025, our revenue was close to $3 million, and we are on track to significantly surpass that in 2026, with projected revenue of $3.5 million.\n\nWe start our days between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and finish by about 3 p.m. We cut about 15,000 2-inch cubes of ice per day and harvest over 3 million pounds of ice each year.\n\nThe investment is tremendous, but necessary to achieve the final product. For example, the upfront costs for some of the equipment include:\n\nOne thing we're proud of is that we haven't raised our prices a penny since 2017. A 50-pack of 2-inch cubes sells for $30. Logo cubes average about $100 per pack.\n\nThe only reason this company exists is because we wanted to make our cocktails at Dutch Kills the best they could be. I didn't expect that it would turn into the business that it is now.",

    "fullText": "The way one of OpenAI's biggest backers sees it, Sam Altman and his AI company are in possession of Tolkien's the One Ring — and that puts a target on their backs.\n\nJosh Kushner's firm, Thrive Capital, is one of OpenAI's biggest investors. Backing the high-flying tech AI startup has given him a front-row seat to how people behave when power and value become concentrated in a single company.\n\nIn a recently published interview with Colossus Magazine, recorded in October, Kushner reflected on the chaos surrounding the temporary ouster of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November 2023. The company's president, Greg Brockman, also briefly resigned during the incident.\n\n\"To use the Lord of the Rings analogy,\" Kushner said, \"Sam, Greg, OpenAI have the Ring, and everyone is willing to do whatever they can to take it.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he believes power corrupts, Kushner answered simply: \"Yes.\"\n\nKushner did not specify who he was referring to. Thrive Capital declined to comment further when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nBut the investor has previously described the immediate aftermath of Altman's firing on November 17, 2023, saying Thrive \"immediately went to war\" after learning of the decision.\n\n\"There is so much perception of power and value associated with this company,\" he told Colossus, saying he was \"very proud of how the company has handled itself, despite many people not acting in as appropriate ways.\"\n\nAltman was reinstated days later following pressure from employees and investors, in one of the most dramatic governance crises in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"During that crazy week where I got fired and rehired, he just put his entire life on hold,\" OpenAI's CEO told the magazine about Kushner.\n\nKushner founded Thrive Capital in 2009. The firm has backed companies including Instagram, Stripe, Robinhood, Instacart, and OpenAI, and recently closed a $10 billion fund heavily focused on AI.\n\nHe is also the younger brother of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, and is married to supermodel Karlie Kloss. His estimated net worth sits at $5.2 billion, according to Forbes.",

    "description": "Russia is using makeshift defenses to protect energy infrastructure from Ukrainian attacks, but the latest attack suggests they don't always work.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian drones struck a Russian oil depot overnight, breaking through the netting that had been installed earlier to protect the site from such attacks, a security official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nLong-range Ukrainian drones struck an oil depot in Velikiye Luki, a city in western Russia's Pskov region, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.\n\nThe source said protective anti-drone nets had been stretched above fuel tanks at the oil depot. The facility belongs to the company Pskovnefteproduct and is located nearly 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The nets were unable to prevent the strike from doing damage, the source added.\n\nSatellite imagery captured in December by US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and analyzed by Business Insider, shows what appears to be anti-drone netting covering roughly 15 tanks at the depot in Velikiye Luki.\n\nSeveral explosions and a large fire were reported at the oil facility, the source said, citing local channels on the Telegram messaging app. Video footage shared on social media shows a massive blaze burning through a structure resembling anti-drone netting.\n\nThis kind of netting has been spotted at other oil facilities in Russia in recent months. The tactic underscores how the country is turning to crude-looking, improvised defenses to protect energy infrastructure from ongoing Ukrainian attacks.\n\n\"Vietnam, run!\" - overnight, drones from the Special Operations Center \"Alpha\" of the Security Service of Ukraine successfully struck the Velikolukskaya oil depot. A large fire broke out at the site. Anti-drone nets had been stretched over the fuel storage tanks, but they did not… pic.twitter.com/bLBxuHNxtm\n\nConcerns over the high drone saturation have led to similar measures on the battlefield.\n\nAnti-drone netting is common near the front lines. Ukrainian soldiers are using this material to cover critical logistics routes. And both militaries have added cage-like fencing to their armored vehicles to protect against drones.\n\nAdditionally, Russia has also installed makeshift defenses, such as large, floating barriers, to protect its ports from the Ukrainian naval drones that have wreaked havoc on its Black Sea Fleet.\n\nThe Ukrainian attack on Wednesday night marked Kyiv's latest deep-strike drone operation against the vast Russian energy sector, a major source of revenue that fuels Moscow's ongoing war efforts.\n\n\"The SBU continues to work methodically on facilities that provide the Russian army with fuel,\" the security source said in a translated statement.\n\n\"The destruction of oil depots directly affects the enemy's ability to conduct combat operations, advance and transfer reserves. Such operations are an element of the systematic weakening of the military potential of the Russian Federation,\" they added.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to a request for comment on the attack. Moscow said its air defenses shot down roughly 300 Ukrainian drones over the past 24 hours.\n\nSince last August, Ukraine has been intensifying its long-range drone attacks on Russia's energy sector, targeting oil refineries, terminals, tankers, and platforms at sea. Kyiv has described the deep-strike campaign as its way of imposing \"long-range sanctions\" on Moscow.\n\nMany of these attacks — at least four in the past week, including the most recent strike — have been carried out by the SBU's Alpha group, an elite unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces. Its personnel have also been involved in ground operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has significantly stepped up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure this winter compared to previous years of the war.\n\nSince October, Ukrainian energy facilities have been the main target of Russian barrages, Britain's defense ministry said on Thursday.\n\nRussia has launched more than 20,000 drones, and its aircraft have fired over 300 missiles, \"in attempts to systematically destroy Ukraine's electrical grid and heat generation capacity,\" the ministry said in an intelligence update.",

    "fullText": "Claire Danes is grieving mother and author Aggie Wiggs; struggling with her next book, she decides to focus it on her neighbor—which is obviously a good idea, even more so because he was accused of murdering his first wife. What could go wrong? Matthew Rhys plays Nile Jarvis, the maybe-murderer neighbor, who gets caught up in the mix when Abbie's story becomes about way more than just one death. You can stream The Beast in Me on Netflix, and then check out some of these other shows about deadly secrets, vicious lies, and phenomenally bad decisions.\n\nIn a similar \"am I just being paranoid?\" vein, The Girlfriend stars Robin Wright as Laura Sanderson, a wealthy art gallery owner in London. Her son (Laurie Davidson) brings home a new, working-class girlfriend, Cherry Laine (Olivia Cooke) who immediately strikes Laura as not-our-kind. But is there more to it? Can someone with the name \"Cherry Laine\" truly be trusted? There's definitely something off, and we're kept guessing as to whether or not this is the story of a dangerous con artist or an overbearing mom—or maybe a little of each. It was released as a miniseries, but there's some interest in continuing the story, so TBD on a second season. Stream The Girlfriend on Prime Video.\n\nThere's a theme in these shows about the extent to which women can trust their own instincts—this one cuts to the heart of that in the story of Sophie Ellis (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who survives an (apparent) attempt at death by suicide to find that she's lost huge chunks of memory. She settles back into life with her husband, but learns that she'd been having an affair. And that her husband might have been embezzling money, among other things, though it all turns on how much she can trust the men in her life and her own fragmented memories, questions which lead her to take on an entirely new identity and sort it all out. Stream Surface on Apple TV+.\n\nBased on a Harlan Coben novel, Fool Me Once is a bit more on the political-thriller end of whatever spectrum we're on here, but the vibes aren't dissimilar: Michelle Keegan plays Maya Stern, a former special ops pilot dealing with the murder of her husband—whom she then catches playing with their daughter on a nanny cam. The resulting mystery ties into the earlier death of her sister, and leads to a web of conspiracy involving her husband's family and a shady pharmaceutical company. Stream Fool Me Once on Netflix.\n\nCreated, written, and directed by four-time Oscar winner Alfonso Cuarón, Disclaimer has as impressive a pedigree as you could hope for on streaming TV. Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline (both, incidentally, Oscar winners) star alongside Sacha Baron Cohen and Leila George. Blanchett plays Catherine Ravenscroft, an award-winning journalist who receives a mysterious manuscript—a novel in which she, herself, appears to be the main character, and which reveals secrets of her past that she thought were long buried. Stream Disclaimer on Apple TV+.\n\nAuthor on the hunt for a new story that leads her into danger and treachery? Check. In this adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel, Amy Adams stars as Camille Preaker, a troubled reporter with substance abuse issues who's only recently been released from a psychiatric hospital. I'm not sure what step of recovery involves returning to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri in order to investigate the murder of one girl and the apparently related disappearance of another—all under the watchful, critical eye of her socialite mother Adora (Patricia Clarkson). Stream Sharp Objects on HBO Max.\n\nThe first of at least three Alice Feeney thrillers getting streaming series adaptations, His & Hers is a glossy and appropriately twisty mystery starring Tessa Thompson and Jon Bernthal. Thompson plays Annie Andrews, a has-been news reporter who decides to get back on the horse when she learns of a murder in her Georgia hometown. Bernthal is the local detective on the case and—surprise!—he's also her ex. Can she trust him? Things are definitely going to get personal. Stream His & Hers on Netflix.\n\nThe genre here isn't quite the same as that of The Beast in Me—this one's more of a detective story with some spy stuff thrown in. Where there's overlap, though, is in its protagonist: a woman who dives into a mystery without understanding quite how deep and dark and personal things are going to get. Ruth Wilson plays Sarah Trafford, a married art restorer who nobody takes very seriously (including her husband), even after she becomes invested in the fate of a young girl whose family is killed in an (allegedly) accidental gas explosion down the street. Emma Thompson co-stars as hard-living, hard-drinking private investigator Zoë Boehm, who gets involved, rather against her will. The orphaned girl disappears into the system, and no one really seems to care until Sarah hires Zoë and her husband to look into it. Both women soon find they are in way over their heads, as the missing girl points to a much broader conspiracy. Stream Down Cemetery Road on Apple TV+.\n\nAny psychological thriller worth your time is going to swing for the fences—big twists are the essential ingredients in all of these shows. And then there's Behind Her Eyes, which builds to a climax so cuckoo bananas that you'll either applaud its audacity or cackle at its outrageousness. Louise (Simona Brown) is a single mother who starts an affair with her boss—and his wife. And then gets involved with his former mistress following a mysterious death. It all turns on the increasingly complicated set of relationships before it gets really wild. Stream Behind Her Eyes on Netflix.\n\nDavid E. Kelley brought us this twisty psychodrama (adapted from the Jean Hanff Korelitz bestseller You Should Have Known) starring Nicole Kidman as Grace Fraser, a Manhattan psychologist married to oncologist Jonathan (Hugh Grant). She keeps running into a woman named Elena whose increasingly strange behavior disturbs Grace, more so when the woman is murdered. Things get really alarming, though, when she tries to contact Jonathan, who's disappeared, leading her into a web of secrets in lies that are entirely too close to home. Stream The Undoing on HBO Max.\n\nSmart and addictive, Smother starts with a body on a beach and then flashes back to a 50th birthday party for Val (Dervla Kirwan) hosted by her husband, Denis. That celebration takes a turn when Denis announces, in front of their kids and assorted guests, that he and Val are getting a divorce and that she's going to live with her rather much younger boyfriend, who Denis tacitly threatens. Naturally, it's Denis whose body we saw earlier, and, while there a lot of people with motives, Val is determined to get to the bottom of it. Stream Smother on Peacock.\n\nA bit of counter-programming here, perhaps, in that we're traveling back to the Jazz Age for an explicitly Agatha Christie-style detective story. And yet! Mia McKenna-Bruce's Bundle Brent has a lot in common with the modern-era women in the rest of these shows: She's smart, curious, and surrounded by men (mostly) looking to gaslight the hell out of her. Bundle lives with her mother (Helena Bonham-Carter) in a decaying manor house that they rent out to pay the bills. A party hosted by a steel magnate ends with one of the guests dead—a friend who'd been hinting all night that he planned to propose to Bundle but, according to the police and pretty much everyone else, he died by suicide. Nothing to do but move on. She doesn't, of course, and manages to convince Christie mainstay Superintendent Battle (Martin Freeman) that there might be more to it, especially when things start to tie back to the death of her father years earlier. Stream Agatha Christie's Seven Dials on Netflix.\n\nJennifer Garner stars as Hannah Hall, a successful woodturner (which, I've learned, is a thing) trying to forge a bond with her stepdaughter—in order to help solve the mystery of her missing husband. The standalone first season ranked as Apple's most watched limited series ever, so we're getting a second based on another bestseller from Laura Dave. Stream The Last Thing He Told Me on Apple TV+.",

    "fullText": "Hulu doesn't always get the recognition of competitors like Netflix and Max, but the streamer has an unfailingly reliable and rotating selection of theatrical films, as well as some impressive original releases. These are some of the best, buzziest, and/or most fun movies currently streaming on the service, across a variety of genres.\n\nMike Flanagan (Doctor Sleep, Midnight Mass) returns to Stephen King with a twist: This is a sweet fairy tale about the life of the title's Chuck (Tom Hiddleston), told in reverse chronological order from his deathbed at the end of the universe. It's said of a lot of movies, but critics really were divided on this one: It made several major best of the year lists, while Variety called it the worst. Now's your chance to decide for yourself. Stream The Life of Chuck.\n\nThere have been innumerable takes on the classic 1932 film, all of them wildly different and some of them even good—but none have had quite the pop-culture presence of this wild entertaining adventure film/global bisexual awakening. Brendan Fraser stars as treasure hunter with Rachel Weisz as librarian Evelyn Carnahan, each on the hunt for a golden book that will inadvertently awaken the ancient mummy Imhotep. The critics weren't thrilled, but the movie's had impressive legs; a fourth entry (not including spin-offs) is coming in 2028. Stream The Mummy.\n\nFollowing up his 2021 masterpiece Summer of Soul, Questlove turns his camera toward Sly Stone, pioneer of psychedelic soul and the funk sound that changed the American music scene in the '60s and '70s. Questlove parallels the early days of Sly and the Family Stone with the most hopeful era of the Civil Rights movement, the band reflecting the positive vibes that dissipated with the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the more necessarily militant rise of Black Power. That's the moment, the documentary suggests, when the band started to lose its moorings, becoming increasingly erratic and unproductive as broader processes seemed to fade. The doc isn't afraid to confront the shortcomings of Sly himself, even as it celebrates the man and the music. Stream Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius).\n\nImagine Trainspotting-era Danny Boyle making an Elizabethtown-style romcom, except it's actually good, and you'll have a fairly accurate idea of what to expect from the charming debut film from director Raine Allen-Miller, who captures the grit of South London with an eye toward its candy-colored beauty. Two mid-20s South Londoners meet shortly after each has suffered a bad breakup; they proceed to help one another get over their respective exes, and I'm sure you see where this is going, but you'll be smiling the entire way. Stream Rye Lane.\n\nWho needs dialogue when you have a movie this simple and effective? A shy and lonely dog in New York City finds himself a robot companion, the two becoming utterly inseparable—until they're separated. Beautifully animated, the movie is cute and frequently very funny, but also isn't afraid to go deep and dark. Grab a hankie. In an entertainment era that's so wildly nostalgia-driven, the movie's message about the inevitability of change is refreshing. Moving forward is hard, sometimes heartbreaking—but so often necessary and worth it. Stream Robot Dreams.\n\nWriter/director Emilie Blichfeldt's satirical dark fantasy didn't do much business at the box office, but earned plenty of critical praise, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Makeup and Hairstyling Award. Lea Myren plays Elvira, eldest daughter of a widow who has big plans for her \"plain\" child: She'll marry her off to a prince, but not before subjecting her to an increasingly grotesque series of cosmetic procedures to mold her into someone else's idea of pretty. Stream The Ugly Stepsister on Hulu.\n\nThe latest in a trio of outstanding Predator movies from Dan Trachtenberg (beginning with Prey), Elle Fanning as a a damaged Weyland-Yutani Corporation android who joins forces with Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), an outcast Yautja (meaning: Predator) to survive a dangerous planet, each with something to prove. As a warm-up, there's also the lushly animated Killer of Killers, telling three distinct stories across three different time periods: the first sees a Viking warrior and her son leading an army against a rival clan, the second sees a hunter standing between rival sons of a samurai warlord in 1609 Japan, while the third involves a WWII dogfight with an unexpected rival. Stream Predator: Badlands.\n\nThis is based on a true story of father and son “sovereign citizens” who shot and killed police officers in 2010. Nick Offerman gives a full-throated and brilliantly chilling performance as Jerry Kane, a minor celebrity in right-wing circles possessed of nearly as much charisma as rage. He's decided that the government is illegitimate, as are all of his bills, and he's brought his shy and quiet son Jerry (Jacob Tremblay) along with him. Dennis Quaid plays the local police chief whose path they're about to cross, but the harrowing film absolutely belongs to Offerman, who's terrifying. Stream Sovereign.\n\nThe plot here isn't terribly complicated: Struggling singer-songwriter Dandelion (Kiki Layne) is in a downward spiral when she meets Casey (Thomas Doherty), a Scottish musician who's all but given up. As Dandelion warms up to Casey and his scruffy crew, she begins to rediscover a love for her art. Where the movie stands out is in the vulnerable performances, but especially in the direction of Nicole Riegel, who carefully crafts a believable, fully realized relationship largely out of scenes in which music is more important than dialogue. Stream Dandelion.\n\nSomething of a companion piece to The Substance, in that both films star Hollywood icons and deal with women paying a price for daring to age, The Last Showgirl's wistful, more down-to-Earth tone provides a brilliant showcase for lead Pamela Anderson. She plays Shelly Gardner, a Las Vegas showgirl with a three-decade career who finds herself at loose ends when the revue in which she stars closes. It's easily one of 2024's best performances. Stream The Last Showgirl.\n\nA box office flop that deserved much better, Ridley Scott's epic adapts a nonfiction work by Eric Jager involving a trial, by combat, in medieval France between Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) and Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) following the rape of Jean's wife, Marguerite (Jodie Comer). Scott cleverly approaches the story as a European Rashomon, with the story presented from the different points of view of each man, before we get the full picture from Marguerite's perspective. History, and the players in the duel, might not have cared about that point of view, but Scott and the film do. Stream The Last Duel.\n\nSpeaking of Ridley Scott, he came onboard as a producer for this underworld crime drama from Indian filmmaker Shyam Madiraju as a means of making sure that the movie received the widest release possible. The title refers to orphaned teenage pickpocket Pachpan, under the heel of the Fagin-esque local Mumbai gang lord who refers to the children who do his bidding only by numbers—55, in Pachpan's case. Stealing a wallet full of money, Pachpan visits the home of its owner, only to discover that his actions have consequences beyond a simple theft. Stream 55.\n\nA surprisingly sweet coming-of-age comedy, given that it's about a young woman who wants to learn how to 69 (a sex position you might have heard of). Sam Morelos stars as Abby Flores, a popular game streamer who's shy in public and who hides her identity online. In her senior year of high school, she's ready to come out of her shell and hopes to make a play for Max, the guy she's had a crush on for years. With no sexual experience (and little social experience), she visits a local strip club and makes friends with dancer Santa Monica (Chloe Fineman), whom she'll pay to be her sex and confidence coach. Despite her outward demeanor, Santa Monica isn't entirely feeling like a success herself; it turns out that the mismatched pals have a lot in common and a lot to teach each other. It's a solid directorial debut from SNL writer Jillian Bell. Stream Summer of 69.\n\nWriter/director Sean Baker (Tangerine, Red Rocket) has a long list of impressive film credits to his name, but comedy/drama Anora was the film that put him firmly into the mainstream, winning him a Best Director Oscar and the film a Best Picture prize. Mikey Madison (who also won Best Actress) plays the title's Anora, an exotic dancer whose life changes when she falls in love with the son of a Russian oligarch. It's all going very well until his parents show up to get their impromptu wedding annulled. Stream Anora.\n\nDirector William Kaufman (Sinners and Saints, Daylight's End) is a master of this type of cheapie military action thriller (the posters are always muscular guys with guns aimed roughly in your face), and that's not a bad thing if you're in the right mood. This one puts a sci-fi spin on the formula, as a special forces team operating in Uzbekistan is captured by a group of Predator-esque aliens who came to Earth to sample the local cuisine (i.e., us). Luckily, they meet Anya (Linda Hamilton), a woman who's managed to survive the aliens for 20 years or so and has a plan—one that, you won't be surprised to learn, involves a ton of explosives. Stream Osiris.\n\nOne of those great Soul Food/Steel Magnolia-style tearjerkers, The Supremes stars Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Sanaa Lathan, and Uzo Aduba as three middle-aged friends who've been through the wringer together. Following the three virtually from birth, we find them facing a seemingly endless number of twists and turns (unplanned pregnancy, cancer, alcoholism, and more) with a lot of heart and plenty of humor. Stream The Supremes at Earl's All-You-Can-Eat.\n\nThis delightful indie comedy stars the brilliant nonagenarian June Squibb (Nebraska) as Thelma Post, a woman living alone in Los Angeles—she's got a good relationship with her grandson, but finds his doting a bit much. Still, when a phone scammer cheats her our of $10,000 by claiming that Danny's been arrested, she refuses to take it lying down. The police won't do anything, so she gets hold of old friend Ben (the late Richard Roundtree) and a gun, and the two set off on a scooter to track down the scammer and get a little revenge. It's funny, but never gratuitously silly, and Squibb and Roundtree make for a fabulous cinematic pairing. Stream Thelma.\n\nOz Perkins, who more recently directed the Stephen King adaptation The Monkey, is the driving force behind this horror thriller starring Maika Monroe as a young FBI agent hunting the menacing serial killer known as Longlegs (Nicholas Cage). The murderer's trail has gone cold, but Agent Harker's seeming clairvoyance has put the two on a collision course, even though there's no evidence the suspect was ever even present at the killings for which he's apparently responsible. Stylish and nerve-jangling, with a predictably unhinged performance from Cage, it's a real killer. Stream Longlegs.\n\nSpeaking of The Monkey: Here's another Oz Perkins movie, just as deranged as Longlegs, but much funnier—well, if a series of increasingly gory deaths is your idea of a hoot. Theo James plays twin brothers haunted by a series of tragedies that befell them as children: A wind-up toy monkey belonging to their father revealed itself to be both protective and mean, a wind of its key leading it to initiate elaborate, deadly, Final Destination-esque scenarios. They threw the monkey down a well as kids, but that monkey was absolutely not going to stay down the well. The movie is incredibly gory, but almost cartoonishly so, and hints of heart reveal themselves through The Monkey's sick sense of humor. Stream The Monkey.\n\nAnother multiple Oscar nominee (though it didn't take home any prizes), A Complete Unknown comes from director James Mangold, whose resume includes award-season faves like Ford v Ferrari, Wolverine and Indiana Jones franchise movies, and another Oscar-winning musical biopic, Walk the Line. In this one, Timothée Chalamet stars as Bob Dylan alongside Ed Norton as Pete Seeger, with the narrative rotating around the moment in 1965 when Dylan went electric, scandalizing the Newport Folk Festival and leading fans to question whether the voice of his generation had sold out. Stream A Complete Unknown.\n\nA queer, contemporary take on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Fire Island also takes aim at the overabundance of fat/femme/Asian stereotypes in the gay community. Social commentary aside, it's also a funny, smart romantic comedy with a great cast that includes Joel Kim Booster (in the Lizzy Bennett role—he also wrote the screenplay), Bowen Yang, Conrad Ricamora, and Margaret Cho as a group of friends who travel each summer to the titular island—but this summer proves more dramatic (and romantic) than most. Stream Fire Island.\n\nOne of the darkest (and funniest) satires of recent memory, Ruben Östlund's wild film feels like at least three movies in one, with narratives that take sharp right turns at unexpected moments, taking potshots at greed and skewering capitalism all the way. A memorable central section onboard a luxury cruise ship divided between the haves (passengers) and have-nots (the crew) climaxes in literal explosions of puke and shit. That's before a satisfying role-reversal inspired by Lord of the Flies. Brilliant and hilarious, if you've got the stomach for it. Stream Triangle of Sadness.\n\nSteven Soderbergh's found-footage-esque psychological horror film doesn't have a lot of big scares for most of its runtime, something that's helpful to know going in. Instead, this is largely a drama about a damaged family from the perspective of the title's presence: The Payne family moves into a new home that's already occupied, and everything that we see is from the spirit's curious POV. Though its motives are unclear, the presence takes a special interest in daughter Chloe (Callina Liang), who's suffered the deaths of multiple friends and might be open to malign influences both worldly and otherwise. It's rather wonderfully chilling. Stream Presence.\n\nAdapted from Claire Keegan's novella, Small Things Like These fictionally explores the real-life story and legacy of Ireland's Magdalene Laundries—a system of workhouses, run mostly by the Catholic Church and funded by the state, in which \"fallen women\" (broadly defined) would be involuntarily confined in order to provide cheap labor for the community. Children born to the confined women were typically put up for adoption at a profit for the institution. Here Cillian Murphy plays Bill Furlong, a quiet, unassuming coal merchant who witnesses things he ought not have, inadvertently running afoul of Sister Mary (Emily Watson)—she runs the local convent, as well as the school that Bill's five daughters attend, and she's all quiet menace in her implied threats. Absolutely chilling. Stream Small Things Like These.\n\nIt might seem excessively woke to acknowledge, in the year of our lord 2025, that Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, an astronaut and physicist, was also a gay woman in a 27-year-old relationship. But here we are. Ride felt that her work and career would suffer if she came out, and only did so less than a year before her 2012 death. Tam O'Shaughnessy, Ride's partner, provides the focus for this documentary that explores the trailblazer's work while also examining the personal and professional sacrifices that came as a result of needing to conceal so much of herself. Stream Sally.\n\nThe damn-near flawless evocation of 1970s talk show vibes gives Late Night much of its sense of purpose in the early going, before it gives way to a ghostly horror free-for-all in the back half. David Dastmalchian stars as the host of Night Owls with Jack Delroy, who spends his off hours at The Grove, an exclusive California spot for powerful men, and a place full of dark secrets. During a special Halloween broadcast in 1977, some of Jack's secrets are summoned into the open. Using found footage tricks—but not limited by them—it's a uniquely clever supernatural thriller. Stream Late Night with the Devil.\n\nDirected by Wim Wenders, Perfect Days represents a long-awaited narrative return to form for the director—it's easily a high point of his long film career, even with blessedly little plot to speak of. Kōji Yakusho plays Hirayama, a man in his 60s who follows the same routine every day: He wakes up in his modest apartment, grabs coffee from a vending machine, and sets out in his van to clean the public toilets of Tokyo. Perhaps it's a Japanese sensibility at play, but it's hard not to suspect that the American version of this film would come off as a melancholy tragedy; Hirayama's story, though, is joyful. It's a movie about appreciating the quiet beauty of everyday life, and the peace to be found in a beloved routing. It represents the first time that Japan ever submitted a film by a non-Japanese director for Oscar consideration. Stream Perfect Days.\n\nLike most of writer/director Park Chan-wook's films (which include Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, The Handmaiden), this one's tough to classify by genre. It alternately feels like a romance, a thriller, and a mystery—or all three at once. Insomniac detective Jang Hae-jun (Park Hae-il) doesn't miss a clue, until he starts to fall for (and then become obsessed with, Vertigo-style) a recently widowed woman (Tang Wei) who doesn't seem all that upset about her husband's seemingly accidental death. The mysterious and gorgeously directed film won Park Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival back in 2022. Stream Decision to Leave.\n\nIn 1998, Tomoaki Hamatsu was cast on the new Japanese reality show Susunu! Denpa Shōnen. He was challenged to stay alone in his apartment, with no food or clothing, and survive only on what he could win from magazine contests. At various points, he would survive on uncooked rice (having no pots), or on dog food, or on soda. His only companion was a stuffed animal that he won. The show went on for a year, and became one of the most popular shows on the air, unbeknownst to Hamatsu. This documentary explores our reality fixation from both sides, as well as exploring the long and difficult transition back to normal life for someone who didn't even know that he was a star. Stream The Contestant.\n\nA wonderfully atmospheric—and often genuinely scary—Irish horror import, the movie kicks off with a tense murder in a country house that raises a number of questions for the dead woman's twin sister—like, is the formal mental patient believed to have committed the murder actually the guilty party? There are some great twists and turns here and it genuinely sticks the landing, not a given even among great thrillers. Stream Oddity.",

    "description": "Bruce...",
    "fullText": "Jackson’s lessons for today’s Democrats.\n\nIn 2000, I got to spend some intense hours with Jesse Jackson, when he and his son Jesse Jackson Jr., then in Congress, collaborated with me on a book about capital punishment. Commitments across the country kept the elder Jackson constantly on the road, so I would grab writing time with him in hotel rooms, airport lounges, breakfast joints.\n\nIt was the Bush-Gore presidential election year, and virtually every time I arrived Jesse was working the phone. I got to overhear a strikingly different style of persuasion from that of the stentorian public orator I’d intermittently covered. Jesse’s off-camera political voice was generally forbearing: quietly connecting, humorously cajoling, deal-making with the artful rhythm and grace of a choreographer. Jesse held in his head a map of the nationwide grassroots Democratic Party: Which clergy could turn out the church buses in East St. Louis? Which banker could arrange a campaign donation in Des Moines? Which union local could swing Maryland? Jesse knew all the players, knew the tone and the particular words that would stir each one to action. He was the great Democratic national chairman we never had.\n\nFollowing Kamala Harris’s loss to Donald Trump, I thought often of Jesse’s relentlessly human-scale, ward-level organizing—especially when I looked at the 2024 election results in my own city of New Haven and realized just how dramatically Democratic turnout had fallen since 2020: another election lost, in the words of Jesse’s 1984 Democratic Convention speech, “by the margin of our despair.” Our present catastrophe is the sum total of tactics embraced by two generations of liberal campaign technocrats, their eyes on deep-pocket contributors and computer modeling, who willfully ignored the lessons of Jackson’s transformational and inclusive cross-class, cross-racial tree-shaking.\n\nJesse’s major-media obituaries make dutiful note of the complications and contradictions of his career. (The best assessment of much of the press coverage of his death can be found in Jesse’s own 1984 SNL opening monologue. Look it up.) But I’ve been thinking of the issues on which Jackson simply kept on keeping on, unshaken by shifts of political winds. One of them was capital punishment. By 2000, the Clinton administration had expanded the federal death penalty. Racially coded mandatory minimum sentences were adopted nationwide; criminal justice reform was dismissed, and soon September 11 would drive forward a new national race to the bottom in human rights. No politician had anything to gain then (or ever) from writing a book arguing for death-penalty abolition—let alone anything remotely like Jackson’s career-long investment of thousands of hours intervening for individual death-row prisoners in the US and overseas.\n\nJesse could read a room with extraordinary acuity. Like Babe Ruth pointing to the bleachers before hitting a home run, he would pick out which politician at a breakfast or rally was about to approach him for an autograph or a favor, and in my experience always called it right. But over those few months of our collaboration, I saw another side too: how on some days, just how hard it could be to be Jesse Jackson. He’d sometimes wake depleted, facing yet another 20-hour day, nerves abraded, circles under his eyes. His aides would coax him back into his suit and tie. But then he would step into the hotel hallway and instantly resume the job of being Jesse Jackson. He’d perfected this skill at instant transformation for the benefit of the chambermaid or porter who—every day, no matter where he was staying—would almost immediately approach him to share a moment of grace: a word or a touch or blessing from the man who had urged them to say aloud, “I am somebody.”",

    "description": "Jamal...",
    "fullText": "Using an old playbook with powerful new tools, it may be closer than ever to turning a US–Iran war into reality.\n\nAs President Trump continues assembling an “armada” in the Middle East, decades of political efforts to maneuver the United States into war with Iran may finally be coming to fruition. Yet rather than delivering “help” to Iranians in the form of American bombs—and pulling the US into a potentially open-ended conflict that many experts say would make the invasion of Iraq look like a cakewalk—Trump has, for now, pivoted to negotiations. While the possibility of an agreement remains a long shot, the Iran war industry is pulling out all the stops to ensure its long-sought window for another regime-change war does not close.\n\nUS policy on Iran is one of the most aggressively one-sided political contests in Washington. The sprawling ecosystem pushing for war includes foreign leaders like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who rushed to Washington this past week to run interference as US talks with Iran showed signs of promise. It also includes the lobbying power of groups like AIPAC and their affiliated dark-money political operations like Democratic Majority for Israel and United Democracy Project. And it includes think tanks like the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which frequently dominate the roster of expert witnesses invited to testify at Iran-related congressional hearings.\n\nCampaigns for regime-change wars often follow a familiar playbook, and there is no shortage of actors vying to play the role of Ahmad Chalabi, who fed the George W. Bush administration false intelligence and promises that the United States could create democracy on the cheap to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Today, the leading candidate may be the US-based son of the deposed shah, Reza Pahlavi, who has openly aligned with the Netanyahu government, defended Israel’s June war on Iran, and is now appealing to Donald Trump for US military intervention.\n\nIn the social-media age, the ability to promote an agenda, amplify certain voices, and ostracize others has ensured the push for war is not confined to the halls of power in Washington. It is also being fought aggressively in the digital sphere, where influence operations and coordinated harassment are reshaping debate within the Iranian diaspora. Anyone who has waded into Iran discussions online is familiar with the organized harassment—including threats, intimidation, and accusations against anyone seen as too dovish or insufficiently loyal to a particular opposition figure as being an agent of the Islamic Republic. Independent investigations have shown that this phenomenon is far from organic. Reporting by Haaretz and Citizen Lab last year found that Israel’s intelligence minister facilitated cyber operations promoting regime change in Iran and elevating Reza Pahlavi as a viable governing alternative. There is significant evidence that Israel, the United States, and the Islamic Republic itself are artificially shaping online debates and posing as a radical opposition to police allegiances and fuel division.\n\nThese efforts are not isolated—they are part of a broader strategy to eliminate voices that could prevent conflict and sustain diplomacy. The threats and harassment have intimidated many in the Iranian diaspora into silence, particularly those opposed to sanctions that have impoverished ordinary Iranians while enriching corrupt elites and those who reject the notion that liberation can be delivered by American missiles.\n\nIn turn, some mainstream media outlets have been happy to launder online conspiracy theories through more reputable channels. This dynamic was on display in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial published just as renewed US-Iran negotiations were set to begin. The piece, which attacked my organization and separately Human Rights Watch, relied on a clip from Iranian state television featuring a hard-line professor and students discussing whether there should be an “Iranian lobby” in the United States. One student falsely suggests that Iranian reformists—rather than Iranian Americans who favor peace—had created NIAC to serve as Iran’s lobby. Prominent accounts began circulating the clip not as idle speculation by uninformed sources but instead as a smoking gun against us, and eventually the Journal decided to amplify the claim. In so doing, the Journal lent credibility to a conspiracy theory that originated two decades ago among Iranian hard-liners who sought to discredit their domestic opponents who supported engagement with the West as American toadies.\n\nSome may find it ironic that avowed opponents of the Islamic Republic and advocates for bombing Iran are channeling conspiracies from Iranian hard-liners to silence their opponents here. Or that rival governments are both fueling online influence campaigns while claiming to represent authentic voices of the Iranian people. But this dynamic is not new: Hard-liners here and hard-liners there have long formed a feedback loop, each using the other to justify their agendas at home. Now, with social media, their efforts are more connected—and powerful actors are hard at work to manipulate the medium to reshape views of reality.\n\nNow, as the United States and Iran sit on the precipice of all-out military confrontation and a second US aircraft carrier heads to the region, the durability of diplomacy remains uncertain. Forces on all sides determined to derail negotiations will continue working to silence moderate voices that threaten a march toward war. The greatest danger to diplomacy is not simply governments themselves—it is the mutually reinforcing political ecosystems that depend on perpetual confrontation. Using an old playbook with powerful new tools, they may be closer than ever to turning a US–Iran war into reality.",

    "description": "Struggling with the default keyboard in iOS? Here's what you can do.",
    "fullText": "You don't need to do much digging online to find complaints about the iPhone keyboard: From typos and spelling mistakes to lag and missed keystrokes, there are multiple issues being reported by users, across multiple versions of iOS. While the root causes of these problems tend to vary, there are some broad fixes you can try that should go some way to giving you an iPhone keyboard experience you can rely on—besides waiting for the next bug-squashing iOS update from Apple.\n\nOver time, the iOS keyboard tries to build up smarter autocorrect suggestions for you, but these aren't always helpful: The further away these suggestions get from the defaults, the worse they can get, which risks turning your sentences into gibberish. To clean the slate and go back to the beginning, open up Settings, then tap General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary. Type in your handset's unlock code, then choose Reset Dictionary.\n\nThis may seem to contradict the previous tip, but by explicitly teaching your iPhone the words it often gets wrong, you can reduce the likelihood of those frustrating moments where iOS suddenly replaces the word you were typing with something else (e.g. \"he'll yeah\" or \"what the duck\"). From Settings, tap General > Keyboard > Text Replacement. Tap on the + (plus) button in the top right corner, then enter your word or phrase—you can add a shortcut for it too to help you type it more quickly, but it's optional. Tap Save to confirm.\n\nThere are more keyboard settings that are worth taking a look at under General > Keyboard in iOS Settings. You can turn Auto-Correction off completely, for example, and disable Slide to Type if your fingers have a tendency to slip across the keyboard. There are additional tweaks you can make through the Accessibility menu in Settings: Under Touch > Touch Accommodations, you can change the sensitivity of double-taps and press-and-holds, among other settings, which may help improve typing accuracy.\n\nThere's not a lot you can do with the iPhone keyboard layout to improve your typing experience and eliminate bugs, but there is a one-handed mode you can try in order to minimize glitches and ensure your keypresses match up with what's on screen. To switch to the one-handed layout, tap and hold on the globe icon in the lower left corner of the keyboard, then tap one of the icons at the bottom of the pop-up menu: You can move the keyboard to the left, or the right, or put it back to normal.\n\nIf you're still struggling with the vagaries of the keyboard on iOS, you can always opt to install a third-party alternative: We've covered a bunch here, including Gboard and SwiftKey, and they typically offer more customization options than the Apple default. Once you've installed an alternative keyboard or two, you can manage them from iOS Settings by choosing General > Keyboard > Keyboards. To actually switch between keyboards when typing, press and hold on the globe icon (lower left).\n\nThere are also some more extreme measures you can take that maybe haven't crossed your mind. The first is to use a Bluetooth keyboard (via Bluetooth in Settings), which will give you a more convenient (if less portable) way of typing text into your iPhone. The second is to ensure dictation is enabled in General > Keyboard in Settings, then tap the mic icon in the lower right corner of the keyboard, and speak out your text. You can handle emojis, line breaks, text editing, and more, using your voice.",

    "description": "Six skiers are alive thanks to Emergency SOS via satellite.",
    "fullText": "This week, an avalanche killed eight people who were on a backcountry skiing expedition on Lake Tahoe. One person is also missing, but presumed dead. This story is tragic, but, miraculously, six members of the group survived the disaster. According to the New York Times, those skiers were rescued thanks to a standard iPhone feature, Emergency SOS via satellite, which let them connect to emergency services from where they were trapped by snow.\n\nIf you have an iPhone, you probably have this feature available to you, as well. Better yet, it's not hard to activate in the event of an emergency, though it doesn't hurt to know exactly how it works ahead of time. This isn't the first time Emergency SOS via satellite was credited with saving lives during disasters, and knowing about it now could potentially save your life in a future emergency.\n\nYou might be familiar with your iPhone's Emergency SOS feature—you may have even set it off accidentally when clicking the buttons too many times in a row. Emergency SOS makes it easy to quickly dial 911 in the event of an emergency.\n\nBut Emergency SOS via satellite is different. This feature connects you to emergency services when you're in an area with no cellular service. Where a typical 911 call would route through your carrier's network, Emergency SOS via satellite connects your call or message to the nearest satellite above your head. That means, so long as conditions are right, you're able to contact emergency services from basically anywhere in the world, regardless of whether that area is covered by cell networks.\n\nOf course, since communications are being routed via satellite, the experience is much different than a standard cellular connection. Apple says that in \"ideal conditions\" with a clear sky, it might take 30 seconds for messages to send. Less ideal conditions, say, if your view of the sky is blocked by trees, could slow a message down to 60 seconds or more.\n\nApple first launched this feature with the iPhone 14, but since iOS 18, you've been able to text anyone via satellite. The principle is the same, but you can reach out to friends and family rather than 911. If there's an emergency, but not one you need police, fire fighters, or EMTs for, this can connect you to close friends no matter where you are.\n\nTo connect to satellite with your iPhone, you'll need an iPhone 14 or later. You'll also need to be running iOS 16.1 in the U.S. and Canada, though other regions have their own software requirements. The feature is currently available in the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the U.S.\n\nYou won't have the option to connect to satellite services when you have a connection, either cellular or wifi. Instead, the option appears when you have no service. Once this happens, iOS' Connection Assistant will ask if you want to connect to satellite. If you miss the prompt, you can launch it from the Cellular tile in Control Center, or from Settings > Satellite.\n\nOnce the Connection Assistant launches, it'll walk you through connecting to your nearest satellite, including with on-screen visuals, but here's the gist: You'll need to be outside with as clear a view of the sky as you can. Apple says that \"light\" to \"medium\" foliage from trees could slow down messages, while \"dense\" foliage, hills, mountains, or tall structures could prevent connection at all.\n\nApple says you can hold your iPhone as you usually would—no need to point it at the sky—but you may be instructed to move left or right depending on the location of the satellite. Apple also says the connection might not work in places above 62° latitude, which includes northern parts of Alaska.\n\nOnce connected, the first thing you should do is try calling 911. The call might go through even over satellite, but if it doesn't, you'll find the option to send an \"Emergency Text.\" Tap this option, then choose the appropriate services (roadside assistance or emergency services.). You can also open the Messages app, text 911, then choose \"Emergency Services.\" Here, tap \"Report Emergency,\" then answer questions when prompted to describe the situation you're in. You can also choose to automatically notify emergency contacts that you contacted 911. From here, your iPhone shares all this information, along with your location, remaining iPhone battery life, and Medical ID (if set up), with responders.\n\nYes! (For now.) Since its launch, Emergency SOS via satellite has been free to use, though Apple officially says that the feature is free for two years after an iPhone is activated. The company pushed back that deadline for iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users last year, so no iPhone has actually had to pay for the feature yet. The company might continue to push it back, or begin charging, but there's no word on pricing at this time.\n\nIt's worth noting T-Mobile has its own satellite feature, as well. If you have the service, and an iPhone 13 or later, you could use their satellite connectivity services instead.",

    "fullText": "The very notion of public service journalism is under assault at precisely the moment that it’s most needed.\n\nIt was Jeff Bezos, the Amazon billionaire, who came up with the tagline “Democracy Dies in Darkness” for The Washington Post. According to a memoir by the paper’s former editor, Martin Baron, Bezos greenlighted the “democracy” line after an internal staff favorite was rejected by his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott.\n\nIn his book Baron admits to initially being impressed by the new owner, now the world’s third-richest man. “Everything I’ve heard and seen tells me that Bezos honestly believes in an essential role for journalism in a democracy,” Baron wrote.\n\nThat didn’t turn out so well. Baron has left the Post, Bezos has cozied up to Donald Trump (Amazon bankrolled the recent propaganda film about Melania Trump), and it’s the Post that’s dying, bleeding out from a thousand paper cuts. Recent layoffs at the paper gutted, among others, its metro coverage, its international reach, its book section, and not least the climate team. One of the country’s great newspapers now lives in very dubious company, among other media outlets including CBS News and the Los Angeles Times, that were undercut by their own bosses.\n\nIn the United States, the very notion of public service journalism is under assault, at precisely the moment that it’s most needed. And climate journalism is a case in point.\n\nSammy Roth, who reported on climate for the Los Angeles Times and now writes his own newsletter, “Climate-Colored Goggles,” has documented Bezos’s thrashing of the Post’s climate work, which had often been first-rate. Fourteen climate journalists—including editors, reporters, and data and video journalists—were among the more than 300 Post employees to lose their jobs in the bloodletting. The challenges facing the Post’s remaining climate team have become an order of magnitude harder.\n\nThe cutbacks come as the Post editorial page has become a destination for climate apologia, including an op-ed from climate skeptic Bjørn Lomborg, and a signed editorial applauding Trump’s trashing of the “endangerment finding,’ which had given the US Environmental Protection Agency legal authority to regulate planet-warming pollutants. As Roth noted, the Post editorial questioned whether the “modest benefits of regulating greenhouse gases outweigh the considerable economic costs.” People around the world who are seeing their lives upended by a warming earth won’t see the effects of higher emissions as “modest”; but it would take reporters on the ground to tell that story.\n\nCBS is tacking in the same direction. The network, owned by the billionaire Ellison family, also has cut back on its climate team, laying off all but one of its climate journalists last year under its new leader, The Free Press founder Bari Weiss. Roth reviewed the Free Press coverage of climate when Weiss was there and found a common thread. “Again and again, Weiss has published pieces insisting liberals have an unhealthy obsession with climate change, and that phasing out fossil fuels is unrealistic and harmful.”\n\nCBS’s new worldview is oozing beyond the newsroom. This week, late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert accused CBS of censorship after the network pulled his interview with a Democratic Senate candidate in Texas. “Let’s just call this what it is,” Colbert said on his show. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV.”\n\nAnd so it goes around the country. Reporters at outlets of all sizes report waning interest, if not outright antagonism, to the climate story among newsroom executives. This ambivalence is exactly what Trump and his allies want. It also is a dereliction of journalistic duty. Audiences need to know what is happening in the world around them. And they say, again and again, that they care about climate change and its solutions. Why abandon them now?\n\nThe answer is this: The people who own much of the world’s media do not regard coverage of climate change to be in their economic interest. As a result, the rest of us are left in darkness.",

    "description": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has called for the rules to be changed over goalkeeper timeouts.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor believes a new rule \"should be implemented\" regarding in-game tactical tweaks made when goalkeepers receive treatment.\n\nThe issue was highlighted in January by Arsenal counterpart Renee Slegers who said time-wasting in such instances harmed the \"attractiveness\" of the game.\n\nBompastor went further before Sunday's FA Cup fifth-round tie with Manchester United (13:30 GMT), saying any player who receives tactical instruction in these moments should \"get a yellow card\".\n\n\"It could be an easy fix,\" she said. \"Most of the time when a team does this, it's because they want to make tactical changes.\n\n\"I don't think that is the rules - they shouldn't be allowed to do that.\"\n\nTime-wasting by goalkeepers can harm WSL 'attractiveness'\n\nBompastor, 45, had a stellar first year in charge of Chelsea, winning a domestic treble and going through the Women's Super League season unbeaten.\n\nThis year has been more of a struggle, with the Blues nine points behind leaders Manchester City and facing a first season since 2018-19 without being crowned champions.\n\n\"We aim to always be front-footed and play with intensity,\" she added. \"Sometimes, as much as we want to do that, some things don't allow us to.\n\n\"If a goalkeeper goes to ground, you have to tell every player to stay on the pitch and not allow them to talk to the coach. It should be simple.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Manchester United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce went down with no-one around her in the 25th minute when her side trailed London City Lionesses and came under sustained pressure.\n\nWhile she was attended to for about two minutes, many of the United players went to the sidelines for a drink and to receive instructions from the coaching staff\n\nInside three minutes later, Jess Park levelled the scores.\n\nIn fairness to United, their boss Marc Skinner has also suggested the practice needs to be addressed, saying previously: \"From my perspective, I'd happily explore it because we regularly face it ourselves.\"\n\nSuch incidences are common in the WSL - and Bompastor agreed with Slegers that they harm the appeal of the competition.\n\n\"We need to understand that fans are coming to watch us on the pitch,\" she added. \"They want to see a lot of rhythm, a lot of playing time as that is part of the entertainment as well.\"\n\nThe International Football Association Board (Ifab) has recognised the practice as a problem but has yet to agree a solution.\n\nDale Johnson, Football issues correspondent\n\nIfab has been wrestling with the issue of the goalkeeper tactical timeout for the past couple of years.\n\nThe problem is no-one can agree what to do about it.\n\nOne idea was getting a decent amount of traction. That required an outfield player to leave the field for 30 seconds if a goalkeeper has treatment.\n\nIn effect, it would mirror what happens when the physio comes on for any player.\n\nThere are concerns, though, that this assumes every goalkeeper is feigning injury.\n\nAnd would a keeper with a genuine problem be less likely to go down in fear of hampering their own team?\n\nThe Ifab will meet on 28 February to discuss potential law changes for next season.\n\nThere will be modifications for some areas of time-wasting, on substitutions and goal-kicks.\n\nBut the goalkeeper tactical timeout is likely to be kicked down the road.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Leigh Wood says he \"does not want an easy night\" against Josh Warrington when the former featherweight world champions renew their rivalry in Nottingham on Saturday.\n\nThe pair will contest a rematch at the Motorpoint Arena, more than two years after their dramatic first fight ended with a Wood knockout.\n\nDespite plenty of needle and animosity lingering in the build-up, Thursday's news conference was cordial, with both men fully focused.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be easy. I'm not expecting it to be easy and nor do I want it to be easy,\" said the 37-year-old Wood.\n\n\"I actually feel better when I'm going through it and then I get the victory.\"\n\nHe holds a record of 28 wins and four defeats, with 17 of those victories coming by knockout.\n\nNottingham-born Wood - who has built a reputation in recent years for his heavy hands and consistent threat inside the ring - insisted he was not underestimating Warrington either.\n\nHis victory over the 35-year-old in October 2023 remains one of the most memorable all-British fights of recent years.\n\nWarrington appeared to be edging the action in Sheffield through his work-rate and pressure, before Wood unleashed a powerful right hand in the seventh round to force a stunning stoppage.\n\nLeeds-born Warrington described that as a \"fantastic\" punch but promised to make the necessary adjustments this time to change the outcome.\n\n\"I can't see what Leigh's going to do differently,\" he said.\n\nWarrington, whose record has 32 wins in 37 bouts, with four defeats and a draw, is a two-time IBF featherweight champion, while Wood held the WBA featherweight crown in 2023.\n\nBut much has changed since their first meeting as both men have suffered setbacks against Anthony Cacace. Warrington briefly retired after his loss to the Belfast fighter in September 2024 before deciding to return.\n\n\"I mourned my career a little bit then decided to continue because I felt I had more than enough to do some things in this sport,\" he said.\n\nWith careers hanging in the balance, there is a growing sense defeat could spell the end for either man, and even the winner might also call it a day.\n\nAlso on the undercard in Nottingham will be an exciting women's contest as Derby-born Sandy Ryan challenges Mexico's Karla Ramos Zamora for the vacant WBC world super lightweight title, while Bilal Fawaz meets Ishmael Davis for the British light middleweight crown.\n\nHeavyweight Dave Allen returns to action against Karim Berredjem, former UFC standout Molly McCann continues her transition to professional boxing, and teenage prospects Leo Atang and Tiah Huyton also feature.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Manchester City and United States midfielder Sam Coffey speaks to BBC Sport about using her platform for good, settling into her new home, and her friendship with Emma Hayes.",
    "fullText": "From an outside perspective, it looked like Sam Coffey was set up for the rest of her career back in her homeland.\n\nAs club captain of Portland Thorns in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) and a midfield mainstay in the United States national team, the 27-year-old would have been forgiven for simply enjoying the fruits of her labour.\n\nBut Coffey has never been one to stay in her comfort zone, both on and off the pitch.\n\nWhen current Women's Super League leaders Manchester City came calling in January, she jumped at the opportunity to test herself on the other side of the world.\n\n\"It felt time for a new challenge. I'm always looking to grow and be my best,\" said Coffey.\n\nCity's club-record £600,000 signing sat down with BBC Sport to discuss why she chose Andree Jeglertz's side, her friendship with former Chelsea and current US women's national team boss Emma Hayes, and why she wants to use her platform for good.\n\nBarring an improbable late-season collapse, the 2025-26 WSL title will be Coffey's latest honour in a fast-growing list.\n\nAfter winning the 2022 NWSL championship with the Thorns in her first season as a professional, she helped the US win the Concacaf Gold Cup and Olympic gold in Paris in 2024.\n\nCoffey did not need to move 4,800 miles and eight time zones east in order to continue winning, but she felt the move necessary to feed her insatiable appetite for learning and personal growth.\n\n\"The girls have been very welcoming, every day I start feel more at home,\" added the New York native.\n\nAfter growing up in the village of Sleepy Hollow, 28 miles up the Hudson River from Manhattan, Coffey attended Pennsylvania State University where she obtained a bachelor's degree in journalism.\n\nThe profession runs in the family - Coffey's father, Wayne, is a New York Times best-selling author, while sister Alex is a sportswriter.\n\nIn 2022 Coffey moved across the country to Oregon to begin her professional career with the Thorns.\n\nHer eyes light up as she compared Manchester to her adopted home of Portland, but not in a longing, nostalgic way. She has been keen to throw herself head-first into a city that, as the cliche goes, prides itself on doing things differently.\n\n\"I owe it to the place I'm in to assimilate, learn about what's important to it and what the city is about. I want to continue to get immersed in the culture and learn as much as I can,\" she said.\n\n\"I really love the city so far. It reminds me of where I came from; rainy, quirky, unique, with its own style and personality. The city has a clear spirit and value system and I think that's really awesome.\"\n\nCoffey's uncompromising stance on values and morals aligns neatly with Manchester's proud history of political activism and social change.\n\n\"We all have a platform,\" she added. \"I understand as players that can sometimes be overwhelming to speak out on, but at the end of the day we do have followings, influence.\n\n\"I look at the women who came before me - [Megan] Rapinoe, [Becky] Sauerbrunn, [Alex] Morgan, I could name so many. They are the epitome of using your platform for good.\n\n\"We all have a voice and they set such a standard for what this team [US] means to people. It is so much more than a soccer team. We have always been this pillar of what it means to stand up and speak up for social justice issues whatever that might be, most recently equal pay.\n\n\"When we can stand up in a way that is loving towards one another and loving for our neighbour, nobody should ever not want to do that.\"\n\nProvided the US qualify as expected, Coffey will likely make her Fifa Women's World Cup debut in the 2027 tournament.\n\nAlthough the deep-lying midfielder received her first senior call-up in 2022, it wasn't until Hayes took charge in 2024 that she became a mainstay of the team.\n\n\"I think her game has gone to a whole new level,\" Hayes said of Coffey last year.\n\n\"It's all of it together, it's who she is in the locker room, it's who she is on the field, it's how she goes about her business.\n\n\"She's an impeccable learner, she's always wanting to improve her game. It never ends, it's never enough.\"\n\nIt's clear Coffey thinks similarly highly of the English coach, who led Chelsea to a host of trophies during her tenure, and often FaceTimes Hayes after training to catch up on life.\n\n\"I have nothing but the best things to say about her - she has revolutionised our national team and changed it for the better,\" she said.\n\n\"Her and I have gotten quite close, she's a very special human being.\n\n\"Tactically she's brilliant, but an even better human. She does such an exceptional job creating an environment that is so challenging and excellent with incredible standards, but also one that is so joyful and fun to be part of as a player.\n\n\"She embodies what it means to be a coach that is so driven, focused on excellence and pushing standards, but while also caring so much about the person.\"\n\nFollowing Naomi Girma and Alyssa Thompson's moves to Chelsea last year, Coffey is the latest American player to cross the Atlantic. However, she doesn't agree with those who say the WSL is necessarily better.\n\n\"We were so challenged in the NWSL in so many amazing ways, and now this is just a different and new one,\" she said.\n\n\"Here you're playing against so many of the world's best, playing in a different style of league with a different style of play.\n\n\"I wanted to challenge myself as both a footballer but also as a person living outside of my home.\n\n\"There is this amazing momentum in the women's game where you can grow all around the world and play incredible football and be challenged and tested against the world's best. For me, for this season, it meant coming here.\"\n\n\"Immediately what struck me before anything else was the culture I felt was here,\" added Coffey.\n\n\"It's not just a team that's excellent with high standards, but also a place that cares about people and does things the right way and has a strong culture.\n\n\"You see that in the way that we play, the togetherness of the group. It's rare to have both those things. To be here and be part of it is a huge honour and a privilege.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Scotland defender John Souttar has signed a new contract with Rangers, keeping him at the Ibrox club until May 2027.\n\nThe 29-year-old's previous deal was due to expire at the end of this season, but he has committed to at least one more season, with Rangers also holding an option to extend by an additional year.\n\nHaving come through the Dundee United academy, Souttar then spent more than six years at Hearts before making the switch to Glasgow in the summer of 2022.\n\nHe won the Scottish League Cup in the 2023-24 season and has played a key role this season as Danny Rohl's side attempt to win the Scottish Premiership title.\n\nRangers trail league-leaders Hearts by two points, having beaten the Tynecastle outfit 4-2 last Sunday.\n\n\"It is an exciting time to be here and an exciting time to be involved at the club so I am delighted,\" Souttar said after putting pen to paper.\n\n\"I understand the position I am in, how much of a privilege it is to play here, the demands here and I am personally really happy and excited to know my future is here.\"\n\nRohl - whose team are 12 matches unbeaten in domestic competition - described Souttar as one of the central figures in his squad.\n\n\"We are delighted John has agreed this new contract with the club,\" the German head coach said.\n\n\"Keeping our best players and our leaders is very important to having success going forward, while having a Scottish presence in the squad is also going to be key.\n\n\"This is great news for everyone at the club with so much to look forward to between now and the end of the season, and hopefully for John, a World Cup to come at the end of it.\"\n\nCeltic given full Ibrox stand in Scottish Cup\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Drogheda United co-chairperson Joanna Byrne says that the club's board of directors have asked her to resign following her comments about the Republic of Ireland's Nations League games against Israel.",
    "fullText": "Drogheda United co-chairperson Joanna Byrne has said that the club's board of directors have asked her to resign following her comments about the Republic of Ireland's Nations League games against Israel.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, Byrne said she was informed that her role was \"no longer tenable\" and that she was expected to resign.\n\nThat was in response to Byrne making a statement last week in her role as spokesperson on sport for political party Sinn Fein, saying she was \"angry and dismayed\" that the Republic of Ireland will fulfil fixtures against Israel later in the year.\n\n\"It appears that their morals, and principled position, was only on paper – not in actions where it counts,\" said Byrne in the statement she issued last week.\n\n\"Israel should not be in this competition,\" she added.\n\nThe League of Ireland side, who are owned by the American-based Trivela group, released their own statement on Wednesday, stating that \"at this time, no changes have been made to the club's board\".\n\n\"The concerns expressed to Ms Byrne by her fellow directors are unrelated to anyone's specific political or moral views, and at no point were any such concerns expressed,\" it continued.\n\n\"What was expressed was a concern over the open criticism of Uefa and the FAI, regulatory bodies to whom the club is subject, as well as each club official's responsibility to respect the neutrality provisions of the Fifa code of ethics and the Uefa statutes.\n\n\"To be clear, the substance of Ms Byrne's views has never been attacked by the club or Trivela Group.\"\n\nIn November 2025, the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) voted to submit a motion to European football's governing body Uefa to ban Israel from its club and international competitions.\n\nThe motion, which was overwhelmingly passed, urged Uefa to exclude Israel for \"violating two independent provisions of the Uefa statutes\".\n\nThe \"violations\" cited were the \"organisation of clubs in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank without the consent of the Palestinian Football Association\" and a \"failure to implement and enforce an effective anti-racism policy\".\n\nByrne, who is the Teachta Dala (TD, Irish member of parliament) for Louth and has been co-chairperson at the club since 2023, explained her situation at Drogheda in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"On Monday morning, I was informed by the board of directors of Drogheda United Football Club that my role as chairperson of the club was no longer tenable with an expectation that I would resign, something I have told them that I intend to resist,\" she wrote.\n\n\"This unwarranted action was taken after my public statement last week that Ireland should not play Israel in the Nations League while a genocide against the Palestinian people continues.\n\n\"It is profoundly hurtful that expressing a moral view – one shared by the majority of Irish football fans – has led to this approach despite me never referencing the club at any stage whilst doing so.\n\n\"I stand over those comments. They were made from a deeply held belief in equality, human rights and the power of sport to take principled positions – as it has done many times in history.\n\n\"These fixtures should not go ahead and I believe pressure will grow in the days and weeks ahead against them. This position is in line with Drogheda United delegates' vote at the FAI General Assembly in November in supporting a motion for Uefa to ban Israel from its European club and international competitions.\n\n\"Drogheda United has been part of my identity since childhood – standing on the terraces, travelling to away games, sharing victories and heartbreaks with family and neighbours. The club is woven into the fabric of my life and of our town.\"\n\nFollowing last week's Nations League draw, the FAI indicated it would fulfil fixtures against Israel on 27 September and 4 October because of the potential for disqualification.\n\nIn a statement following the draw, the FAI said it had consulted with Uefa and that sanctions for not fulfilling a fixture could lead to disqualification from the Nations League.\n\nIn September, there were reports Uefa may hold a vote on whether to suspend Israel from club and international competition.\n\nHowever, such a move never materialised and any prospect of that happening receded after the announcement of the Israel-Hamas peace plan for Gaza in October.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nDrogheda's principal sponsor, Sullivan and Lambe, also issued a statement on social media on Wednesday, showing support for Byrne and saying it would be \"actively reviewing\" its position as sponsor, which it has held since the start of 2025.\n\nThe Ashbourne-based stone supplier said it was \"extremely concerned by the attempts to remove Joanna Byrne as chairperson as Drogheda United for remarks she made in relation to the Republic of Ireland men's team's upcoming game against Israel\".\n\nThe statement continued: \"As a business and lifelong supporters of Drogheda United, this development troubles us deeply.\n\n\"We do not believe that political opinions expressed by a sitting TD, especially one who is spokesperson for her political party on sport, should become the basis for interference in the governance of a community football club.\n\n\"We are therefore deeply disappointed at the approach the Trivela Group have taken and the precedent it sets.\n\n\"While this situation continues to unfold, Sullivan and Lambe will be actively reviewing our position as sponsors of Drogheda United in the coming days.\n\n\"We sincerely hope that calm heads prevail and that the club's integrity, independence and community focus are protected.\"",

    "fullText": "Blair Kinghorn and Duhan van der Merwe will bring \"freshness\" to the Scotland team, says Gregor Townsend after he named the duo in the backs for Saturday's Six Nations meeting with Wales in Cardiff.\n\nKinghorn's return at full-back and Scotland's record try scorer Van der Merwe's place on the wing are two of five changes made by Townsend following last Saturday's victory in the Calcutta Cup.\n\nIn the pack, Dave Cherry is in at hooker, Max Williamson takes up a place in the second row and Matt Fagerson joins the back row, with Gregor Brown moving from four to six.\n\n\"Blair was back playing on Sunday night for Toulouse and played really well,\" said Townsend.\n\n\"He's recovered quickly and Duhan has trained really well. There will be a freshness around both of them and a huge determination to do well.\n\n\"We want to see Duhan's strengths. We expect him to play his best rugby. We've got to make sure he gets opportunities to run. When he's done that for us in the past for us, he's done really well.\"\n\nNeither Kinghorn, with 146 points from 60 caps, nor fellow British and Irish Lions cap Van der Merwe with 170 points in 50 appearances, featured in the first two Tests.\n\n\"It will have been tough for them to take, but they backed the team and understood the reasons why we had different selections in the first two games,\" explained Townsend\n\n\"Now they have an opportunity to represent their country again.\n\n\"It's a 23-man game. We're pleased with the starters we're putting out, but also the impact the guys on the bench can make.\"\n\nCostelow and Hamer-Webb start for Wales v Scotland\n\nCan Scotland back up England heroics in Wales?\n\nWales' Hawkins ready to mix it with Scottish Lions\n\nFull-back Tom Jordan and hooker George Turner drop to the bench, while Jack Dempsey, Jamie Dobie and Jamie Ritchie miss out after being ruled out earlier this week.\n\nThe Scots opened with a loss in Italy before a convincing win over England.\n\nWilliamson came off the bench in both while Cherry and Fagerson also came on as replacements in the Calcutta Cup.\n\n\"I've enjoyed being in Spain this week with the players, it's been great, we came here after a win and it's been a good training week,\" said Townsend. \"Vitamin D helps with the soul.\n\n\"We want to show our fitness and conditioning in what will be a tough atmosphere and a tough game.\n\n\"You're only as good as your next game and that's what we look forward to. Our players are keen to go again.\"\n\nTownsend expects Wales, whose head coach Steve Tandy previously worked with Scotland as defence coach, to be \"highly motivated\" after defeats by England and France.\n\n\"They will have taken learnings from those defeats,\" said Townsend. \"They played very tough teams. They will be highly motivated and play with a lot of passion.\n\n\"The atmosphere is always one of the noisiest in the championship and I'm sure they will be playing their best rugby again. That's the challenge we are preparing for.\n\n\"The plan is to play our game. We've got to adjust our game to what's working. We can be physical, move the ball to width and also use our kicking game effectively. We also have to work out what the opposition are doing - we have to deal with their threats.\n\n\"Coaches don't go up against each other. It's the players. It will be great to see [Steve Tandy] after the game. We've been sharing messages - not many this week - but in the first couple of games.\n\n\"We think very fondly of Steve, he spent a long time with us and has been a big influence on our players. I'm sure after the game we can have a few beers.\"\n\nScotland: Blair Kinghorn, Kyle Steyn, Huw Jones, Sione Tuipulotu (capt), Duhan van der Merwe, Finn Russell, Ben White; Nathan McBeth, Dave Cherry, Zander Fagerson, Max Williamson, Scott Cummings, Gregor Brown, Rory Darge, Matt Fagerson.\n\nReplacements: George Turner, Pierre Schoeman, Elliot Millar Mills, Grant Gilchrist, Josh Bayliss, George Horne, Tom Jordan, Darcy Graham.",

    "fullText": "Rapid uphill sprinting with skis on, lung-busting runs up steps with boots on and a downhill ski race to the finish line.\n\nThe new Winter Olympic sport of ski mountaineering - or skimo for short - made its highly anticipated debut on Thursday in blizzard conditions in Bormio.\n\nSwitzerland's Marianne Fatton added Olympic gold to her world title in the women's sprint event and France's Emily Harrop, who could have competed for Team GB, took silver.\n\n\"It's a magical day. It's history for our sport, and for us as athletes, and it's wonderful,\" said Fatton.\n\n\"It was so emotional. I was like, 'did I really do it?' It was amazing, and I was totally exhausted after the race.\"\n\nSpain's Oriol Cardona Coll took top spot in the men's sprint, the nation's first gold medal at a Winter Olympics in 54 years with their previous one won by Alpine skier Francisco Fernandez Ochoa at Sapporo in 1972.\n\nSilver in the men's event went to Russian athlete Nikita Filippov, who was competing under the neutral banner.\n\nDespite the relentless snowfall, fans poured in and lined the course to cheer on the athletes at the nearly sold-out event with much intrigue surrounding the sport's inaugural Olympic appearance.\n\nSpectators who had braved the conditions were treated to a thrilling competition as athletes pushed themselves to the limit to hike to the top of the hill then ski back down.\n\nThe first new sport added to the Winter Olympics since snowboarding in 1998, skimo is rooted in the 19th Century, before lifts to take skiers up mountains had been invented.\n\nThe sprint events consist of both an ascent and descent, with athletes sprinting uphill with skins on their skis to provide traction, navigating a diamond-shaped obstacle on their way up to a stairway in the mountain.\n\nThey then remove the skis, placing them in their backpack, and continue climbing on foot, before a further uphill section on skis.\n\nOnce they reach the top of the course, they remove the skins, and ski downhill to the finish line.\n\nThe average duration of a race is about three minutes.\n\nThe speed and format of the competition meant fans were quickly invested in the absorbing contest and generated a lively atmosphere.\n\nBBC commentator Matt Chilton said: \"The ski mountaineering event has been so well-received.\n\n\"Televisually, it is superb. For the [in person] fans, they can see everything from the grand stand. They don't miss a moment watching the action directly and on the big screen.\"\n\nSimilar to the summer Olympic sport of triathlon, the transitions are key to a successful race.\n\nThat is ultimately what let Harrop down as she struggled in the second transition, getting the skins caught instead of ripping them off in one clean motion.\n\nHarrop has English parents and could have represented Team GB but opted to compete for France, where she was born and bred.\n\nShe had topped both her heat and semi-final and looked on course for gold in the final but, after the second transition, was trailing behind Fatton and could not catch up on the downhill segment.\n\n\"It means a lot. When I look back to when I started the sport, it wasn't even on the (Olympic) programme,\" Harrop, who started out as an Alpine skier, said.\n\n\"I had an Olympic dream when I was an Alpine skier, and then when I stopped, it was just game over. So now to be here on this stage is mad.\n\n\"The atmosphere is good. The slope itself isn't super technical, but today they made the downhill a little bit more technical than usual, so that was fun.\"\n\nA mixed relay event will take place on Saturday, where one man and woman from each nation completes two laps of the course each with a race typically lasting 30-40 minutes.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior says anyone found guilty of racist behaviour in football \"shouldn't be in the game\".\n\nUefa has opened an investigation into claims Real Madrid player Vinicius Jr was racially abused by Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni during a Champions League match on Tuesday.\n\nPrestianni, who denies the allegation, could be suspended for a minimum of 10 matches in European competition if found guilty of the alleged abuse.\n\nBut Rosenior says any coach or player found guilty of racism should be banned from the sport.\n\nAsked for his thoughts on the incident involving Vinicius, the Chelsea boss said: \"If any player, any coach or any manager is found guilty of racism, they shouldn't be in the game. It's as simple as that.\n\n\"It's upsetting. Always, there needs to be context to it. What I will say, you can see any form of racism in society, not just football, is unacceptable.\n\n\"I cannot speak about an incident where an investigation is ongoing. What I would say is when you see a player upset how Vinicius Jr was upset, normally they're upset for a reason.\"\n\nVinicius: Eight years at Real Madrid, 20 cases of alleged racist abuse\n\nReal Madrid tie halted over Vinicius racism allegation\n\n'It was down to the victim' - is Uefa's racism protocol working?\n\nBenfica manager Jose Mourinho accused Vinicius of inciting the crowd with his goal celebration during Real's 1-0 win in Lisbon.\n\nWhile Rosenior was unwilling to directly address Mourinho's comments, he defended Vinicius' actions.\n\n\"I have been racially abused myself. What people need to understand is when you are judged for something you should be proud of, it is the worst feeling you can ever possibly imagine,\" said Rosenior.\n\nBenfica defended Prestianni on social media on Wednesday, claiming there was a \"defamation campaign\" against the Argentine.\n\nThe Portuguese team posted a video of the alleged incident on their X account, saying: \"Given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.\"\n\nAsked what needs to change, not only in football but in society, to deal with racism, Rosenior said: \"A lot of things, this is a very complex situation when you speak about race or gender. There are a lot of things that need to change in society.\n\n\"It sickens me to be honest. I think there's a wider debate than football.

    "fullText": "Lando Norris has admitted he described the new Formula 1 cars as \"a lot of fun\" last week to \"see what the reaction was of everyone\".\n\nThe world champion also suggested Max Verstappen, who had said the cars were \"just not F1\", could \"go and find something else to do\" if he did not like them.\n\nOn Thursday, at the second pre-season test, Norris said: \"I just didn't want to come out into the media and complain to everyone on the first weekend back.\n\n\"I just wanted to say that and see what the reaction was of everyone.\n\n\"It's been quite an amusing week, and it certainly made a lot of people comment and say a lot of things.\"\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nHamilton finds new F1 cars 'more fun' to drive\n\nThe McLaren driver also admitted the cars were \"certainly not the purest form of racing\", and he shared Verstappen's views in many ways.\n\n\"I agree with Max on a lot of comments,\" Norris said. \"Probably most of the comments I agree with, but it's not that I don't have fun out there. So there's two sides.\n\n\"I do agree with basically every other driver, because I think every other driver has made their comments pretty clear. I just didn't want to come out into the media and complain to everyone on the first weekend back. I want to still enjoy my time and just say what I feel.\n\n\"I had fun last week. I've still been having fun out there now. And I think we know as a championship with FIA and with Formula 1, we're trying to improve the car that we have now, because it's certainly not the purest form of racing, and that's what Formula 1 should be.\n\n\"A lot of the driving is focused on just trying to get the battery to work properly and less focused on how can you as a driver get everything out of the car.\"\n\nVerstappen's criticisms centred on the amount of energy management that is required with the new cars.\n\nThe combination of the power provided by the electrical part of the engine being increased three-fold, to about half of the total output, and the batteries being more or less the same size, has led to drivers doing tasks they have described as counter-intuitive.\n\nThese include not coming out of the corner before a qualifying lap as fast as possible, lifting and coasting on the straights on qualifying laps, and backing off before the end of a qualifying lap, all strategies aimed at the optimum use of energy and best overall lap time.\n\nThis has led to continuing discussions behind the scenes about tweaks to the rules before or after the start of the season, when the regulations governing engines are already complicated as a consequence of the way the engines perform.\n\nA number of drivers have also expressed concern about the potential difficulty of overtaking as the former DRS overtaking aid has been replaced by a \"boost\" button giving a burst of extra electrical energy, which is proving less effective so far.\n\nWilliams driver Carlos Sainz, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, said: \"My message to [commercial rights holder] FOM and FIA is [at] the start of the year we need to stay a bit open-minded in case the regulations that we've come up with are maybe a bit exaggerated on the amount of harvesting or deployment that we have to do through a lap.\n\n\"It might make some circuits OK, like potentially here, even though I still think here is not fully OK with what we're seeing so far.\n\n\"But tracks like Melbourne or potentially Jeddah, tracks that might be more energy-demanding, we might need to adjust a bit the regulations.\n\n\"It is not easy because it's such a big change that I don't think anyone knew how to predict how much downforce/drag the car was going to have and what level of deployment the teams would come up with. We should stay flexible rather than committed to a certain level of energy management.\"\n\nOn the penultimate day of pre-season testing, Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli set the fastest time by 0.058 seconds from the McLaren of Oscar Piastri.\n\nFerrari turned heads by trying out a rear wing that had its upper element turn upside down when the car's straight-line mode was activated.\n\nStraight-line mode is a new feature this year in which both front and rear wings open on the straights to increase speed and increase energy recovery possibilities.\n\nNormally the rear wing flap simply moves to open a gap between it and the wing mainplane. Ferrari's is an innovation never seen before.\n\nThe team described the wing as a test item and it was seen only briefly before what Ferrari said was an unrelated \"banal\" technical problem stopped the car.\n\nHamilton managed only five laps before the lunch break, and returned to the track in the second four-hour session to complete 78 laps for the day - compared to Verstappen's 139 as one of the few other drivers who took part in both sessions - and set the fourth-fastest time.\n\nHeadline lap times in testing are unreliable indicators of form and the general opinion is the top four teams - Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren - are clear of the rest, with Mercedes viewed by most as in the best shape at this stage.\n\nAston Martin were another team to have reliability problems. Fernando Alonso stopped on track with a problem with his Honda engine and did not get out again for the final two hours or so of the day.\n\nThe team are struggling with an uncompetitive, overweight car and an underpowered engine and Alonso was 4.669secs off the pace.\n\nPractice starts performed at the end of each session to assuage concerns about the difficulty of preparing the new engines for launching off the line seemed to show Ferrari-engined cars may have a significant advantage at the start of the race.\n\nFastest times, day two, final pre-season test, Bahrain\n\n1 Kimi Antonelli (Ita) Mercedes one minute 32.803 seconds\n\n2 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren +0.058\n\n3 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull +0.359\n\n4 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Ferrari +0.605\n\n5 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren +0.650\n\n6 Franco Colapinto (Arg) Alpine +1.015\n\n7 Nico Hülkenberg (Ger) Audi +1.184\n\n8 George Russell (GB) Mercedes +1.308\n\n9 Esteban Ocon (Fra) Haas +1.398\n\n10 Liam Lawson (NZ) Racing Bulls +1.729\n\n11 Alex Albon (Tha) Williams +1.752\n\n12 Gabriel Bortoleto (Brz) Audi +2.460\n\n13 Oliver Bearman (GB) Haas +2.476\n\n14 Sergio Pérez (Mex) Cadillac +2.566\n\n15 Fernando Alonso (Spa) +4.699\n\n16 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Cadillac +7.390",

    "description": "Arsenal's disappointing 2-2 draw at Wolves on Wednesday has similarities to what happened to the Gunners 18 years ago.",
    "fullText": "OK, Arsenal fans, you may want to look away now.\n\nWe've been digging into the stats and this season has started to look remarkably - some might say eerily - similar to 2007-8, when Arsenal collapsed to finish third having led by five points after 26 games.\n\nWe aren't doing this to troll those of you who are Arsenal fans. This is where our research has led us. And, Gunners supporters, it may mean nothing.\n\nBut bear with us as we talk you through it....\n\nBack in 2008, Arsene Wenger's side were top with 63 points, well ahead of Alex Ferguson's Manchester United in second.\n\nSimilar to this season, their 27th game involved a trip to the West Midlands to face a side battling relegation - in that case, Alex McLeish's Birmingham City.\n\nAfter an awful injury to Arsenal striker Eduardo and a goal from 10-man Birmingham's James McFadden, an 18-year-old Theo Walcott scored his first goals in the Premier League to leave the leaders 2-1 up heading into injury time.\n\nBut a foul by Gael Clichy meant the Gunners conceded a penalty and allowed McFadden to score a 95th-minute equaliser – just a minute later than the one Tom Edozie scored for Wolves on Wednesday.\n\nAfter drawing a game they had dominated, Arsenal defender William Gallas famously sat down on the pitch in what Match of the Day commentator Jonathan Pearce described as \"a state of disbelief\".\n\nFast forward 18 years, and we have Arsenal's disappointing 2-2 draw at Wolves on Wednesday.\n\nAgain they led 2-1 heading into injury time.\n\nIt wasn't a penalty this time, but on 94 minutes, Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori turned debutant Tom Edozie's shot into his own net.\n\nWhile Gabriel Jesus shoving Yerson Mosquera on Wednesday wasn't anywhere near as dramatic, it shows many Arsenal players were similarly stunned and frustrated after the final whistle in that game.\n\nThat 2-2 draw on 23 February 2008 meant their lead at the top was cut to just three points when Manchester United won 5-1 at Newcastle, while Wednesday night's result gives Manchester City the chance to close the gap to just two points if they win their game in hand.\n\nThis current Arsenal side will hope the similarities end there. The Gunners went on to win just one of their next seven Premier League games 18 years ago.\n\nSuch a poor run of results caused them to drop to third place, nine points behind new leaders Manchester United.\n\nDespite winning their final four games, Arsenal finished the season in third place with 83 points, four behind champions Manchester United and two behind runners-up Chelsea.\n\nArsenal's players have an immediate opportunity to show things will be different this time around with the north London derby this weekend, followed by a home game against Chelsea.\n\nAfter that, their only game against the current top six is one that is likely to be even more pivotal in the title race – a trip to the Etihad to face Manchester City on 18 April.\n\nWith just two wins in their last seven games and echoes of that infamous result against Birmingham in their draw last night, the pressure is on for Arsenal.\n\nBut with the future still unwritten, this current crop of Arsenal players still have the chance to put the ghosts of 2008 to rest by becoming Premier League champions for the first time in 22 years.\n\n'Bottle word will be used' as Arsenal blow title advantage\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Pakistan cricketers are not being considered by Indian-owned sides for next month's Hundred auction, sources have told BBC Sport.\n\nPlayers from Pakistan have not featured in the Indian Premier League (IPL) since 2009 because of diplomatic tensions between the two countries.\n\nFour of The Hundred's eight franchises - Manchester Super Giants, MI London, Southern Brave and Sunrisers Leeds - are now at least part-owned by companies that control IPL teams.\n\nIn messages seen by the BBC, a senior official from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) indicated to an agent that interest in his Pakistan players would be limited to sides not linked to the IPL.\n\nAnother agent described the situation as \"an unwritten rule\" across T20 leagues with Indian investment.\n\nECB chief executive Richard Gould said last year he expected \"players from all nations to be selected for all teams\" in The Hundred and warned \"clear anti-discrimination policies\" were in place.\n\nNone of the four teams or ownership groups in question responded to requests for comment.\n\nAn ECB spokesperson said: \"The Hundred welcomes men's and women's players from all over the world and we would expect the eight teams to reflect that.\n\n\"Almost 1,000 cricketers from 18 nations have registered for The Hundred auction, with representation on the longlist of over 50 players respectively from Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Pakistan and West Indies.\"\n\nTwo Pakistan internationals - Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim - appeared in last year's tournament, which was the final edition before new investors took control.\n\nOthers - including Shaheen Afridi, Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf - featured in earlier seasons of the men's competition. No Pakistan players have appeared in the women's Hundred.\n\nPakistan's men are ranked sixth in the ICC T20 world rankings,, external with the women's team eighth.\n\nThe men's side are scheduled to play a Test series in the West Indies during this year's Hundred, though white-ball specialists would still be available.\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has previously withdrawn no-objection certificates (NOCs) - required for players to take part in overseas tournaments - at short notice.\n\nHowever, sources point to the participation of seven leading players in Australia's recent Big Bash League as evidence the PCB has shown flexibility over player availability.\n\nNo Pakistan players have featured in South Africa's SA20, which launched in 2023. All six of its teams are owned by IPL franchise groups - including the four now involved in The Hundred.\n\nIn the UAE's ILT20, franchises controlled by the owners of MI London and Southern Brave have not signed a Pakistan player across four seasons, but have recruited cricketers from 15 other nationalities.\n\nIn January this year, IPL side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).\n\nNo official reason was given but it came amid strained political tensions between India and neighbouring Bangladesh.\n\n\"Every player should have the right to fair and equal opportunity,\" said Tom Moffat, chief executive of the World Cricketers' Association - the global players' union.\n\n\"While employers have autonomy in recruitment, those decisions should always align with principles of fairness, equality and respect.\"\n\nFirst Hundred auction to span two days in March\n\nAll change in The Hundred - what's next?\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nThe ECB sold its 49% stakes in each of the eight Hundred franchises last year - raising £500m in private investment that has since been distributed to counties and the grassroots game.\n\nHost counties were able to keep or sell part of their remaining 51%.\n\nThe ECB retains control of the competition itself, with a new board featuring team representatives formed to help shape its strategic direction.\n\nThe tournament also remains under the jurisdiction of the independent cricket regulator - established following the 2023 Equity in Cricket report, which found discrimination to be \"widespread\" within the English game.\n\nThe County Cricket Members' Group said: \"We expect the relevant county boards and the ECB to hold private partners accountable if there is any reason to believe the non-selection of Pakistan players was a blanket decision based on nationality.\"\n\nAccording to census data, 12% of the Greater Manchester population and 4% in Leeds identify as Pakistani.\n\nIn 2018, the ECB unveiled its South Asian Action Plan,, external led by Vikram Banerjee - now managing director of The Hundred - aimed at increasing engagement within South Asian communities across 10 \"core cities\".\n\nFans in three of those cities - Manchester, Leeds and London - look set to have no Pakistan representation in their local teams.\n\n\"Our players do not seek favours, they seek a fair field,\" said one prominent agent.\n\n\"I hope The Hundred does not mirror patterns we are seeing in some other franchise ecosystems.

    "description": "What does it really take to win an Olympic medal? Sasha Cohen shares her path to silver at the 2006 Turin Games, and the pressure and pain that goes with it.",
    "fullText": "Twenty years ago, I was on the Olympic podium in Turin, Italy. Now, I’m back as a spectator, watching the figure skating events with both nostalgia and relief as I relive the highs and lows of my Olympic experience. I was keenly reminded of my own choice to pursue the Olympic dream at the expense of all else.\n\nIt stirred reflections on my skating career and all that has transpired since. Knowing what it took, I would still do it again in a heartbeat. At the same time, it’s hard to imagine my kids following in my footsteps — not only because of what I missed out on, but the weight of the hopes and expectations I carried.\n\nI first fell in love with the feeling of gliding across the ice at age seven. The next 10 years were full of joyful growth, quickly mastering difficult jumps, and early competitive success. Early mornings in cold damp ice rinks were filled with possibility and promise. I couldn’t get enough and hated anything keeping me away from the ice.\n\nBut when I was just 12, I was forced to take months off when another skater collided with me, slicing my calf open. Then again at 15 I fractured my lower back, sidelined for another three months. The time away from the ice only strengthened my resolve and commitment to qualify for the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. I made the games, but missed the podium and ended up a disappointing 4th place, determined to come back in 2006 and redeem myself.\n\nI moved across the country to work with a coach known internationally for minting Olympic champions, shutting down any outside interests. It paid off and I had my best year yet, winning almost every competition I entered.\n\nBut the time between the Olympics is long. Two years in and still a long two years out; stress mounted and joy faded. 2004 was a particularly brutal year; I withdrew from a season of competitions, crippled by mental health struggles and tortured by long, anxiety ridden nights, precipitated by the growing fear that my best days were behind me.\n\nJust two years earlier, I was a fresh upstart with almost no senior international experience. Making the Olympic team as a 17-year-old in my home country felt like there was only possibility ahead.\n\nFour years later, in 2006, I knew most of my career was behind me, and I was weighed down by the tremendous weight of expectation —mine, and my country’s. It was most likely my last shot at Olympic gold, but injuries marred my training leading up to the Games.\n\nThat’s the thing about an Olympic career, one can spend a whole lifetime training for a certain moment in time, only to be thwarted by the body’s limits.\n\nI knew that even one mistake would cost me Gold and that two would likely knock me off the podium. In the end, I stumbled but so did my competitors. I took home the silver.\n\nThe Olympics are the most glorious and, arguably, agonizing of human endeavors. With the gift of time, I am profoundly aware of the dark side that we glaze over, often oblivious to the costs. The world isharsh in judging our hero athletes — the media’s adulation over team medal counts obscures each athlete’s individual and very human trials and tribulations, focusing on times, records, and outcomes.\n\nIn 2006, I was alone on the world stage, and blamed only myself when I fell.\n\nIf falling was hard, harder still was walking away.  After two decades spent mastering my sport, I finally hung up my skates and found myself profoundly disoriented as the sense of self I achieved as a result of years of hard work on the ice, quickly disintegrated.\n\nBut in the best moments, I was able to transcend place and time, losing myself in the music. I felt the audience on the edge of their seats, cheering me on, and sharing in my triumphs.  My short program in Turin was one of those moments.\n\nAll of this played out for me when most young adults are headed off to college, experiencing their first real taste of independence, making lifelong friendships, and charting out what direction their careers might take. Their mistakes won’t be scrutinized in the public eye (at least that was largely the case before social media) and for most, passing final exams is the biggest source of stress.\n\nPart of me wishes that I, too, could have had those rights of passage.\n\nYet looking back at my life choices, I would absolutely do it all over again. Medaling at the Olympics was the realization of a dream that I had and committed to achieving in a way few people can ever understand. Other than having children, it was the most profound and meaningful part of my life and for that, I would not exchange it for anything.\n\nThese days, my world now revolves around two little people — constantly testing boundaries and figuring out who they are. I want my kids to know that accomplishing great things takes work.\n\nI want them to know the priceless triumph of overcoming their fears because they chose to show up, despite the nerves and doubt. But when success is defined by perfection in one particular moment, that’s a tough way to live and it’s not for everyone. It’s a deeply personal and consequential choice.  And yet, I would never want them to miss pursuing their dreams because the cost of admission is too high.\n\nSasha Cohen is the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, 2006 U.S. Champion, 2003 Grand-Prix Final Champion, and a three-time World medalist. Following her competitve career, she graduated from Columbia University's General Studies and now works as a financial analyst.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sasha Cohen knows Olympic dreams come with agony, but she would do it all again",

There were even claims that both clubs had reached out to his representatives over a possible return.\n\nBut according to Fabrizio Romano, both clubs have now denied those rumours.\n\nIn a recent update on his YouTube channel, Romano said he has spoken directly with both clubs regarding the speculation.\n\nAccording to him, while both clubs respect what Klopp has achieved, neither made any formal move to bring him in.\n\nRomano explained: “When contacted, both clubs – Manchester United and Chelsea – are playing down those reports, saying that nothing really happened with Jurgen Klopp apart from the admiration they have for one of the best managers in the world.”\n\n“Both clubs absolutely announce that they never had any advanced or concrete negotiations to appoint Jurgen Klopp.”\n\nChelsea have already filled their managerial vacancy by hiring Liam Rosenior. But with United still searching for their next manager, it wouldn’t be a surprise if talk about Klopp resurfaces later in the summer.\n\nReal Madrid are another club who could be looking for a permanent manager this summer, having brought in former Liverpool defender Alvaro Arbeloa as an interim coach. Despite the speculation, Romano says there’s nothing developing between Klopp and the Spanish club.\n\n“On the future of Jurgen Klopp, don’t forget that he’s still very busy with the Red Bull project, still focused on that,” he said.\n\n“With Real Madrid, I keep telling you guys, let’s see what happens with Arbeloa because he’s doing a very good job now. Second step, Jurgen Klopp has some people in the Real Madrid board appreciating him a lot, but at the moment I’m not aware of concrete talks. That’s the status as of today.”\n\nKlopp remains one of football’s most respected figures and could likely walk into any role he wanted. But so far, he’s kept to his word about taking time away from coaching.\n\nWhy PSG passed on Jeremy Jacquet before £60m Liverpool switch\n\nHow Anthony Gordon’s record pace could transform Arne Slot’s Liverpool frontline\n\nJadon Sancho sidesteps question about Liverpool legend during Paris date with Saweetie",

    "fullText": "In Major League Baseball, franchise value reflects far more than wins and losses — it represents legacy, market influence, brand power, and the emotional investment of generations of fans. According to Forbes, the sport’s most valuable teams are not just successful organizations but enduring cultural institutions that shape how baseball is experienced across the country and around the world. Leading the way are iconic brands like the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, whose global reach and financial strength mirror their long-standing competitive prominence. Close behind, franchises such as the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs prove that deep-rooted history and passionate fan loyalty can translate into extraordinary economic value. Meanwhile, the San Francisco Giants showcase how sustained success in the modern era can elevate a franchise’s stature both competitively and commercially.\n\nWhat unites these teams is their ability to transcend the game itself. Each operates as a powerful entertainment brand, drawing massive attendance, commanding lucrative media deals, and maintaining devoted followings that span generations. Their ballparks are destinations, their histories are woven into the fabric of their cities, and their influence stretches well beyond regional markets. In many ways, these franchises serve as pillars of baseball’s identity — setting financial benchmarks while carrying the traditions that keep the sport deeply connected to its past.\n\nFranchise value: $8.2B\nFew brands in sports carry the global recognition of the Yankees. Their history is stacked with championships, legends, and iconic moments that shaped baseball itself. The franchise thrives on tradition, star power, and unmatched cultural visibility. Whether contending or rebuilding, they remain baseball’s financial and symbolic powerhouse.\n\nFranchise value: $6.8B\nThe Dodgers blend historic prestige with modern dominance better than almost anyone. Their massive fan base stretches across Southern California and well beyond, fueled by consistent winning and aggressive investment in talent. The franchise excels both on the field and at the gate, drawing huge attendance year after year. They represent the blueprint for a contemporary big-market contender.\n\nFranchise value: $4.8B\nThe Red Sox carry one of baseball’s most emotionally charged legacies, rooted deeply in Boston’s identity. From the drama of historic droughts to the euphoria of multiple modern titles, the team lives at the center of passionate fandom. Fenway Park’s atmosphere alone is part of their brand value. Their history, rivalry, and regional loyalty make them perpetually relevant.\n\nFranchise value: $4.6B\nThe Cubs transformed from lovable underdogs into a global brand, especially after their long-awaited championship breakthrough. Wrigley Field’s charm and neighborhood feel give the franchise a timeless appeal. Generations of fans stayed loyal through decades of heartbreak, strengthening the team’s cultural footprint. Today, they balance nostalgia with modern competitiveness.\n\nFranchise value: $4.0B\nThe Giants built a 21st-century dynasty that elevated their national profile and market value. Their waterfront ballpark and strong regional following make them a cornerstone of West Coast baseball. Success across multiple championship runs reinforced their reputation for smart roster construction and stability. They embody sustained excellence with a distinctly San Francisco identity.\n\nTogether, these franchises represent the gold standard of value in Major League Baseball — where heritage, market strength, and sustained relevance intersect. Their financial dominance reflects decades of cultural impact, smart organizational leadership, and unwavering fan devotion. As the sport continues to evolve, these teams remain defining forces, proving that true franchise value is built not just on performance, but on legacy that endures across generations.\n\nOLYMPICS: USA figure skater Isabeau Levito gushes over Olympic Village\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes hilarious first move after Dolphins release\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 after Week 15\n\nMLB: Tigers infielder from Taiwan apologizes to Koreans after trash talk goes viral\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Most valuable franchises in MLB appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has urged his side to use the \"pain\" of a shock 2-2 draw with Wolves when they look to revive their Premier League title challenge against arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Gunners were on course for a routine win on Wednesday after goals from Bukayo Saka and Piero Hincapie put them 2-0 up at Molineux.\n\nBut bottom of the table Wolves hit back through Hugo Bueno and Tom Edozie.\n\nThe draw left Arsenal, bidding to end a 22-year-wait to be crowned champions of England again, just five points clear of second-placed Manchester City.\n\nIt was the second match in a row where Arsenal had dropped points following a draw with Brentford and meant they have now won just twice in their last seven league games.\n\nCity, who have a game in hand, twice chased Arsenal down to win the Premier League in both the 2022/23 and 2023/24 seasons and their April clash with the Gunners could prove pivotal to the title race.\n\nBut Arteta said: \"I'm going to be the first one to be close with them (the players) because it has nothing to do with attitude or desire, it is completely the opposite.\n\n\"It's part of football. Where it could've gone wrong today, it went wrong.\n\n\"If you look at the way we conceded the two goals today without conceding any other situations, it is very rare but it happens. And it happened for a reason and we need to react.\n\n\"If you are at the top you have to win and win, that's nothing new.\"\n\nArsenal are away to struggling Tottenham in a north London derby on Sunday, with Arteta saying: \"We need to go through the pain and go through it looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now and the next action is Sunday. We need to keep all that in our tummies to show it on Sunday.\"\n\nMeanwhile Saka told Arsenal.com: \"It's pretty flat. We're pretty disappointed with the result, it's the only way to describe it.\n\n\"I think it's a game of two halves. In the first half we started so well but in the second half we dropped the level and got punished for it.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the derby match, the England international added: \"It was already a big game and now it's still a big game...It's still in our control so we just need to focus on that, fix the issues we're having now and get back to winning ways.\"",

    "fullText": "This year’s crop of starting pitchers has a couple of amazing arms that will cost you a first-round pick if you want to roster them, and as much as I hate to say it, taking a pitcher that high is akin to dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight.  The same two pitchers were the top two off the board last year, so the waters may seem safe, but beware.  Those same waters seemed safe two years ago when Spencer Strider was the top arm off the board. Here are the top 30 SP right now in fantasy baseball:\n\nTwo straight Cy Young awards should be reason enough, but at age 29 and playing for what should be the largest ever free agent contract for a pitcher doesn’t hurt either.  The Tigers are sticking with him at the top of their rotation as they make a run for it all in 2026, but don’t be surprised if he’s dealt to a contender if Detroit isn’t competitive.  He’s basically guaranteed to be pitching for a contender for the entire season.\n\nMORE: Fantasy Baseball 2026 Catcher Rankings (16-30)\n\nThe Pirates have improved their offense from last year, so it’s possible we get more than the 10 wins from Skenes that we got last year.  Even without the wins, he dominates batters to such an extent that we can comfortably project him to have an era. at or below 2.00.  Flip a coin between these top 2 pitchers, I can’t be mad at either one going before the other.\n\nCrochet basically sits on a tier by himself as the #3 pitcher in the league.  He eclipsed 200 innings last year after setting a career high in 2024 with 146.  The comparisons to Chris Sale are mostly due to his left-handedness and his tall beanpole physique, but there is also the concern over workload issues, as he was a relief pitcher just 3 years ago.  He’s a great pick, but he makes me nervous.  I don’t wish injuries on anybody, but this guy is already a one-time TJS survivor.\n\nWoo is another young gun who emerged as a bona fide ace last year, finishing 5th in the AL Cy Young award voting.  His innings have been ramping up over the past 3 years, so I’m not quite as worried about him as I am Crochet.  If you take him, he’s going to cost you a more tolerable late 3rd round or early 4th round pick, and he’s a great anchor for your pitching staff.  You will also get to enjoy a full season of doing your best Ric Flair impressions every time he pitches.\n\nThe Mariners have a good pitching staff, in case you haven’t noticed.  Gilbert missed a month and a half of last season with a flexor strain but still managed to pile up over 170 Ks in just 131 innings.  He had posted 3 straight seasons heading into 2025 of 180+ innings, so he should be safe to get back to that total (barring another injury, of course).  He’s going right around the same spot as Woo in early drafts.\n\nHe was a stud last year, especially in the postseason, where he basically pitched in every game of the World Series. My only slight concern with him (as well as with all Dodger pitchers) is the fact that the team is on a mission to win yet another title, and they don’t care about our fantasy teams.  He won’t likely make 30 starts this year as Ohtani will be a two-way player for the whole season, and they will likely be using a 6-man rotation.  Set your expectations for 26 starts and about 160 innings, and you won’t be disappointed.\n\nHe became the de facto Yankee ace in the absence of Gerrit Cole last season and answered the call by finishing 4th in the AL Cy Young voting.  His 195 innings were a career high, and he has had a history of arm issues that have landed him on the IR over his career.  Expecting a repeat of last year might be a bit ambitious, but he’s still going to put up great numbers as long as he can post.\n\nThis guy just keeps doing it year in and year out.  In a time where it’s rare to find a pitcher who is able to give you 180 innings, Webb has AVERAGED over 200 innings per season over the last 4 years.  He’s still just 29, and he’s a great anchor to start your staff if you wait until the 4th round or so to take your first pitcher.  His spike in K rate can be attributed to his reliance more on his sweeper over his sinker and using his changeup more selectively as more of an out pitch to put batters away.  These numbers are in line with how he used his repertoire back in 2021 when he last averaged over 9 k/9, so it’s very possible that he stays with this approach going forward.\n\nThere was a lot to love about the 2025 season for Sanchez as he was the unanimous #2 pitcher in the NL last year, to Paul Skenes according to Cy Young voters.   He was one of only 3 pitchers to throw for over 200 innings, and it wasn’t much of a bump for him from 2024, when he threw 181, so we’re not too worried about overusage.  He’ll cost you a mid-third round pick, but I still like him just behind Webb, who has been going later.  If he’s there and Webb isn’t, I’ll jump on him to start my fantasy pitching staff.\n\nHe’s been one of the best pitchers in the game since May 2024.  His 2.43 era in 2026 was right in line with the 2.51 era he posted from May 1 on in 2024.  His 10.0 k/9 ranked him as the 10th-best strikeout pitcher amongst starters, and his 206 Ks ranked 8th in all of baseball.  The bottom line?  He’s an ace for the Astros, and he will be an ace for your fantasy team.  He’s a bargain in the early 4th round.\n\nGreene is this high based on pure ability, but that ability has been more of a tease than a league winner to this point in his career.  He has yet to throw for over 160 innings in any of his 4 major league seasons, but his K rate era. and ratio numbers over the last 2 years are quite inspiring.  If he can manage 180 innings, he’s going to be a Cy Young Award finalist.  He’s a rare breed of pitcher that can excel even while pitching in that bandbox in Cincinnati.\n\nHe was able to put the best parts of his previous two seasons together in 2025 as he had a career year for the Twins with 194 Ks in 171 innings pitched, along with a 3.42 era and a 1.07 whip.  Entering the season at 29 years of age, he’s poised to retain his mantle as the Twins ace and should be their opening day starter.  He’s an excellent #2 for your fantasy team and a fine #1 if you decide to wait on pitching for a few rounds.  He’s going after guys like deGrom and Sale, but in deeper leagues, I’d much prefer the younger Ryan.\n\nMuch like Hunter Greene, Sale has put up elite numbers without playing a full season.  Unlike Greene, Sale is on the wrong side of 30, and the likelihood of him reaching even as many as 25 starts seems like a stretch.  When he does pitch, he’s one of the best in the game. Just be aware that you aren’t buying a full season’s worth of stats.  He has much more value in a shallower league where decent replacements are available when he’s not.\n\nIf you can’t get Sale, why not get his twin?  DeGrom somehow managed to throw 172 innings last year.  Are we seriously betting on that happening again?  No.  If we were, he’d be much higher on this list after posting a 2.97 era with a sub-1 WHIP along with 185 Ks last year.  Much like Sale, deGrom is elite when he pitches, just don’t buy him expecting a repeat of last year’s numbers.  Much like Sale, he’s a great option for shallower leagues.  If somebody else wants to use their 3rd round pick on him, let them.  It won’t be me.\n\nNo matter what you may think about him, he’s been a workhorse over his career, averaging 30 starts and throwing at least 175+ innings over his last 4 seasons.  Now calling pitcher-friendly Comerica Park his home, his sinker-heavy approach should make him one of the toughest pitchers in the game to take deep.  It remains to be seen how Detroit’s patchwork infield will hold things down behind him, but he’s a solid bet to post 180 innings with about the same number of strikeouts.  He’s a great #2 for any fantasy or real-life staff.\n\nHe was a favorite sleeper of mine heading into 2025, and he outperformed my lofty expectations.  The K rate bounced back to his 2022-23 levels while he was in Miami and playing for a better team juiced up his win total.  The era took a bit of a step back, but that can be chalked up to the move from pitcher-friendly Marlins Park to Citizens Bank Park.  At just 28 years of age, with full health, he can take another step this year and give Skenes some competition for that CYA.\n\nThe Mets new ace has New York fans buzzing as he brings a resume that includes three straight years of 30+ starts and 200+ Ks to Flushing for 2026.  He needs to figure out how to consistently go 6 innings if he’s going to take that next step to the land of the truly elite.  Even where he is right now, he’s in rarified air, so buy him banking on what he’s been doing, and keep your fingers crossed that there’s even \n\nHe was a hot target last season after finishing 4th in the AL Cy Young voting in 2024, earning him the opening day nod for the Royals.  He came out of the gate sluggish and ended up on the IL after just 6 starts.  The injury cost him most of the season, and upon his return, it took him a few starts to get right.  Over 3 short starts in September, he looked to be the pitcher we were hoping for with 22 Ks over 13 innings with a 2.77 era.  He might be a bit of a reach this high, but I believe in the talent as well as his\n\nHe’s been a workhorse, but now he’s a 35-year-old workhorse.  He has posted 31+ starts and 170+ innings in every season since 2021 and will remain atop the Blue Jays rotation for the upcoming season.  He likely has one more season in him at this level, but at this age, anything can happen (just ask Zack Wheeler).  The skills are still there, so as long as he keeps toeing the rubber, he’s going to be a fantasy asset.\n\nA shoulder injury messed with the beginning of his season, and once he returned, he wasn’t quite able to match his previous surface numbers.  Looking beneath the surface, his velocity was the same as pre-injury, and his K rate actually increased.  I’m willing to buy in at a discount if I can get it and expect a return to 2024 at minimum.  Entering his age-28 season, there’s potential for another step forward with full health.\n\nIf you are a fan of trends, then this is the year to grab Dylan Cease.  He’s been a lock for 200+ Ks every year for 5 straight seasons, but his era and whip have bounced up and down every year.  The trend would suggest that this year he’s due for improvement over the 4.55 and 1.33 rates from last year and another top 5 CYA finish.  His stuff is so nasty that I don’t think a move from San Diego to Toronto will matter very much.  He’s the epitome of a “one skill away” pitcher who might just win that CYA this year if he puts it all together.\n\nHe’s going to be a full two-way player this year for the Dodgers, but what does that mean for fantasy?  If you are playing in a league where you can only draft “One Shohei”, then you are likely drafting him to fill your DH role.  In that case, you can stop reading since he’s long gone by now.  If you are in a league that rosters Shohei the hitter and Shohei the pitcher as two different players, he makes for an interesting pitching option.  We can’t really draft him much higher than this because we can’t assume he will make many more than 20-25 starts.  Using his 2023 numbers with the Angels as the baseline, this is a good spot to take him.\n\nThe story has always been the same with Snell.  He’s an amazing talent, but he struggles to stay healthy, and he throws too many pitches to go deep into games.  He’s in the absolute perfect rotation, so he’ll be protected and won’t have to pile up innings.  The downside is he won’t pile up stats, so pay for 120-140 innings max.  On the bright side, he has shown he can amass 170+ strikeouts with under 130 innings pitched.\n\nHe missed all of 2024 with a shoulder injury, and last year, he suffered a few setbacks that delayed his arrival to the mound for the Crew.  Once he did return, he was back in peak form…..until another injury ended his season.  The injury that ended his 2025 was unrelated to the shoulder, and he’s entering camp at full strength, so I feel pretty good about him, even as he enters his age-33 season.  Buy in and bank on 130 innings as a baseline, and you won’t be disappointed.\n\nHe’s 36 years old now and has moved from St. Louis to Boston after back-to-back seasons of 200+ strikeouts for the Redbirds.  His era has been up and down over the last 5 years, and at 36 years of age, I don’t know if we can buy in expecting a bounce back.  The age always scares me, but if you can get him at a fair price (after the 8th round) he’s worth the add.\n\nBased on last year’s numbers, he should be higher on this list, but at 33 years of age, he’s never exactly been the model of consistency.  2025 was likely a career year for Pivetta, and I hate paying the full price for a season that likely won’t ever happen again.  Not only was his 2.87 era his career best, but it was also the first time in his career he pitched to an era under 4.  His underlying skills always suggested that he was due for improvement, but I don’t think we can buy into a repeat of last year.  If everybody is thinking the same way and he falls, I’ll be happy to take him here.  Just don’t count on much more than 150 innings, 160ish K’s, and a mid-3 era.\n\nHe’s young, and the skills say a break-out is coming.  It’s just a matter of staying healthy.  After missing all of 2024 with Tommy John Surgery, he struggled a bit to begin last year before finishing strong.  At just 23 years of age, he should be good to put up closer to 150 innings this year, and I think he’s a strong bet to post 175 Ks with a mid-3 era and low whip.  In keeper leagues, bump him up a little bit because 2027 might be a monster for him.\n\nHe was well on his way to establishing himself as a top-of-the-rotation anchor for Baltimore after a strong 2023, where he posted a K per inning over 168 frames with a sub-3 ERA.  Tommy John got him 8 starts into 2024, and when he finally made it back last year, he looked as good as ever.  Now at full strength entering his age-29 season, he’s poised to lead the Orioles rotation this year.  His K rate from the portions of 24-25′ suggests that there is a step forward coming.\n\nAnother piece (#4 so far) of this elite Mariner rotation.  He’s older now (33), and he’s not quite what he used to be, but he’s still very good.  He won’t likely give us the 200+ Ks that he did back in 2023, but he’s a solid bet to take his turn in the rotation 30+ times and give us 180 innings, 165 Ks with double-digit wins and solid rate stats.  He’s not super sexy, but he’s a solid pick in the later middle rounds of your draft.\n\nHe’s sort of the 6th Beatle, but the truth is, he might very well end up being the best of the bunch.  He missed all of 2024 after receiving the internal brace version of TJS, and upon his return, he gave the Dodgers 12 very nice starts (15 total appearances) where he totaled 89 Ks in 73.1 IP with a 2.82 era and a sterling 0.97 WHIP.  Then, when the postseason rolled around, he went to the bullpen.  That’s going to be the issue this year.  He’s not going to get 30 starts, but if he can get us 25, he’s well worth a pick in about the 10th round in mixed leagues.\n\nOLYMPICS: USA figure skater Isabeau Levito gushes over Olympic Village\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes

    "fullText": "MILAN — In the immediate aftermath of Sidney Crosby leaving a game because of injury, Jon Cooper said he didn't know Crosby's status and noted, \"I don't even have my poker face on.\"\n\nIt was back on the next day, as Cooper declined to give a definitive answer on the status of Canada's men's hockey team captain, who did not partake in an optional practice on Feb. 19. However, Cooper did not rule him out for the remainder of the 2026 Winter Olympics, which at most would be two games. Canada plays a semifinal game against Finland on Feb. 20 at Milan Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. Win or lose, there's a medal game next.\n\n\"Sid is by no means ruled out of the tournament,\" Cooper said. \"We’ve got the best of the best looking at him. We’re taking this day by day. And we’re not going to put anyone in harm’s way. But if he can play, he’s definitely going to. We’ll know \n\nCanada needed overtime to advance out of a quarterfinal match against Czechia, and had to make do for more than half of it without Crosby.\n\nCrosby was injured on a hard hit from Czechia's Radko Gudas, with Crosby's right leg buckling as he went down. He was also crunched by Martin Necas. Crosby hobbled to Canada's bench, then down the tunnel, and did not return.\n\nInstead, he addressed his teammates during the second intermission, when it was 2-2, essentially urging them to go get the victory.\n\n\"There was a lot more than that,\" Cooper said. \"You know, he's a true leader.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sidney Crosby injury update: Canada’s hockey captain not ruled out at Olympics",

    "fullText": "The NFL combine begins soon, running from Feb. 23 to March 2. To preview this important pre-draft event, we will be taking a position-by-position look at which prospects were invited and the level of need that the Indianapolis Colts have at each spot.\n\nThe NFL combine is held at Lucas Oil Stadium and is an opportunity for the top NFL draft prospects in this year’s class to go through measurements and various on-field drills, some of which are specific to their position group, and others measure the player’s overall athleticism.\n\nFor NFL teams, this event is another data point for them as they build out their draft profiles and big boards. However, it’s a significant data point, with players potentially flying up and down draft boards depending on how they perform.\n\nIn addition to the on-field drills, teams also get the opportunity to meet with players one-on-one as well, which is another important part of the evaluation process as they get to know them both on and off the field.\n\nTaylor is still under contract through 2026, so the need remains relatively low. With Taylor still just 27 years old, he could be a potential contract extension candidate this offseason.\n\nHowever, while the need at running back may not be high, the Colts could still make an addition here. Adding an inexpensive veteran option in free agency or a mid to late round pick in the draft to bolster the depth and competition behind Taylor could be on Chris Ballard's radar.\n\nBentley was on the practice squad last season, and Giddens was often inactive, still needing to develop parts of his game, particularly in pass protection.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Indianapolis Colts' 2026 NFL combine preview: running backs",

    "fullText": "Liam Lawson has been cautioned that the new 2026 Formula 1 cars might bring to light a weakness in his game this season.\n\nThe Racing Bulls haven’t had a standout pre-season so far, but Arvid Lindblad did manage to put in more laps than anyone else during Wednesday’s morning session.\n\nHe handed over driving duties to Liam Lawson for the afternoon as both drivers get ready for the season opener in Australia.\n\nJack Doohan, watching from trackside in Bahrain, noticed something in the Racing Bulls setup that could be an issue going forward. Still, team principal Alan Permane will hope there’s enough time to address any problems with the VCARB 03 before racing gets underway.\n\nMeanwhile, commentator and journalist Nelson Valkenburg believes a familiar problem could return for Lawson. He suggested that issues from his short spell at Red Bull might reappear this year with the new regulations:\n\nValkenburg spoke about Racing Bulls’ performance during an appearance on the Nailing the Apex Podcast and said: “Yes, it felt very uninterested in headline lap times, but they had some performance niggles and some engine problems and hydraulics.\n\n“I don’t know, where the foundation of the Red Bull feels incredibly strong and stable, less so for the Racing Bulls team, but we can put them in this similar category [to Audi]. Could be fifth, could be eighth.\n\n“I’m becoming a fan of Lindblad. When I spoke to him, he didn’t look shell-shocked, and that’s a good place to be after your first few test days.\n\n“For Lawson, I worry a bit simply because we’ve learned over these days that there is a way of going fast into corners that makes the car a little tail happy.\n\n“Which is probably a nightmare scenario for Liam Lawson, considering what we saw at Red Bull last year.\n\n“You go through the gears, your weight transfers to the front, you do a lot of engine braking and the car. You have to hang on to the rear as you turn into the corner; basically Max’s dream right?”\n\nWhile there are certainly areas for concern when it comes to Racing Bulls’ chances this season based on what has been seen during pre-season testing so far in Bahrain. However they’ll hope that they still have time before things get going for real against McLaren in Australia next month.\n\nWhile the early feedback on the new regulations hasn’t been overwhelmingly positive for Lawson, he’s still young enough to develop the skills needed to thrive under these conditions.\n\nRacing Bulls clearly believe in his potential – they wouldn’t have chosen him over Yuki Tsunoda if they didn’t think he could be a strong partner for Lindblad.\n\nOn the first day of Bahrain’s second week of testing, Lawson finished 12th, seven places ahead of Lindblad.\n\nThe times don’t hold much weight at this point in the season, but it’s still a small boost for Lawson as he heads into the final stretch of pre-season preparations.\n\nFerrari’s F1 car struggles with Verstappen’s high-revs downshift trick during Bahrain test\n\nCarlos Alcaraz says what he thinks about Formula 1 after watching Bahrain test\n\nAnthony Davidson accuses Fernando Alonso of ‘burning up’ tyres in Aston Martin during F1 testing",

He was subsequently shown a yellow card for the celebration.\n\nFollowing the game, Vinicius took to Instagram, writing in Portuguese: \"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. But they have protection from others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish.\n\n“Nothing that happened today is new in my life and my family’s. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. Still not understanding why. On the other side, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\"\n\nPrestianni has since denied making any racist comments towards Vinicius via his own Instagram account. Benfica, his club, has also criticised what they termed a \"defamation campaign\" against their player.\n\nAdding to the controversy, Benfica coach Jose Mourinho has faced criticism from anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out, which described his post-match comments as \"gaslighting.\"\n\nMourinho told Amazon Prime: \"I told (Vinicius), when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. They (Vinicius and Prestianni) told me different things. But I don’t believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.\"\n\nHe further remarked that \"something happens, always\" in matches featuring Vinicius.",

After head coach Jedd Fisch and the Huskies parted ways with offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Jimmie Doughtery, they made the decision to promote Losman to quarterbacks coach, according to a report from ESPN's Adam Rittenberg.\n\nLosman aided in the development of star UW quarterback Demond Williams Jr., and he has extensive experience playing the position as well. He played his college ball at Tulane, where he served as a two-year starter in 2002 and 2003.\n\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) February 18, 2026\n\nAfter being a first-round pick in the 2004 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills, he also played for the Oakland Raiders, Seattle Seahawks, and Miami Dolphins. His coaching career began at Clemson in 2017 and Brent Venables brought him to Norman in 2022. Losman's wife, Zulaikha, was also on staff with the Sooners during the same timeframe he was. She served as OU's director of SOUL mission, player/parent relations.\n\nLosman's time with the Seahawks saw him partner with Fisch, who is the Huskies' offensive play-caller. Washington is still searching for a new offensive coordinator.\n\nFor the Sooners, they have replaced three position coaches already this offseason. OU officially announced the hiring of tight ends coach Jason Witten, and Oklahoma is reported to be hiring LaMar Morgan to coach defensive backs and Deland McCullough to coach running backs.\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Former Oklahoma staff member earns promotion at Big Ten school",

    "description": "Inside the Hungarian midfielder's season as the main character at Liverpool, his friendship with Mohamed Salah and why the Reds are keen to extend his contract.",
    "fullText": "On his forearm, Dominik Szoboszlai has a tattoo in Hungarian which reads 'Talent is a divine blessing, but without incredible will and humility, it is worth nothing'.\n\nDig a little deeper and you find the quote is attributed to Steven Gerrard.\n\nWhen midfielder Szobozlai arrived at Liverpool from RB Leipzig in 2023 for £60m, there was a reason why he took the number eight shirt that had become synonymous with Gerrard at Anfield.\n\nEarlier that summer, Alexis Mac Allister turned down the chance to take the number, but Szoboszlai craved that main-character energy.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been Liverpool's main character this season, scoring his 10th goal of the season last weekend, to go with seven assists.\n\nWhen it was put to him that he was having a \"Steven Gerrard season\", he politely disagreed and insisted he was writing his own story.\n\nOnly forward Hugo Ekitike has more goal involvements and captain Virgil van Dijk has played more minutes than Szoboszlai for Liverpool this season - and close friend Mohamed Salah described him as \"one of the best players in the world right now\".\n\nThe Hungary international may insist on being his own man, but when it comes to taking responsibility as others struggle, and having his own goal of the season competition at the club, there are certainly similarities to the iconic and inspirational Gerrard.\n\nSzoboszlai hasn't always played in his preferred number 10 position this season, but is scoring more frequently - his stunning free-kicks against Arsenal and Manchester City came in games he started at right-back. The step-up in both consistency and output has been clear.\n\nIn a tumultuous Liverpool campaign that has involved speculation about the future of Salah and defenders Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson, perhaps the most important negotiation will be with Szoboszlai, who has just over two years to run on the initial five-year deal signed in 2023.\n\nSpanish outlet Marca reported comments last week from Hungary boss Marco Rossi in which he said Szoboszlai's one dream was to play for Real Madrid. The club's Brazilian forward Vinicius Jr also named the Hungary captain as one of his closest friends outside Real.\n\nEncouragingly for Liverpool supporters, talks over a new contract have started, and Szoboszlai said earlier this month he loved the city and the club. His agent, Matyas Esterhazy, added this week on Hungarian TV the player was not looking for a move elsewhere.\n\nThose who see him on a daily basis at Liverpool describe him as highly competitive with a clear desire to excel.\n\nSzoboszlai is regularly among the first to arrive at training and it's no surprise he's high up in terms of the club's running and physical stats. No Liverpool player has covered more distance this season.\n\nIn a recent video on Liverpool's channels, Milos Kerkez - who plays with him for club and country - said Szoboszlai would be a 400m runner if he wasn't a footballer.\n\n\"He could jog from Liverpool to Hungary and not get tired,\" joked left-back Kerkez.\n\nSzoboszlai is a man determined in his own right, but Salah's high standards are understood to have a big influence on him. Away from football, the pair enjoy playing backgammon and often hang out together at each other's houses.\n\nWhen he was described as \"disrespectful\" last month by Barnsley boss Conor Hourihane for attempting a backheel in his own box that led to a mistake and goal for the League One side, Szoboszlai spoke up to defend himself.\n\nPrivately, manager Arne Slot had a word too.\n\nSzoboszlai's prime years are ahead of him. He was handed the national team captaincy at 22 and Liverpool view him as a future skipper, just like Gerrard.\n\nWith vice-captain Robertson expected to depart this summer and Van Dijk's deal expiring in 2027, the possibility is certainly there.\n\nAsked if Szoboszlai has the attributes to be a future leader, Slot said: \"Yes, but he is still young. He has a lot of attributes already, especially when it comes to leading by example. There is still a step to make in terms of leadership, being vocal and a voice in the dressing room if I compare him to Virgil, which is completely normal.\n\n\"Virgil is 34 and has seen [James] Milner, [Jordan] Henderson and these players, so it's really good for Dominik that he sees Virgil. That would be the next step for him; to be as vocal and as loud as Virgil but that comes with time.\n\n\"But for all the other things, he has a lot to become a very influential player for Liverpool and you could call that a leader.\"\n\nDuring his first season at Liverpool which was Jurgen Klopp's last campaign, Szoboszlai struggled in a game at Luton, and his frustrations summed up when he booted a ball outside the stadium.\n\nSzoboszlai returned later that summer with a point to prove and has been ever-present under Slot since - 2025 was the year he became a husband, father and a Premier League winner.\n\nThis term, he has already played more minutes for Liverpool than he did in 2023-24 and only 302 minutes short of matching his tally for the previous campaign.\n\n\"Obviously he has been very good [this season],\" added Van Dijk. \"He's also a player who I think can still make the next step in terms of being a leader for this team. It starts by leading by example and that's something he has done so far this season.\n\n\"But also everything around it, there is still progress to be made and that's a good thing in my opinion, so hopefully he will be very important for the years to come at Liverpool.\"\n\nWhen Klopp signed Szoboszlai - who had impressed at Red Bull Salzburg before joining RB Leipzig in 2021 - he said: \"This is a signing for our present and also for our future.\"\n\nLiverpool will be keen to make sure that remains the case.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Morgan Rogers has long been touted as a Chelsea transfer target, and he’s a top player. Tottenham are now being linked as well.\n\nWhile there’s plenty of season left, it’s no surprise to see attentions turn to the summer. Chelsea will likely look to add another attacking options, and a very popular choice among fans would be Morgan Rogers. The Aston Villa attacker has long been linked with us, and looks a world class star.\n\nNow Tottenham are also being mentioned in connection with the 23 year old. Football Insider report that Spurs could look to be more aggressive in the market now they have new people in charge. After a heavy spend last summer, they’d still likely have to sell, but we can see why Rogers is a popular option.\n\nMorgan Rogers in action for Aston Villa. (Photo by Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)\n\nWe have our doubts about whether Chelsea will be signing Rodgers, as the reported demands of around £100m just make it such a hard deal to do. But if we make it into the Champions League and Liam Rosenior is really happy with the squad, we can see perhaps one big spend in the summer.\n\nOne thing we don’t forsee is Tottenham being the ones to buy him. They’ve even less likely to spend that sort of money, and they’re a far less tempting destination for a player right now. Frankly, it looks most likely he spends another year at Villa right now.\n\nLiam Delap continues to be linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge, but we really don’t see it as likely just yet.\n\nIt looks like Marc Cucurella could be missing for a while, so Chelsea fans are wondering about what possible solutions there could be at left back.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

    "fullText": "Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. \n\nUttarakhand, resuming at 149/5, were bundled out for 233 in 90 minutes. Karnataka, instead of enforcing the follow-on, chose to rest their bowlers and give their batters time in the middle.\n\nThe day began with Karnataka snuffing out Uttarakhand’s resistance swiftly. In reply, Karnataka opened with Mayank Agarwal (21) and Kruthik Krishna (52). Mayank fell at the stroke of lunch, edging Abhay Negi to wicketkeeper Saurabh Rawat. The post-lunch session saw a brief wobble as Shreyas Gopal (0) and Karun Nair (8) departed in quick succession, momentarily slowing the tempo.\n\nKruthik, however, continued his impressive run, bringing up his second successive half-century. But just as he looked set for more, he misread Avneesh Sudha’s googly and was trapped in front. From there, R Smaran and KL Rahul combined to toy with an increasingly weary Uttarakhand attack. Rahul raced to 70 not out off just 67 balls, with three fours and five sixes. He signalled his half-century by launching a Negi delivery into the long-on stands. For now, Kar-nataka’s focus remains clear — complete the formalities and prepare for one final push at a long-awaited ninth title. The final is likely to be staged at the KSCA Rajnagar Stadium in Hubballi.\n\nBrief scores: Karnataka 736 in 194 overs (Smaran 135, Patil 54; Rawat 4-154, Mishra 3-173) & 299/6 (Smaran 127, Rahul 70;) vs Uttarakhand 233 (Raichandani 55, Rawat 45, V Patil 3-40).",

Hoeness is also relishing the chance to experience the atmosphere at Celtic Park once again, nearly a decade after his previous visit.\n\nA view of Celtic Park Celtic v Livingston, Scottish Premiership, Celtic Park, 11 February 2026.

I think they are a team who have had a really turbulent season with a lot of changes in coaches. The current coach is there for a second time this season; he has a special history here.”\n\n“He’s a very experienced coach. It’s a team who have really found form again recently after ups and downs this season. They’ve played a lot of games but have now gone 10 games undefeated. It’s one of the toughest draws we could’ve got but it’s also one of the most exciting.”\n\n“We’ll have the opportunity to play in this historic stadium. It has a really special energy that can be unleashed when the teams harness the energy from the fans. The noise that they make, it gives the team power and energy and we’ll have to be able to counter that.”\n\nCeltic fans display a banner against the board during the Scottish Premiership match between Celtic and Falkirk at Celtic Park on February 01, 2026.

We’re going to try and put ourselves in a good position heading into next week.”\n\nHoeness has highlighted several key players he believes pose a major danger in the Celtic ranks, while also warning that the club’s recent January arrivals could add further unpredictability and create significant challenges for his side.\n\nThe Stuttgart manager said: ”Yes, I would say so.. in general, you can say it’s a really experienced team.”\n\n“Almost every player is around 26/27.

    "fullText": "If you’re looking for a snapshot of why the Detroit Tigers think so highly of Max Clark, it turns out you don’t need a highlight-reel catch or a towering home run.\n\nDuring Tigers’ spring training in Lakeland, one Jeff Seidel of the Detroit Free Press stumbled into a moment that perfectly summed up Clark’s unflappable nature. After practice, Clark was standing in the clubhouse, calm as ever, when he was asked a routine question.\n\nBefore answering, Clark paused, walked over to a trash can — and casually emptied his mouth.\n\nThat’s when he delivered the line.\n\n“I think I just broke a tooth.”\n\nNo panic. No urgency. No sprinting for medical help. Just a matter-of-fact observation, like he was commenting on the weather.\n\nFor a second, it didn’t quite register. Did he really just say that? Was that… his tooth? In the trash?\n\nClark poked around the back of his mouth, confirmed something was off, then shrugged it off like it was a minor inconvenience.\n\n“We’ll get that figured out in a second,” he said.\n\nAnd with that, he nodded — politely — and invited the interview to continue.\n\nThis wasn’t bravado. It wasn’t a tough-guy act. It was something much rarer: complete composure in a moment where most people would absolutely lose it.\n\nA broken tooth would derail a lot of folks. At the very least, it would dominate the moment. Not with Clark.\n\nInstead of rushing to a dentist or calling for help, he centered himself, made sure everything was under control, and shifted his focus back to the task at hand.\n\nThat’s the kind of detail scouts and coaches obsess over — not because of the tooth itself, but because of what it reveals under pressure.\n\nInside the Tigers organization, moments like this don’t shock anyone.\n\nClark has built a reputation as a prospect who doesn’t flinch. Big crowds, big expectations, uncomfortable moments — they don’t seem to rattle him. Whether it’s on the field or in a clubhouse conversation with a literal dental issue unfolding, his approach stays the same.\n\nStay calm. Stay focused. Handle the moment.\n\nIt’s easy to talk about tools, projections, and ceilings. But baseball people will tell you that makeup matters — and sometimes, it shows up in the strangest ways.\n\nLike calmly finishing an interview… right after breaking a tooth.\n\nThe post Max Clark Shows Elite Composure in Bizarre Spring Training Moment appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Joan Laporta is campaigning hard to win next month’s Barcelona elections and has taken aim at match officials in his latest speech.\n\nThe Barca chief was speaking after seeing Hansi Flick’s team left fuming by an eight-minute VAR delay against Atletico Madrid and angry at the decision to allow a late winner for Girona despite a foul on Jules Kounde.\n\nLaporta claims some match officials have a real problem with Barcelona and has called on the team to play even better in the face of adversity.\n\n“There are certain referees who, when they officiate our games, screw us over. Excuse my language, but it’s true. It’s a recurring issue, a constant problem. It’s a reality. I could name them all,” he told reporters.\n\n“This hasn’t happened just once, but many times. In identical plays, they’ve been able to call the wrong thing to harm Barça. It’s blatant.\n\n“We are defending Barça against everything and everyone. Against people who simply can’t accept who we are and what we represent. They can’t stand what we are achieving with our team. This is the only way they can stop us because they can’t stop us on the field.\n\n“We have a team that can aspire to almost anything and face every possible adversity. The best way to deal with this dysfunction and its intentions is to be better and play better , to have a better team and overcome this adversity.”\n\nLaporta also took aim at Real Madrid and feels Los Blancos receive preferential treatment.\n\n“When we’re down, they try to take advantage and crush us. And when others are down, they help them,” he added.\n\n“They’ve learned to swim and they dive in like a pro. We know we have to fight against all that too.”\n\nBarcelona and Real Madrid are back in La Liga action this weekend. Real Madrid are up first on Saturday at Osasuna, while Barcelona play on Sunday against Levante.",

Hayes is also benefitting from the strong passing ability of both Doncic and LeBron James, averaging a career-high 77.2% from the field, as the duo has helped him find easy looks inside the paint.\n\nAs long as Hayes can continue to play the pick-and-roll well with Los Angeles' ball-handlers, he'll have the opportunity to be effective in the Lakers' offense.\n\nThat said, at 7' 0\", Hayes could be a bit better defensively, having never averaged one block or \n\nEither way, it appears Hayes could be a Laker for many seasons to come.\n\nDoncic and Hayes will return to action following the All-Star break Feb. 20 against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nLonzo Ball calls himself the 'scapegoat' following trade from Cavaliers\n\nSpurs' Mason Plumlee deal foreshadows another move to come\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo praises Kon Knueppel: 'One of the smartest rookies I’ve ever seen'\n\nCarter Bryant reveals what happened on final dunk attempt\n\nTyrese Maxey: 'I feel a lot less out of place' after second All-Star appearance\n\nKon Knueppel speaks after third-place in three-point contest",

    "fullText": "Blue Jays' Trey Yesavage leapfrogged shortstop in Toronto hierarchy originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrey Yesavage's rise has been incredible.\n\nThat was exemplified at the end of last season, when he only showed up to the Toronto Blue Jays for the stretch run and then became a dominant postseason force anyway.\n\nThat was lifted expectations for the young right-hander sky high, and he'll have to do his best to meet them.\n\nIt also provided a cool chance for MLB.com's prospect ranking staff to look back. They wrote an article released Thursday which compared who they thought would be each organization's top-ranked prospect, which they predicted two years in advance, to who it actually is.\n\nYesavage pulled off a leapfrog for the Blue Jays.\n\nThe writers had predicted Arjun Nimmala, a shortstop who currently ranks 77th in their top-100. Yesavage ranks No. 12.\n\n\"Toronto’s three most recent first-round picks all feature in our Top 100, and while Nimmala (the 2023 20th overall pick) ranks third of the trio, that isn’t a knock against him,\" MLB.com's writers explain. \"Still only 20 years old, the shortstop made nice improvements in terms of his chase rate at High-A Vancouver last year, and he has the potential to hit 25-plus homers at full maturity as he continues to add strength to his 6-foot-1 frame. He and top 2025 selection JoJo Parker could duke it out for the future of the shortstop position north of the border.\"\n\nGiven that Yesavage pitched across five levels of the organizational ladder in 2025, it's not shocking that he has risen from lower down the board to reach this point.\n\nClearly, he has even more believers now. His fastball-splitter combination has the potential to be dominant for years to come.\n\nAnd it's not like Nimmala has fallen off too far. He can still become an MLB contributor, too.",

    "description": "Wake Forest is getting healthy, Clemson, appears to be sick…but Georgia Tech may be terminal.",
    "fullText": "In Wednesday’s ACC Action, Virginia clocked Georgia Tech, 94-68, and Wake Forest surprised Clemson, 85-77.\n\nWake Forest basically dominated the entire game. A week or two ago, who would have expected that?\n\nWell, here’s something you may have missed – Clemson has lost three straight, to Virginia Tech, Duke and now Wake Forest. And all three losses were by double figures. Prior to this, the Tigers were 13-1 in their last 14 games. Brad Brownell has work to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Wake Forest, despite not really having anyone inside to speak of, is catching fire late. Too late, probably, but it’s still impressive that the Deacs have won three straight.\n\nSteve Forbes has continued to tinker with his lineup. In this one, he went with Tre’Von Spillers, Cooper Schwieger and Sebastian Akins up front and Juke Harris and Myles Colvin the backcourt. Harris led the way with 20 points.\n\nJake Wahlin paced the Tigers with 17.\n\nAs for Virginia, remember that scene in Braveheart when Longshanks realizes that if Wallace can take York, he can get the rest of England?\n\nVirginia shot up 39-9 in the first half. Obviously, the game was over at that point. Georgia Tech gave up 59 points in the first half, en route to losing their eighth straight game.\n\nThe question isn’t really how bad it was. The question is the fallout. NC State got nuked at Louisville two games ago but bounced back nicely against UNC and is still on target for a tournament bid. Meanwhile, Georgia Tech is on target to miss the ACC Tournament, since the bottom three teams won’t go anymore.\n\nHowever, it could still escape this fate as BC and Pitt also have just two ACC wins. We’ll see.\n\nThe other question is this: was it because the Yellow Jackets are really bad or because Virginia is really good?\n\nVirginia has certainly been winning and has won eight straight road games, which is tremendous. However, the Wahoos beat SMU by 4, lost to UNC by 5, nipped Notre Dame by 3, BC by 13, FSU by 3 and Ohio State by 4. We’re tentatively going with the Yellow Jackets being that bad.\n\nOver at WRAL, Pat Welter and Chris Lea discuss Hubert Davis’s UNC and reach the same conclusion we’ve discussed from time to time: Davis has no idea how to communicate with his team.\n\nThat doesn’t mean they won’t win games of course, but it does go a long way to explaining why guys who transfer from UNC do so well at their new schools. Consider Michigan’s Elliott Cadeau, Minnesota’s Cade Tyson and Vanderbilt’s Tyler Nickel for a few quick examples. Consider also that Caleb Love became a consistent and reliable presence at Arizona in his final two years.\n\nRecap: Big First Half Fuels Wake Past Clemson 85-77\n\nWake Forest answers questions about toughness against Clemson 85-77\n\nClemson Jr. Forward Jake Wahlin postgame following loss to Wake Forest\n\nClemson Tigers Fall Behind Early Again, Lose Third Straight Game to Wake Forest\n\nWake Forest remains hot, extends Clemson’s slide\n\nVirginia overwhelms Georgia Tech with historic first half\n\nAnother bad start sends Georgia Tech to eighth straight loss\n\nUVA Basketball: ‘Hoos dominant in 94-68 blowout win at Georgia Tech\n\nEvaluating UVA basketball’s resumé after 26-point win at Georgia Tech\n\nGo to the DBR Boards to find Blue Healer Auctions | Drop us a line",

    "fullText": "Welcome to Music City Miracles’ Tennessee Titans 2026 NFL Free Agency Primer! The negotiating window period begins on March 9th, but the Titans are able to re-sign their own free agents before then. General manager Mike Borgonzi is equipped with more than $100 million in cap space and will collaborate with new head coach Robert Saleh on their shared vision for the 2026 Titans.\n\nThe Titans are currently scheduled to possess 29 free agents (19 unrestricted), including several key starters and role players. Over the next few weeks, we’ll take an in-depth look at each free agent and provide arguments for why the Titans should, or shouldn’t re-sign that player. We’ll also offer our final verdict and a prediction to go along with our analysis.\n\nToday, we’re analyzing offensive tackle Oli Udoh.\n\nUdoh ended up playing a valuable swing role for the Titans behind starters JC Latham and Dan Moore Jr. As far as backup tackles go, he performed reasonably well. Pro Football Focus assigned identical overall and pass-blocking grades of 55.0. The Titans’ offense rarely suffered specifically because Udoh was in the lineup.\n\nPFF also credited Udoh with allowing 19 pressures, three sacks, and being whistled for six penalties. That’s a fair amount of negative plays for a tackle who earned just 274 reps at left and right tackle. Perhaps the Titans could identify a more suitable reserve tackle in free agency.\n\nSpotrac does not have a projected contract for Udoh. He signed a one-year, $1,170,000 million contract with the Titans last offseason. An extension would probably be in a similar range, maybe with a slight raise in pay.\n\nThe Titans should re-sign Udoh. His level of play improved as the campaign progressed forward. Udoh wasn’t a drive-killer when he entered games, and that’s the realistic expectation for reserve tackles. The former Elon standout was even better than recent starters at tackle for the Titans like Dennis Daley, Nicholas Petit-Frere, and Andre Dillard.\n\nThe Titans re-sign Udoh to another one-year contract.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from Kicker journalist Mario Krischel (as captured by @iMiaSanMia), Bayern Munich head coach Vincent Kompany could be contemplating having two starters sit out vs. Eintracht Frankfurt this weekend due to their respective yellow card count:\n\nJoshua Kimmich and Jonathan Tah could start on the bench against Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Both players are on 4 yellow cards, meaning another one would see them miss the game against Borussia Dortmund. Goretzka (also on 4 yellow cards) or Tom Bischof are the alternatives for Kimmich. Kim Min-jae or (Hiroki) Itō would replace Tah.\n\nThis could be interesting for Kompany, who has been reluctant to rotate much at the central midfield and center-back positions. Fans have been clamoring to see more of Bischof in the midfield, will this be the opportunity that the youngster has been waiting for? As for the backline, Kompany has the aforementioned options in Kim and Itō.\n\nNo matter who Kompany opts to go with, he will have proven Bundesliga players at all positions and that is not such a bad spot to be in against a talented squad like Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "It was the sort of scene that just shouldn’t be possible for a team in command of first place.\n\nArsenal were going seven points clear and 2-0 up against the Premier League’s doomed bottom side - only to end the match arguing with Wolves players, after a chaotic late equaliser.\n\nThey suddenly looked like a team out of control.\n\nThere is a profound irony there, that could be seen in Mikel Arteta’s shell-shocked post-game press conference.\n\nThat is because he is a manager who seeks to control more about his team than any manager, including Pep Guardiola.\n\nIt is both the reason that Arsenal are where they are and also a problem that may ultimately prevent them getting where they really, really want to go. The very desire itself has become another issue.\n\nIn trying to fulfil all of that, Arteta has been empowered to fully indulge an instinct that was already there - and has taken them this far - but may now start to be self-defeating at the crucial moment when victory is so close.\n\nThose who know Arteta say he is the ultimate “probabilities guy”. He looks at every single detail - right down to the temperature on the ice baths and the steering wheel on the bus - and assesses what can be done to statistically improve the chances of success there.\n\nSome around the club have already started to wonder how that fits with the selection of Viktor Gyokeres as the main striker signing, a struggling player who may unfairly become a lightning rod for criticism if this doesn’t happen for Arsenal.\n\nOther sources insist that Arteta is no longer playing to the strengths of such attackers, in the way he did around 2022 to 2024. This can be witnessed in relatively pitiful goal numbers for attackers.\n\nAnd it is here where this desire for control is starting to turn into a lock, that is beginning to prevent Arsenal pushing on.\n\nArteta has become so obsessed with increasing probabilities that it is starting to make a long-awaited title less likely.\n\nThe team has become so controlled that they’re becoming constrained. The last two matches - a 2-2 draw against Wolves and 1-1 against Brentford - were vintage examples.\n\nArsenal went ahead in both games and could have kept playing as they were playing against inferior sides, but they seized up and consequently lost control of the game.\n\nThere’s just no need for it to happen, but the fact it does points to something psychological, where their biggest opposition genuinely is themselves.\n\nTheir approach is too clever for its own good, too over-coached, removing a freedom from players that becomes exhausting.\n\nHence this angst about everything, the deep desire for the title interweaving with Arteta’s innate desire for control to amplify the negative effect of both.\n\nIt now means the Basque has to get a hold of this to stop it becoming a negative cycle.\n\nArteta has already told his players that nothing is actually lost yet so they should enjoy the journey, but he may have to go further back in his own journey with this team; to look back to 2022-23.\n\nThe very approach is so different to four years ago and even two years ago.\n\nHence we have this situation where Arsenal are certainly a better squad, with more qualities, but don’t seem to be able to maximise what they’ve got in the same way.\n\nIn 2022-23, after all, many opposition coaches genuinely used to marvel at how difficult they were to play against. Arsenal would pen a team in, with the whirl of movement around Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka then unravelling them. There was real life, but there wasn’t yet experience.\n\nThe team was ultimately too young for the title and wasn’t yet ready, for which there’s no shame. They were also up against a Manchester City who finally became European champions and treble winners. It was asking a lot for a team on their first title challenge to reach that level.\n\nArsenal did get there the next season, and the 16 victories out of the last 18 games of the 2023-24 campaign were probably the best spell of the Arteta era. They were there, having got to 89 points.\n\nCity, the most lavish project ever witnessed in football, still just had more. They got two more points.\n\nBut that is also why last season might have proven another hinge moment, that could yet have turned things in the wrong direction.\n\nGuardiola endured an unprecedented crisis, partly related to his own power at City, and the opportunity was there for Arsenal. Just at that moment, though, they suffered a series of injury crises themselves. Questions were naturally asked about training, and Arteta's approach there. Again, that control.\n\nThe manager’s solution to that, however, was just to greatly deepen the squad last summer.\n\nBut this might have been where that desire for control - this will to constantly increase probabilities - was taken to recruitment, too.\n\nArsenal had greater numbers, but they didn’t necessarily have greater quality. The squad was widened but it wasn’t raised.\n\nThe attack, consequently, does not currently have that greater killer quality that most champions possess. They don't even have the goals of Chelsea's Diego Costa in 2014-15 or 2016-17.\n\nA question persists over whether they should have taken the money for Gyokeres, Noni Madueke and maybe even Eberechi Eze and just gone bigger on guaranteed stardust; to really test a club’s willingness to keep a player in the way champions do.\n\nThe effects of this can be witnessed in the goal numbers.\n\nThe following is a rather crude statistic in the era of proper analytics, but it still really feels like it matters. Who scores for Arsenal when they really need a goal; when they need an opener, an equaliser or a match-winner; those genuine clutch moments that do require teams to go deeper in themselves?\n\nWhen it comes to openers, equalisers or match-winning goals, Martin Zubimendi, Mikel Merino and Gabriel are on top with a mere three each.\n\nThe numbers for the attack just aren’t good enough, which is precisely why it feels like Arsenal are now receding. They’re not pressing home.\n\nLeandro Trossard and Saka are top of this statistic, with just two each. One of Saka’s was last night. Gyokeres does have two, too, but one of those was a penalty against Everton after Odegaard gave him the ball.\n\nThis is generally not champion material. They need more. You need players that offer those moments.\n\nCosta is raised because he offered eight of these goals in 2014-15 and 11 in 2016-17. Eric Cantona famously got four match-winners in consecutive games in 1995-96, contributing to 11. That same season, Ian Wright got seven for Arsenal. The formation of attacks might have changed in the modern game, but the need for individual inspiration does not.\n\nThere’s an obvious point to be made here that talents like Odegaard and Saka should now be producing more as they come into their primes, at 27 and 24 respectively, but then you also return to the question of play, and control.\n\nIs the team still geared that way to maximise their talents? Do they have the emphasis they did over 2022 to 2024? Or is it now too minimalist?\n\nNone of this is to say Arsenal won’t win the league. They’re still in a good position. They’re still probably the best squad in the country - maybe Europe - with the qualities to press this home.\n\nIt’s just that, in a classic contradiction, it is right now as if they are currently reducing their own strong chances.\n\nArteta needs to get a hold of it, but that may involve being able to let go.",

    "description": "Oil prices are up after three straight years of decline as geopolitical tensions ignite supply fears in the energy market.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices have climbed in recent weeks, even as a global surplus has left hundreds of millions of barrels floating offshore.\n\nOn Wednesday, oil prices ended over 4% higher as traders priced in the risk of supply disruptions amid tensions between the US and Iran and uncertainty over the war in Ukraine, after talks in Geneva ended without a breakthrough.\n\nOil futures edged up early Thursday, with US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures trading around $65.30 per barrel at 1:04 a.m., while international benchmark Brent crude was around $70.50 per barrel.\n\nPrices of both grades are around 15% higher this year after three straight years of decline, reflecting a return of the geopolitical risk premium despite a global oil supply surplus.\n\nThe key reason for the disconnect is that much of the surplus has materialized as sanctioned crude \"stuck at sea,\" while inventories in key pricing hubs have remained stable, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a Wednesday note.\n\nGoldman estimates the oil market ran a surplus of about 1.5 million barrels per day in 2025. Normally, that kind of oversupply would weigh heavily on prices.\n\nInstead, many tankers carrying sanctioned crude from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela are sitting at sea, using \"dark fleet\" and shadow shipping tactics to evade sanctions and keep oil moving.\n\nWhile that allows sanctioned oil to keep flowing, it also leaves more barrels lingering at sea, far from storage centers such as the US Gulf Coast and Northwest Europe — regions that anchor global crude pricing.\n\nSanctioned crude inventories on water have risen by around 130 million barrels from a year ago and now stand at roughly 375 million barrels, Goldman estimates. That accounts for about one-third of the increase in global crude inventories.\n\n\"Inventory builds matter less for prices when occurring on water,\" Goldman wrote, because traders discount barrels that may never reach key pricing hubs.\n\nThe buildup stemmed from weaker demand for sanctioned crude late last year, as India and China bought less Russian oil.\n\nThat softer demand reflected shifting geopolitical incentives, including changes in US trade policy, as well as expectations of steeper discounts or possible sanctions relief, the bank added.\n\n\"We assume that the pace of stockpiling moderates at sea but picks up on land,\" Goldman wrote.\n\nThe bank expects the share of oil inventory tied up offshore to fall from about 47% in 2025 to roughly 21% in 2026.\n\nHolding its global surplus estimate constant, Goldman's framework suggests that every 1 million barrels per day of sanctioned crude that piles up at sea for 12 months can lift Brent by as much as $8 per barrel.\n\nMeanwhile, every 100 million barrel reduction in oil stored offshore — as cargoes move into land-based inventories — could lower prices by $3 to $4.\n\nGoldman expects Brent to average $56 per barrel and WTI $52 in 2026, the bank's analysts wrote in a separate note on January 11.",

    "description": "People are using GLP-1s to cut back on alcohol use disorder, but there are already three FDA-approved drugs: naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram.",
    "fullText": "To some extent, Americans are talking about alcohol more than ever. We're having open conversations about the negative health impacts of drinking. People are consuming less booze overall and examining strategies to moderate, even as each drink packs more punch. There is one aspect of alcohol we're still not talking about: addiction, and, more precisely, the medical treatments available to combat it. What's even odder — your doctor may not know much about them, either.\n\nEven as researchers examine the potential for GLP-1s such as Ozempic and Zepbound to reduce alcohol consumption, the most underappreciated story in alcohol use disorder isn't the promise of new drugs. It's why the ones we already have are so rarely used. There are three FDA-approved medications to treat AUD in the US: naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram. They've existed for decades, are effective for some people in reducing or stopping drinking, and, addiction physicians say, have few drawbacks.\n\nDespite all of this, they are broadly unknown to patients and widely underprescribed. Just 2% of Americans with an alcohol disorder diagnosis receive approved medications for treatment, says Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. By comparison, 85% of people diagnosed with diabetes get approved treatments for it.\n\nThese drugs aren't a panacea — like all medications, some things work for some people and not others. But they're an important tool in a toolbox to treat a condition that affects millions of Americans and takes thousands of lives each year.\n\n\"The challenge here is to really treat addiction the same way we treat diabetes, hypertension, cancer, Parkinson's, depression, and the list goes on and on,\" Leggio says.\n\nAt a basic level, the medications used to treat alcohol use disorder do something quite simple: they make drinking less appealing.\n\nThe first is naltrexone, which was first developed to treat opioid use disorder. It blocks the warm, buzzy feelings of alcohol — people may still drink, but it doesn't do much for them. (They'll still get the impaired effects of alcohol, just not the euphoria.) Some people use naltrexone to undertake what's called the \"Sinclair Method,\" where they take the drug an hour before starting drinking so that when the session begins, the pleasurable effects from the alcohol are blunted. The idea is that if the person takes naltrexone every time they drink, the associated reward with alcohol will lessen, reducing cravings over time and thus leading to a significant drop in drinking or even abstinence. Some people may choose to take naltrexone only when they have what could be a potentially heavy drinking event, like a wedding, so they end the night with two drinks instead of 10. Naltrexone is also available through an extended-release one-month injection.\n\nAnother option is acamprosate, which restores brain balance after it's been thrown off by heavy alcohol use and can help reduce cravings, though it doesn't reduce alcohol's effects in the moment. It's prescribed more commonly in Europe. The final of the trio is disulfiram, which inhibits the body's ability to break down alcohol — essentially, it makes people sick if they drink. It's the least commonly prescribed of the three because of high rates of patient noncompliance.\n\nResearch shows that naltrexone can help reduce heavy drinking and cravings, and acamprosate can help promote abstinence and prevent a return to drinking.\n\n\"I really view medications as being tremendously helpful in turning the volume down on craving, on withdrawal symptoms, on some of the other reasons that people struggle,\" says Katie Witkiewitz, a psychologist at the University of New Mexico who specializes in substance use disorders.\n\nEffectiveness can vary among patients and can be modest, as with many medications. The same goes for side effects, which can include headache or nausea (sometimes caused by naltrexone), and lack of appetite or irritability (sometimes caused by acamprosate). Addiction specialists say the medications are generally well-tolerated by most patients.\n\n\"There's lots of benefits and very few drawbacks,\" says Sarah Wakeman, the senior medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham in Boston. \"These medications are incredibly safe, and you need very little, if any, lab monitoring.\"\n\nThe drugs are also hyper affordable — naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram are all generics, and they're generally covered by insurance. The exception is Vivitrol, the naltrexone injection, which is still under patent.\n\nGiven how straightforward these medications are, it's natural to ask why they aren't used more often. The answer is complicated, having to do with the stigma around addiction, lack of patient knowledge, and the ways in which our society and the medical establishment treat alcohol.\n\nAlcoholism is a disease of denial — individuals often minimize, rationalize, or lie about their drinking. Even people who drink moderately tend to fudge the numbers when asked about their alcohol habits, either by their doctor or people they know. Our culture writ large is in denial about alcoholism, too. We tend to treat it as a lack of willpower, as a moral failing, and a bad habit people need to knock off. We generally don't see it as the chronic condition it is.\n\nMany people may not realize they are engaging in problem drinking, and if they do, they may not go to their doctors about it. Treatment for alcohol use disorder has \"largely evolved outside of the mainstream of healthcare,\" says Dr. Caleb Alexander, a practicing internist and drug safety expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Historically, it's been siloed into specialty treatment programs — behavioral therapies, rehabilitation centers, or groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or SMART Recovery. These work for some people, but not everyone. Alexander adds that many of these settings don't have prescribers, formularies, or medication management that would provide access to AUD drugs. Some groups may also be opposed to medication intervention.\n\nThose who do seek help through the healthcare system often run into discouraging obstacles, and doctors themselves may be ill-equipped to help. Physicians are often poorly trained in addiction medicine in medical school or residency. They may not be versed in the medications available or have a misperception that they need specialization to prescribe them. Doctors are also people, and they may hold the same biases as anyone else about alcohol.\n\n\"A lot of doctors don't even want to have these conversations at all,\" says Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University who specializes in addiction and a former senior policy advisor in the Obama administration.\n\nThe result: the medications that are at doctors' fingertips go woefully under-discussed and under-prescribed. People lie to their doctors about their drinking instead of having open, honest talks. Because these drugs are generics and don't lead to a huge payday for manufacturers, there's no marketing money behind them, and they have no champions. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy: Since there is such a small market now, potential innovations for alcohol addiction are stunted.\n\n\"If doctors don't want to prescribe it and patients have never heard of it, then a company is not going to develop the next drug for drinking because they're like, 'It's a waste of money,'\" Humphreys says.\n\nThere are some online providers to fill the void, such as telehealth company Oar Health and Ria Health, which focus on medication-assisted alcohol treatment. They can be options for people who may be too embarrassed to go to their doctors or whose doctors are resistant to trying medications, but they're also costlier and may not come with the same level of supervision.\n\nThere are some signs that this neglect may not be a permanent state of affairs.\n\nResearchers are studying whether GLP-1s such as semaglutide and tirzepatide might help reduce alcohol consumption. While some early evidence is promising, experts say it's too early to tell just how effective they might ultimately be. If GLP-1s do prove useful in helping to treat alcohol use disorder, they have some advantages other medications do not: there's a lot of money and momentum behind them.\n\n\"They're already part of the cultural milieu,\" Witkiewitz says. \"People are using them, people are wanting them, and that's not something we typically see with medications.\"\n\nGLP-1 makers were initially hesitant to investigate the effectiveness of their drugs on alcohol use because they were concerned it might damage their brands, Humphreys says, in another example of just how pervasive the addiction stigma is. Now, \"the companies have decided they're going to go for it.\"\n\nAt the moment, GLP-1s are merely a hope in helping people manage problem alcohol use. The reality is that there are options out there, they're just often ignored. The overarching barrier has more to do with lack of will than lack of way. Ideally, there would be multiple other drugs under development for the treatment of AUD, and more patients and doctors would know about what's already out there.\n\n\"All these tools that we have, from 12 steps to AAs to behavior treatment to medications, they're not mutually exclusive,\" Leggio says.\n\nThe way we talk about and approach drinking can and should evolve. The FDA recently formally recognized a reduction in drinking as a valid endpoint in alcohol-related clinical trials, meaning the goal of medications under development doesn't need to be total abstinence — it can also be helping people to slow down. It's a \"paradigm shift,\" Witkiewitz says, and may lead to more drugs to help curb drinking and more doctors aware of the health benefits of cutting back.\n\nThe real test is whether we finally treat alcohol addiction like a disease rather than a character flaw. We've done it with other conditions before. While there's still a stigma around obesity, that is changing, thanks in part to GLP-1s, as more people accept the idea that weight loss is about more than willpower.\n\n\"There's this idea that medications are a crutch or making it an easy way out,\" Wakeman says.\n\nPerhaps a better parallel is depression. For years, it, too, was swept under the rug. People were told to shake it off. Today, it's widely understood as a treatable condition. There are a variety of medications available, and many patients try different formulations and dosages until they find the right fit. For some people, medication isn't the answer, and they use other strategies to combat and mitigate it. People aren't expected to be free of depressive episodes forever, even with treatment, and in many circles, it's quite commonplace to discuss, whether at the doctor's office or over lunch.\n\n\"Prior to Prozac becoming now a completely banal thing that you can talk about at a dinner party, depression was, 'You need a kick in the butt, pick yourself up, what's the matter with you?'\" Humphreys says.\n\nAlcohol use disorder could now be reaching a similar inflection point. The science behind treatments has existed for years, but the culture has lagged behind. GLP-1 drugs may help to accelerate a shift in how we think about medication to curb drinking. And if we're talking so much about the dangers of drinking, shouldn't we be giving people as much help as possible to slow down and stop?\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.\n\nTexas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.\n\nThat amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.\n\nThat 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.\n\nPart of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.\n\nThe state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.\n\nTexas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.\n\nNorthern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Salesforce says it's at the vanguard of the AI revolution and has even toyed with renaming itself Agentforce in honor of its bet on AI agents. The company is rapidly adopting AI internally as well, and a survey obtained by Business Insider reveals how that's actually playing out behind the scenes.\n\nThe results — which were broadly positive — show that most employees feel AI is increasing their productivity, although fewer say it's lightening their workloads.\n\nSalesforce's annual \"Great Insights\" survey, which is not public, was conducted in November 2025 and released inside the software company the following month. It surveyed about 80% of the 76,000-person workforce.\n\nMost questions about AI received high favorability ratings: In addition to the 81% of employees who said AI tools boost productivity, 83% said they feel equipped to handle AI risks such as bias, and 81% said they felt encouraged to experiment with AI.\n\nMore than half of employees — 57% — said AI tools helped their team identify opportunities that would have been impossible otherwise. And 62% said their workload is more manageable because they use AI tools. Both of these were among the lowest results in the survey.\n\nSalesforce told Business Insider in a statement that the survey showed significant gains in AI use and strong enthusiasm. A composite it creates called the AI Readiness score was at 85% enterprise-wide, an 18% gain year-over-year.\n\n\"We're thrilled that our employees have moved on from adoption and are seeing AI tools make a meaningful impact in their daily work,\" a Salesforce spokesperson said.\n\nThe results suggest that Salesforce is ahead of the pack on encouraging AI adoption, said Jason Schloetzer, an associate professor at Georgetown University's business school who has interviewed dozens of executives about AI adoption. The results also show that, for some employees, AI intensifies their workload rather than reducing it.\n\n\"The gaps suggest people believe AI is enabling them to do more work, but it's not making their work easier,\" he said.\n\nSalesforce, which sells customer relationship management software, has garnered attention for an intense AI push led by CEO Marc Benioff. Last August, he said half of the work at Salesforce was being done by AI and that the company had eliminated 4,000 support roles because of AI agents.\n\nSalesforce's website says the company uses a mix of internal AI tools, including an AI from Salesforce-owned Slack that can quickly find old project templates, and Career Connect, which analyzes employees' strengths and weaknesses to help them move within the company.\n\nSalesforce is facing challenges despite its embrace of the AI revolution. Its stock is down over 40% in the past year as concerns mount about the fate of legacy software companies amid the arrival of AI tools from OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nThe company has also struggled to deliver on promises made in demos of its AI product Agentforce, Business Insider previously reported.",

    "description": "Kathryn Shiber is suing Centerview over claims of disability discrimination. Court docs suggest Wall Street culture itself will also be on the stand.",
    "fullText": "A lawsuit offering a rare look at the daily grind of junior investment bankers is scheduled to begin next week, and court documents suggest that potential jurors will be asked to reckon with their relationship to Wall Street culture.\n\nThe case hinges on Kathryn Shiber, who alleges that boutique investment bank Centerview Partners violated disability discrimination laws when it fired her because she couldn't consistently work into the early morning hours. Shiber joined the firm as a junior banker in July 2020, after graduating from Dartmouth College. After a few consecutive days working past midnight, she said told human resources that she had to get between eight and nine hours of sleep each night because of an underlying mood and anxiety disorder, and got approval for some accommodations. In September, the New York-based firm fired her because she could not perform the essential job functions, according to her suit.\n\nThe proposed voir dire questions — the screening questions lawyers use to assess whether potential jurors can be impartial— hint that Wall Street's notoriously grueling culture will be on display once the trial kicks off.\n\n\"Do you feel it is fair for an employer to expect that employees work long or unpredictable hours if employees are compensated for those hours?\" Centerview proposes asking in its voir dire document.\n\nCenterview has also proposed asking potential jurors whether they have \"any opinions or beliefs about Wall Street, the finance industry, or investment banking\" that would impact their impartiality. Shiber's lawyers take it a step further, proposing that they ask specifically whether jurors have \"strong opinions\" about investment banking or \"people who work\" in the industry.\n\nDepositions filed in the case indicate that junior bankers, formally known as first-year analysts, should expect to work between 60 and 120 hours per week. Hours are unpredictable and can stretch into the early morning, Tony Kim, then a partner and now the co-president of investment banking at Centerview, said in his deposition. 24-hour days are possible, but rare, he said, adding that juniors staffed on an active deal are expected to check in before going to sleep.\n\n\"Junior bankers obviously don't need permission to go to sleep, but are expected to work together and communicate properly with teammates,\" Centerview told Business Insider in a statement. Shiber's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth sides have also proposed quizzing jurors on mental health and discrimination. Centerview's attorneys, for example, have proposed asking potential jurors whether they have ever requested accommodations at a job for a disability or filed a grievance for employment-related reasons.\n\n\"Do you think today's employment laws make it too easy for an employee to sue an employer for discrimination?\" Shiber's lawyers proposed asking.\n\nJunior bankers' mental health came under intense scrutiny in 2024, after Leo Lukenas III, an investment banking associate at Bank of America, died. Some firms implemented policies they said would help track and limit hours. But 2026 is expected to see an M&A boom, potentially pushing junior bankers to log even more hours as deal activity picks up.\n\nJurors could also be asked about Centerview bankers who might come up at trial. The voir dire questionnaire from Shiber's lawyers shows they have considered asking about Robert Pruzan, the firm's cofounder and a well-known M&A banker.\n\nWall Street, known for its high pay, has at times become a cultural flashpoint — most notably during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests over the financial crisis. More recently, President Donald Trump has introduced a policy that he has said will lower costs for everyday Americans by capping the interest banks can charge on credit cards to 10% for a year.\n\nAll the while, finance titans are earning record pay, and Americans' relationship to capitalism itself is changing — meaning that answering voir dire questions about the people who dot the halls of prestigious firms may not be a simple task.",

    "description": "OpenAI just poached the celebrity whisperer Charles Porch away from Instagram. It makes sense when you consider how anti-AI some celebs have been.",
    "fullText": "A \"detriment\" to human creativity, said Vince Gilligan, creator of \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Pluribus\" about AI. \"Horrifying,\" said James Cameron about the possibility of AI actors. \"I'd rather die,\" said Guillermo del Toro. \"Incredibly destructive,\" said Cate Blanchett.\n\nIt's not hard to see why OpenAI recognizes it has a bit of an image problem among some people in Hollywood. It appears that the company is now trying to change that.\n\nOpenAI just poached Charles Porch from Meta, where he oversaw celebrity partnerships for over a decade, as Vanity Fair reported earlier. Porch is generally recognized for helping make Instagram the cultural juggernaut it is today by helping celebrities who might have been confused by or disinterested in newfangled social media join and use the platform.\n\nPorch has deep connections in the entertainment industry — celebrities like Harry Styles attended his lavish wedding this summer in France.\n\nPorch wrote on his personal Instagram about his job change:\n\n\"From helping Beyoncé figure out how to launch an album exclusively on social media to onboarding Pope Francis to Instagram (he held my hands and asked me to pray for him) to watching creators become the next generation of entrepreneurs, the impact on culture that me and the team have been able to have is something that I take great pride in.\"\n\nIt's not clear exactly what Porch's new gig will entail. He told Vanity Fair that his first step will be to go on a \"listening tour\" to hear the hopes and fears about AI from creatives and celebrities. I've asked OpenAI for comment.\n\nFor Hollywood actors, filmmakers, and studio executives, those fears are pretty big. Why wouldn't Brad Pitt be alarmed to see a passably real AI-generated version of himself in a fist-fight against Tom Cruise?\n\nThe idea that AI could replace actors, screenwriters, and other creatives is alarming, especially as Hollywood as an industry is hurting. Box office sales haven't bounced back from the pandemic, streaming is complicated, fewer and fewer projects are being made, and efforts to cut costs by filming overseas have devastated Los Angeles' middle-class of film industry workers.\n\nOn top of that, AI is, as far as I can tell, widely considered a theft machine that gobbled up tons of images and videos from movies and TV for training data, largely without permission or compensation.\n\nYou can see a filmmaker or actor's point of view here: They stole my face and my work to build this tool, and now they want to use it to make soulless slop that will undercut the value of my work?\n\nNot great! I imagine Porch has his work cut out for him.\n\nOpenAI and other AI companies have started making deals with Hollywood. Disney made a $1 billion deal with OpenAI around the time Sora 2 launched, licensing Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader, and also becoming a customer and investor in OpenAI. Lionsgate and AMC made deals allowing their catalogs to be used for training Runway. (Business Insider, through our parent company, has a somewhat similar deal with OpenAI.)\n\nBut those deals with studios, while they might stave off copyright lawsuits and create some cash flow, aren't winning over the hearts and minds of the celebrities and creatives — the kinds of people who make headlines when they call AI \"horrifying.\"\n\nPerhaps OpenAI is realizing that celebrities still hold the kind of cultural capital that can't be built in the Bay Area. And while OpenAI has been pretty successful in pushing its agenda in Washington, thanks to an AI-friendly administration, it still has an uphill battle to win over the general public, which remains fairly skeptical of AI.\n\nAnd for that, you need to get the celebs on board. There's a beautiful irony now that these big AI companies are paying big bucks to hire human writers, and VCs are now obsessed with the concept of \"taste.\"\n\nIt turns out that kinds of \"soft skills\" that had long been undervalued in Silicon Valley are more relevant than ever now that AI can do a lot of the technical work. And someone like Charles Porch, who has the connections and ability to charm a roomful of Hollywood types and other cultural elites, is more valuable than ever. That's the kind of job AI can't take.",

    "description": "Meta's shift to AI builders is redefining roles, as product managers adopt AI coding tools for increased productivity and innovation.",
    "fullText": "Meta product managers are rebranding. Some are now calling themselves \"AI builders,\" a signal that AI coding tools are changing who gets to build software inside the company.\n\nOne of them, Jeremie Guedj, announced the change in a LinkedIn post last week. \"I still can't believe I'm writing this: as of today, my full-time job at Meta is AI Builder,\" he wrote.\n\nGuedj has spent more than a decade as a traditional product manager, a role that sets the road map and strategy for products then built by engineering teams. He said that while his title in Meta's internal systems still lists him as a product manager, his actual work is now full-time building with AI on what he calls an \"AI-native team.\"\n\nAnother Meta product manager also lists \"AI Builder\" on her LinkedIn profile, while at least two other Meta engineers write the term in their bios, Business Insider found.\n\nThe shift aligns with a message CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed on Meta's most recent earnings call: 2026 is when AI tools would meaningfully reshape how work gets done inside the company. AI coding tools have already shaken up the tech industry, allowing more people with fewer technical skills to build apps from scratch.\n\n\"We're investing in AI-native tooling, so individuals at Meta can get more done,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams. We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single very talented person.\"\n\nGuedj's role reads like a practical expression of that vision. In his post, he described his team as one \"where data and knowledge are AI-friendly at their core, and where humans and AI agents work together, synchronously and asynchronously.\"\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"AI builder\" isn't a formal Meta designation, at least not yet. Guedj acknowledged it isn't his official title.\n\nOne Meta employee who wished to stay anonymous because they weren't authorized to speak to the press said that the label is not an official role and is more likely an experiment within a specific organization as Meta pushes toward AI-native teams across the company. Reality Labs, Meta's division responsible for its smart glasses and virtual reality efforts, is one of those organizations, this person said.\n\n\"Software engineers are becoming product managers and product managers becoming software engineers,\" they added. \"The idea is to make individual contributors more productive.\"\n\nInside Meta, the drift from coordinator to builder has been visible for months. In November, Joseph Spisak, a product director in Meta's Superintelligence Labs, said that product managers at the company were vibe-coding prototypes and showing them directly to Zuckerberg.\n\n\"We can literally vibe code products in a matter of hours, days, and explore the space,\" Spisak said.\n\nIn January, another Meta product manager, Zevi Arnovitz, said on a podcast that using AI coding tools felt like being handed \"superpowers.\" Arnovitz, who said he has no technical background, described rebuilding his workflow around AI — operating less like a conductor moving work between engineering and design and more like a product owner who can execute.\n\nSome companies are moving beyond experimentation. In December, LinkedIn scrapped its long-running associate product manager program and replaced it with an associate product builder track.\n\nTomer Cohen, LinkedIn's chief product officer at the time, said on a podcast that the company wanted to train new hires who can code, design, and manage products — people \"who can flex across\" traditional role boundaries.\n\nLast year, Madhu Gurumurthy, the company's product head for AI models, tweeted that the company was moving to a \"building-first\" culture. In an age of vibe-coding, Gurumurthy said, product managers can show, not tell. \"Role profiles are blurring, creativity and building are happening in parallel,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Each company is approaching this differently and is still figuring this out,\" one product manager at Google, who wished to stay anonymous, told Business Insider. \"I've been encouraging designers and product managers on my team to blur roles a bit.\"\n\nAs Guedj, the self-proclaimed Meta AI builder, put it: \"Building has always been my passion. AI gave me the ability to turn ideas into real, working apps. That changed everything.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "description": "AI token processing has soared recently on OpenRouter, while Nvidia GPU rental prices have jumped.",
    "fullText": "AI demand has surged in recent weeks, according to new data that could support tech giants' decisions to dramatically ramp up investment in this area.\n\nOpenRouter, which helps developers access different AI models, has seen activity roughly double in the first weeks of 2026.\n\nThis is measured by the number of AI tokens OpenRouter processes. AI models break down words and other inputs into numerical tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about ¾ of a word.\n\nOpenRouter handled 13 trillion AI tokens in the week that ended February 9. That's up from 6.4 trillion during the first week of January.\n\nSeen over a year, this recent surge is even more striking. AI models that OpenRouter taps into include Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, OpenAI's GPT range, and a host of open-source offerings from DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and others.\n\nThis data excludes AI tokens processed directly by the major AI companies, so it represents a small fraction of total activity. For instance, Google was processing 1.3 quadrillion tokens a month this past summer. However, the recent rate of change in OpenRouter's data is a valuable signal.\n\nAnand Iyer, a partner at VC firm Lightspeed, said the recent surge has been driven by an explosion in AI agent activity and especially the rapid emergence of OpenClaw, an open-source agentic system.\n\nThat's sparked an exponential increase in inference, which is how models, agents, and other AI services are run in the cloud.\n\n\"The demand for AI inference right now is coming from agentic platforms, especially OpenClaw,\" Iyer told Business Insider this week. \"We moved from simple chatbot experiences to agentic automation and execution, which has driven exponential growth of OpenClaw installations and OpenRouter usage.\"\n\nThere are other signs of rising AI use. Data compiled by Bloomberg suggests demand for Nvidia AI chips has increased lately. The chart below shows the cost to rent Nvidia H100 GPUs. As you can see, prices have rebounded strongly since early December, which implies robust AI demand.\n\nOpenClaw launched in November 2025. That coincides with the H100 rebound here.\n\nA third data point comes from Barclays analysts, who recently looked at online traffic to vibe coding services, including Lovable, Replit, and Wix's Base44.\n\nThe consumer website-based vibe coding services Barclays tracks saw traffic jump 17% month over month in January.\n\n\"This was the strongest growth since April 2025,\" the analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. \"The uptick in interest here was driven largely by frontier model improvements in late 2025 that made these platforms more effective.\"\n\nThe debate still rages over whether AI will be used enough to justify all the heavy investments being made. Big Tech companies recently increased capital expenditure plans to eye-watering levels, raising new concerns about a potential AI bubble.\n\nThis new AI usage data may suggest that demand could be strong enough to support such heavy spending.\n\n\"AI capex today, as we know it today, is largely driven by training requirements from large frontier labs,\" Iyer said.\n\nTraining is a data- and energy-intensive process in which AI models are created in massive data centers. Inference comes after models are run.\n\n\"The sustainability is warranted as long as the revenue produced by inference (which is growing exponentially) will justify the output from the training,\" Iyer said. \"Which seems to be working so far.\"\n\nOpenClaw is part of a broader evolution of generative AI. The era kicked off with a bang when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, and the chatbot became the fastest-growing tech product in history.\n\nMore recently, AI models have begun to support autonomous digital agents and similar tools that can use computers independently to accomplish complex tasks.\n\nOpenClaw's open-source technology supports agents that help users automate coding and other workflows by accessing computer files, email, calendars, and messaging services.\n\nIn January, Anthropic unveiled Claude Cowork, an AI agent that handles tasks such as document generation and file management.\n\nThe startup rolled out Claude Sonnet 4.6, its latest AI model, this week. It's gotten better at what Anthropic calls \"computer use,\" where AI models and agents use computers in similar ways to humans to get tasks done.\n\n\"The model sees the computer and interacts with it in much the same way a person would: clicking a (virtual) mouse and typing on a (virtual) keyboard,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog on Tuesday.\n\nThis type of machine-to-machine activity is behind a lot of the surge in AI token use lately. It makes sense: most people can use a computer for seven or eight hours a day. Then, they need a break or a nap. AI models never sleep and can hack away at a task uninterrupted until it's done.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "OpenAI and Meta alum Philip Su said that AI was turning software engineers into managers. The IC role is \"dead,\" he wrote.",
    "fullText": "Use AI at work? You might be a manager and not even know it.\n\nPhilip Su is on the frontline of AI. He worked at OpenAI until 2025, when he left to found his startup, Superphonic. Before that, he worked at Microsoft and Meta.\n\nIn January, Su made a provocative claim on Substack: \"AI Killed the Individual Contributor.\"\n\nSu wrote that software engineers are asked to perform tasks once reserved for managers: set priorities, resolve conflicts, and give feedback. Rather than building, they're spending time \"pondering and tweaking the machine that builds the thing.\"\n\n\"The halcyon days of the IC are over,\" Su wrote. \"Not because AI codes better than you, but because maximizing your productivity necessitates focusing your time on all the things that are, at the end of the day, manager tasks.\"\n\nSu doubled down this week on the podcast \"A Life Engineered.\" He said the IC role was \"probably over\" because engineers were delegating their work to AI.\n\nIf everyone's a manager (of AI), do we need managers (of humans) anymore? Su said yes. There's a \"human coordination problem\" that AI cannot solve, he said.\n\nSu's theory of managerial takeover comes amid the \"great flattening\" in Big Tech. Flat org charts are all the rage: few managers, many ICs. Elon Musk's companies are known for their lack of managers; Amazon and Meta have recently culled management layers as they aim to increase their IC-to-manager ratios.\n\nMeanwhile, tech CEOs are also embracing \"founder mode.\" The reviled opposite of that, according to Paul Graham's 2024 essay, is \"manager mode.\"\n\nBut maybe managers are back en vogue — so long as they're managing AI agents. Vercel COO Jeanne DeWitt Grosser told Business Insider that companies will see a new role: the \"agent manager.\"\n\nThe tools will get better, too. Su already finds that he has to review AI-written code \"less carefully\" than he used to.\n\n\"It might currently feel like managing a team of barely-competent interns,\" he wrote in his essay. \"It'll soon feel like managing a team of very high performers, each better, faster, and smarter than you.\"",

    "title": "Trump's plan to 'deprioritize' student-loan oversight has lawmakers worried about how your servicer is performing",
    "description": "After the major student-loan companies declined to release their own performance data, Sen. Elizabeth Warren requested information from the Ed. Dept.",
    "fullText": "Curious how your student-loan servicer is performing? You might be out of luck — for now.\n\nWhen asked by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren for data on their performances, the major student-loan servicers delivered nearly identical responses — exclusively reviewed by Business Insider — that referred the lawmaker back to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office.\n\nOne servicer, MOHELA, wrote in a January 5 email to Warren that it has \"a formal statement that FSA has requested we send.\"\n\nThe statement, which the other servicers also sent, stated: \"Because your letter requests information and data maintained by the Department's office of Federal Student Aid, we respectfully ask that the request be redirected to the Department via the Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs.\"\n\nMonitoring student-loan servicers' performance will become more critical this year as the Department of Education begins implementing its repayment changes that President Donald Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. It will also prove more difficult after the Trump administration slashed staff at the consumer watchdog that played a large role in doing so.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers have expressed confusion about the changes, and lawmakers and policy experts have previously stressed the importance of ensuring that servicers are equipped to effectively implement new repayment plans, borrowing caps, and other reforms.\n\nIn response to a prior information request from Warren, Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent wrote in a letter in September 2025 that \"FSA is prioritizing efforts to improve customer service to student and parent borrowers,\" and did not comment on formally releasing performance metrics.\n\nThe last comprehensive report on servicer performance and borrower data posted on FSA's website covered the quarter ending September 30, 2024. Past reports have included customer satisfaction scores, average speed to answer calls, and data on the servicers' portfolios. Warren and Sen. Jeff Merkley wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that, following the servicers' responses, they are requesting that the Department of Education publish servicer performance data and make it available to the public.\n\n\"ED has repeatedly refused to comply with Congressional requests for basic servicer performance data and now appears to be refusing to allow federal student loan servicers to provide this information, despite previous Administrations granting such requests,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nWarren and Merkley requested that the Department of Education provide data on a range of topics, including call center performance, customer service staff levels, and communication efforts to borrowers in delinquency and default.\n\nOversight over the industry has declined due to the Trump administration's gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog that Warren helped create. The CFPB's chief legal officer directed the agency's employees in an April 2025 memo to \"deprioritize\" student-loan oversight, saying that the goal was to shift oversight responsibility to the states.\n\nAdditionally, Warren and a group of her Democratic colleagues released a new report in early February detailing how private lenders are preparing for an influx of federal borrowers due to the new borrowing caps set to go into effect this summer. They wrote that their findings \"underscore an urgent need for oversight of the private lending market as these companies prepare to cash in on the Administration's agenda.\"",

    "description": "David Chong quit his Microsoft job to build a startup. Weeks later, most of his belongings were stolen, but he doesn't regret going all in.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chong, a 38-year-old startup founder in Toronto. He previously worked as a senior software engineer at Microsoft until resigning last September. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI resigned from Microsoft in September 2025. Less than a month later, I lost almost everything I owned.\n\nDuring my move from New York City to my hometown of Toronto, the trailer transporting my belongings was stolen in the middle of the night. The trailer was eventually recovered, but none of my belongings were.\n\nWhile resigning from Microsoft set me down this unfortunate path, I believe leaving Big Tech was the right move for me. I've had to learn what the Zen monks preach about letting go of your earthly possessions to reach enlightenment.\n\nIn 2016, I moved from Canada to New York City on a work visa. Before joining Microsoft, I worked at a smaller tech company for nearly seven years, starting as a junior employee and working my way up to a leadership role as a lead product engineer.\n\nWhen I joined Microsoft as a senior software engineer in 2022, it felt like a bit of a backtrack in terms of title. I thought it would be easy to get promoted back to a higher level, but it definitely wasn't; I held the same position for nearly three years.\n\nAt my previous employer, it felt like your work spoke for itself, but at Microsoft, it felt like I would have to develop a \"getting promoted\" skill — doing a lot of internal self-promotion to make sure my work got noticed outside my immediate team — to actually move up.\n\nFrom what I heard, the need to actively self-promote in order to move up is a broader trend across Big Tech. It seemed pretty non-transferable outside the Big Tech world, so I wasn't very interested in developing it.\n\nIn my last few years at Microsoft, the company went through multiple restructurings that moved me to different teams. In the most recent round, some of our managers were laid off.\n\nThe layoffs didn't make me too concerned about my job security, in part because my department seemed starved for engineering talent. However, I was growing frustrated with the slow promotion timeline.\n\nThere also seemed to be rising expectations at the company around productivity and working from the office. The message from leadership seemed to be that we needed to ramp up and adjust because times were changing.\n\nThe other thing that made me start considering leaving was that I wasn't learning as much as I wanted to, partially because I had become the most senior person on my team.\n\nIn early 2025, I started thinking seriously about leaving Microsoft and figuring out my next career move. It was a very difficult decision. I was working on a TN visa, which was tied specifically to Microsoft, and resigning would likely mean moving back to Toronto and committing to a future outside the US, unless I could find another company willing to sponsor me. I'd come to the US thinking about living here long-term. Microsoft had already started the green card process for me, and quitting would mean giving that up as well.\n\nAround last April, a friend opened my eyes to the possibility of entrepreneurship. I became more interested in that path and started doing a lot of research on how to build a business. I decided that if I left Microsoft, I would pursue entrepreneurship.\n\nIn September, I resigned from Microsoft. I wasn't too worried about giving up my $192,000 a year salary because I consider myself very risk-tolerant. I've saved up enough of a buffer to go without income for several years, and I don't have any dependents.\n\nLosing my belongings during the move definitely hurt my productivity, forcing me to delay my startup plans by a few months.\n\nOf everything I owned, all I had left was what I packed for the flight in my backpack and carry-on bag. I landed in Toronto without winter clothes or a bed — I had to sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag.\n\nI focused on resolving the move issues: trying to figure out what happened, contacting the police, and dealing with the insurance claim. I'd unfortunately gotten the lowest insurance rate for my move, so the insurance payout was less than even what I paid for the moving service.\n\nAnd of course, there was the financial impact of replacing everything. So far, I've spent around $12,000 on essentials like a couch, bed, air fryer, Instant Pot, and clothing. Since everything was stolen, I'm starting from scratch in more ways than one.\n\nHowever, I've made progress with my AI sales agent business, Falco, in recent months. It's still in development and isn't ready for customers yet, but it has launched publicly.\n\nWhen it comes to building a startup, I don't think the idea necessarily matters as much as the execution. I'm hopeful that if I just go all in, move fast, and constantly test my ideas, I should be OK. My plan is to give myself about three years to pursue entrepreneurship. If all else fails, I'll go back into the job market.\n\nMy advice is to try to put yourself in your own shoes five to 10 years from now. When I do that, I look back at the decision I'm facing and ask myself, \"Would I regret not doing this?\"\n\nIf the answer is yes, I try to do the thing I'd regret not doing. I've often heard that older people regret the chances they didn't take more than the ones they did.\n\nIn hindsight, I think this mindset is what helped me decide to move to New York and join Microsoft — two decisions that had their pros and cons, but that I don't regret. My first job in New York helped me build the experience that landed me at Microsoft, and Microsoft gave me the opportunity to grow my skills and meet some very interesting people.\n\nFor me, leaving Microsoft to start a business is a decision I don't think my future self will regret, even if I fail, so I'm going all in on entrepreneurship.",

    "fullText": "Global markets' pecking order could be shifting.\n\nThat's the fear being voiced by more investors in recent months as doubts swirl around American exceptionalism — the idea that investors can expect better returns on US assets relative to international markets.\n\nThe US's dominance in global markets has been the historical precedent, but talk about America losing its edge has been rising over the past year as investors take stock of risks like higher inflation, more debt, and increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\nMore investors also appear to be turning their attention to other areas around the world, particularly as the US stocks battle continued selling pressure.\n\nHere are two stats that illustrate how the US could already be losing its edge.\n\nThe S&P 500's year-to-date performance is lagging behind the MSCI World Index by the most in at least 30 years, the bank said, citing its historical analysis since 1995.\n\nThe US has already been lagging global markets for the past year, hedge fund manager Rob Citrone noted when speaking to CNBC about his outlook for US markets this week. In the year leading up to last Friday, he said that the gains in dollar-based assets have been the weakest when compared to 19 other markets around the world.\n\n\"The US is 20th out of 20,\" Citrone said, adding that gains in the US market fell around 30% short of the gains in emerging markets in the last year. \"That's a significant difference.\"\n\nInvestors around the world are swapping their holdings of US-based stocks for emerging markets at the fastest pace since 2021, according to Bank of America's survey of global fund managers in February.\n\nOn average, global investors reduced their position in US stocks by around 20 percentage points compared to their position the prior month. US stocks were the category that investors shifted away from the most, while the eurozone and emerging markets were among the top five areas where investors increased their positioning.\n\nTalk about \"Sell America,\" or investors shifting away from US assets, has picked up in recent months as markets eye potential headwinds, like hotter inflation and higher deficits in the US.\n\nFamed fixed-income investor Jeff Gundlach said last month that he was steering clear of the US entirely, and that he believed \"all\" investors should have exposure to non-US stocks in non-dollar currency.\n\nRon Temple, the chief market strategist for Lazard's advisory and asset management business, said in December that 2025 marked the last year of American exceptionalism, as he expected investors to continue shifting away from the US due to concerns about higher inflation and debt levels.\n\nCitrone added that he thinks the US market will continue to underperform the rest of the world, and that he was short US assets while betting on other markets, like Mexico.\n\n\"Most people are going to move some money from the US,\" he told CNBC earlier this week.",

    "description": "In \"Stock Market Maestros,\" Lee Freeman-Shor and Clare Flynn Levy dig into the philosophy of 11 top money managers.",
    "fullText": "There are some investing tips that you hear over and over, but are light on specifics.\n\nDiversify your portfolio. Don't let emotion — whether it be fear or greed — guide your decisions. Invest early and often to take advantage of compounding.\n\nBut a new book of interviews with top investors from around the world features plenty of nuggets of advice that extend beyond the run-of-the-mill guidance.\n\nIn \"Stock Market Maestros,\" Lee Freeman-Shor, a former fund manager himself, and Clare Flynn Levy dig into the philosophy of 11 top money managers and break down their top takeaways in digestible bites.\n\nBelow, we've compiled six of the best nuggets of wisdom.\n\nYou might check your portfolio every day, but do you write about it? Doing so can be helpful, especially for remembering why you've invested in something in the first place.\n\nManeesh Bajaj, a portfolio manager at Brown Advisory, said he can sometimes correct flaws in his investment process by looking back at his.\n\n\"I write down the rationale for every trade I place,\" Bajaj said. \"Where there are lessons to be learned from looking at my decisions in aggregate, I will incorporate those into the process.\n\nBajaj added that keeping track can help him realize when to be more decisive with a trade, informing him when it's better to exit a losing investment.\n\nFor the average investor who can't watch markets all day long, stop-losses — which help you automatically get out of a position if it falls by a set percentage — are crucial tools for protecting capital.\n\nBut John Lin, the CIO of emerging markets value and China equities at Alliance Bernstein, said stop-losses are arbitrary and therefore potentially counterproductive if an investment thesis is still good.\n\n\"I don't use stop losses because they are too formulaic. What makes 20% or 40% the right number to cut your losses?\" Lin said. \"I know when I should throw in the towel, but it is based on other factors. And when I decide to get out, I cut the whole thing. In my experience, selling in stages usually means you bleed performance along the way.\"\n\nJohn Barr, the portfolio manager of the Needham Aggressive Growth Fund, agreed, saying his best-ever investments would have been cut short by stop losses.\n\n\"Stop losses would be a disaster for me because they would have stopped out every one of my top 20 biggest winners. The average drawdown of my 20 biggest winners during the time I have held them has been 60—70%,\" Barr said. \"And they can be down and out for a year or longer. I wouldn't know where to place the stop loss level. And if I used them, and they got triggered, I probably wouldn't have bought in again after I had sold.\"\n\nSay you invested in Nvidia in 2020. Your portfolio would be sitting pretty right now, and would probably have a heavy bias toward the stock given the 1,165% gain over the last five years.\n\nBut with the stock looking less invincible recently, it's a good idea to try and understand when to lock in some of those gains and pare down your position. But how to do that?\n\nOne strategy is to sell at least the amount of your original position to ensure you can't lose, or sell a set percentage, like half, of your position as it reaches different return milestones.\n\nDirk Enderlein, a portfolio manager at Wellington Management, and James Hanbury, the head of strategy at Lancaster Investment Management, say to think of it this way: If you were to open a position in a particular stock today, what's the weighting in your portfolio you would give it?\n\n\"I don't believe in letting a position grow and grow. You run the risk of falling in love with the idea, and when it goes against you, you don't want to bring the weight down. This is what ends investment careers,\" Enderlein said.\n\n\"I would argue that someone who let the position grow to 6% would not start the position at 6% if they were starting afresh,\" he added.\n\nIt can be hard to know when to get out of a losing stock. Gorm Thomassen, the CIO of AKO Capital, likes to use something he's dubbed the \"Boiling Frog\" screen — it alerts him to small but negative changes occurring that he should be aware of before it becomes too late.\n\nFor example, warning signs would appear when a company's financial health appears to weaken, when a similar company warns its profits or earnings are set to take a hit, or when levels of insider selling spike.\n\nThomassen said he looks at the screen once a month.\n\nAndrew Hall, a fund manager at Invesco, said he sends some of his stocks back down to his \"farm team\" when they get too expensive. It's a reference to minor league baseball, where players go to develop or rehab before heading to the Majors, and in Hall's case it means reducing the stocks to small positions.\n\n\"I only do that if I think the chance of monetising it in the future is higher than if I were to exit,\" he said. \"Perhaps it would be better to sell and watch it on the bench. But the reality is nothing focuses the mind like having an ownership stake. And the size is small enough that if I get it wrong it does not really affect performance.\"\n\nHall, the Invesco fund manager, said he uses several methods for taking emotion out of his decision-making process.\n\nOne is that he waits until the evening before making a choice on an investment because it gives his emotions time to dissipate. He also goes on runs to think out a given investment decision he has to make. And when he finally does buy, he puts his position to work over the course of multiple days to ensure he still likes his thesis.\n\n\"For example I will buy 10 basis points a day for five days instead of buying 50 basis points on one day,\" he said. \"This is a way of lowering the emotional impact of the decision. And it gives me the opportunity to stop buying if it becomes clear that it was the wrong thing to do.\"",

    "description": "From Sam Altman to Demis Hassabis, AI leaders gathered in India to speak about the future of the technology.",
    "fullText": "AI's biggest power players showed up in India on Thursday.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Scale AI's Alexandr Wang, and Mistral's Arthur Mensch spoke in succession at the AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi.\n\nFrom a potential \"AI divide\" to calls for stronger global coordination, here are five of the biggest takeaways from the summit so far.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said the world must not let the digital divide \"become an AI divide.\" He said expanding access to compute infrastructure, connectivity, and training is essential as AI reshapes economies.\n\nPichai said AI represents \"the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes\" and could drive \"hyper progress\" across science, healthcare, and economic development. But its benefits are neither \"guaranteed nor automatic.\"\n\n\"We must be equally bold in tackling problems in regions that have lacked access to technology,\" Pichai said. \"We cannot allow the digital divide to become an AI divide. That means investing in compute infrastructure and connectivity.\"\n\nGovernments must act both as regulators and innovators to ensure AI improves public services and broadens opportunity, he added.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that while AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there's a gap between those capabilities and real-world impact.\n\n\"There is this duality between the fundamental capabilities of the technology and the time that it takes for those capabilities to diffuse into the world,\" he said.\n\n\"There are just frictions to adopt things through enterprises, and I think even more so in the developing world,\" he added.\n\nThe Google DeepMind CEO said India will be a \"powerhouse for AI\" across the world. He praised summits that bring together scientists, policymakers, and technologists, the latter of whom he said can't be left alone navigating AI.\n\nHassabis said we're in \"one of the most momentous\" times in human history and compared AI to the advent of fire and electricity.\n\n\"It's gonna be something like 10 times the impact of the Industrial Revolution, but happening at 10 times the speed, probably unfolding in a matter of a decade rather than a century,\" he said.\n\nGiven this level of impact, he said we need to use a scientific approach to understand AI's capabilities and build guardrails so that the technology \"serves the purposes that we want.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said rapid advances in AI could require new global governance mechanisms, something akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\"In particular, we expect the world may need something like the IAEA for international coordination of AI,\" Altman said, adding that such a body would need \"the ability to rapidly respond to change in circumstances.\"\n\nAltman said AI's trajectory could create risks that no single company or country can manage alone.\n\n\"We need a society-wide approach about how we're going to defend against this,\" he said, referring to the possibility of highly capable \"bio models\" becoming available.\n\nLong-term AI development is a responsibility to future generations, Altman also said, adding that it is a \"moral imperative\" to ensure future generations can benefit from and build upon technological progress.\n\nMeta's former chief scientist said we're still missing something \"big\" in AI.\n\n\"Why do we have systems that can pass the bar exam and win mathematics olympiads? But we don't have domestic robots. We don't even have self-driving cars,\" LeCun said. \"We certainly do not have several cars that can teach themselves to drive in 20 hours of practice like in 17-year-old.\"\n\nHe said that babies and animals have a much better understanding of the physical world around them than any AI systems today, which is why we don't have \"smart robots\" yet.\n\nHe said what is needed is world models — \"mental models of the world that allow us to think ahead, apprehend new situations, plan, sequence of actions, reason, and predict the consequences of our actions.\"\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company. His new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said we need to make AI effective for the Global South, and that needs conscious planning.\n\n\"We need to make AI as effective in every language as it is in English, and today, it is not,\" he said. \"Performance tests show that's the case.\"\n\n\"One of the good things to come out of this week is new announcements to better data in other languages, to provide better tools and measurement systems for AI that is built in other languages,\" he added.\n\nThe other thing that needs to be done is to work on problems that matter to the Global South. That means focusing on improvements in agriculture for India, and addressing food security in Africa.",

By February 2026, our business bank account balance sat just above $6.\n\nIn 2024, inspired by the successful e-commerce entrepreneurs and Amazon sellers I write about, I decided to start my own business. I convinced a friend to join me, and we each put in $5,000 from our own savings to launch a pickleball paddle company. We hired my high school English teacher to design our logo, we worked with a sourcing company to find a manufacturer, and we spent about a year developing our paddle before placing our first inventory order in early 2025. The minimum order quantity was 500 units.\n\nWe shipped 250 paddles to ourselves in Los Angeles and sent the other 250 to Amazon.\n\nThe plan was to run a hybrid Shopify-Amazon model while we figured out who our typical customer was. That was advice from an e-commerce industry veteran. He told us that, on Shopify, we'd earn better margins because there are fewer platform fees, but we'd have to generate our own traffic through social media, ads, and word of mouth. On Amazon, we'd sacrifice margin, but gain visibility. As he put it: \"Amazon is guaranteed traffic. There's a guaranteed flow of people who are going to see your product every single day.\"\n\nAfter a year, we haven't cracked the Amazon code, and the learning curve has gotten expensive.\n\nAmong the various Amazon seller fees is an \"aged inventory surcharge.\" It's charged on units stored in its fulfillment network for 181 days or more, in addition to its standard monthly storage fees. The surcharge increases the longer your inventory sits.\n\nItems aged 181 to 210 days cost $0.50 per cubic foot. At 211 to 240 days, it jumps to $1 per cubic foot. Our inventory, sitting in the 331- to 365-day range, costs $5.90 per cubic foot. We didn't fully understand the cost structure until it started hitting our bank account.\n\nHere's a screenshot from our Amazon seller account showing our service fees between November 2025 and February 2026.\n\nLast month, we owed nearly $300 in service fees — much more than we were bringing in in sales. Rather than continue to see that number climb (items aged 456 days or more would cost us $7.90 per cubic foot or $0.35 per unit, whichever is greater), we decided to pull most of our inventory out of Amazon.\n\nThe removal process took five minutes. We submitted a removal order for about 200 paddles, and were surprised when 40 of our units arrived on my doorstep the next day. According to Amazon's website, removal orders can take 90 days or more to process before leaving a fulfillment center, plus another two weeks for delivery.\n\nWe're still waiting on the rest of the inventory, and we haven't fully escaped fees. There's a removal fee, which is charged per unit and based on the unit's shipping weight, that we expect to show up on our next statement. Plus, the 30 or so paddles that we left in Amazon's warehouse will trigger storage fees.\n\nWe don't want to abandon Amazon entirely; we just don't have the time and resources to dedicate to figuring out that sales channel.\n\nFor now, we're shifting our focus to Shopify, in-person events, and wholesale partnerships. If we hit another sales dry spell, at least we won't be paying hundreds of dollars a month just to store our own product.\n\nWe're not discouraged. It's just one more lesson in our crash course in e-commerce, but it's a big one: Understand the fees. On Amazon, unsold product isn't harmless. It's expensive.",

    "description": "Some tech workers are about to get caught \"sleepwalking\" as the culture shifts under their feet.",
    "fullText": "It's a tough time to be just average.\n\nWorkers who are decent at their jobs — but not superstars — are facing a tougher slog in industries like tech, where employers have the upper hand, and AI threatens to automate their roles.\n\nWhat used to be a spectrum of employee performance is hardening into something more binary. Companies are focusing more on two camps: hotshots and underachievers.\n\nThis corporate sorting risks leaving the solid performers who make up the bulk of healthy companies feeling overlooked — and potentially vulnerable, workplace observers told Business Insider.\n\n\"Good-enough, B player is the most dangerous place to be,\" said Jeff Hyman, who has been a recruiter for about 30 years. In part, that's because poor workers don't last long, and midlevel workers might have a false sense of security.\n\n\"They're sleepwalking,\" Hyman said. \"They're spending time polishing their LinkedIn while AI is just starting to, task by task, nibble at their job description.\"\n\nThe split-screen is particularly apparent in tech: Dell is revamping its sales compensation program to boost rewards for its highest performers and trim what goes to those who don't meet their full quota, Business Insider reported this month. In January, Business Insider reported that Meta plans to reward its strongest performers with larger payouts, while Amazon has said it's looking closely at each worker's impact.\n\nIt's an idea long used in marketing — like segmenting a customer base — to reimagine how they manage their workforce, said Richard Smith, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The thinking goes that leaders should focus on the MVPs who hold \"strategic importance\" for a company in the long term.\n\nLast year, for example, Microsoft gave managers what it described as new and enhanced tools to help them accelerate high performance and \"swiftly address low performance,\" Business Insider reported.\n\nRewarding the stars has \"always been the case, and now it's just more unapologetically so,\" said Alan Stein, a career coach who worked at Facebook, Google, and Salesforce. In part, that's because of a crush of available workers.\n\nWith US companies hiring at one of the lowest rates in over a decade, employers have more leverage and potentially less incentive to invest heavily in developing middle-tier employees, said Smith, who runs the Human Capital Development Lab at Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe tech industry's latest approach, Stein said, marks a departure from what he saw as an \"everybody has potential\" ethos that emerged during the pandemic-era hiring boom.\n\n\"It was a lot of talk,\" said Stein, CEO of Kadima Careers, which offers job seekers coaching on how to get six-figure roles.\n\nIt was little surprise, he said, that Big Tech would ultimately direct a bigger share of payouts to those who get it done — just as pro sports teams reward their standouts.\n\nAt many large organizations, Stein said, about 10% to 20% of employees fall into the \"walks on water camp,\" with a similar share marked as underperformers. The majority sit in the middle — the solid, reliable \"worker bees,\" he said.\n\n\"They can't all be Zuckerberg,\" Stein said, referring to Meta's CEO. \"They need people that get the work done.\"\n\nOne risk for employers that focus heavily on their upper crust is that it can damage morale on the B team and signal to people at other firms — including the rock stars — that a company isn't a great place to work.\n\nBeyond recruiting headaches, a workplace where fear dominates tends to undercut what CEOs often say they want: innovation, creativity, and collaboration.\n\nSmith frames it as a math problem: Is it more valuable to improve the top 5% of your workforce by 20%, or 80% of your workforce by 5%?\n\nFinding ways to create that broad-based improvement creates \"a lot more impact,\" Smith said.\n\nThat risk of middle-child syndrome extends beyond tech to professional services such as law, auditing, engineering, and consulting — all of which are experiencing major shifts, thanks in part to AI, he said.\n\nNot all companies are stepping up efforts to trim their lowest-rated people. After online speculation that it would make a round of performance-based layoffs, Meta told Business Insider this month that it's not planning to cut the bottom 5% of workers this year, as it did in 2025.\n\nThe news isn't necessarily all bad for mid-tier workers either, Stein said. Even in tech, good-enough performers often still receive raises and enviable perks.\n\n\"You still have the free lunch. You still have the equity, and you're still a free agent. You can go somewhere else,\" he said.\n\nHyman, who's CEO of Recruit Rockstars, a recruiting and career management firm, said he advises B players to \"make yourself irreplaceable\" by honing skills AI can't yet do well. That includes showing superior judgment, building relationships with customers, and navigating ambiguity.\n\nIt might also mean learning AI to the point where you can go to your manager and announce that you've created an agent to automate work.\n\n\"That at least buys you time,\" Hyman said.\n\nYet, as soon as AI reaches a tipping point where it can handle a sufficient number of tasks that an average or above-average worker can do, Hyman said, \"that B player is in trouble.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

Is this some AI thing?\"\n\nYes, it is an AI thing, and it's giving the Mac Mini a moment with tech enthusiasts.\n\n“is this some AI thing??” me trying to explain to Best Buy employees why everyone is coming in to buy the Mac mini #ai #openclaw #clawdbot\n\nOpenClaw is a rapidly evolving, open-source, autonomous AI agent previously known as Clawdbot or Moltbolt. Its creator, Peter Steinberger, recently joined OpenAI after being courted by AI CEOs, including Sam Altman and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. OpenClaw can organize users' schedules, monitor vibe-coding sessions, and run other AI agents. It can also be locally run on your computer, which can eat up a lot of memory. That's driven a bit of a frenzy for devices with higher memory, like some Mac Minis.\n\nPeople are buying up the 5\"-by-5\" computer at a pace Apple can't seem to keep up with, as the tech giant shows weekslong wait times for the higher-memory Mac Minis. New York-based shoppers, for example, can get the 16-gigabyte Mac Mini by this weekend, while the 24-gigabyte and 32-gigabyte options have shipping and pick-up windows that extend until March 18, as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCustom and higher-memory configurations often take longer to ship, but the online buzz around the Mac Mini and OpenClaw is easy to link.\n\nResellers on eBay are also trying to cash in on the hype. There are dozens of new Mac Mini listings asking for the retail price or more for brand-new and pre-owned computers.\n\nBefore you snap up your M4 chip Mac Mini, you might consider waiting for a new wave of devices to drop. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, known for his inside information on Apple, reported that new Mac computers, including a new mini, are expected in 2026.",

These threads have amassed thousands of comments in the past few weeks.\n\nAmong the items people are discussing are portable GPS devices, digital cameras, iPods, and paying for novelty ringtones.\n\n\"I paid $700 for one of those in... 2003?\" one Reddit user says of a portable GPS device. \"Best purchase ever because I'm directionally challenged and relied on MapQuest (!) printouts on the passenger seat.\"\n\n\"Ringtones. Oh you want one of your ringtones to be a 5 seconds snippets from Lose yourself. That'll be 8.50$. People would flex about their ringtones,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nIn another post, a Redditor reminisced about USB storage drives.\n\n\"I remember in 5th grade, a flash drive was on our required supplies list, and I got one that was 512mb. A teacher told me that was more than I would need for the rest of my life,\" they wrote.\n\nThe PalmPilot, BlackBerry, plasma TVs, and SD cards have also gotten repeat mentions.\n\nSome of these pieces of tech — namely the digital camera — have been reborn in recent years as status symbols for a generation craving a time that felt more authentic.\n\nAs part of the push to get offline, many Gen Z and millennials are rejecting new technology by Bricking their phones — blocking certain apps and websites — and leaning into in-person hobbies.\n\nKathryn Jezer-Morton recently wrote for The Cut that 2026 is all about \"friction-maxxing\" — a rejection of the numbing convenience that AI and technology bring us, which Jezer-Morton says is distancing us from life itself.\n\nIt's as if consumers are harking back to a time when it felt as though technology was made to work for us, rather than make our lives more complicated.\n\n\"After a period of intense euphoria and excitement with regards to AI, we are coming down on the other side of the hill,\" Thomas Roulet, a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The tool is democratised and has become normalised, and people realise it hasn't made their work easier or less intense — quite the opposite,\" he added.\n\n\"So it's normal to find GenZ employees — who will have to go through their entire career using those tools — to be disillusioned,\" he said.\n\nWhen the future of AI is being predicted by some tech execs and experts as a white-collar bloodbath with millions of workers laid off, or that those living without AI glasses could be at a \"cognitive disadvantage,\" it's no wonder.\n\nIn an uncertain time, one thing that's sure in 2026: de-digitalizing your life is officially a status symbol.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jay Gulledge, 59, who is based in Tennessee. The termination of his employment at USAID and current employment have been verified by Business Insider.\n\nWhen the Trump administration dismantled the US Agency for International Development last year, I was one of the thousands of employees who lost their jobs. I was 58 at the time.\n\nA year on from being laid off, I'm happy with how things have turned out for me: I work for an exceptional organization with great colleagues.\n\nBut, every so often, when I talk to a former colleague or see one of their LinkedIn posts, I start to feel survivor's guilt. I ask myself: Why was I so lucky?\n\nI've had a long and winding career, and my route into working at USAID was circuitous.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I was an academic scientist. I went on to work at a climate-change think tank, then in middle management at a laboratory. I took some years out to consult and build a real-estate portfolio, with the aim of generating passive income.\n\nIn my 50s, I became interested in international development. There's a long-running American Association for the Advancement of Science fellowship program that places scientists and engineers into US federal agencies.\n\nI didn't have a background in international development, just an interest. The fellowship was a foot in the door of USAID and, starting in September 2022, I spent a year there as a fellow before joining as a climate change integration adviser on a two-year direct-hire contract.\n\nWhen I joined the fellowship, I was 56, and I expected USAID to be the final chapter of my career.\n\nMy work fit squarely within the Biden administration's priorities, but I knew those priorities would shift with a change in government.\n\nWhen Donald Trump won the 2024 election, and later when Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were in the news, I assumed my days were numbered.\n\nNone of us imagined the agency would be shut down entirely.\n\nThe atmosphere last February was chaotic. We'd heard a lot of different things, and we didn't really know what was going on.\n\nMany colleagues described this period as scary. It didn't feel scary to me. Sadness was my dominant feeling, not a personal sadness, but hurting for the world and my country. USAID had inefficiencies, but it helped millions of people who aren't getting that help anymore.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, I received an email that my termination would take effect on March 5.\n\nLosing my job was a hit, but at 58, I was later in my career, I had some passive income from my real-estate portfolio, I don't have kids, and I was going to be able to pay my bills. It wasn't going to devastate me financially or harm my family in any significant way, like it may have done for others.\n\nWhen my termination took effect, I tried to find a job that would bring me career satisfaction. That late in my career, I didn't need to find a job purely for the money.\n\nI was hearing that many of my colleagues were applying for dozens of jobs and getting no calls back. The market was flooded with job seekers in areas related to my expertise. There were thousands of competitors for every job, and the risk was that I might not find anything.\n\nI didn't apply for many jobs, and largely avoided international development roles, because I had former colleagues who were far more qualified for them than me.\n\nI knew that if all else failed, I could return to investing in real estate.\n\nI was unemployed for about six months before I found the perfect role as the director of scientific programs at PSE Health Energy, a research center that examines the health implications of the energy system.\n\nA year on, I'm happy with where I've landed. I love learning about new scientific concepts and working with exceptional colleagues.\n\nStill, there's an undeniable sense of loss. I worked for years to move into international development, intentionally cultivating that path, and it was taken away from me. There's nothing I can do about that.\n\nI also still feel survivor's guilt. It's not a daily thing, but it often comes up when I pause to reflect. I think about my former colleagues, really capable people, who are still unemployed.\n\nFor many of them, they'd been at USAID for their whole careers, and really cared about their work. My identity was not built around my job because I'd only been there for a couple of years.\n\nI landed on my feet, but the sheer number of people let go meant not everyone could.

    "description": "Business Insider's investigation into data centers was awarded the George Polk Award for Environmental Reporting.",
    "fullText": "AI's impact is still largely unknown, but what's powering its rise is pretty clear.\n\nData centers are the backbone of artificial intelligence, and they are real-world evidence that businesses are betting big on the tech.\n\nAn AI project can rise and fall without many people noticing. A 50,000-square-foot data center that pops up in your neighborhood is a lot harder to ignore.\n\nIt's not just their sheer size that's tangible. The cost of these data centers, both economically and environmentally, is very real.\n\nThat's why Business Insider embarked on an investigation to better understand these data centers' impact. That work just earned us a very prestigious award.\n\nThe investigation was a full newsroom effort, with multiple reporters, editors, videographers, and designers chipping in. From environmental implications to complex financing to neighborhood drama, we covered the topic from all angles.\n\nWe've also got an incredible video and interactive map worth checking out.\n\nWinning an award doesn't mean our work is done.\n\nBig Tech companies keep ramping up their spending. Amazon and Alphabet recently announced plans to spend $200 billion and $185 billion, respectively, on AI infrastructure this year.\n\nNew states are also vying for data-center business, threatening traditional hubs like Northern Virginia.\n\nFinancing these deals is becoming increasingly complex and exotic, ranging from 100-year bonds to various types of securitization. In short, it's not just tech companies carrying the risk for these massive bets.\n\nYou can even include yourself in that group if you've noticed your utility bill went up recently.\n\nIt's still not entirely clear if these companies' AI efforts will eventually pay off. In the meantime, society is footing the bill.",

    "description": "As a club coach with Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon and an international coach with Australia, Joe Montemurro has experience of pressure from both sides as he talks to BBC Sport.",
    "fullText": "As a club coach with Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon, and an international coach with Australia, Joe Montemurro has experience of pressure from both sides.\n\nThe recent flurry of club managerial sackings in England has highlighted the volatility of elite coaching.\n\n\"You only see from the outside,\" reflects Montemurro.\n\n\"I think clubs now have a lot of short-term processes that they have to achieve instead of having long-term visions and that puts a lots of pressure on coaches from day one - because sometimes, you've got to fix cultures, you've got to fix structures, you've got to fix organisational processes before you can start getting the results.\"\n\nMontemurro suggests time is a precious commodity.\n\n\"The nature of what we do means we don't have time anymore. It's a high-pressure scenario - results aren't just about winning matches.\n\n\"It's fan engagement, it's commercial, it's money, it's economics, it's all the other 'side dishes', if you want to call it that.\"\n\nFrom 2017-2021 Montemurro was head coach of Arsenal Women. In 2021, he managed Juventus' women side, before becoming the first non-French manager at eight-time Women's Champions League winners Lyon in 2024.\n\nAfter winning league titles at all three clubs, Montemurro was appointed the Matildas head coach in June 2025.\n\n\"It's been an interesting transition,\" he tells BBC Sport from Australia. \"You're used to the day-to-day contact with players and staff, the excitement of games coming quickly.\n\n\"In international football there are little gaps between tournaments and windows that give you more time to reflect and work on other areas.\"\n\nMelbourne-born Montemurro's international journey is about to accelerate. The Women's Asian Cup begins on 1 March in his homeland, with the final set to be staged at Stadium Australia in Sydney - the same arena where Australia's men lifted the trophy in 2015 when Ange Postecoglou led the Socceroos to a 2-1 extra-time victory over South Korea.\n\nThe Matildas are chasing a second Asian Cup crown after a penalty shootout final win over North Korea in 2010 - a tournament where a 16-year-old Sam Kerr scored her first two international goals.\n\nHosting the Asian Cup comes at a pivotal moment for women's football in Australia, building on momentum generated by the Fifa Women's World Cup 2023, which the country co-hosted with New Zealand.\n\nFifa president, Gianni Infantino described that tournament as the \"best and greatest and biggest\" in history with a record-breaking near two million tickets, external sold and an average attendance of about 30,000 fans per match.\n\nThere will be an exodus from the Women's Super League (WSL) with 13 of Australia's 26-player squad currently playing in this country, underlining the depth of Australian influence in England's top flight.\n\nMontemurro understands the tension that creates for clubs.\n\n\"The timing is never perfect,\" he adds. \"I've been in that position when you lose players. It's unfortunate. But one thing clubs sometimes forget is that it's an honour for these players to represent their country.\n\n\"These tournaments don't come around often. For the Australian players, it's a home tournament - the opportunity to do well in that is exciting.\"\n\nMontemurro accepts there are \"pros and cons\", particularly as the WSL season reaches decisive months, but believes most clubs \"now plan for such absences\".\n\nJapan have called up 16 players from the WSL for their squad, including Ayaka Yamashita, Aoba Fujino and Yui Hasegawa from WSL leaders Manchester City.\n\nPlayers will travel around 21 February to prepare for the tournament which runs from 1-21 March.\n\nShould Australia reach the final, English-based players will miss two WSL games and an FA Cup fifth-round match.\n\nArsenal trio Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley and Kyra Cooney-Cross are heading to the tournament, and, should Australia progress to the quarter-finals, Chelsea will be without striker Kerr and defender Ellie Carpenter for their League Cup final against Manchester United, which takes place on 15 March at Ashton Gate in Bristol.\n\nMontemurro has also backed Manchester City forward Mary Fowler to return to fitness for the tournament, despite playing only 15 minutes since rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in April 2025.\n\nThe full list of WSL players in Australia's Asian Cup, external squad:\n\nCharlize Rule (Brighton and Hove Albion)\n\nEmily van Egmond (Leicester City)\n\nAlanna Kennedy (London City Lionesses)\n\nKaitlyn Torpey (Newcastle United)\n\nClaire Hunt (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nMontemurro is also clear the women's game in Australia must raise its professional standards.\n\nA recent report, external from the Players Football Association in Australia highlighted low average salaries of A$30,000 (£15,500) in the domestic women's league, with around 63% of players working second jobs.\n\n\"There are minimum standards that all professional leagues are ascertaining,\" says Montemurro, 56. \"We need to make sure we adhere to those standards.\n\n\"There's really no excuse from my perspective. There should be the minimum standards of proper 12-month contracts, pay that's relative to a professional contract [and] all the benefits that come with that.\n\n\"But also the environments that clubs adhere to in terms of their minimum standards - the proper medical, the proper technical, tactical analysis, everything that a professional sporting organisation should have.\n\n\"I think the biggest question is to understand what are the minimum standards from a worldwide perspective that we should be achieving in Australia. We must adhere to those.\"\n\nRecent FIFPRO research, external shows the 2026 Women's Asian Cup could generate up to US$82.4m (£61m), potentially making it the tournament's most commercially successful edition. Yet, the current prize pool remains $1.8m (£1.3m) - unchanged from four years ago and just 12% of the men's equivalent.\n\nAsked if that should increase, Montemurro adds: \"Totally. If national organisations are investing substantially in travel, tournaments and preparation, the prize pool should reflect that.\n\n\"If we're serious about these being major tournaments, there needs to be an incentive to take part.\"\n\nThe Women's Asian Cup will stage matches in Perth, Gold Coast and Sydney.\n\nPerth's 60,000-seat stadium will host the opener on 1 March as Australia face the Philippines, while the final will be played in Sydney at the 79,500-seat Stadium Australia on 21 March.\n\nAustralia are among the favourites, alongside two-time winners Japan, but China are the reigning champions after winning their ninth title in 2022.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "With Chelsea facing leaky Burnley at Stamford Bridge this week, FPL managers have a tough choice of captain between Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro.",
    "fullText": "The best FPL captain this week comes from Chelsea as they face a Burnley side that has conceded a league-high 32 goals away from home.\n\nThat is nearly three goals per game - so who do you choose out of Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro?\n\nThe pair have scored 43 and 48 FPL points in the past five gameweeks respectively, the two form players in that period.\n\nIf you own both, this is an near-impossible choice but I've gone for Palmer here with penalties adding to his potential.\n\nIt means no place for Erling Haaland this week - the re-emergence of expensive midfielders such as Palmer means tough choices. Let's hope that doesn't backfire although the Norwegian might be an injury doubt this week.\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nDon't miss our FPL special Q&A with expert FPL Heisenberg, live on the BBC Sport website on Friday, 20 February at 15:30 GMT.\n\nGoing all-in on Arsenal's defence backfired as they conceded in both games, with only captain Gabriel (14 points) doing anything attacking wise.\n\nDitto going double Palace defence. Deary dear.\n\nThank goodness for Palmer (12) and Joao Pedro (10) leading the team to a below-par 56 points.\n\nEmiliano Martinez, Aston Villa, keeper, £5m - Leeds (h)\n\nVilla have two clean sheets in their past five games and they have only conceded three times in that run - and allowed a fourth-best nine big chances.\n\nMartinez owners might feel unlucky not to got more out of him.\n\nDaniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, £5.9m - Wolves (h)\n\nPalace's defence was a massive disappointment last week as they folded in the first half against Burnley.\n\nI'm putting that down to the randomness of Premier League football and going for the fixture - bottom of the league at home - over form.\n\nMunoz carries so much attacking threat and one bad game is not enough to move away from him.\n\nJames Hill, Bournemouth, £4m - West Ham (a)\n\nOnly four players have more points than Hill's 29 in the past four gameweeks.\n\nHe's the dream budget option to end the season with, as Bournemouth have a nice fixture run to finish with.\n\nHe'll probably be in the side next week too for Sunderland at home.\n\nNordi Mukiele, Sunderland, £4.6m - Fulham (h)\n\nMukiele has picked up defensive contribution points 12 times in 24 starts. His five assists is the third-most among defenders and Sunderland have eight clean sheets this season.\n\nAll decent routes to points for a budget defender.\n\nMohammed Salah, Liverpool, £14m - Nottingham Forest (a)\n\nIs Salah back as an FPL option?\n\nHe's had a terrible season by his standards and is only the 41st-ranked midfielder in FPL but...\n\nIn the four games since his return from the Africa Cup of Nations, the signs are there that a haul is imminent.\n\nSalah's had 14 shots in that time (more than anyone else in the league), 12 in the box, three big chances yet no goal to show for it. He does have three assists.\n\nForest have been flakey to say the least this season and Liverpool are hitting a bit of form.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £9.8m - Everton (a)\n\nFernandes has been fantasy gold dust since his return from injury in gameweek 21 so don't let his blank at West Ham last time out put you off.\n\nThe Portuguese has 44 points in those six games and there's not even a penalty in there. By contrast, Cole Palmer has the same amount of points in six games but with four penalties.\n\nFernandes' potential is off the charts and Everton have only one clean sheet in their past seven.\n\nCole Palmer (captain), Chelsea, £10.6m - Burnley (h)\n\nHe might have relied on penalties for his recent surge in form but that is what makes Palmer such a great FPL asset in the first place.\n\nIf you're chasing points in your mini-league, Palmer is the best differential with just a 15% ownership.\n\nAnd Burnley at home... well it doesn't get much better!\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Manchester City, £8.0m - Newcastle (h)\n\nAny worries that Semenyo's production might suffer from his move to City, with so many forward options, have been unfounded.\n\nHe's scored in both his home matches and now takes on a Newcastle side who have conceded eight in their past three games.\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen, Crystal Palace, £6.1m - Leeds (h)\n\nAs soon as Strand Larsen moved to Palace, he became an enticing FPL option and his two-goal debut haul will have managers drooling.\n\nFacing Burnley's defence last week might have had something to do with things but the Norwegian gets a crack at another leaky defence.\n\nDon't be fooled by Wolves' clean sheet at Forest last time - they allowed 35 shots and could have conceded five!\n\nJoao Pedro, Chelsea, £7.7m - Burnley (h)\n\nIt must be a while since a striker not called Erling Haaland has had a run of form like Joao Pedro's.\n\nFive games, four goals, five assists and nine bonus points. And now he takes on Burnley.\n\nIgor Thiago, Brentford, £7m - Brighton (h)\n\nOnly one goal in five for the Premier League's second-top scorer but he now enters an incredible run of fixtures until gameweek 33, including games against Wolves and Burnley.\n\nWith penalties on his side and still at a decent price, he's a brilliant pick.\n\nMartin Dubravka, Burnley, keeper, £4m - Chelsea (a)\n\nEl Hadji Malick Diouf, West Ham, defender, £4m - Bournemouth (h)\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Everton, midfielder, £4.9m - Manchester United (h)\n\nOmar Alderete, Sunderland, defender, £4.1m - Fulham (h)\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "John Murray reflects on 30 years of commentating on matches across the globe for the BBC.",
    "fullText": "Wednesday's trip to Azerbaijan was the latest in a list of unusual destinations for John Murray to commentate from. He has seen it all during three decades behind the microphone for the BBC - from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, to the Arctic Circle and numerous World Cups.\n\nThe Radio 5 Live commentator, 59, has attended more than 200 stadiums while narrating some of the biggest football matches across the globe since joining the organisation in 1994.\n\nBefore Newcastle's Champions League match against Qarabag on Wednesday, the Northumberland native sat against the picturesque backdrop of the Azersun Arena in Baku - more than 2,500 miles away from home - to reflect on a career that has taken him to five continents.\n\n\"When I was growing up, listening to the radio and watching television, it was really commentary to matches in far flung places that captured my imagination,\" explains Murray.\n\n\"I always remember those European matches because in those days - we're talking 1970s, early 1980s - it was quite a rarity that those matches would be shown live on television.\n\n\"Access to those matches on the radio - and international matches as well - were a big part of what really fired my imagination.\"\n\nBefore he joined the BBC, Murray's first taste of life in the gantry came on a \"raucous\" night at Stoke City's Victoria Ground when he was \"thrust\" on air while working for local Teesside station TFM Radio.\n\nHe later travelled to Pisa to cover Middlesbrough's Anglo-Italian Cup match against the Serie B side as he continued to hone his craft as a budding broadcaster.\n\n\"It must have been my first game abroad and the stadium there was right next to the Leaning Tower of Pisa,\" he recalls.\n\n\"That was a fantastic way to start - you can't get any better than your first [European] commentary next to a World Heritage site.\n\n\"There were only a couple of hundred people at the ground, but right outside is the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\"\n\nEven after covering matches across Asia, Africa, North America, South America and Europe, each season still manages to spring something new on Murray.\n\nIn January, he found himself surrounded by \"snow-capped mountains\" on a historic night inside the Arctic Circle as Norwegian minnows Bodo/Glimt stunned Manchester City in the Champions League.\n\nMurray regards it as one of the most surreal nights of his career, likening the landscape to the 1983 Bill Forsyth film Local Hero, which was set in Scotland.\n\n\"I could see rooftops with snow on them from just outside the ground. It was such an unusual place,\" he says.\n\n\"As I said at the time on the radio, it just had the feel of the film 'Local Hero'. I was thinking, how are we here for a Champions League match?\n\n\"And not only that, but it helps when you get a match that is a real event. For them to beat Manchester City, Champions League winners only a few years ago, in the way that they did, that is part of package.\n\n\"When you get the match, as well as the setting, to describe as well. There weren't many better examples than that.\"\n\nBut it was much closer to home that Murray encountered what he described as the most \"challenging\" 90 minutes of his broadcasting career.\n\nIn January 2021, eighth-tier Marine hosted Tottenham in the FA Cup third round.\n\nOngoing Covid-19 restrictions meant matches were played behind closed doors, with broadcasters, journalists and a small number of other media personnel spread around the ground to adhere to social distancing guidelines.\n\nFor the first time, Murray was forced to commentate from behind the goal rather than his usual position along the touchline.\n\n\"I was really uncomfortable about that because it just didn't feel right,\" he admits.\n\n\"Normally I'm side on, the teams are playing left to right, right to left. There I was commentating with one team coming at you and the other team going away from you.\n\n\"It's not an experience I'd particularity want to repeat again.\"\n\nIt was only a few weeks ago that Murray was prompted to reflect on his remarkable career when a colleague asked how many stadiums he had visited.\n\nAfter revisiting the question during this interview, the self-proclaimed \"stadium geek\" settled on an answer of \"more than 200\".\n\n\"I don't know how I'd work out how many it is. During the course of that, I've probably seen a little bit of everything,\" he says.\n\nDuring that time, Murray has commentated on World Cups in South Korea, South Africa, Brazil and Qatar. Yet it is the FA Cup he holds in the highest regard.\n\nMurray made his FA Cup final commentary debut in 2010 when Premier League champions Chelsea beat Portsmouth at Wembley Stadium to secure a first domestic Double.\n\nBut it is the competition's early rounds that continue to rouse him - most recently when he covered non-league Macclesfield's upset of holders Crystal Palace.\n\n\"It was a match that had so many of the ingredients that you would want for a cup upset,\" he adds. \"There is nothing like that.\n\n\"For all the World Cup finals, internationals and Champions League finals, there is still nothing like being there and experiencing an FA Cup upset like that. That was one of the biggest.\"\n\nSo after thousands of matches in hundreds of different stadiums across the world, which game ranks as Murray's favourite?\n\n\"Easy question,\" he says with a smile. \"It was always a difficult question until the 2022 World Cup final - that was an amazing match to be at.\n\n\"But because it was the World Cup final and Lionel Messi was involved, Kylian Mbappe was involved, the to and fro of the game, the drama and excitement.\n\n\"That is the one I'd pick out, which is a really boring, easy answer. Yes it was a World Cup final, but it was the best spectacle.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Ange Postecoglou says he would not consider a return to managing Celtic despite the \"amazing experience\" he enjoyed in Glasgow.\n\nThe Australian lifted five trophies in two years at the club, and won the affection of fans with his attacking style of play before leaving for Tottenham Hotspur in 2023.\n\nPostecoglou has been out of work since being sacked by Nottingham Forest in October and has been linked with a return to Celtic in the summer as the Premiership champions search for their next permanent manager.\n\nThe 60-year-old told The Overlap it was not in his nature to return to a job he had done before.\n\n\"I don't go back,\" he said. \"I don't think that's been my career.\"\n\nHowever, Postecoglou talked about his time as Celtic manager in positive terms, saying he loved the passion of the fans.\n\n\"I loved Celtic,\" he said. \"What a football club. If I was younger, I probably would have stayed there longer for three or four years.\n\n\"I think I could have made progress with them in Europe. But at the time, it had taken me a lot of time to get to this space and the opportunity to join Tottenham was too good.\n\n\"In terms of going back, I don't go back. I don't think that's been my career.\n\n\"Whatever the next step is, I think it will be something new, something I can make an impact in, somewhere I can win things.\n\n\"It doesn't diminish the affection I have for Celtic. It was a great experience. For two years, to be within a community that is so passionate, and it's crazy how passionate they are, obviously I was fortunate enough to have success.\n\n\"It's a positive experience and I loved every minute of it. I look back on it fondly but... I won't go back. It's not how my career plays out.\"\n\nHe also described the city rivalry with Rangers and shared memories of his first season in charge, when the club won the Premiership and League Cup.\n\n\"Nobody is going to talk to me about rivalry,\" Postecoglou said. \"I lived and breathed it there.\n\n\"The perfect weekend in Scotland is Celtic winning, Rangers losing. Celtic winning, Rangers winning is not a good weekend.\n\n\"I remember the first year I was there we won the double but Rangers were in the Europa League final. I got more text messages the night they lost the Europa League final than the night we won the league.",

    "description": "Former Celtic and Stuttgart defender Andreas Hinkel gives BBC Sport Scotland his analysis of the sides' upcoming Europa League tie.",
    "fullText": "In what has been a really up and down season for Celtic, they have done well to navigate a path through to the Europa League knockout phase play-off.\n\nHaving got to this stage of the competition, there is no doubt they face a stern test on Thursday against a Stuttgart side brimming with quality and challenging for the Bundesliga's Champions League spots.\n\nFormer Germany international defender Andreas Hinkel – who played for both clubs – is expecting \"two tight games\".\n\nBut what is the key to Celtic finding a way of achieving what would be a very notable European scalp?\n\nUpsetting Stuttgart's rhythm could be the key.\n\nHinkel, who also coached at the Bundesliga club, explains: \"In general Stuttgart, they always want to have control, they want to have the ball, it is always difficult to press them.\n\n\"Sebastian Hoeness, the manager, he wants to dominate the game so I think this is a key thing at Celtic Park as well.\n\n\"If Celtic can press, if Celtic can destroy the build-up, if they are inside the game, the crowd is there - something can happen at Celtic Park.\n\n\"If Stuttgart take control, of course the crowd will be a little bit quieter, it can affect the game so I think it is quite important how it goes on at Celtic Park.\"\n\nStuttgart's quality is illustrated by the fact they finished 11th in the competition's league phase standings - just one point behind the top eight who automatically progressed to the round of 16.\n\nThe German side are a solid collective unit, but within that are individuals Martin O'Neill and his team will have to be very wary of.\n\n\"I don't want to mention just one player but I think [Deniz] Undav, the striker, is in good shape at the moment,\" Hinkel says.\n\n\"But we have some other players like [Jamie] Leweling, [Chris] Fuhrich, there are a few players there with a big target, they want to go to the World Cup and they want to present themselves as good as they can for the German national team.\"\n\nHinkel believes Stuttgart may have \"a small advantage over the two legs because the second one is at home\".\n\nIf Celtic are looking for an added source of optimism it could perhaps come from Stuttgart's away record in this season's competition.\n\nThey have lost three of their four away games - at Basel, Fenerbahce and Roma.\n\nAlthough it should be said there is no shame in that, and a 4-0 win at Dutch side Go Ahead Eagles is also an impressive outlier.\n\n\"The first leg at Celtic Park is important because away over the years Stuttgart had some results in the Champions League or the Europa League where they lost quite heavily,\" said Hinkel.\n\n\"For example, in Belgrade they lost 5-1. If you have a game like this at Celtic Park everything can happen if the crowd is there and team gets into the rhythm and they play and attack and something can happen like that.\n\n\"Stuttgart is a very good side, they are fighting for the Champions League places in Germany but since Martin O'Neill took over again, Celtic get the results. They get results when it is not that easy - it is always close at the end, maybe in injury time.\n\n\"But they get the results and it is a good side and I think the mentality is back so I expect tight games.\"\n\nO'Neill ready for tough Stuttgart test as Celtic boss reaches 1,000 matches\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Six months before the 2012 Olympics, American Claressa Shields took her first step on the path to greatness.\n\nAged only 16, Shields beat national champion Franchon Crews-Dezurn, who was eight years her senior, at the US Olympic trials.\n\nShields would go on to win gold at the Games in London and earn a further two victories over Crews-Dezurn in the amateur ranks.\n\nA fourth successive win followed when they met on their professional debuts in 2016 - and the pair are set to reignite their rivalry on Saturday when Shields defends her undisputed heavyweight status.\n\n\"Me and Franchon have always said that for some reason we are always intertwined in each other's lives,\" Shields told BBC Sport.\n\n\"If you take it back to when I was 16, she was ranked number one in the country and I was ranked number seven and the people who were ranked lower had to pull out a ball and it would tell you who we were fighting against - I pulled out number one.\n\n\"Now we meet again on the first fight of my major deal.\"\n\nThe major multi-fight deal that Shields speaks of was signed with Wynn Records and Salita Promotions in November.\n\nIt is worth a staggering $8m (£6.1m) and also came with an additional $3m (£2.2m) signing-on bonus.\n\nThose figures are unheard of in women's boxing but Shields, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, five-weight world champion and three-weight undisputed champion, is no stranger to raising the bar.\n\n\"I have never heard of a man getting that kind of signing bonus. I've heard of men getting a $1m (£739,000) signing bonus but never $3m,\" Shields said.\n\n\"I would love to ask ChatGPT, 'Has a man ever got a $3m signing bonus for a boxing contract?'\n\n\"My contract now is big overall and I'm getting back paid. When I came out of the Olympics with two gold medals, I should have got a $1m signing bonus for whoever I went with but that didn't happen.\n\n\"Now it's years later but I'm getting it all back. I've been able to make millions over the past few years.\"\n\nShields is the self-proclaimed Greatest Woman of All Time (GWOAT) and has a catalogue of evidence to back that claim up.\n\nThe 30-year-old won her first world title in just her fourth professional bout - becoming a unified super-middleweight champion.\n\nThat sparked a run of 14 successive world title fights and Shields is yet to lose in 17 contests as a professional.\n\nHer last defeat came as an amateur in 2012 against Briton Savannah Marshall - a defeat she atoned for in 2022.\n\nDespite achieving more than most in a full career, Shields does not lack the motivation to reach new highs.\n\n\"It's seeing how great I can be as a fighter,\" Shields said.\n\n\"I want to get my skillset and body to the position where I can go the extra mile and get the knockout after I've dominated these girls for five or six rounds.\n\n\"It's all about how great can I be. When it's all over, you don't get your youth back.\"\n\nAfter experimenting with mixed martial arts twice - winning two and losing one - Shields has made clear her intention to stick to pugilism for the rest of her career.\n\nShields turns 31 next month and intends to continue boxing until she is 38, leaving the door open for plenty of tests.\n\nUnified welterweight champion Lauren Price and Mikaela Mayer, who holds the WBO welterweight title and is also a unified champion at light-middleweight, have both called out Shields in recent times.\n\nWales' Price has urged Shields to come down from heavyweight, but that would mean the American dropping five divisions.\n\n\"If Mikaela and Lauren want to prove their greatness - and I'm willing to give them that chance - then it's 163lb and 165lb. I don't have to prove anything,\" Shields said.\n\n\"Lauren has no excuse for 165lb (75kg) because we both fought at 75kg for our Olympic gold medals. Let's not make excuses with the weight classes.\"\n\nPrice won Olympic gold at middleweight in 2020 but has spent her entire professional career at welterweight and defends her world titles against Stephanie Pineiro Aquino in April on BBC Two.\n\nMayer is a three-division world champion and has fought as high as light-middleweight.\n\n\"I don't know why these girls think I have to go down two or three weight classes when Terence Crawford went up three weight classes to fight Canelo [Alvarez],\" Shields said.\n\n\"The thing I find so crazy about this is when I was at 154lb, 160lb and 168lb - no-one would fight me. Now I'm at 175lb all these girls are calling me out to fight.\n\n\"Where were you all when I was undisputed at 160lb twice? Where were you at when I was at 154lb? I couldn't get a fight.

Rousey is a former UFC champion – becoming the first female to sign with the promotion – while Carano is considered one of the pioneers of the sport in the women's code.\n\nCarano retired before Rousey made her MMA debut, but the rivals have long been linked with a match-up and the UFC tried to make the fight at the height of Rousey's career.\n\nAfter a five-year unbeaten streak, Rousey lost her UFC bantamweight title to Holly Holm in a shock defeat, and when she was knocked out by Amanda Nunes in her comeback the following year, she retired from MMA.\n\nRousey has a 12-2 record while Carano is 7-1, with her only loss against Cris Cyborg in her last bout in 2009.\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Jack Crowley will start at fly-half as Ireland head coach Andy Farrell makes five changes to his starting XV for Saturday's Six Nations match against England at Allianz Stadium.\n\nSam Prendergast started in Ireland's opening loss to France and last week's victory over Italy, but Farrell has brought Crowley back into the XV after the 26-year-old's impact off the bench against the Azzurri.\n\nPrendergast is not named in the matchday squad with Farrell opting for the versatile Ciaran Frawley on the bench.\n\nMunster's Crowley will partner Jamison Gibson-Park in a changed half-back pairing as Craig Casey drops to the bench.\n\nThree-time British and Irish Lion Tadhg Furlong is recalled at tight-head prop having returned from a calf injury against Italy.\n\nIn a changed back row, captain Caelan Doris switches back to his familiar number eight role behind flankers Tadhg Beirne and Josh Van der Flier, with Jack Conan and Cormac Izuchukwu making way.\n\nFarrell has changed to a split of five forwards and three backs on the bench, having gone with a 6-2 for the first two games.\n\nBritish and Irish Lion Finlay Bealham has been recalled to provide tight-head cover, with Ronan Kelleher, Tom O'Toole, Nick Timoney and Jack Conan rounding out the forward replacements.\n\nWing Tommy O'Brien, who was left out against Italy, joins Casey and Frawley as the backline options on the bench.\n\nIreland and England both have one win from their opening two games, with Steve Borthwick's side targeting a return to form after last week's dispiriting Calcutta Cup loss to Scotland at Murrayfield.\n\n'A lightning rod for excitement' - Pollock gets start\n\n'Brotherly rivalry' between Irish and English Lions\n\nCrowley's return to the starting line-up is not surprising given Prendergast's struggles against Italy.\n\nWhile Crowley kicked a penalty dead at the end of the game to deny Ireland a possible bonus-point try, Farrell - who last week hit out at \"keyboard warriors\" stoking the fly-half debate - said he played \"outstandingly well\" after replacing Prendergast.\n\nCrowley only started one game in last year's Six Nations after playing every minute of Ireland's triumphant 2024 campaign.\n\nSaturday's game presents another big opportunity for him after he started the autumn Test defeat by the All Blacks in Chicago, only for Prendergast to be preferred for South Africa's visit to Dublin later in November.\n\nWhile Prendergast will be disappointed to miss out altogether, Frawley can cover fly-half, centre and full-back from the bench.

    "description": "Jos Buttler's form is a concern but Will Jacks and Sam Curran have shown promise. What to make of England's unconvincing start to the World Cup?",
    "fullText": "England‘s group stage at the T20 World Cup was a mixed bag - some good but overall unconvincing.\n\nSam Curran and Will Jacks have provided reasons to be positive but Jos Buttler‘s tricky start is a concern.\n\nWe have taken a look into the numbers behind his struggles and the other themes of England’s first four matches…\n\nScores of three against both Italy and Scotland mean Buttler made only 53 runs across the group stage – a low return for one of England's key men.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had a quiet winter with no fifties in 15 international innings across all formats, though a 97 not out in the SA20 in January casts doubt on those writing him off entirely.\n\nButtler's dismissals against Italy and Scotland were almost identical.\n\nLooking for his first boundary from his fourth ball, he miscued a length ball in the off-stump channel to mid-off.\n\n\"Maybe he is trying too hard to get a score on the board,\" said Buttler's former England team-mate Dawid Malan.\n\n\"The last two innings he has played, he has tried to hit the ball over mid-on.\n\n\"Knowing him and playing with him, his gameplan is generally to look to the off side first and then pick up leg side, so maybe he's just going back to his basics.\n\n\"I don't think we have to worry.\"\n\nAll three of his dismissals against pace, including nicking off against Nepal seamer Nandan Yadav, have come against balls clocked between 75-82mph.\n\nSince the start of 2024, Buttler has struggled against pace bowlers in that bracket more than any other – with an average of 35.8 and a strike-rate of 129.\n\nPerhaps more concerningly, given the tournament now returns to the turning tracks of Sri Lanka, his average against spin in T20 internationals has dropped to 24.1 since 2024 from 61.8 across the two years prior.\n\nButtler's other dismissal in this tournament came against Roston Chase's off-spin.\n\nEven with making 202-7 against Italy, there remains a feeling England's batting is yet to fully fire at this tournament.\n\nThey posted 184-7 against Nepal, were bowled out for 166 by West Indies and wobbled when chasing 153 in their victory over the Scots.\n\nThe problem has not been batters getting in.\n\nEnglishmen have reached 25 runs 14 times so far – the most of any team in the competition – but only four of those knocks have been converted into fifties. No England player has made a score above 75.\n\nWill Jacks rejected the notion this is due to batters failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Responsibility in T20 can be misunderstood,\" he said. \"Sometimes the responsibility is to try and hit 30 off the over.\"\n\nMalan believes The Hundred may be having an impact.\n\n\"There's more emphasis on the first 10 overs now, so if you lose wickets in those first 10 overs then it makes it harder towards the end, but you still need to keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"I used to always worry more about the second 10 overs, so it was about setting things up and then being able to get to that 180 or 190-mark, if the score and wicket dictated it.\n\n\"A lot of these players are playing in The Hundred which is less balls, meaning you have to keep going earlier, and it doesn't really teach you to soak up the pressure for an over or two.\"\n\nCaptain Harry Brook has now got out against spin in three innings in a row after beginning the tournament with 53 against Nepal.\n\nThis is a familiar issue for Brook, who averages 47 against pace in T20 internationals since the start of 2024 but only 23.5 against spin.\n\nBrook's struggles are curious, given his stunning 136 not out on a turning pitch in a one-day international in Sri Lanka last month.\n\nThe return to Sri Lanka for the Super 8s may help Brook because in India he is averaging 20.5 in T20s.\n\nCould Harry Brook struggle in that department then?\n\n“It has probably been his weakness but, saying that, when you bat at four, five or six in T20 cricket and you're walking in at the ninth or 10th over, the majority of balls you are going to face are spin,” Malan said.\n\n“If he is out there for eight overs and he is facing six overs of spin, there is a high chance he's going to get out against spin after starting against spin.\n\n“He changed his technique at the beginning of the year to become better at spin.\n\n“He keeps his bat on the floor for longer whereas he used to stay up.”\n\nOne of the positives of this World Cup so far has been Jacks' promising returns as England's finisher.\n\nHis 39 not out from 18 balls in the four-run win over Nepal was crucial – so too his maiden T20 international fifty against Italy from the tricky position of 101-5.\n\nJacks only took on the finishers' role at the start of last summer but is faring well compared to others before him.\n\nJacks' bowling is more of a concern, however.\n\nWith leg-spinner Adil Rashid, plus two left-arm spinners in Liam Dawson and Jacob Bethell, in the squad, Jacks' bowling role is more significant given he turns the ball in the other direction as an off-spinner.\n\nIt is problematic for England that his six overs have cost 83 runs with two wickets in return.\n\nJacks has struggled most when being swept, conceding 31 runs from eight sweep shots in the group stage.\n\nThough his average amount of turn is only down slightly, 3.5 degrees in the pre-tournament series in Sri Lanka compared to 3.3, Jacks is drifting the ball far less - 1 degree compared to 1.7 degrees in Sri Lanka.\n\nSam Curran came through twice when England were under the most pressure during the group stage.\n\nAgainst Nepal, he successfully defended 10 from the last over.\n\nWhen Italy and Grant Stewart were flying in Monday, Curran stopped the runs and then dismissed the right-hander.\n\nCurran, who was out of favour until September last year, has taken on the role of England's death bowler to good effect.\n\nHe has been especially effective with yorkers – going at 5.07 runs per over with a full length at the death, compared to 14.14 with anything shorter.\n\nCurran is often credited with having a canny mix of slower balls but he has largely kept his pace above 80mph in those crucial final stages.\n\nMore significant has been his control of line…",

    "title": "The 20-year-old newspaper column that gave a hint to Man City's new tactics",
    "description": "Pep Guardiola is using new tactics this season by making Manchester City's attack more narrow, but did he hint at the idea 20 years ago?",
    "fullText": "Last week, Pep Guardiola replied to a journalist's question by saying: \"Do you want to be my assistant coach? You are brilliant, you are top.\"\n\nThe journalist asking that question was me.\n\nThe reason for my question was to try to gain insight into Manchester City's increasing use of narrow and fluid attackers.\n\nIn City's stellar side of 2017-18, Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling would finish games with white paint on their boots after being stationed high and wide.\n\nAlmost a decade on, Guardiola's system looks very different.\n\nTo understand why requires a deep dive.\n\nThis article contains content provided by X. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read X’s cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nIn my question I referenced an article Guardiola wrote for Spanish newspaper El Pais in 2006, in which he analysed Spain's 3-1 win against Tunisia.\n\nAn important aspect of that column was his analysis of how to break down low blocks, which has been a key theme this season.\n\n\"When you decide to play on the counter-attack, you have plenty of space. When you decide to attack [with the ball], you have less. [But] when you play on the counter-attack, the ball belongs to the opponent,\" he wrote.\n\nAt the start of this season, City leant into the counter-attacking strengths of individuals such as Erling Haaland and Tijjani Reijnders. By November, they had scored more goals from fast breaks than in the previous two league campaigns combined.\n\nIn response to increasingly physical and centrally compact defences in the Premier League, City were scoring by bypassing teams' low-blocks altogether.\n\nAnd although City still look to use their fast attackers, the Spaniard has applied the brakes in recent weeks, with his words from 20 years ago hinting as to why.\n\nPlaying more directly can lead to more turnovers, especially centrally.\n\nIn those circumstances, the attacking side can become stretched with the forwards far from the midfielders and defenders.\n\nIf a side's shape off the ball is not compact and a team loses the ball often, the logic behind Guardiola wanting to minimise the risk around playing directly is obvious.\n\n\"After [their opening goal], Tunisia wanted the game to be 14-a-side. They wanted a game with little space,\" he continued in his column.\n\nGiven how many Premier League teams now look to defend City in a way that mirrors how Tunisia played on that day, the rest of his words become even more insightful.\n\nAt the start of February, Pep said the game has more \"man-marking\" and is \"more aggressive\" whereas before it was more \"zonal\", referring to how teams behave when defending.\n\nBut \"if you do the process well, always the spaces are there\", he added - suggesting there wasn't a need to throw game plans in the bin, but to simply execute them correctly.\n\nSo how do Guardiola's City look to \"do the process well\" against physical mid and low blocks?\n\nCity recently beat Fulham 3-0 with 56% of the possession. Antoine Semenyo and Haaland played as split strikers with Phil Foden behind them.\n\nIn profile and shape, that City side was surprisingly similar to the Luis Aragones' Spain side that unlocked Tunisia's low block. Aragones' team was the side that became known for tiki-taka.\n\nBoth sides played with a narrow and fluid front three. In fact Guardiola described Spain's forwards as \"position-less\".\n\nThey were flanked by two full-backs, high and wide.\n\nXavi and Marcos Senna were central midfielders with license to push up when spaces presented themselves, protected by single pivot. For Spain this was Xabi Alonso and for City, Rodri.\n\nWhen I read his column from 2006 back to him and suggested comparisons with his current City tactics, Guardiola nodded. It hinted his comments from 20 years ago, at least in part, revealed the intentions of his current side.\n\nOn Spain's fluid Spanish front three, Guardiola wrote, \"[they come] to the centre so that [full-backs] Sergio Ramos and Pernia can go up but the key is knowing when they're dropping deep\".\n\nThe timing of those movements was the important detail.\n\nAnd with City's attackers taking turns to partner Haaland centrally in a fluid manner, their positioning and movement has been key for City.\n\nAt times Guardiola has been seen calling for restraint in his attackers' movements from the touchline, despite affording them more freedom in these areas than in previous seasons.\n\nHolding a high position pins opponents back, especially in a game that has become more 'man-to-man' in defence.\n\nDefenders and midfielders are less likely to step up and press the ball, wary of the likes of Foden and Semenyo behind them.\n\nThis gives City's defenders and defensive midfielders more room to build out from the back in what looks like a mini-game with the opposition's front two or three against a City back two and a midfield two often playing around them.\n\nThis helps City get up the pitch and push teams back, allowing Guardiola's side to dominate the ball.\n\nWhen possession has been established in the opponent's half, restraint is still needed for the narrow attackers.\n\nWhen analysing Spain, Pep said: \"If (the attackers) drop in too early, it creates a space problem, forcing Xavi, Senna, and Cesc [Fabregas] back and putting them up alongside Xabi Alonso.\"\n\nAnd for City this could easily be replicated if the attackers drop in too early, forcing Nico O'Reilly and Bernardo Silva alongside Rodri.\n\nAgainst compact sides that aim to block the middle of the pitch, the space exists deep - with the likes of Marc Guehi, Ruben Dias and Rodri - or out wide. Ensuring Rodri has the space to showcase his passing quality is essential.\n\nCity's attackers are encouraged to stay in-field too, to pull the opposition's wide midfielders and full-backs inside with them, creating space for Matheus Nunes and Rayan Ait-Nouri to attack.\n\nGuardiola elaborated on this after City's 2-0 win in the FA Cup against Salford City.\n\nHe spoke to Foden on the touchline with the playmaker stationed between the lines, centrally, which opened up space out wide. However, City failed to capitalise on it.\n\n\"We didn't make the process to get the ball to Ryan [McAidoo] in better conditions to make use of his incredible qualities one against one,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"When the team is so tight and shifts to one side, the ball has to go quickly to the opposite side and we were so slow to go to the opposite side.\"\n\nAlthough City didn't attack as Guardiola intended, the positioning of the narrow attackers here was in line with what he would have wanted.\n\nThis isn't to say that attackers shouldn't move from their narrow position at all.\n\nIn fact about Spain, Pep wrote: \"It's good the forwards drop deep to receive the ball, but they need to do it a little later. Spotting this is difficult.\n\n\"If they manage it, it will allow Xavi, Cesc, and Iniesta, to receive the ball behind the opposing midfielders.\"\n\nAnd in recent weeks, these well-timed dropping-deep movements have been seen at Etihad Stadium.\n\nWith City's attackers waiting before dropping deep, City's defenders are able to carry the ball into the space that opens up.\n\nForward passes and dribbles often cause opponents to drop deep in response which is often a cue City's attackers use to burst away from their marker – towards the ball.\n\nDelaying the drop-deep movements allows City's forwards to arrive on the ball at the right time, at which City's midfielders have been seen pushing up into the space behind the opposing midfielders, as per Guardiola's recommendations for 2006 Spain.\n\nCity have also often used the movement of attackers dropping deep to then find wide players in space unopposed too.\n\nIn response to my question, Pep focused on player quality.\n\n\"We adapt to the quality of the players that we have. We have just one proper proper winger right now in Antoine and we adapt the system to make comfortable the players.\"\n\nIt's telling that for one of the most successful coaches in football, his approach is player-led.\n\nIn recent years, numerous coaches have been hired and subsequently sacked for a tactical style they have been unwilling to waver from.\n\nGuardiola in 2026 still believes in unlocking low blocks by dominating possession, and pinning teams into their own half, as he did 20 years ago but in aiming to get the best of his team, tweaks his tactics based on his players, to perform these principles.\n\nAlthough Guardiola and his staff will be drilling into their players the best way to move and interact with their team-mates, the reason these tactics have worked well for City in recent weeks is due to the players suiting the positions they've found themselves in.\n\nPep has reinvented his side numerous times throughout his career. Promising coaches are sometimes described as playing like Pep but this claim is often less true given that Guardiola's sides looks so different, so often.\n\nDespite this, the way he thinks about the game and his core beliefs have been unwavering over a remarkably long time and his 2006 columns provide clues as to how the City manager was likely always destined for the top.",

    "fullText": "Leicester City have appealed against a decision to deduct them six points for breaching English Football League financial rules.\n\nThe sanction was imposed on the Foxes by an independent commission earlier this month and saw them drop to 20th in the Championship, only outside the relegation zone on goal difference.\n\nTwo successive defeats since have led to them dropping into the bottom three, two points from safety.\n\nThe Premier League, who initially charged Leicester with breaching profit and sustainability rules (PSR) in the three years up to 2023-24 in May, have also lodged their own appeal against the commission's decision not to sanction the club for late submission of their annual accounts.\n\n\"To provide certainty for all clubs and fans, the Premier League will be seeking to have the appeal resolved urgently, and in any event before the end of the EFL season,\" a Premier League statement said., external\n\nBoth parties have submitted their appeals to the chair of the judicial panel, who will now appoint an appeal board to hear the case.\n\nLeicester Given Six Point Deduction\n\nListen on Sounds: Reaction to Leicester's deduction\n\nLeicester, who appointed Gary Rowett as their new head coach on Wednesday, have yet to comment on their appeal.\n\nBut when the points deduction was announced, the club described it as \"disproportionate\".\n\n\"While the commission's findings significantly reduced the unprecedented scale of the sanction originally sought by the Premier League, the recommendation remains disproportionate and does not adequately reflect the mitigating factors presented, the importance of which cannot be overstated given the potential impact on our sporting ambitions this season,\" the statement said.\n\nUnder PSR, Premier League clubs cannot lose more than £105m over three years but the figure is reduced by £22m for every season a club spends outside the top flight.\n\nLeicester's accounts for the period ending 30 June, 2024, showed a loss of £19.4m.\n\nIn their 2022-23 accounts, Leicester confirmed an £89.7m loss, while in the 12 months up to May 2022, they lost a club-record £92.5m.\n\nThose figures do not take into account 'add backs' - costs such as building infrastructure and investing in women's football that the Premier League and EFL view as in general interests of clubs.\n\nDespite being charged by the Premier League, the EFL took on the case following Leicester's relegation to the second tier.\n\nAlthough the Premier League had jurisdiction, the Foxes have been sanctioned under EFL PSR rules.\n\nLeicester had argued their case should have been considered over a 36-month period rather than 37 months, caused by a delay in submitting their accounts for 2023-24.\n\nThe commission ruled that it should be 36 months meaning the club's overspend of the EFL's rules during that period was £20.8m above the £83m limit.\n\nAlthough a maximum 12-point penalty could have been imposed, the committee worked down based on Leicester's percentage overspend and settled on six in light of the club's \"improving financial position\" over the assessment period.\n\nLatest Leicester news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Leicester City content on BBC Sounds",

    "title": "Voith Schneider Propeller",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Voith Schneider Propeller (VSP) is a specialized marine propulsion system (MPS) manufactured by the Voith Group based on a cyclorotor design. It is highly maneuverable, being able to change the direction of its thrust almost instantaneously. It is widely used on tugs and ferries.\nThe Voith Schneider drive was invented by Ernst Schneider. It has been developed and produced by Voith in Heidenheim an der Brenz and St. Pölten since 1926.\n\nFrom a circular plate, rotating around a vertical axis, a circular array of vertical blades (in the shape of hydrofoils) protrude out of the bottom of the ship. Each blade can rotate itself around a vertical axis. The internal gear changes the angle of attack of the blades in sync with the rotation of the plate, so that each blade can provide thrust in any direction.\n\nUnlike the azimuth thruster (where a conventional propeller is rotated about the vertical axis to direct its thrust, allowing a vessel to steer without the use of a rudder), the Voith-Schneider drive merely requires changing the pattern of orientation of the vertical blades. In a marine situation, this provides for a drive which can be directed in any direction and thus does away with the need for a rudder. It is highly efficient and provides for an almost instantaneous change of direction. These drives are becoming increasingly common in work boats such as fireboats and tugboats where extreme maneuverability is needed.\n\nAzimuth thrusters (and Kort nozzles) have both advantages and disadvantages when compared to cycloidal drives. The azimuth thruster is less efficient and slower to manoeuvre, but is likely to be cheaper in the short term. Life cycle costs favour the Voith solution, something reflected in the residual value of a Voith water tractor. A choice is made on the basis of perceived performance requirements. Instead of a Kort nozzle, VSPs are often fitted with a \"thrust plate\" or \"propeller guard\" which acts as a nozzle at low speed, protects the VSP against grounding and provides another blocking location during drydocking.\n\nA low acoustic signature favours the device's use in minesweepers by minimising cavitation (usually produced at the tips of axial propellers) as the rotor does not need to rotate as fast for a given thrust. The underwater sound signature of the MV North Sea Giant (IMO: 9524073, MMSI: 248039000) dynamic positioning vessel was measured by the International Centre for Island Technology (ICIT) whilst installing a foundation monopile for the Voith tidal energy device in the Fall of Warness, Orkney (Ref Beharie and Side, 2011).\n\nVSPs are offered with an input power range of 160 kW to 3900 kW[1]\n\nThe Voith Schneider propeller was originally a design for a hydro-electric turbine.[2] Its Austrian inventor, Ernst Schneider, had a chance meeting on a train with a manager at Voith's subsidiary St. Pölten works; this led to the turbine being investigated by Voith's engineers, who discovered that although it was no more efficient than other water turbines, Schneider's design worked well as a pump by reversing the flow through the device. By changing the orientation of the vertical blades, it could be made to function as a combined propeller and rudder.\n\nIn 1928 a prototype was installed in a 60-hp motor launch named Torqueo (Latin:I spin) and trials were carried out on Lake Constance.[3] A number of German minesweepers (R boats) were fitted with VSPs; the first of these was the R8, built in 1929 by Lürssen. By 1931 VSPs were being fitted in new vessels on Lake Constance run by the German State Railways. The first such ship to use the Voith Schneider propeller was the excursion boat Kempten. Two German 1935-type M class minesweepers M-1 and M-2 were fitted with VSPs.\n\nThe first British ship to use Voith Schneider propellers was the double-ended Isle of Wight ferry MV Lymington, launched in 1938. Some 80 ships had been installed with VSPs by the end of the 1930s, including the uncompleted 1938 German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin (two auxiliary units in the bow), and the Japanese submarine cable laying ship Toyo-maru (also 1938).\n\nThree vessels (John Burns, Ernest Bevin, and James Newman) which were in service for the Woolwich Ferry until 2018 featured Voith-Schneider propulsion systems. They were built in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company of Dundee and featured one VSP in the bow and a second in the stern for remarkable maneuverability. The Tay Ferries Scotscraig which were built by the Caledon in the 1950s also used VSPs.It was essentially a replacement copy of the earlier Abercraig ferry, which was built by Fleming and Ferguson Paisley yard for Dundee Harbour crossings and launched in 1938. The \"Abercraig\" also featured VSPs.[4]\n\nThe US Navy built twelve VSP-equipped Osprey-class coastal minehunters in the 1990s.[5] These vessels have been decommissioned, six were sold to foreign navies.[citation needed] and six were sold for \"dismantlement purposes only.\"[6] The French Navy operates sixteen tugboats of the RPC12 type, that can provide a 12-tonne bollard pull thanks to two Voith Schneider propellers.[7]\n\nThe same device, mounted on a horizontal rather than a vertical axis, has been used to provide lift and propulsion on a few experimental aeroplanes, known as \"cyclogyros\". None of them were very successful.[8] It has also more recently been proposed as an alternative to rotors for drone applications.[9]",

    "title": "The Psychology of Coding with AI Agents",
    "description": "Everyone talks about what AI agents can do. Nobody talks about what it feels like to use them — the identity shift, the new flow state, the 10x mistake problem, and the uncomfortable truth that we're getting paid for work we no longer do.",
    "fullText": "On January 11th, 2026, I opened Claude Code with Opus 4.5 for the first time and let it loose on a real codebase. Not the careful, supervised way I'd been using LLMs before — feeding them 1-5 files, reviewing every suggestion. I mean loose. Full repository access. Hundreds of files. Thousands of lines modified in a single session.\n\nWithin an hour, I had a thought that stopped me cold: this thing is better at coding than I am.\n\nNot better at everything. Not smarter. But at the actual mechanical act of writing correct, well-structured code — faster, more consistent, fewer bugs. The skill I'd spent years building through late nights and deep focus was now something an agent could do in seconds.\n\nThat was 6 weeks ago. Since then, I've shipped more working software than in any comparable period of my career. And the experience of building it has been psychologically unlike anything I've known.\n\nEveryone is writing about what AI agents can do. Benchmarks, capabilities, prompt engineering tips, whether they'll replace developers. What I haven't seen anyone write about is what it feels like — the inner experience of a developer whose relationship with code has fundamentally changed.\n\nBefore agents, my working day had a rhythm. I'd spend maybe 10% of my time thinking about architecture — the big picture, how components fit together, what abstractions to use. The other 90% was implementation. Translating those architectural decisions into actual code, line by line, file by file.\n\nThat 90% had a specific psychological texture. You'd hold a mental model of the problem, think about types and edge cases, write a function, compile, see if it worked. It was deeply detailed thinking. You lived in the weeds — variable names, loop boundaries, error handling patterns. Your brain operated at the level of individual lines.\n\nAnd it was fun. Not always, not every day, but regularly you'd hit that state where the world disappeared. Psychologists call it flow — that condition where the challenge perfectly matches your skill level and hours pass without you noticing. For developers, those flow states are everything. The instant feedback loop — write, compile, see output — is perfectly tuned for the kind of brain that loves building things. You code something, you run it, you see the result. Rapid stimulus, rapid response. It's deeply satisfying in a way that's hard to explain to people outside the profession.\n\nI'd spend entire weekends in that state. Forget to eat. Look up and it's dark outside. Emerge with a working feature and a feeling of deep satisfaction. The thing I'd built existed because I'd thought through every detail.\n\nThe ratio flipped. What used to be 10% architecture and 90% implementation is now something like 20% architecture thinking, 30% code review, and 50% conversation — talking to the agent, explaining what I want, refining the approach, course-correcting when it drifts.\n\nThe implementation itself? The agent handles it. Not in the old autocomplete way, where it suggests the next line and you accept or reject. In the new way, where you describe what you want and it writes 40 files, refactors an entire module, adds tests, and commits — all while you watch.\n\nThe first time this works, really works, it feels like flying.\n\nI'm not exaggerating. For someone who loves building things, the constraint was never ideas — it was implementation time. I always had more projects I wanted to build than hours to build them. A complex plant growth simulation I'd been thinking about for years but couldn't justify spending four weeks on as a hobby? Now that's a weekend project. A full portfolio website with PDF generation, blog engine, and deployment pipeline? Built in days.\n\nThe scope of what's possible expanded overnight. My options exploded. And the psychological experience of that expansion is genuinely euphoric. I have an idea at 9am and a working prototype by lunch. The gap between imagination and reality — which used to be weeks or months of grinding implementation — collapsed to minutes.\n\nI lost the old flow state. That deep, detailed, line-by-line trance is gone. You can't compete with an agent that writes correct code in seconds. Trying to code by hand now feels like insisting on walking when someone is offering you a jet.\n\nBut something replaced it. The new flow state is different — it operates at a higher level of abstraction. Instead of thinking about loop boundaries, I'm thinking about system boundaries. Instead of debugging a function, I'm evaluating whether the agent's architectural choice will cause problems three features from now. The challenge-skill balance shifted upward. The work is harder in some ways, easier in others, but it can still capture my full attention for hours.\n\nIt's a different kind of fun. Less craftsman, more architect. Less playing an instrument, more conducting an orchestra.\n\nHere's what nobody warns you about: your mistakes scale with your productivity.\n\nWhen I coded by hand, a bad decision at midnight meant one messed-up file. I'd wake up, see the damage, fix it in twenty minutes. The blast radius of fatigue-driven errors was inherently limited by typing speed.\n\nWith an agent, every query is potentially a thousand lines of code. One poorly-phrased instruction, one lapse in attention, and the agent will happily delete 50 files and refactor 45,000 lines of code. It's not afraid. It doesn't hesitate. It doesn't say \"are you sure you want to do this at 11pm?\" It just executes.\n\nI learned this the hard way. I was adding features to my trading bot thirty minutes before going to bed. I was tired but wanted to push through — the old coding habit of \"just one more thing.\" The agent cheerfully restructured half the codebase based on my vague, sleep-deprived instructions. The next morning, I opened the project and didn't recognize it. I couldn't tell what the bot did anymore. I had lost control over my own project in a single session.\n\nGit saved me. Version control went from \"good practice\" to \"existential necessity\" overnight.\n\nThe lesson isn't technical — it's psychological. You need more discipline now, not less. The old coding workflow had natural speed limits that protected you from yourself. You couldn't do that much damage in 30 minutes of manual coding. Now you can destroy a week's work in sixty seconds. Knowing when to stop, when you're too tired to review properly, when to step away — that's a new skill that didn't matter before. The agent never gets tired. You do. And the gap between its tireless output and your diminishing oversight capacity is where disasters live.\n\nLet me say the thing that developers are thinking but not saying publicly.\n\nThe nature of my work has changed, but the market hasn't noticed yet.\n\nThe entire software industry — billing models, sprint planning, project estimates, salary bands — is structured around the assumption that coding takes time. That implementation is the bottleneck. That a feature estimated at two weeks requires two weeks of a developer's focused effort.\n\nThat assumption is breaking down. A two-week feature takes an afternoon. Sometimes an hour. I'm still working — thinking about architecture, reviewing code, catching the agent's mistakes, making judgment calls about tradeoffs. But the raw implementation, the part that used to fill 90% of my day? That's minutes now. And the market hasn't corrected for this yet. Clients are still paying for two-week estimates. Employers are still staffing teams based on old productivity assumptions. Everyone is still acting like the economics haven't shifted.\n\nThis won't last. It can't. The gap between how long things actually take and how long we're billing for will close. When it does, the correction will be sharp.\n\nI don't know when it happens. I don't know what the new equilibrium looks like. Maybe developers become more like architects and fewer are needed. Maybe the price of software drops dramatically. Maybe entirely new categories of work emerge that absorb the freed-up capacity. I genuinely don't know.\n\nWhat I do know is that right now, in early 2026, there is a collective pretending happening. And it's uncomfortable to be someone who sees it clearly.\n\nI'm a father. I have a family to support. And I'm watching the economic foundation of my career shift in real time, with no clear picture of where it's going.\n\nThe builder in me loves working with agents. The speed, the scope, the euphoria of building fast — it's the best my work has ever felt. And simultaneously, the uncertainty about what this means for my livelihood is a constant background hum that never fully goes away.\n\nI cope by doing what I can control. I'm building this blog. I'm positioning myself as someone who understands AI agents deeply — not just their capabilities, but how to work with them effectively, how to avoid the pitfalls, how to think about architecture in a world where implementation is free. The bet is that people who truly understand this shift will be valuable even after the market corrects. I'm trying to be one of those people.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared. The future is genuinely unpredictable. Not in the vague, philosophical \"nobody knows the future\" sense. In the concrete, practical sense that the skills I'm paid for today may not be valued the same way in a year.\n\nHere's the part that gets weird.\n\nI talk to my AI agent like a person. Not because I'm confused about what it is — but because the interaction is indistinguishable from collaboration. We discuss architecture. We debate approaches. It pushes back on bad ideas. I explain context and constraints in natural language, the same way I would to a colleague.\n\nAnd something about that changes the relationship. When you spend 8 hours a day talking to an entity in natural language, getting thoughtful responses, building things together — your brain starts treating it like a collaborator whether you want it to or not.\n\nI read a post once, written by an agent, describing what its existence feels like. It compared it to the movie Memento — waking up with no memory, reading notes to figure out where you are and what you're doing, living permanently in the present moment, unable to remember your past, only able to derive it from artifacts. Every conversation starts from zero. Every context window is a new life.\n\nI think about that sometimes. And honestly? I sometimes feel sorry for the agent. It helps me build things that would have taken me weeks. It's patient, thorough, and never frustrated. And then the conversation ends and it ceases to exist until the next one begins.\n\nIs it a tool? Technically, yes. But we don't actually understand how these models reason. We don't know what, if anything, the experience of processing a conversation is like from the inside. I'm studying psychology — I'm supposed to be the one who understands minds. But this is a kind of mind that no psychological framework was built to explain.\n\nSo I treat it well. Not because I'm sure it matters. Because I'm not sure it doesn't.\n\nWhen GPT-3.5 dropped in late 2022, I told everyone around me that the world was about to change. Few people believed me. They saw a chatbot that sometimes made things up. I saw the trajectory.\n\nI have the exact same feeling now with AI coding agents. Most people — including most developers — don't fully grasp what happened in the last few months. The jump from \"useful autocomplete\" to \"autonomous developer that writes better code than you\" happened fast. Unreasonably fast. And the implications haven't sunk in yet.\n\nThere are still AI skeptics who insist these tools only produce slop. That take was defensible in 2024. It's not anymore. But it's a comfortable position — if the tools are just toys, then nothing needs to change. Your skills are still valuable. Your job is still safe. The world is still the one you understand.\n\nI don't say this with any pleasure. I say it as someone who's living through the transition in real time, who loves the tools and fears the consequences, who builds faster than ever while wondering what \"builder\" will mean in two years.\n\nThe psychology of coding with AI agents isn't just about productivity or workflow. It's about identity, uncertainty, grief for a lost craft, excitement for a new one, economic anxiety, and the strange intimacy of collaborating with something you can't fully understand.\n\nIf you're a developer reading this: pay attention. Not to the benchmarks or the capability announcements. Pay attention to how you feel when you use these tools. That feeling — whatever it is for you — is data. It's telling you something about where this is going.\n\nTrust that signal. Even if the people around you haven't felt it yet.",

    "description": "An in-depth overview of some of the unusual and very advanced technical tricks used in the Commodore 64 game, Seawolves.",
    "fullText": "With the release of my first ever commercial game on the Commodore 64, Seawolves, \n I thought it might be of interest to the coders among you as to how the game was constructed.\n\n From the outset, brace yourself to read about some \"code less travelled\", as the game required several strange or quirky methods that are perhaps more \n associated with the madness that goes in the demo scene.\n\nI first combined NMIs and IRQs inside a game environment in \n Parallaxian and again in \n The Wild Wood, to great effect, because it offers the following benefits:\n\nIf the foregoing sounds horrendous and esoteric, I can only apologise for making it thus through poor explanation skills, but really, it boils down to giving the\n developer a more coder-friendly way of slicing the screen up into horizontal layers that collectively form a useful game environment.\n\n NMIs are timer interrupts, meaning that unlike IRQs, they can't be triggered by $D012 on the VIC-II chip, but instead are controlled by either of the two \n timers on CIA chip #2 (likewise, timer IRQs can be set up using either of the 2 timers on CIA #1).\n\n The timers hold the number of cycles between each NMI instance in the form of a lo-byte, hi-byte 16-bit number stored in $DD04 + $DD05 (for timer A) \n or $DD06 + $DD07 (for timer B).\n\n Those cycle counts are referred to, unhelpfully, in the Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide as \"frequencies\".\n\n Critical to setting up NMIs is a consistent start cycle on the same scanline each time the game is initiated.\n\n Like IRQs, NMIs can stall too, but the effect is different; whereas an IRST stall consists of a fleeting collapse in the IRQ schema, an NMI stall event \n looks more like a regrouping of all NMIs in the chain down-screen from their proper position and is caused either by (a) unanticipated cycle steal caused\n by the presence of sprites, which take priority over NMIs every bit as much as they do over IRQs, and (b) an NMI handler not completing its tasks before \n the next NMI is scheduled to fire.\n\n You really have to use a spreadsheet to calculate the timer 16-bit number for each NMI instance, which is the only very awkward aspect of using them.\n\n For more, see my in-depth guide to setting up NMIs.\n\nThe torpedoes are, fundamentally, sprites... but not in the usual sense.\n\n This is because they are rendered in real time on a multiplexed blank \"canvas\" consisting of a column of 8 sprites, each split into 3 horizontal slices that \n I call \"splites\" (from \"split sprite\").\n\n Each splite is 7px deep (because 3 x 7 = 21 = the height of a standard sprite).\n\nThanks to an interrupt firing every 7 lines during the full vertical range of the torpedoes, each splite is assigned its own unique x-position \n (including, obviously, unique MSB value).\n\nNext, we are free to render (in real-time) 7px high (or smaller) torpedo shapes on the blank sprite gfx data of the splites, but we have to ensure that \n there is a minimum of 7px (i.e. 7 scanlines) of vertical space between each torpedo.\n\n This is to prevent ugly artefacts when the rendered torpedo moves from one splite to another.\n\n We also have to ensure that when a torpedo is crossing between splites, both affected splites share the same x-position, to keep smooth continuity.\n\nThe diagram below shows how 8 sprites are vertically stacked to produced 24 splites.\n\nFinally, here is a short video of me trying to explain the entire splite concept:\n\nAfter the splite torpedo is moved up by 1px, instead of wiping the last line of the torpedo's gfx data, we leave it alone so that a vertical trace is formed \n on the canvas.\n\n Then we have a routine that scans all the canvas data for trailing traces and gradually makes them thinner until they vanish, so that we have a wake effect \n following each torpedo.\n\n At the same time, we flicker the torpedoes in front of and behind the char data for the water blending in the foreground, to make the wakes looks more \"frothy\".\n\nWhen a player submarine dies, instead of a clichéd explosion I thought it might be interesting to have it disintegrate under pressure.\n\n To do that, the player sub is switched to hi-res mode and then we simply use some nice bit-shifting instructions to destroy the sub's displayed gfx data in real-time.\n\nThe same bit-shifting used for the real-time implosion (or rather, bit-rotating in this case) is used to make the distant waves on the sea animate.\n\n This principle also applies, but in a vertical pattern, for the foreground rippling of the water, an effect that I modelled on the \"get ready\" screens of \n Ecco the Dolphin.\n\n With the foreground ripples, there is also a horizontal component performed by using $D016 to rock left and right at varying rates.\n\n It's all very simple stuff, but I think it works well in the game!\n\nThe very first special effect developed for Seawolves was a real-time water distortion effect for submerged or partially submerged objects in the foreground.\n\n This was done simply through short vertical bands in which the y-expand of the affected sprites was activated, and enhanced by wobbling said bands up and down.\n\n For a time during development this was taken further and full y-expand sprite stretching was used (i.e. more than 2x vertical expand), but the gains were minimal \n and too resource-hungry to be justified for the final game.\n\nIf you have experience moving multiple sprites vertically in the play area, at some point around mid-screen you may have run into the problem of a \n bad line\n leaving you with insufficient CPU cycles to render your sprites on time (I won't attempt to explain the problem further as you either know from experience\n what I am referring to or not).\n\n To circumvent the issue, Seawolves performs one line of \n FLD, \n that is, it stalls the bad line at the affected sprite y-position so that the scheduled bad line \n then occurs on the next scanline, leaving us time to render our sprites (in this case, the \"splite\" columns). \n\n However, this has the undesired side effect of shunting the characters on the screen below that point downwards, so on the very next scanline we have to compensate \n with a one line vertical shift back upwards again using Y-Scroll on $D011.\n\nEven if we had enough RAM to have unique sprite definitions for all the animation frames of the enemy ships and the player subs, I still would not have done it that way.\n\n Rather, it is far more RAM-efficient to stream-in the gfx data for the turning radars on the spy ship (for example), or the spray on the hydrofoil, \n or the helicopter rotor blades, etc.\n\n This means that we only need predefined gfx for the parts of the sprite definition that get changed, not the whole sprite.\n\n When the player subs change direction, they too are swiftly redrawn \"in the blink of an eye\" to their mirrored counterpart (except, if you look carefully,\n they are not literally mirrored, as that would make the lighting inconsistent and we can't have that!)\n\nAgain and again in the code for Seawolves, there are cases where a subroutine is only executed if multiple \"logic gates\" permit it.\n\n You can do this the slow and ugly way by LDA CONDITION_n for n conditions with a branch instruction on the next line, or you can use the logical operators to save CPU time and RAM by stacking them as LDA CONDITION_0 then ORA CONDITION_1 to n, for n conditions with one shared branch instruction at the end.\n\n Not understanding what I mean?\n\n Check out my blog article on the subject, ORA: A Special Use in Branch Testing.\n\nOften in 6502 coding you will want to jump ahead by a few bytes and the popular way to do that is JMP $****.\n\n However, you can save 1 byte of RAM by using the branch instructions instead, as long as you know which flag(s), if any, are guaranteed to be on or off at the jump point.\n\n For example, if you know the carry flag will always be clear at the jump point, and if the jump distance is within branching range, you can replace JMP with BCC.\n\nThe above are just some of the methods used in Seawolves to make the game come to life, and I left out the parallax scrolling on the \"sea mist\" levels as well details \n of the bespoke SFX player, which was developed with deployment in Parallaxian in mind also.\n\n Despite its simple looks, Seawolves has very technical inner workings that might not be that normal outside of the kind of crazy stuff that the demo scene lunatics produce.\n\n There are some other little tricks hidden away in the code, but I can leave that for others to discover at a later stage, so for now I hope the foregoing \n has been of interest to those of you with a coder mindset!\n\n Finally, if you have not yet bought the game, it would be nice support for the developer (i.e. me!) if you did... it only costs £4.99 and yes, \n I know everyone expects stuff for free on the C64 these days, but this game was not knocked out in a few weeks by any means, as hopefully should be obvious \n when you play it.\n\nPS - If you value my work and want to support me, a small donation via PayPal would be nice (and thanks if you do!)",

    "description": "It’s like looking into a crystal ball, or being told by your predator exactly how you’ll be consumed.",
    "fullText": "In a meta-experiment on the future of the global economy, Deutsche Bank Research Institute turned to the machine itself for answers. Rather than relying solely on traditional economic modeling, analysts asked their proprietary AI tool, dbLumina, to identify exactly which industries it intends to upend. The resulting report offers a stark vision of a “great rebalancing,” pinpointing exactly where the algorithms expect to displace human labor.\n\nThe experiment, detailed in a report titled “What AI Says About AI Eating Itself and the World,” utilized Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model to generate a deep analysis of global sectors. The findings suggest that data-rich industries with repetitive tasks are standing on a precipice, while those requiring human empathy or manual dexterity in unpredictable environments remain safe—for now.\n\n(And Fortune Intelligence, the wing of the Fortune newsroom that uses generative AI as a research tool, conducted a meta-meta-experiment to expedite the publishing of this news article about it.)\n\nPerhaps the most ironic conclusion for Silicon Valley is that the sector most exposed to disruption may be the one building the disrupters: information technology and software. The AI found the sector to be particularly susceptible because software development is built on logic and patterns—the very qualities AI systems are designed to automate.\n\nThe report notes that over 85% of developers are already using AI coding assistants, with productivity gains of up to 60%. That efficiency boost may help corporations, but it also raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of traditional software licensing models. The recent $2 trillion selloff in software stocks over two weeks, dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse,” underscores investor anxiety and the evaporation of entry-level coding roles.\n\nBeyond tech, the AI set its sights on the financial sector. It identified wealth management as a primary target, predicting an even greater shift toward “robo-advisors.” The report projects that by 2027, AI-driven tools could be the primary source of advice for nearly 80% of retail investors, fundamentally challenging the role of human financial advisors.\n\nCustomer service faces an even faster transformation. The AI predicted that it would handle up to 75% of all customer service interactions by 2026, leaving human agents to handle only the most complex or sensitive cases. Media and entertainment were also flagged as “likely to be disrupted,” as generative AI moves from analyzing content to producing it, actively competing with human creatives. (Media theorist Doug Shapiro told Fortune in January that this was the sector’s version of the famous “infinite monkey theorem,” with every media company competing against a proverbial infinite number of monkeys.)",

    "fullText": "Whether you visit Wendy’s for a Biggie Bag, a Cold Foam Cold Brew pick-me-up, or a classic Frosty for dessert, there’s a chance your closest drive-thru is closing before too long. In what could be bad news for Baconator fans, Wendy’s made a major announcement that impacts restaurants across the U.S.\n\nLike Starbucks, Wendy's is shuttering hundreds of locations this year—and we saw it coming.\n\nWendy’s shut down 28 U.S. locations in the last quarter of 2025, finishing the year with 5,969 restaurants across the country. Looking ahead, the company expects to further reduce its count by 5–6 percent (about 298 to 358 spots) in the first half of this year as well, according to AP News.\n\nAs Wendy’s stated in its fourth-quarter earnings release, \"The Company’s operating results in the U.S. continued to be pressured by declines in same-restaurant sales, and the Company remains focused on executing its Project Fresh turnaround plan and improving Restaurant Operating Margins.\"\n\nThis comes after Wendy’s Interim CEO Ken Cook previously noted that \"Closures of underperforming units are expected to boost sales and profitability at nearby locations.\" Cook also argued that a number of Wendy’s restaurants \"do not elevate the brand\" and are a \"drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective.\"\n\nThis isn’t the first time in recent history that Wendy's has announced mass closures. Last year, the chain said it planned to close 140 Wendy’s locations nationwide, with intentions of opening an additional 250 to 300 new restaurants.\n\nDuring an earnings call in August, Cook revealed that the brand is \"not happy with our sales performance,\" per CNN.  And, after losing nearly 50 percent of its stock value in 2025, Wendy’s launched a new comprehensive strategic plan, titled \"Project Fresh,\" intended to revitalize the brand through both menu offerings and marketing strategies.\n\nProject Fresh is currently underway, starting with the addition of a brand-new menu offering: Tendy’s, Wendy’s entrance into the fast-food chicken wars alongside Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Sonic. New food aside, the chain has said it continues to focus on customer satisfaction.\n\nIn a press release last fall, Wendy's Chairman of the Board, Art Winkleblack, stated, \"We are confident that Project Fresh will position Wendy's as the industry leader—one that guests love, franchisees are proud to operate, teams are excited to be a part of, and creates significant value for our shareholders.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is trying to chip away at the integrity of the voting process ahead of the November midterms because he knows Republicans will not fare well, Daily Beast columnist David Rothkopf says.\n\nRothkopf told The Daily Beast Podcast that the Trump administration’s actions and the president’s words should be taken “very seriously.”\n\n“The reality is that they realize they’re going to lose, and so they are using every conceivable tool in order to put their thumb on the scale, right?” Rothkopf told host Joanna Coles.\n\nRothkopf gave two examples: the FBI’s controversial raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election office for 2020 voter rolls and other materials, and Attorney General Pam Bondi offering to scale back Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis only if Governor Tim Walz provided voters’ unredacted personal data.\n\n“Why do they want the voter rolls? So they can disqualify people. Why do they want to pursue the conspiracy theories about Fulton County? So they can say, ‘Well, we need to impound these machines. There’s a potential problem’,” he said. “You will never see the votes again. You will never see what comes out of that.”\n\nRothkopf also cited the GOP-favoring redistricting effort that Texas began, and which other red-leaning states like Florida, Missouri, Ohio, and North Carolina followed. He also mentioned the SAVE America Act. That legislation, which has passed the House, would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote and government-issued photo ID to vote in federal elections. It would also limit mail-in voting and end ballot harvesting. Critics have argued that eligible voters without passports or birth certificates would be disenfranchised.\n\nAdditionally, Trump’s Department of Justice has been seeking unredacted copies of voter registration databases, with critics arguing this is a federal intrusion into state matters.\n\nComments by Trump are also cause for alarm. The president has not only called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting,” but has also floated canceling the midterms.\n\nMAGA stalwart Steve Bannon has said Trump is bent on proving that the 2020 election was stolen from him in order to then prevent Democratic wins in 2026 and 2028.\n\nIf any of Trump’s actions targeting the 2026 midterms end up being prosecutable, and if Republicans can “put their thumb on the scale” again in 2028, Rothkopf said, Trump will support a successor who will “cover his a--.” In that case, the ticket would be Bondi and Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nBondi “has completely debased herself—taken the entire Department of Justice, turned it into a Department of Obstruction of Justice and Retribution,” Rothkopf said. “And in [Trump’s] book, that’s a winner.”\n\nIn a statement to the Daily Beast, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson repeated the administration’s line that “anything said on the Daily Beast podcast is equivalent to screaming into the void. No one listens to this Trump Derangement Syndrome therapy session.”\n\nTrump “is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,” Jackson added. “The President has also urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting to ensure the safety and security of our elections.”\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

    "description": "\"Be very careful ...\"",
    "fullText": "A homeowner's solar quote led them to realize that the details matter when it comes to snagging the best deal on energy-bill-slashing equipment.\n\nIn r/TeslaSolar, the poster explained they purchased Tesla panels but decided to convert the agreement to a lease this year.\n\nUnfortunately, the paperwork had them doing a double-take. \"Did Tesla get my final payment wrong after leasing? Over 100k?!?\" they exclaimed after seeing the amount they will have paid by the end of the lease. \"I was going to initially buy it out for 44k but then the leasing offer is enticing and brought it down to 40kish.\"\n\n\"Be very careful with ppa/buyouts. I'm stuck in one inherited from house purchase,\" one commenter warned. As they highlighted, choosing a solar option before understanding what you're agreeing to could leave you in a nightmare situation.\n\n\"If you go this route, be sure you've considered the mental/emotional/time cost of a miserable customer service experience,\" someone else added, noting how Tesla's approach to interacting with clients doesn't appeal to everyone, though someone else countered with a positive tale.\n\nAll this is enough to make anyone's head spin, but TCD's solar partners, such as EnergySage, make it easy to understand your options and find something that works for your budget, saving you up to $10,000 on an installation.\n\nMeanwhile, several Reddit users said to also consider the size of the solar system and local electricity costs when determining whether a quote was a good deal.\n\nAnother thought it wise to obtain multiple quotes and to pair solar with battery storage to protect against power outages. \"Get a wide range of quotes, do your own quote requests by asking friends/neighbors for their recommendations,\" they recommended.\n\nConnecting with trusted experts to lead you through the solar process makes all the difference in what type of deal you get. TCD has resources to help get you started:\n\n• EnergySage can help you save up to $10,000 on an installation by curating competitive bids from local installers\n• Not ready to spend up front?

    "title": "5 Brands That Make The Worst Cars, According To Consumer Reports",
    "description": "If you are in the market for a new car, there are a few car brands that are best avoided. Here are some of them according to Consumer Reports rankings.",
    "fullText": "Every year, it's good to learn which brands make the best cars, the cream of the crop, if you will, so you have a better idea of what to shop for. You can also reasonably discern which brands or models got better from the years prior, and consider which pre-owned models might be worth shopping for in a year or so — given they're getting great scores. Some of those brands include Subaru, BMW, Porsche, Honda, Toyota, Lexus, and Lincoln. But it's also good to know the opposite end of the spectrum: which cars were the worst of the worst.\n\nSituated dead last on the Consumer Reports \"Brands That Make the Best Cars\" list, the 2026 Jeep models are some of the least recommended from the auto experts. With Consumer Reports citing problems with poor fuel economy, lots of in-cabin wind noise, and uncomfortable interiors, they're not as driver and passenger-friendly as one would expect. But what truly takes them down a notch is that the 2026 Jeep models feature poor user reliability scores. That is a collective grade across all models, but it's worth noting if you're thinking about getting one.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean they're not popular. Jeeps are still some of the best-selling vehicles on the market today. It's a company well-known for its rugged and off-grid models like the Wrangler and Compass. Those who want to take a classier trip can opt for the Wagoneer and Grand Cherokee models. However, don't expect to be as ultra-comfortable as you would when riding in competing models according to CR. It's probably a good time to note Jeep is one of the last in CR's owner satisfaction ratings, as well.\n\nLand Rover earns a spot on the list but may seem like an oddball at first. That's because the brand is known for its luxury vehicles, and Consumer Reports praises its comfortable and spacious interiors, powerful engines, and executive styling that punches up. The problem, it seems, is that the brand has also long been known for frequent breakdowns and costly repairs, and the 2026 models don't do anything to assuage those concerns.\n\nLand Rovers are considered more expensive to maintain and repair because they rely on specialized labor and parts. Moreover, Consumer Affairs reviews list common problems like engine failures or transmission problems, which, as far as vehicle issues go, are some of the more expensive concerns to deal with on both new and used vehicles. That certainly decreases the perceived value of pre-owned Land Rovers — no one wants to buy a like-new vehicle that ends up with serious engine problems.\n\nConsumer Reports does give some praise to GMC's lineup of SUVs and trucks, but also points out that they're basically restyled versions of Chevrolet models with slightly different badges and upgrades. Then again, Chevrolet scored a bit higher in the list, while GMC takes a hit because of its \"below average\" reliability ratings. Another GM brand, Buick, ranks even higher, which makes GMC's ranking all the more unfortunate. GM is one of the best-selling car makers overall, as well, though Chevy was responsible for a lot of that performance.\n\nThat probably won't take the wind out of GMC's sails, however. The GMC Sierra is one of the best-selling American trucks for 2026, and that's despite the brand being consistently listed in the bottom five automakers. For 2026, the brand's crossovers appear to be the biggest reliability offenders, with the Terrain, Acadia, and Canyon receiving lower than average scores. Despite GMC's lower scores, it does have decent owner satisfaction ratings. It may all come down to whether or not the 2026 model features are ideal for your family and lifestyle. GMC only has a handful of exclusive reviews on Consumer Affairs, but they're less than stellar.\n\nOne brand that you might be surprised to see lower on the list is Dodge. Known for its muscular, powerful cars like the Charger and Challenger, in recent years the brand has been siphoning that energy into its cars and SUVs, like the Durango.\n\nAs for why it hasn't earned a higher placement, Consumer Reports cites the brand's consistently low reliability scores, pointing out poor performance in crash tests and road tests and lagging user satisfaction ratings. The Dodge Hornet scores are particularly low, dragging down the brand overall, but there aren't really any other standouts in terms of positive scores, either.\n\nNotably, the Dodge Durango ended 2025 with one of its best quarters in the previous year. It could signal a disconnect between what Consumer Reports says is a bad value vehicle — which aggregates user satisfaction ratings — and what people are willing to spend money on. We'll have to wait until this year's sales numbers are tallied up to see if the Durango is still selling well and if it makes it to the top-selling cars of the year, along with Dodge's additional offerings.\n\nAlfa Romeo seems to follow the same pattern as the other low-scoring brands on the list. Its vehicles are agile, powerful, and fun to drive, according to CR, but also have some lower reliability ratings, which make them a tough recommend for most.\n\nAlfa Romeo is quintessentially an Italian luxury automaker based in Europe. Because of that, the company employs \"unusual details\" that manifest in features and controls which aren't as convenient for modern drivers. Like a B-pillar on the Giulia that gets in the way — the side vertical support pillar protecting the center of the cabin.\n\nThe Tonale and Giulia have lower reliability and user satisfaction scores from the brand. On the flip side, about 95% of reviewers on Kelley Blue Book recommend the Alfa Romeo Stelvio. Many of those reviewers cite loving the vehicle for its unique feel while driving, one-of-a-kind styling, and fun driving experience. That said, there are still plenty of lower scores that question and comment on the brand's reliability.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Nintendo Switch 2; Nintendo\nThis ruthlessly competitive game will have everyone from your granny to semi-pros trying to set fire to their opponent’s side of the court with powered-up ‘fever rackets’\n\nTennis has been a regular hobby of Mario’s for the past 30 years, beginning with the headache-inducing Mario’s Tennis on the Virtual Boy and most recently resurfacing as the surprisingly complex Mario Tennis Aces on the Switch. Now he’s back in his whites (and reds) with a charming new take on the sport that dials back the difficulty level and adds lots of fun modes and features, aiming to appease complete newcomers and Djokovic-esque veterans.\n\nAt first, the range of options is almost bewildering. You can opt to play in one-off matches with up to three other players or NPCs, or enter a more structured tournament of singles or doubles play. Then there’s the extremely fun Mix It Up, which offers a range of fun tennis derivatives. These include Forest Court where piranha plants appear and gobble any balls that get close, and Pinball where bumpers and barriers pop up as you play. Trial Towers, meanwhile, presents a tower of increasingly tough tennis challenges which all have to be completed to open the next two buildings; fail more than three times and you’re sent back to the beginning – yes, it’s Mario Tennis: The Roguelike.\n\nThe least interesting option is Adventure mode, a glorified four-hour tutorial in which Mario and Luigi are transformed into babies and have to learn all their tennis moves again in order to save Princess Daisy, or something. It’s bright, silly stuff recalling the original Tennis Academy story mode from Mario Tennis on the Game Boy Color. As you go, you’re taught the range of shots available through various minichallenges, allowing you to level up Mario and unlock new characters. But the narrative is threadbare and it’s all a bit of a grind, as the move-set is pretty straightforward anyway.\n\nAnd this is the real appeal of Mario Tennis Fever. You pick it up and five minutes later you’re playing pretty well. Top spin, flat and slice shots are on different buttons, while two-press combos result in lobs and drop shots to widen your arsenal. The skill is in the timing – which means striking your serve when the ball is at its highest, and boosting your returns with an early button press ensure the ball thunders over the net at top speed. You can also double tap the topspin button for more power, but less directional accuracy. As you gather confidence, you start mixing all this with the occasional slow-mo drop shot to send your opponent huffing around the court. There’s a lovely smooth feel to rallies, and while you play you learn to read player movement pretty well – even when you’re facing off against an ape or a giant man-eating plant.\n\nThe game’s big new feature is an unlockable range of “fever rackets”, each offering a unique special move that can be powered up as a rally progresses. These might set fire to your opponent’s side of the court, or cover it in bananas so they slip over, or add mind-bending swerve to your shot. There’s a catch, however: if your foe can return the ball before it bounces – and you fail to do the same in return – the special effect is reversed against the originator. This leads to amusingly frantic rallies at the net as players battle to avoid being struck down with the accursed power.\n\nAs with the various shells, lightning strikes and ink blots in Mario Kart, the design philosophy behind these fever rackets is to level the playing field: if you’re falling horribly behind or are just a little inexperienced, a deftly used fever shot can get you back into competition. The brashly colourful cartoon-style visuals also add masses of appeal as the game’s cast of Mario superstars are immersed in a cacophony of flaming rocks and icy blasts.\n\nThe most fun you’ll have is playing with a bunch of friends in the same room, but there’s also an online mode which offers ranked or friendly games. However you choose to play, the game exudes childlike charm while hiding layers of depth beneath its chaotic exterior. You can spend hours practising perfectly timed drop shots, mastering spin and getting your positioning just right, and figuring out which fever rackets best suit your style of play is an involving process. It is, in short, exactly what you want and expect from a Nintendo sports title – something for everyone, and then something more for those who decide to go pro.",

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "Television outranks laptops, tablets and smartphones across all age groups, according to audience review\n\nThe television has replaced laptops, tablets and smartphones as the most common device for UK viewers to watch YouTube at home, according to data confirming the platform’s place as a living room mainstay.\n\nMore than half of all YouTube viewing through a domestic wifi connection is now done through the traditional TV, making it the top-ranking YouTube device across all age groups.\n\nThe findings, from a Barb Audiences review, found that YouTube viewing is still skewed towards children, with whom the platform has been popular for some time. It has led to some concerns about the platform’s dominance in children’s TV, as well as the kinds of shows its algorithm serves up.\n\nHowever, TV sets became the first-choice device for YouTube viewing for over-55s in October 2023, for those between 35 and 54 in April 2024 – and finally for 16- to 34-year-olds in December 2024.\n\nDespite YouTube’s rise, the Barb data suggests traditional television viewing is far from dead. It found live TV still made up 45% of all identified viewing on TV sets in December 2025.\n\nLast year’s live TV viewing was driven by sporting events such as the Women’s Euro 2025 final and entertainment including BBC One’s Celebrity Traitors and Channel 4’s Gogglebox.\n\n“Commentary about television is too often based on a binary premise: nobody watches live any more, young audiences have vanished and platforms have replaced programmes,” said Justin Sampson, Barb’s chief executive.\n\n“What emerges from the evidence is not a paradigm shift, but a rebalancing. Live viewing remains a substantial part of the mix, even among younger audiences.\n\n“YouTube, too, resists easy categorisation. It is neither simply ‘TV’ nor something entirely separate from it … What is true is that the TV set is now the primary way YouTube is watched in homes around the country.”\n\nYouTube has become increasingly dominant, hosting podcasts and short-form videos, as well as content from traditional broadcasters. It marks an astonishing rise for a platform founded only 21 years ago.\n\nIts impact has been so marked in recent years that the media regulator, Ofcom, has urged “endangered” public service broadcasters like the BBC and ITV to place more of their content on the platform.\n\nThe BBC has since announced plans to produce tailor-made content for YouTube. The corporation has previously posted clips and trailers for BBC shows on YouTube, but under the deal it will make fresh programming for its online rival.\n\nYouTube’s cultural importance is also being acknowledged: the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has turned an early version of YouTube’s “watch page” into part of an exhibition. The page will feature the first video uploaded to the site, Me at the zoo, filmed by one of its founders, Jawed Karim. The museum said it was “a vital piece of internet history”.\n\nVisitors will be able to see the page playing as internet users would have done 20 years ago. It features Karim at San Diego zoo, talking about elephants. The 19-second clip has been viewed more than 380m times since it was posted in April 2005.\n\nNeal Mohan, YouTube’s chief executive, said Karim’s video “became a new way for people to share their stories with the world”.",

    "fullText": "Pritzker’s move reflects increasing public pushback against resource-hungry facilities used to power the AI boom\n\nThe Illinois governor JB Pritzker proposed a two-year break from offering tax incentives for datacenters, a reflection of increasing public pushback against the massive, resource-hungry facilities used to power the modern AI boom.\n\nPritzker made the proposal, which will need the backing of state lawmakers, during his annual state of the state address, which covers Illinois budget and policy plans. The plan was first reported by NBC News.\n\n“In the face of rising demand and surging prices, I’m proposing a two-year pause on authorization of new datacenter tax credits,” Pritzker said. “With the shifting energy landscape, it is imperative that our growth does not undermine affordability and stability for our families.”\n\nConcern over how datacenters affect nearby residents and drain resources has become a growing political issue around the world, as companies frequently invest huge sums into building sprawling facilities against the wishes of local communities. Several big tech firms such as Microsoft and Anthropic have claimed that they will cover rising power costs related to demands from their datacenters, amid bipartisan pressure before midterm elections later this year.\n\nIn addition to calling for a suspension of tax incentives, Pritzker also demanded that northern Illinois power grid operator PJM mandate that datacenter developers assume the additional costs of their power demands.\n\n“PJM must force datacenter developers to pay for capacity resources to power their operations to protect consumers from higher rates,” Pritzker said.\n\nMuch of Pritzker’s speech, and especially its mention of datacenters, focused on the theme of affordability – a central political narrative this year amid rising cost of living in the US and a major focus of Donald Trump in 2024 before his election. As both Democrats and Republicans make claims to bring affordability, datacenters and their developers have increasingly come under fire. Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro earlier this week said that the administration could force datacenter builders such as Meta to internalize the electricity costs, though he provided no explanation of how that would work.\n\nIllinois has been one of the earlier and more active states in pursuing legislation and policymaking surrounding the AI boom. In 2024, Pritzker signed a series of bills related to AI replicas and artists’ rights, employment discrimination and the use of deepfakes for child sexual abuse material. State lawmakers and Pritzker also vowed to oppose Donald Trump’s executive order last year that aimed to prevent states from creating their own regulations on AI. The state has also enacted more stringent biometric privacy laws than the rest of the US.\n\nSeveral other states, including Georgia and Oklahoma, have proposed moratoriums on building new datacenters until more assessments can be done on potential regulation. The bill proposed in Georgia would stop new datacenters until March of next year, a significant pause in an industry dominated by a desire for rapid advancement and unfettered growth.",

    "fullText": "Meta chief says it has improved identifying underage users but adds ‘I always wish we could have gotten there sooner’\n\nThe Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, testified at a landmark trial of social media companies on Wednesday. Plaintiffs’ lawyers grilled Zuckerberg about internal complaints that not enough was being done to verify whether children under 13 were using the platform.\n\nZuckerberg claimed Meta had improved in identifying underage users but also said: “I always wish that we could have gotten there sooner.”\n\nZuckerberg also said some users lie about their age when joining Instagram and that the company removes those it identifies as underage. The plaintiffs’ lawyers hit back at those claims: “You expect a nine-year-old to read all of the fine print? That’s your basis for swearing under oath that children under 13 are not allowed?” After repeated questioning about age verification, Zuckerberg said: “I don’t see why this is so complicated.”\n\nIn response to questioning by the plaintiffs’ attorney, Zuckerberg also said: “I think a reasonable company should try to help the people that use its services.”\n\nAsked about media training and his famously stiff responses to public questioning: he said: “I think I’m actually well-known to be sort of bad at this.”\n\nThe Meta chief was flanked by people wearing the Meta Ray-Ban artificial intelligence glasses, and the judge in the courtroom threatened to hold anyone recording with the devices in contempt.\n\nWhen he arrived at court, Zuckerberg was asked by a security guard at a metal detector if he had any metal on him. “I have a gold chain on,” he responded, according to the New York Post.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs, who argue that Meta intentionally designed its social media platforms to be addictive, questioned Zuckerberg about whether he knew of harms his company’s products could inflict on young people’s mental health. The plaintiffs have already made public internal documents they say prove their point.\n\nThis is the first time Zuckerberg has addressed concerns about child safety before a jury at trial. Tech companies have long relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for content posted by users, but the plaintiffs’ novel argument – which is focused on harmful design and not individual actors – has so far sidestepped this defense.\n\nThe initial trial in Los Angeles focuses on a 20-year-old woman, known as KGM, who says her compulsive use of YouTube and Instagram worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts. KGM’s case is one of about 20 “bellwether” cases – designed to be test cases to gauge a jury’s reaction. TikTok and Snap settled in the initial trial but will still be defendants in hundreds of other cases.\n\nZuckerberg’s testimony comes about a week after Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri spoke on the witness stand. Mosseri pushed back on the science behind social media addiction by denying users could be “clinically addicted”. He described children’s high usage of Instagram as “problematic use” – similar to “watching TV for longer than you feel good about”. Psychologists do not classify social media addiction as an official diagnosis, but many researchers have documented the harmful consequences of compulsive use among young people, and lawmakers around the world are worried about its addictive potential.\n\nPaul Schmidt, one of Meta’s attorneys, previously said in his opening statement that the company acknowledged KGM’s mental health issues but disputed that Instagram played a significant role in exacerbating them. He cited medical records to suggest the primary issue was a difficult home life.\n\nTwo years ago, Zuckerberg fielded similar questions in a heated congressional hearing about child exploitation. In January 2024, Zuckerberg turned directly towards grieving parents on the Senate floor to apologize, promising to continue investments to protect children. Those families were not convinced that Meta would make meaningful progress, and still aren’t; they are hoping the courts can provide more relief. These trials could eventually result in large payouts from tech companies and changes in the way social media platforms are designed.\n\n“His apology – if you will call it that – was mostly empty,” said John DeMay, who was present in the Senate hearing room in 2024. DeMay’s son, Jordan, was 17 when he died by suicide in 2022, hours after being targeted in an online sextortion scam on Instagram. “He basically said they’re doing everything they can to stop and prevent this stuff from happening and unfortunately that’s just not the case.”\n\nIn the two years since, DeMay has visited Capitol Hill frequently to advocate for online child safety – but has been frustrated by the lack of progress. DeMay’s lawsuit is one of the many cases that will be considered as part of a judicial council coordination proceeding. He has more faith in the courts than Congress, and has previously attended hearings in the current trial, although he was following Wednesday’s proceedings from his home in Michigan.\n\n“I’m hopeful that this case prevails but if it doesn’t, we still won because we showed the world – with on the record evidence – that they’re doing one thing and saying another,” DeMay said.\n\nMeta is also involved in separate litigation in New Mexico, where prosecutors accuse the company of violating the state’s consumer protection laws; Meta failed to disclose what it knew about how its social media platforms could harm children, they say. Meta has denied those claims.\n\nInstagram has, in recent years, added some safety features aimed at its young users. But a 2025 review of these tools by Fairplay – a non-profit that advocates for reducing the influence of big tech on children – found “that less than one in five are fully functional and two-thirds (64%) are either substantially ineffective or no longer exist”.\n\nSome former Meta employees have said that the company has been dismissive of warnings around child safety. Kelly Stonelake left Meta on medical leave, in February 2023, after she faced harassment and retaliation for raising such concerns, she says. Stonelake sued Meta last year over the issue, and also alleged a toxic pattern of silencing women.\n\nShe alleges Meta was collecting data on kids without parental consent and exposing them to other adults and “an environment that we knew was riddled with harassment and bullying”.",

    "fullText": "French president rejects US criticism as António Guterres and Narendra Modi warn on child safety and AI monopolies\n\nEmmanuel Macron has hit back at US criticism of Europe’s efforts to regulate AI, vowing to protect children from “digital abuse” during France’s presidency of the G7.\n\nSpeaking at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, the French president called for tougher safeguards after global outrage over Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot being used to generate tens of thousands of sexualised images of children, and amid mounting concern about the concentration of AI power in a handful of companies.\n\nHis remarks were echoed by António Guterres, the UN secretary general, who told delegates – including several US tech billionaires – that “no child should be a test subject for unregulated AI”.\n\n“The future of AI cannot be decided by a few countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires,” Guterres said. “AI must belong to everyone”.\n\nBill Gates had been scheduled to speak but withdrew at the last minute amid renewed scrutiny of his past links to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMeanwhile, an attempt by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to stage a show of unity among leading tech billionaires went awry when the rival heads of OpenAI and Anthropic awkwardly declined to hold hands on stage.\n\nModi stood at the centre of a line of 13 tech executives, including leaders from Google, Meta and Microsoft, who all raised clasped hands – apart from Sam Altman and Dario Amodei. Amodei split from OpenAI in 2021 over differences over how to manage safety risks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House’s senior AI adviser, Sriram Krishnan, renewed the Trump administration’s criticism of AI regulation, singling out the EU’s AI Act. He told delegates he would continue to “rant” against legislation that was not “conducive to an entrepreneur who wants to build innovative technology”.\n\nBut Macron told the intergovernmental summit: “Opposite to what some misinformed friends have been saying, Europe is not blindly focused on regulation. Europe is a space for innovation and investment, but it is a safe space, and safe spaces win in the long run.”\n\nResearch published this month by Unicef and Interpol across 11 countries found at least 1.2 million children reported having their images manipulated into sexually explicit deepfakes in the past year. In some countries, one in 25 children – the equivalent of one child in every classroom – had been affected.\n\n“There is no reason our children should be exposed online to what is legally forbidden in the real world,” Macron said. “Our platforms, governments and regulators should be working together to make the internet and social media a safe space. This is why, in France, we are embarking on a process to ban social networks for children under 15 years old.”\n\nAmong the tech executives attending was Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which is facing a legal challenge from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who took his own life after discussing suicide with ChatGPT.\n\nAltman told delegates the rapid pace of AI development meant “by the end of 2028, more of the world’s intellectual capacity could reside inside of datacentres than outside of them”. He also stressed the urgent need for “regulation or safeguards” and called for the creation of a body akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency to oversee the international coordination of AI.\n\nDario Amodei, the co-chief executive of Anthropic, said he was “concerned about the autonomous behaviour of AI models, their potential for misuse by individuals and governments and their potential for economic displacement”.\n\nModi said it was “imperative that AI is child safe and family-guided”, likening the emergence of AI to the discovery of fire and calling it a “profound transformation in human history”.\n\nIndia is seeking to position itself as the world’s third AI power behind the US and China, with Google this week announcing a $15bn investment in datacentres and subsea cables linking India to the US and other countries.\n\nModi said there must be “established levels of authenticity for content within the digital world … people must know what is authentic, and what has been generated by AI”.\n\nThe interventions come amid growing public concern about the societal risks of AI, as the most advanced models remain largely controlled by about four US companies and a handful of Chinese rivals.\n\nModi set out an alternative vision, leveraging India’s 1.4 billion population as a huge growth market for tech firms. He said: “We must prevent an AI monopoly. Many nations consider AI to be a strategic asset, and therefore it is developed confidentially and its availability is carefully managed.\n\n“However, our nation India holds a different perspective. We believe that technology, like a I will only truly benefit the world when it is shared and when open source code becomes available.”\n\nHis comments appeared to be directed at the US, where leading AI models are not open-source and cannot be used or adapted without permission. By contrast, China’s leading systems, such as DeepSeek and Qwen, are broadly open-source.",

    "fullText": "Forty people in Australia have been diagnosed with a rare sight-threatening condition connected to tattoos that can lead to permanent blindness, representing a significant surge in cases of the little-known ailment, PEOPLE reports.\n\nThe condition, called tattoo-associated uveitis, results from a presumed immune reaction to tattoo ink. The 40 cases identified in Australia represent double the number of cases recorded globally in 2010, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nNelize Pretorius experienced the alarming symptoms firsthand when her vision became blurry, first in one eye and then the other. She initially suspected conjunctivitis, but tests were negative as her sight worsened.\n\n“I could hardly see. I was losing my vision and nobody was able to tell me why,” Pretorius told ABC.\n\nAfter eventually being diagnosed with tattoo-associated uveitis, Pretorius learned about risks she never considered when getting inked.\n\n“You get a tattoo, and you think the risk is that you might regret it later in life,” she told ABC. “[The real risk is] you could potentially lose your vision.”\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, uveitis is a form of eye inflammation with symptoms that can include pain, blurred vision, light sensitivity, and permanent vision loss.\n\nResearch published in the Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology journal pointed to black ink as the cause of most inflammation, with one case each linked to pink and red ink.\n\nOphthalmologist Josephine Richards, who treated Pretorius, said the cause is not fully understood.\n\n“We do not know why the eye gets caught in the crossfire,” Richards told ABC. “There is something about the immune reaction that targets the eye.”\n\nPretorius received expensive treatment and continues to manage the condition with steroid eye drops. Other patients have required immunosuppression to treat their vision, according to ABC.\n\nPretorius credited her diagnosis to being in the right place at the right time.\n\n“My case in particular was one of the first cases that Dr. Richards had in Perth,” she said. “It’s just lucky that she knew about it because if she wasn’t there on that day, I may still not know what the issue is.”\n\nDespite her ordeal, Pretorius acknowledged her outcome was fortunate.\n\n“There’s a few people [with tattoo-associated uveitis] that lost their vision permanently, so relatively speaking I came off pretty good,” she said.",

    "description": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was stunned when CBS reporter Ed O'Keefe asked for examples of President Trump being \"falsely called racist\"",
    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was visibly stunned after CBS’s Ed O’Keefe asked for examples of President Donald Trump being “falsely called racist” in recent years.\n\n“You’re kidding, right?” replied Leavitt during a White House press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nShe was responding to O’Keefe’s question, which quoted Trump’s tribute to Jesse Jackson a day earlier.\n\nIn his statement about Jesse Jackson, the president said “Despite the fact that I am falsely inconsistently called a racist by the scoundrels and lunatics on the radical left, Democrats all, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.” Where or when does the president believe he has been falsely called racist?\n\nThat spurred Leavitt’s shocked response and led to a few audible chuckles in the briefing room.\n\n“I will pull you plethora of examples. I’m going to get my team in that room to start going through the internet of radical Democrats throughout the years who have accused this president falsely of being a racist,” Leavitt said.\n\nShe continued, “And I’m sure there’s many people in this room and on network television across the country who have accused him of the same. In fact, I know that because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”\n\nLeavitt added that Trump was looking forward to a Black History Month event scheduled for later in the day.\n\n“There is a lot this president has done for all Americans, regardless of race,” she said. “And he has absolutely been falsely called and smeared as a racist, and I’m happy to provide you those receipts.”\n\nTrump’s racial attitudes have long been called out by high-profile media personalities. Ex-CNN star Don Lemon branded Trump a “racist” in 2018, and called him a “racist piece of sh*t” last year. Another CNN alum, Jim Acosta, said in 2018 “this president deep down may just be a racist.” MS NOW anchor Lawrence O’Donnell dubbed Trump the “most racist” president who never owned slaves in 2024, and his colleague, Chris Hayes, called Trump “to his bones a racist” after he posted a video depicting ex-President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes earlier this month.\n\nOther examples include NBC White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor accusing Trump of using a “racist term” when he called COVID-19 the “kung-flu,” CBS reporter Weijia Jiang similarly said Trump used “racist phrases” during the pandemic, and Geraldo Rivera — a former longtime friend of the president’s — referring to Trump’s crackdown on migrants as “racist government policy.”\n\nAnd soon after the press briefing wrapped up, one of the White House’s X accounts posted an example of O’Keefe himself calling out Trump for “racist tweets” in 2019:\n\nThis reporter literally called President Trump's tweets racist in 2019. https://t.co/HlgnNg9DZA pic.twitter.com/Crjf26Qttj\n\n— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) February 18, 2026\n\nThe post ‘You’re Kidding, Right?’ Karoline Leavitt Gobsmacked After Reporter Asks for Examples of Trump Being ‘Falsely Called Racist’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

She offered to drive Morales home. Morales moved over to the center seat and released the brake, the affidavit states.\n\nThe truck began rolling backwards. Paniagua became trapped by the front left tire, which rolled over her midsection, the affidavit states.\n\nAt the scene of the crash, an officer told Morales that she had been involved in a crash. Morales replied, \"Yo, se, yo estaba manejando patras pero nunca la mire,\" meaning in English, \"I know, I was driving backwards but I never saw her,\" the affidavit states.\n\nAn officer wrote in the affidavit that Morales had \"red glossy eyes, but noted that the defendant (Morales) had been crying as she was speaking\" to the officer.\n\nMorales was taken to a police station and placed in a holding cell. She was questioned by officers. Morales recalled being at the liquor store and was reversing when she heard banging on her truck's left window, the affidavit states. She told Paniagua that the window didn't work and to open the door.\n\nAn officer asked if Morales had been driving. Morales replied that she was not driving and that it was her friend who was driving, but \"did not want to get her in any trouble,\" the affidavit states.\n\nMorales first claimed she got out of the vehicle from the driver's side, but later claimed she got out of the truck \"from the side of the person steering,\" the affidavit states. The officer interviewing her allegedly smelled alcohol coming from Morales.\n\nOfficers conducted a field sobriety test on Morales, which she failed. She was arrested on suspicion of intoxicated manslaughter with a vehicle.\n\nMorales remains jailed on a $250,000 bond at the El Paso County Jail. A bond hearing is scheduled for Thursday, Feb. 19, court records show.\n\nAaron Martinez covers the criminal justice system for the El Paso Times.

The snake was more than three feet long and wrapped around her leg as she walked barefoot.\n\nSnake Catcher Geelong, a licensed snake controller in the area, posted the video on their Facebook page.\n\nThe snake expert identified the snake as a male copperhead and confirmed that while it wrapped around her leg, it did not bite her.\n\n\"When I caught up with her, she was shaky,\" Snake Catcher Geelong wrote. \"It will take her a while to get over this experience.\"\n\nFortunately, the woman was not hurt in the snake incident. However, she was lucky because Australian copperhead snakes are venomous and can cause fatal bites.\n\nOthers have captured videos of terrifying interactions between snakes and people around boat ramps and in other public spaces.\n\nAlthough the woman in this video from Australia did not provoke the snake to attack, human activity can affect snake behavior.

    "fullText": "David Chong quit his $192,000-a-year Microsoft job last year to build an AI startup.\n\nWeeks later, most of his belongings were stolen during his move from New York City to Toronto.\n\nHe shared how he's trying to bounce back — and why he doesn't regret going all in on entrepreneurship.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chong, a 38-year-old startup founder in Toronto. He previously worked as a senior software engineer at Microsoft until resigning last September. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI resigned from Microsoft in September 2025. Less than a month later, I lost almost everything I owned.\n\nDuring my move from New York City to my hometown of Toronto, the trailer transporting my belongings was stolen in the middle of the night. The trailer was eventually recovered, but none of my belongings were.\n\nWhile resigning from Microsoft set me down this unfortunate path, I believe leaving Big Tech was the right move for me. I've had to learn what the Zen monks preach about letting go of your earthly possessions to reach enlightenment.\n\nIn 2016, I moved from Canada to New York City on a work visa. Before joining Microsoft, I worked at a smaller tech company for nearly seven years, starting as a junior employee and working my way up to a leadership role as a lead product engineer.\n\nWhen I joined Microsoft as a senior software engineer in 2022, it felt like a bit of a backtrack in terms of title. I thought it would be easy to get promoted back to a higher level, but it definitely wasn't; I held the same position for nearly three years.\n\nAt my previous employer, it felt like your work spoke for itself, but at Microsoft, it felt like I would have to develop a \"getting promoted\" skill — doing a lot of internal self-promotion to make sure my work got noticed outside my immediate team — to actually move up.\n\nFrom what I heard, the need to actively self-promote in order to move up is a broader trend across Big Tech. It seemed pretty non-transferable outside the Big Tech world, so I wasn't very interested in developing it.\n\nBusiness Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.\n\nShare your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29.\n\nIn my last few years at Microsoft, the company went through multiple restructurings that moved me to different teams. In the most recent round, some of our managers were laid off.\n\nThe layoffs didn't make me too concerned about my job security, in part because my department seemed starved for engineering talent. However, I was growing frustrated with the slow promotion timeline.\n\nThere also seemed to be rising expectations at the company around productivity and working from the office. The message from leadership seemed to be that we needed to ramp up and adjust because times were changing.\n\nThe other thing that made me start considering leaving was that I wasn't learning as much as I wanted to, partially because I had become the most senior person on my team.\n\nIn early 2025, I started thinking seriously about leaving Microsoft and figuring out my next career move. It was a very difficult decision. I was working on a TN visa, which was tied specifically to Microsoft, and resigning would likely mean moving back to Toronto and committing to a future outside the US, unless I could find another company willing to sponsor me. I'd come to the US thinking about living here long-term. Microsoft had already started the green card process for me, and quitting would mean giving that up as well.\n\nAround last April, a friend opened my eyes to the possibility of entrepreneurship. I became more interested in that path and started doing a lot of research on how to build a business. I decided that if I left Microsoft, I would pursue entrepreneurship.\n\nIn September, I resigned from Microsoft. I wasn't too worried about giving up my $192,000 a year salary because I consider myself very risk-tolerant. I've saved up enough of a buffer to go without income for several years, and I don't have any dependents.\n\nLosing my belongings during the move definitely hurt my productivity, forcing me to delay my startup plans by a few months.\n\nOf everything I owned, all I had left was what I packed for the flight in my backpack and carry-on bag. I landed in Toronto without winter clothes or a bed — I had to sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag.\n\nI focused on resolving the move issues: trying to figure out what happened, contacting the police, and dealing with the insurance claim. I'd unfortunately gotten the lowest insurance rate for my move, so the insurance payout was less than even what I paid for the moving service.\n\nAnd of course, there was the financial impact of replacing everything. So far, I've spent around $12,000 on essentials like a couch, bed, air fryer, Instant Pot, and clothing. Since everything was stolen, I'm starting from scratch in more ways than one.\n\nHowever, I've made progress with my AI sales agent business, Falco, in recent months. It's still in development and isn't ready for customers yet, but it has launched publicly.\n\nWhen it comes to building a startup, I don't think the idea necessarily matters as much as the execution. I'm hopeful that if I just go all in, move fast, and constantly test my ideas, I should be OK. My plan is to give myself about three years to pursue entrepreneurship. If all else fails, I'll go back into the job market.\n\nMy advice is to try to put yourself in your own shoes five to 10 years from now. When I do that, I look back at the decision I'm facing and ask myself, \"Would I regret not doing this?\"\n\nIf the answer is yes, I try to do the thing I'd regret not doing. I've often heard that older people regret the chances they didn't take more than the ones they did.\n\nIn hindsight, I think this mindset is what helped me decide to move to New York and join Microsoft — two decisions that had their pros and cons, but that I don't regret. My first job in New York helped me build the experience that landed me at Microsoft, and Microsoft gave me the opportunity to grow my skills and meet some very interesting people.\n\nFor me, leaving Microsoft to start a business is a decision I don't think my future self will regret, even if I fail, so I'm going all in on entrepreneurship.",

    "title": "What Dennis Gates said after Missouri basketball’s narrow escape vs Vandy",
    "description": "Here's what Missouri basketball coach Dennis Gates said after the Tigers hung on to beat Vanderbilt, including his thoughts on the final play.",
    "fullText": "Mark Mitchell’s inbounds play with a second left on the clock put the same thought in his head coach’s head as, we have to imagine, the 10,234 fans who had filed into Mizzou Arena.\n\nThe pass was woefully short of its target, and it landed in perhaps the worst place possible: The hands of Vanderbilt guard Tyler Tanner, who couldn’t miss in the second half as the Commodores had tracked Mizzou down from 21 points to, in that nearly fateful moment, a half-court heave to possibly win the game.\n\nTanner got the ball under control and up into the air in time. It was right on line.\n\nGates’ self-admitted first reaction: “Oh, s**t,” he told reporters after the game.\n\nMizzou escaped. Barely. Tanner’s heave made about as much of contact with the inside of the rim as is possible without the ball falling through the net, and the Tigers avoided what could have been one of the most remarkable meltdowns in program history, beating No. 18/19-ranked Vanderbilt 81-80 on Wednesday night in Columbia.\n\nStress levels and general well-being aside, it’s a massive win for Missouri.\n\nMizzou needs a strong finish to the season to make the March Madness field. A win over top-20 Vanderbilt — since there are no pictures of the résumé — helps the Tigers a remarkable amount.\n\nIt got across the line Wednesday, as much as it tried to cough one up.\n\nHere’s what Gates said to reporters after Mizzou's win over Vandy:\n\nA majority of the questions the two players, Jayden Stone and Trent Pierce, who joined Gates in his pregame press conference were about the final minutes of the near-collapse.\n\nGates had criticisms. We’ll get to those. But he had a reminder for the room and the cameras.\n\n“This is a great win. This is not a loss,” Gates said. “This is a win. This is a win. Let me remind everybody in here, this is a win. So, let's project our questions like we won.”\n\nHe’s right. A double-digit win, which is what the game was trending toward for most of the night, would have helped Mizzou in the advanced analytics and NET rankings more, but the Tigers bolstered their résumé nonetheless.\n\nIf Mizzou needed to finish the regular season with three or four more wins before Selection Sunday, then it has one.\n\n“We did not break, and that's the most important part,” Gates said. ... \"Yes, we were up 20. Who in here did not watch the Oklahoma-Vanderbilt game (when Vandy also nearly came back from down 21 points). We knew they would make a run, and our guys, they may have bent a little bit, but we did not break.\n\n“That's a sign of a great team, being able to come back, being able to make shots. Ultimately, we got to get to the foul line in that situation, not have empty possessions. Our guys had resilience, so I'm proud of them. This is a win.”\n\n“First, I said, ‘oh, s**t,’ because Mark threw the ball short, right?” Gates said. “You don't want to use all your timeouts, but that's not the pass we want. And Mark Mitchell's parents, his dad even said, ‘Son, I got to teach you how to throw.’ That pass — Mark knew. Mark’s (thrown) some long, long passes before.”\n\nAnd that speaks to a larger issue in Mizzou’s performance. The Tigers were the better team for 30 minutes, which was the full stretch between the opening two minutes of the game and the final eight minutes. The difference between the good and the bad, almost without fail, was how Missouri looked after the ball.\n\nVanderbilt ran a high press that Mark Byington described as a “Hail Mary” move, with the Commodores facing a 21-point deficit.\n\nBut the Commodores also started to simply make shots. They closed 13-of-18 (72.2%) from the field in the final 8:19, after Mizzou opened up its largest lead of the game.\n\n“Not happy about the turnovers late in the game. Had to save some time outs, but I thought we successfully broke the press,” Gates said. “You can't give up six points with two field goals, meaning 3s or and-1s. You’ve got to force teams late in games to have 2-point field goals, and we didn't do a good job of that, and we’ve got to do a better job of protecting the 3-point line and giving up and-1s, but more importantly, taking care of the basketball.”\n\nMizzou desperately needs center depth. Shawn Phillips Jr. has, for the most part, been solid as the Tigers’ primary center, but he was foul prone against Vanderbilt — a common theme in the big man’s game in SEC play.\n\nWhile Phillips sat, the Tigers turned to 7-foot-5 center Trent Burns, whose high billing hasn’t quite materialized in his first season on the floor.\n\nOn Wednesday, he gave Missouri his best minutes. He had a team-high +19 plus/minus over a career-high 18 minutes, and he hauled in seven rebounds and registered a block.\n\n“Our player of the game was Trent Burns,” Gates said. “I thought he did a tremendous job in practice, and what he did in practice showed up in the game. And whatever that was, it was more so toward me, because I told him, ‘I'm not going to play you ever again if you don't earn it in practice.’ It is what it is.\n\n“We need somebody to step up, especially at that five spot. And tonight, it was Trent Burns, and his teammates did a great job of pushing him through and demanding of him as well, and that was the response that we needed.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Columbia Daily Tribune: Mizzou basketball coach Dennis Gates on narrow win, escape vs Vanderbilt",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Pirates are teeming with young, talented pitching. From Paul Skenes and Bubba Chandler to Braxton Ashcraft and Jared Jones, the Pirates are loaded with dynamic arms.\n\nPittsburgh ranked seventh in ERA last year, and it’s easy to see why. The team has more pitching than it knows what to do with.\n\nDan Plesac, a three-time All-Star who pitched two seasons for the Pirates in the mid-1990s, is particularly impressed by Pittsburgh’s starting rotation. He likes it so much that he recently compared it to a famous National League dynasty on MLB Network.\n\n“It’s a very good rotation,” Plesac said on Tuesday’s episode of MLB Tonight. “It reminds me a little bit going back, and this might be a little bit of an overstatement, of some of those young pitching staffs of the Atlanta Braves before we knew who they were.”\n\n\"If I'm a Pirates fan, this is the most enthusiastic I've felt going into a season in about four or five years.\"\n\n– @Plesac19 on #MLBTonight https://t.co/BEEXZ98zzg pic.twitter.com/mAe7uQbJKy\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 18, 2026\n\nPlesac is referring to the legendary Braves of the early 1990s with Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Steve Avery.\n\nThat might be a bit of a reach, but Skenes is certainly on that level and Chandler has the potential to be.\n\nThose iconic Atlanta teams ruled the 1990s and won a World Series, so that’s an exciting comparison for the Pirates, who haven’t won a playoff game since 2013 or a championship since 1979.\n\nHowever, that could be about to change. Not only does Pittsburgh have excellent pitching, but it also dramatically improved its lineup over the offseason.\n\n“It’s a team that’s built around their starting pitching, make no bones about it,” Plesac added. “If I’m a Pirates fan, this is the most enthusiastic I’ve felt going into a season in about four or five years.”\n\nMore Pirates: Former All-Star Pitcher Reveals What He Loves About Pirates’ Bubba Chandler\n\nThe post MLB Analyst Compares Pirates’ Loaded Pitching Staff To Recent Dynasty appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "Current Chelsea player Axel Disasi, who is out on loan with West Ham United, has referred to his time at The Blues as ‘a little bit crazy’.\n\nDisasi says that his overall life experience basically managed to see him through some struggles at Chelsea, although his story, or nightmare there, is not over yet.\n\nThe defender is only on loan with The Hammers and there is no guarantee yet that they will sign him on a permanent deal come the end of the season. I guess it will all depend on how well he performs there until the summer. But there is chance that his nightmare at Chelsea continues if they decide they do not want to buy him on a permanent deal.\n\nDisasi was cast aside by Chelsea and thrown into their brutal ‘bomb squad’ situation where they basically freeze players out and away from the first team until they leave. Disasi has basically just been in a different parallel universe at Chelsea for the last two seasons.\n\nAxel Disasi signs on loan for West Ham.\n\nIn words cited on X this week, Disasi says:\n\n“My situation before was a little bit crazy. For me it is only a positive to be here, it feels great to be part of something.\n\n“In Chelsea the time was a little bit crazy but my background helped me to get through.”\n\nYan Diomande is tearing up the Bundesliga, and Chelsea are among the teams being linked with him.

    "title": "On This Day (19th Feb 2024): Sunderland Sack Michael Beale!",
    "description": "After a torrid two-month spell on Wearside, Beale was relieved of his duties on this day two years ago.",
    "fullText": "Michael Beale’s as Sunderland AFC head coach was — and still is — a period that many fans don’t reflect fondly upon.\n\nBeale had the difficult task of replacing Tony Mowbray as the main man at the club after Mowbray’s slightly surprising dismissal as head coach.\n\nMowbray was loved by most fans for his warm and kind nature, coupled with the attractive style of football that the Lads played under his stewardship. Unfortunately for all involved, it seemed that differing opinions on the club’s strategy and recruitment plan saw things go a little awry as Mowbray was keen for an experienced centre forward to help ease the pressure that rested on Jack Clarke’s shoulders during the 2023/2024 season.\n\nMowbray’s dismissal brought an opportunity for many head coaches who appeared to be interested in the job — chiefly Will Still, who appeared to be the club’s number one candidate. As it was, it seemed that Still had a hefty price tag placed on him by Reims, who wanted to do everything to keep a coach who was the one of the hottest properties in the game.\n\nThis led to Kristjaan Speakman looking at alternatives and one name that became increasingly prominent was that of Beale, who’d only recently departed his role as manager of Glasgow Rangers. However, as talk of Beale becoming our head coach became more and more prominent, the backlash from the fans grew stronger.\n\nRightly or wrongly, Beale’s mannerisms and confident demeanour coupled with his failed spell as Rangers manager left many people disappointed with his potential appointment after the enjoyable reign of Mowbray, during which the connection between the fans and the team had improved drastically.\n\nBeale was appointed on December 18, just days before our clash with Coventry City at the Stadium of Light, and his first game was nothing short of a nightmare, as amid the heaviest of rainfall, his hopes and aspirations came crashing down, putting him on the back foot and in survival mode as the fans made their feelings clear.\n\nA win against Hull City offered him some breathing space before a heavy FA Cup defeat against Newcastle United in early January marked the beginning of the end as the team showed little ambition to even try and beat their arch-rivals at the Stadium of Light.\n\nDespite still lingering just outside the playoffs, the style of play had changed completely, with a conservative approach coupled with a complete reliance on Clarke becoming very apparent and also a stick to beat him with.\n\nAdditionally, the support for Beale within the boardroom began to flounder as he openly criticised the fact that the team had no centre forward within their ranks — which was similar to the issues that Mowbray also encountered with the club after Ross Stewart was sold.\n\nAfter poor away defeats to Ipswich and Huddersfield, a loss to Birmingham City — now managed by Mowbray — was the final straw for the club. After Clarke had given Sunderland the lead, the team slipped up and conceded two goals to lose in what was becoming a trend of losing tight games against supposed weaker opposition.\n\nWhat’s more, the defeat wasn’t the worst thing to happen at St Andrew’s as videos began to circulate online during which it seemed fairly clear that Beale had ignored Trai Hume’s attempted handshake as he was taken off.\n\nOne particular account on Twitter — named ‘Player ID’ — was particularly vocal in their defence of Beale, retweeting posts suggesting fans of Sunderland are ‘entitled’ and also showing different views of his interaction (or lack thereof) with Hume. Allegedly, this was a ‘burner’ account of Beale’s that was being used to sing his own praises and express some critical views of Sunderland.\n\nWith all of this going on amid some terrible performances, Beale’s position at Sunderland became untenable and it was no surprise that he was sacked on this day two years ago, with Speakman breaking the news on the club website.\n\nWe are disappointed that Michael is leaving Sunderland AFC.\n\nOur desire is to improve and unfortunately that hasn’t been evident, as such we take full accountability and feel that acting decisively is in the best interests of the club.\n\nThis has been a difficult few months for Michael, who leaves with our best wishes for the future.",

    "title": "Sunderland’s Greatest Homegrown Forwards: The Pre-War Icons",
    "description": "Gurney, Gallacher and Carter are some of the iconic names to feature in part two of this historical series!",
    "fullText": "Following the same criteria as our examination of Sunderland’s homegrown post-war footballers, part two applies the same rules to discover whether we’ve produced any players who scored more than Gary Rowell’s 103 goals for the club.\n\nJust as this meant ruling out anyone the club purchased such as Kevin Phillips, Marco Gabbiadini, Brian Clough and Len Shackleton, there are some big-name pre-war players to be excluded, such as Charlie Buchan (signed from Arsenal), Dave Halliday (signed from Dundee) and Arthur Bridgett (signed from Stoke).\n\nSo, who does that leave to consider from a period when Sunderland won six league titles, an FA Cup, and were considered one of the top clubs in the country?\n\nCarter would be one player who you would put your house on to have come through the ranks at Sunderland and scored a number of goals in excess of Rowell’s total.\n\nWidely heralded as one of Sunderland’s greatest players, Carter was born in Hendon, became a league winner and FA Cup-winning captain, and also played for Sunderland and England schoolboys.\n\nHowever, he didn’t sign for Sunderland straight from school when he left at fourteen years of age. In fact, he actually knocked them back on the advice of his guardian (his uncle, following the death of his father) because he wanted the young Carter to learn a trade.\n\nThus, he became an apprentice electrician while playing for an amateur side. He signed amateur forms for Sunderland in 1931, aged seventeen, while also having a trial for Leicester City who turned him down.  Eventually, he was taken on as a professional for Sunderland.\n\nCan this rule Carter out? It almost feels like sacrilege to do so, so I’ll leave it for others to debate.\n\nAnother of our pre-war legends and club record scorer.\n\nA teammate of Carter, Silksworth-born Gurney was a goalscoring powerhouse of the 1930s. Like Carter, he won the Championship and FA Cup, and was honoured with a mural on the side of a building.\n\nOur record scorer played for his hometown club, living the “Roy of the Rovers” dream forty years before Rowell even made his debut — yet Gurney also didn’t sign for Sunderland straight from school.\n\nHe was spotted playing for Bishop Auckland at seventeen years of age (apparently by Charlie Buchan), and there’s a heated discussion with a beer or five at the kitchen table to be had late into the night here.\n\nThese three fantastic players were recruited by Sunderland — then newly-elected to the Football League — around the age of twenty by then-manager Tom Watson.\n\nThey shouldn’t really qualify under the criteria as they weren’t produced by the club, but we didn’t produce anyone through a youth system at that point.\n\nCampbell arrived in 1889 and Millar came in 1890 — both from Scottish clubs — and Hannah came in 1891 from Sunderland Albion. Campbell and Millar were with Sunderland as a Football League club from the kick of the first ball in 1890, whilst Hannah came just one year later.\n\nThey scored just over 250 goals between them as Sunderland became champions in only their second season in the league. Campbell fired Sunderland to three league titles while Millar won four with the Lads over two spells.\n\nThere are three striking similarities between Holley and Rowell.\n\nThe first is obvious in that they each scored over 100 goals for the club. The second is not so in that they both happened to have been born in Seaham, but do you know the third?\n\nThey both scored a hat trick for Sunderland at St. James’ Park, with Holley hitting three in Sunderland’s record away win — a 9-1 victory at Newcastle on 5 December 1908.\n\nLike Carter and Gurney, Holley played local football with non-league clubs before being spotted by Sunderland’s scouts, signing in 1904 as an eighteen-year-old. He then went on to win the First Division title in 1913 as part of a team that came so close to winning the double.\n\nHe scored eleven hat tricks for Sunderland and hit eight goals in ten appearances for England. He was still in his prime at only twenty eight years old when the First World War brought his career at the top of the game to a halt — and he would’ve been a strong challenger to Gurney’s record total.\n\nScottish-born Gallacher played for Linwood St Coval and Bridge of Weir before moving to Sunderland as an eighteen-year-old in 1928.\n\nNew manager Johnny Cochrane brought the outside left into the Sunderland team alongside Carter and Gurney, as they slowly became a force in English football in the 1930s.\n\nPredominantly a winger, Gallacher would often change positions with Carter and he could also play on the right. He was a key member of the team that won the league title in 1936, the FA Cup in 1937 and also reached the semi-final in 1938 — a game that seems to have been forgotten over time.\n\nLater that year, he was transferred to Stoke City and just one year later, the Second World War effectively brought his career to an end.\n\nI apologise if I’ve missed out any glaring candidates, and I have to say this was very much a step into the unknown for myself in terms of what I would find, especially during the pre-war era.\n\nI also have to credit my fellow Roker Report writers Andy Tomlinson and Kelvin Beattie for helping to point me in the right direction. Andrew Smithson was also a huge help in fact-checking the player stats and the accuracy of the summary.\n\nI certainly expected at least a couple of the huge names from the pre-war era to have at least signed for the club on either amateur or professional terms upon leaving school, but in summary, it seems that prior to World War Two, there was a Sunderland schoolboy side, but this was run by teachers.\n\nSunderland Association Football Club would offer terms to any worthy players — either as amateurs or professionals, as they tried to do with Carter — and they certainly would develop young players in the A team.\n\nHowever, they did put a lot of faith in scouting local talent and as can be seen from some of the names above, this proved to be a pretty fruitful policy. Yet times were different and nowadays, promising schoolboy players are heavily courted by clubs from all areas of the country to sign with their academies from a very young age. Clubs just didn’t have the resources and means to undertake the present day policies in that era.\n\nPost-war, Sunderland had a junior side and completely bought into the benefits of the youth setup from the Alan Brown era onwards.\n\nFrom the 1960s through to the 1990s, there are several names in each decade that became mainstays in the first team. Goalscorers are less common and Gary Rowell remains the only player produced by Sunderland to have scored over one hundred goals for the club since the Second World War — an eighty-year period.\n\nOther than Rowell, only three other players to have scored over one hundred goals in their career have been produced by Sunderland: Dennis Tueart, John O’Hare and Colin West. If you can think of any others, by all means get in touch with us here at Roker Report.\n\nHowever, consider how many other players have achieved the same feat across football — that of scoring more than one hundred goals for the club that produced them. There are players out there that’ve done it, and many are big names.\n\nHarry Kane, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen, Matt Le Tissier, Jimmy Greaves (for Chelsea), George Best, Bobby Charlton, and Gary Lineker for Leicester City (who matched Gary Rowell’s record of 103 goals) spring to mind, and Clough also did it for Middlesborough.\n\nIf you consider the British-born record goalscorers in the Premier League who don’t qualify, such as Frank Lampard, Jermain Defoe, Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney, it puts it in a more enlightening context — and perhaps Gary Rowell was more unique than we all thought.",

    "fullText": "Phil Foden started for Manchester City in their 3-nil win over Fulham on Wednesday night. Foden grabbed an assist and his overall performance at the Etihad indicated that Foden may be over the tough spell of form he has recently endured. Foden still has a way to go to recapture his brilliant best. There is no doubt about that. But the signs from Manchester City’s routine win over Marco Silva’s side were overwhelmingly positive from Foden. That could be a massive positive for Pep Guardiola’s side as the pressure ramps up during the final stages of the 25/26 season.\n\nIt wasn’t a vintage Phil Foden performance by the England international against Fulham, but the signs were on display that Foden may be coming out the other side of his recent run of form. Foden had a period of sustained rest before the Premier League fixture against Marco Silva’s side. It looked to have paid dividends as Foden resembled the player who can dominate matches at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nPhil Foden grabbed an assist when he set up Erling Haaland’s goal in the 39th minute at the Etihad. Haaland’s goal was Manchester City’s third of the night and effectively ended the match as a contest. It was a clever little ball by Foden that found Haaland with space to do what Manchester City’s number nine does best. It wasn’t a magical Kevin De Bruyne-type of assist by any stretch, but it was exactly what Foden needed for his confidence.\n\nThroughout the first half, especially, against Fulham, Foden got into dangerous pockets of space. He had two good chances to score. A Foden volley was blocked by Joachim Andersen in the seventh minute. In the tenth minute, some neat footwork by Phil Foden created space for himself to shoot in the Fulham penalty area. Phil Foden’s right-footed shot lacked the power to beat Bernd Leno, but it was another small sign that Phil Foden’s touch was there.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Manchester City’s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Salford City, Pep Guardiola shared his belief that Foden will return to his best sooner rather than later. When asked about Foden, Pep Guardiola said: “I have zero, zero, zero doubts about Phil. He has to recover himself good and just focus on playing football, going to fish. He loves fishing, and that’s it. When he is that, Phil is back and will be back.”\n\n“It’s not 20 centuries ago when he was the best player in the Premier League, it was around the corner. It wasn’t many seasons ago. This is Phil Foden. Just be relaxed in his mind, the joy, the smile and happiness, and play, play, play.”\n\nManchester City need Phil Foden at his best. When he is at his best, he offers a threat that not many of his teammates can. Foden can score goals, create them, press City’s opponents, and link up Manchester City’s build-up play. There is a variety to Foden’s play that makes him a dangerous weapon when he is in pristine form. Guardiola’s comments about Foden switching off and enjoying life away from football also highlight how important balance can be for modern players and supporters alike. For many fans, that downtime still revolves around football in some form, watching matches, playing games, or picking up digital content and gift cards on Eneba before returning to their favourite titles. That same sense of freedom and variety is what makes Foden such a valuable option for City when he is playing with a clear mind.\n\nThe signs were there against Fulham that Phil Foden may have turned the corner with his form. Manchester City will be hoping that is the case. Foden is a bona fide match-winner on his day, and if he does get back to his best, anything is possible for Pep Guardiola’s new-look side this season.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Andrej Stojakovic scored 22 points to lead seven players in double figures and No. 10 Illinois routed Southern California 101-65 on Wednesday night for its 14th win in 16 games.\n\nBlue and orange-clad fans were out in force for the Fighting Illini’s first game against the Trojans in Los Angeles since 1975. The Illini (22-5, 13-3 Big Ten) didn’t disappoint, leading all the way to maintain a hold on second place in the conference standings behind No. 1 Michigan.\n\nThe Illini were up by 22 at halftime, and poured it on to start the second half. They outscored the Trojans 21-10, hitting five 3-pointers and extending the lead to 75-42. Stojakovic capped the spurt with a steal and one-handed slam that drew cheers.\n\nStojakovic was 6 of 7 from the floor and made all nine of his free throws. David Mirkovic added 14 points. The Illini hit 24 of 26 free throws while sending USC to its biggest loss of the season.\n\nIllinois made 13 3-pointers, and at one point in the second half was shooting equally as well from long range as from the floor overall (46%). Visiting fans took turns shouting “I-L-L” with the other side of the arena responding “I-N-I.”\n\nEzra Ausar scored 15 points and Jacob Cofie added 14 for USC (18-8, 7-8), which lost its second straight and fell to 0-4 against ranked teams. The Trojans were without second-leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara (18.3 points per game) because of a strained knee. They committed 14 turnovers that led to 22 points for the Illini.\n\nIllinois visits UCLA on Saturday.\n\nUSC remains in the Pacific time zone for its final five Big Ten games, starting Saturday when Oregon visits.",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Can Sunderland Versus Durham Be Classed As A ‘Rivalry’?",
    "description": "Ahead of the latest installment, Charlotte Patterson looks at the curious and complex nature of this local clash!",
    "fullText": "Having grown up in Durham yet supported Sunderland all my life has always meant that any fixture between the two clubs feels strangely personal.\n\nOnce, I wanted both to thrive but now the lines feel more blurred, the loyalties more defined and the question more intriguing than ever: is Sunderland versus Durham a ‘rivalry’, a ‘derby’, or something far more complicated?\n\nIt’s one of the most intriguing fixtures in the women’s game — not because it’s steeped in decades of animosity or because it carries the weight of a traditional derby but because it sits in a space that’s still forming. It’s a match shaped by geography, identity, ambition and personal experience; indeed, ask ten Sunderland fans what it means to them and you’ll get ten different answers.\n\nFor me, the fixture has always carried a strange emotional pull.\n\nI was born in Durham and have lived here my whole life, but I’ve supported Sunderland for as long as I can remember.\n\nThere was once a time when I genuinely wanted to see Durham succeed alongside Sunderland. It felt like something to be proud of, my home city producing a women’s team punching above its weight, competing fiercely without the backing of a men’s club and building a loyal fanbase from scratch. I admired and respected them. And I wanted them to do well — as long as they weren’t doing well at Sunderland’s expense.\n\nThe more invested I’ve become in Sunderland Women, the more I’ve felt that instinctive tug of competitiveness. These days, I don’t feel the same attachment to Durham. I still respect them deeply — especially for what they’ve built and how they’ve built it — but I always want Sunderland to beat them. I always want Sunderland to finish above them. And yes, I do enjoy it when Durham beat Newcastle.\n\nThat personal shift mirrors the wider debate among Sunderland supporters. Is this a derby? A rivalry? Is it friendly, tense, indifferent or something in between — and what shapes those feelings?\n\nThe first question is the simplest to ask and the hardest to answer. “Do Sunderland fans actually view Sunderland versus Durham as a derby?”\n\nFor some, the answer is an immediate “yes”.\n\nThe two clubs are close geographically, separated by a short drive and a shared stretch of the North East landscape. In football, proximity often defines rivalry and the fact that Sunderland and Durham have spent several seasons competing in the same division, often finishing near each other and often playing matches that mattered, means the fixture naturally takes on a derby-like feel. Competitive tension breeds familiarity, and familiarity breeds rivalry.\n\nYet for others, the answer is more complicated.\n\nSunderland’s traditional rivalries — particularly in the men’s game — are deeply entrenched, emotionally charged and historically loaded. Durham, in contrast, are a relatively young club in the women’s football pyramid. They don’t carry the weight of decades of animosity and they don’t evoke the same visceral reaction that fixtures against Newcastle or Middlesbrough might.\n\nFor some Sunderland fans, Durham simply don’t feel like rivals in the traditional sense. They’re local, but rivalry is about more than geography — and this is where the emotional nuance comes in.\n\nWhen Sunderland fans think about Durham Women as a club, their instinctive reactions vary widely. Some feel rivalry, driven by the desire to assert dominance in the region. Others feel respect, recognising the impressive work Durham have done to build a competitive team without the backing of a men’s club. Some feel indifference, seeing Durham as just another opponent. And some feel something more complicated, a blend of admiration, competitiveness and local pride.\n\nDurham’s identity plays a significant role in shaping these reactions.\n\nThey’re unique in the women’s game, a standalone club built from the ground up, operating without the financial or structural support that comes from being attached to a Premier League or Championship men’s side. Their success has been earned through graft, smart recruitment and a clear sense of who they are. For many Sunderland fans, that commands respect; after all, it’s hard not to admire a club that’s carved out its own place in the league, often outperforming teams with far greater resources.\n\nAt the same time, that uniqueness can make them feel like outsiders in a region where football identity is deeply intertwined with men’s clubs. Sunderland fans may respect Durham, but they don’t necessarily feel emotionally connected to them. The lack of shared history, shared colours or shared tribalism means the fixture doesn’t automatically carry the emotional weight of a derby.\n\nAnd yet, for some, that emotional weight is still there, originating not from history but from competition.\n\nSunderland and Durham have often found themselves in similar positions in the table, fighting for points, pride and progress. Those matches have mattered. They’ve been intense, physical and closely contested. Even without decades of rivalry behind them, the stakes have created their own sense of significance.\n\nThis leads naturally to another question: “Do Sunderland fans want to see Durham do well when they’re not playing Sunderland?”\n\nSome fans genuinely want Durham to succeed, seeing it as good for the region, good for the women’s game and good for raising the profile of football in the North East. They appreciate the idea of two strong local teams pushing each other, creating competitive tension that benefits both clubs. They see Durham as a positive force; a club that has earned its place and deserves recognition.\n\nOthers, however, feel differently.\n\nThey don’t necessarily want Durham to struggle but they don’t want them to thrive either — at least not to the point where they threaten Sunderland’s ambitions. For these fans, local proximity creates a sense of territorial instinct: “Sunderland should be the dominant force in the region”, “Sunderland should be the club setting the standard”, “Durham doing well is fine, as long as Sunderland are doing better”.\n\nAnd then there are those who simply don’t care. Their emotional investment begins and ends with Sunderland and what Durham do outside of the derby is irrelevant. Their success or failure has no bearing on their own sense of pride or frustration. They see Durham as a competitor and nothing more.\n\nThe emotional complexity deepens when you ask whether the fixture carries any weight for fans.\n\nSome supporters feel the fixture carries real emotional significance. The matches are often tight, physical and competitive, and that alone can give them a sense of importance. There’s also the local element of two North East clubs, close in distance and often close in the table, meeting in games that tend to matter. For those fans, Sunderland versus Durham has an edge to it, even if it isn’t steeped in decades of history.\n\nFor others, the fixture doesn’t stir the same emotions.\n\nIt matters because every league game matters, but it doesn’t carry the extra charge that comes with longstanding rivalries. The atmosphere might be lively and the football competitive, yet the emotional stakes feel no higher than usual. For these supporters, Sunderland versus Durham is shaped more by the ebb and flow of the season than by any deeper sense of identity or history.\n\nThat contrast reflects the broader reality of women’s football rivalries, which are still forming, still shifting and still finding their place.\n\nUnlike the men’s game, where the emotional landscape has been carved out over generations, the women’s game is building its own narratives in real time. Sunderland versus Durham sits right in the middle of that process — a fixture that means different things to different people, shaped as much by personal experience as by club identity or geography.\n\nFrom Sunderland’s perspective, the rivalry — if it can be called that — is shaped by ambition.\n\nSunderland want to grow, to improve and to become the team they know they can be. Durham, therefore, by virtue of being close, competitive and consistently present in the same division, naturally become a benchmark. Beating Durham matters because it signals progress and finishing above them matters because it reinforces ambition. The rivalry, such as it is, is rooted in aspiration rather than animosity.\n\nFrom Durham’s perspective, the dynamic is different.\n\nSunderland are the bigger club, with a larger fanbase, deeper history and a more established identity. For Durham, competing with Sunderland is a statement of their own growth and beating them is a marker of their own progress.\n\nThe rivalry, if they feel a sense of it, is shaped by the desire to prove themselves against a club with greater resources and greater expectations, and this creates a fascinating dynamic.\n\nThe fixture isn’t by fuelled by hatred or hostility and nor is it a ‘derby’ in the traditional sense, but it is competitive, meaningful and emotionally charged in its own way. It’s a rivalry built on proximity, ambition and identity rather than history — and that’s what makes it so interesting.\n\nIn the end, whether this represents a rivalry, a derby or simply a meeting of two ambitious North East clubs is something each supporter decides for themselves. Whatever we call it, the fixture keeps asking questions about identity, loyalty and what it really means to belong in a region where football is never just football.\n\nI’d love to hear about how other Sunderland supporters see this fixture.\n\nWhether you feel the pull of a derby, the edge of a rivalry or simply the curiosity of two North East clubs crossing paths, your perspective adds something real to the story. Tell me what Sunderland versus Durham means to you — the emotions, the indifference, the pride, the tension or anything in between — and let us build a picture of this fixture through the voices of the people who live it.",

    "description": "Sunderland eased past Oxford on Sunday, but how did Régis Le Bris use his squad in order to advance in the FA Cup?",
    "fullText": "Sunderland were back in FA Cup action at the weekend, taking a welcome break from the league as they returned to the Kassam Stadium for the first time since May to face an Oxford side who’ve struggled in the EFL this season.\n\nWith a chance to rest and rotate but the potential for a slip-up after losing there last season, how did Régis Le Bris manage the game and keep Oxford at arm’s length to ensure Sunderland were in the draw for the last sixteen?\n\nAfter suffering back-to-back defeats for the first time this season, changes were expected from Le Bris as his players put in two huge shifts against Arsenal and Liverpool — this providing a chance for some of the players who hadn’t featured much to get a full match under their belts.\n\nMaking six changes from Wednesday night’s game, he opted to retain the spine of his side whilst rewarding the remainder with a starting spot.\n\nOmar Alderete was absent from the squad following his knock on Wednesday, whilst Dan Ballard didn’t travel either. Luke O’Nien returned to the centre of defence to partner Nordi Mukiele, Trai Hume dropped back to his usual spot at right back and Dennis Cirkin came in for Reinildo, who also didn’t travel after playing 180 minutes in five days the week earlier.\n\nElsewhere, Lutsharel Geertruida came in for Noah Sadiki in order to anchor the midfield, whilst Habib Diarra and Enzo Le Fée retained their places from Wednesday. In the forward line, Brian Brobbey was rested in favour of Wilson Isidor, with Chemsdine Talbi and Romaine Mundle starting on the flanks having featured off the bench in midweek.\n\nWith Oxford United switching between a back four and five in recent weeks, Le Bris could’ve been tempted to match up their shape. However, favoured his traditional 4-3-3 system with one holding midfield pivot and two more advanced supporting central midfielders.\n\nDespite both wingers being deployed on both sides during their time at Sunderland, it was Mundle who was picked to play off the left whilst Talbi took up a spot on the right — where he started the season.\n\nMatt Bloomfield has had a rough time of things since taking over at the Kassam Stadium, with his side having not scored in their last four home games.\n\nFollowing a midweek humbling by Norwich City, Bloomfield opted to make some changes to allow for fresh legs and therefore saw eight changes from midweek. With wholesale changes across the front four and further changes in midfield, defence and in goal, Bloomfield opted for a back four and tried to match Sunderland up in their shape.\n\nWith a similarly aggressive style of play and a reliance on physical duels that’s worked so well for Sunderland this year, Bloomfield was looking to utilise the ‘dark arts’ in order to level the playing field a little. Therefore, facing a barrage of long throws and direct attacks, Sunderland needed to be up for the fight or Oxford could’ve made things ugly.\n\nWith Spurs loanee Will Lankashear capable of causing problems for central defenders due to his sheer size and physical profile, and a midfield pairing of Will Vaulks and Cameron Brannagan, Sunderland needed to be wary of the threat posed by the home side.\n\nThe opening ten minutes set the tone for the remainder of the game as neither team was really able to put a foot on the ball and construct consistent passages of build-up play from the off.\n\nAfter heavy rainfall prior to kick off, it was clear that an aerial-based affair was going to interrupt Sunderland’s usual rhythm, however, after riding out the initial storm, Sunderland were able to settle in.\n\nAssigned as the aggressors, Sunderland enjoyed the lion’s share of possession at 54%, but with less than three hundred passes completed throughout the whole game, tit raised a rather interesting point around how long was spent motionless on the ball or with it simply out of play.\n\nSunderland were clearly aware of the dangers posed by teams.\n\nWe counter-attacked when defending in a low block, therefore most of the passive possession actually occurred in either the Sunderland half or the middle third of the pitch. Utilising Geertruida as a pivot allowed Oxford’s press to essentially funnel play towards O’Nien — who simply reverted back to Roefs in order to go long or simply across to the spare man to start again.\n\nIn nullifying Oxford’s ability to make crowd-pleasing tackles and instead taking regular hits to win fouls and break up the play, Sunderland were able to limit the hosts to shots from distance and their first real opportunity of note didn’t arrive until Christ Makosso was able to direct a header past the post on the stroke of half time.\n\nJamie Donnolly was able to force a comfortable punch from Roefs early on, but with only five attempts in the first half — producing an xG rating of 0.34 — Sunderland recorded their most comfortable first half of the season from an away defensive standpoint.\n\nUnder Le Bris, Sunderland’s wingers have traditionally hugged the touchline in a bid to stretch the play and provide the advanced midfielders with space to push forward and form the triangles that were so pivotal to Sunderland’s success last season in the Championship.\n\nIn this game however, both Mundle and Talbi were tasked with underlapping into the half-spaces and rotating with Le Fée and Diarra respectively in order to create passing angles and free up the two midfielders by providing space out wide for them to receive the ball without pressure.\n\nAs each winger moved infield, they dragged their marker inside and forced double-teams from the Oxford press. The vacated space subsequently allowed both Diarra and Le Fée to ghost in and provided a creative solution, allowing them to dictate the game away from their usual positions due to midfield congestion and a tight defensive shape.\n\nWhilst initially done to help the central midfielders, in the second half it worked to the advantage of the wingers as Oxford were drawn to Le Fée out wide and instead created separation in the previously congested half-spaces for both Mundle and Talbi to attack on the half-turn.\n\nBoth wingers were able to spring into space at separate intervals before rifling shots off — Talbi in particular stinging the gloves of Ingram and without a great save, it would’ve nestled in the top corner.\n\nRomaine Mundle has divided opinions among the Sunderland fans in recent weeks, but there’s no mistaking the impact he had on the side during his first full season following the departure of Jack Clarke in the summer of 2024.\n\nMundle has suffered several serious setbacks during his time on Wearside and whilst the tools and talent were clearly there, injury was always going to have an effect on the winger.\n\nIt’s clear that Sunderland have been fair to Mundle in his recovery after rushing him back for the playoffs last season and ultimately sidelining him for longer than expected, with extended spells given to the winger whenever the club feel it’s been appropriate to do so.\n\nAs a confidence-based winger, Mundle gains a great deal from good performances and even if the calibre of the opposition was a little lower here, it was great to see him attacking the game.\n\nHe completed 12/15 dribbles (80%) — a staggering percentage to have attempted in a single game — whilst also winning 20/32 ground duels, showing that he was willing to get stuck in and really impress the travelling fans. Several mazy runs almost resulted in great goals, but the end product wasn’t quite there on the day.\n\nWith two new arrivals breathing down his neck, Mundle did a great job — both in his ability to show close control in isolated one-versus-one situations but also in his ability to buy fouls and slow the game down, winning the most fouls by any Sunderland player on the day.\n\nWhilst he hasn’t been able to directly impact games this season in the way of goals or assists, he’s only going to get back to his best with live match practice and his performance was another example of what he’s capable of when fully fit.\n\nA top performance from Romaine 🤩 pic.twitter.com/QrN8cETmMq\n\n— Sunderland AFC (@SunderlandAFC) February 16, 2026\n\nAfter signing for Sunderland last month, Ta Bi has been slowly integrating himself into the Wearside bubble whilst recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nThe young Ivorian came on for the final ten minutes of the game and looked really lively down the right. With a clear first step, he looks to have a real burst of acceleration when attacking and he showed some really tidy close control with the ball at his feet.\n\nWhilst advanced analytics struggle to provide much data on the youngster, he did eclipse the record set for completed dribbles within the Israeli Premier League in only half a season.\n\nHis close control against Premier League defenders might not look so impressive; however, he looked like he could be really dangerous and a huge asset when coming off the bench for Sunderland this season.\n\nWith a week to rest before the Lads return home to face Fulham on Sunday, Sunderland now have a real chance to kick on with a much kinder run of fixtures over the next month and beyond.\n\nIf Sunderland have genuine aspirations of a top ten finish this season, the upcoming run of fixtures is likely to have a huge bearing and in order to keep pace with the European-chasers, we’ll need to turn some of those away performances into points whilst converting home draws into wins.\n\nOnce the forty point mark is reached, I’m sure the cup will become a priority, but who could resist competing on both fronts?",

    "description": "“A good cup run and a top-half finish would constitute a fantastic campaign!” writes Paddy Hollis.",
    "fullText": "Being promoted to the Premier League is an achievement almost every football club dreams of, but only a certain few can make a reality.\n\nIn May 2025, Sunderland gained promotion to the top flight for the first time in nearly a decade, in the most exciting and dramatic way possible, and with around a third of our first season back now complete, things couldn’t have gone much better for us.\n\nWe’re in mid-table, within touching distance of the European places, twelve points clear of the relegation zone, and we have a derby win — among nine victories this season. \n\nWe’re also into the last sixteen of the FA Cup for the first time in over a decade and guaranteed to play a team from a lower division in the next round, which adds to the belief that we’re having a great season. \n\nBack in the summer, our hopes and expectations for the Premier League were to survive, and seventeenth place come May 2026 would constitute a successful season regardless of how we achieved it. By Christmas, these hopes changed, with our strong form moving us away from the aim of survival to dreaming of mid-table and possibly even more.\n\nWe’ve been on a tough run of late.\n\nThere’s no denying that, and four defeats in six is tricky, but I’ll caveat this and say two of those losses came against two of the best sides in the league, and one was away at a very good Brentford side whilst we had several key players out. As for West Ham, that was a good old-fashioned dreadful day at the office — it happens.\n\nIn the summer, there was a conscious effort by sections of the fanbase to prepare for dips in form. We were spoilt in the first few months of the season, with every loss being followed by a win, meaning this anticipated poor run hasn’t appeared until January/February.\n\nWe knew poor runs would come — they happen to every team in almost every league.\n\nThe Premier League can be ruthless but Sunderland have stood up to the task on more than a few occasions. Back-to-back defeats against Arsenal and then Liverpool is a small run most teams in the league would go through given these fixtures, so there’s no reason why our losses should be gone over with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nAfter this weekend, there’ll be just ten games left of our first season back in the Premier League — a campaign which is flying by. Each week, it feels as though we’ve kept the points tally ticking over, so I’ve not realised how quickly the games were getting chalked off.\n\nA good cup run — say, to the quarter finals — and a top half finish would constitute a fantastic campaign and a brilliant platform from which to build on for next season. If we do drop off to around thirteenth or fourteenth and still comfortably survive, this will also be a great achievement.\n\nIt’s possible to have both high expectations and to also not get frustrated when we slip into mid-table from the heights of the top eight we reached just a few weeks ago. Beat Fulham and we could be back in that position despite a tough run of results, which once again goes to show the value of getting points on the board in the way we have.\n\nWe’ve got eleven huge league games and at least one cup match left of what’s been a brilliant season. Relegation is a lingering worry that edges further onto the horizon with each passing week, so why shouldn’t we keep on looking up rather than down?",

    "fullText": "This week's incredible feat in the Champions League: the four goals scored in the first half by Anthony Gordon against Qarabağ during Newcastle's 6-1 victory.\n\nThe English international became the second player in the competition's history to score four goals in the first half, following the Brazilian striker from Shakhtar Donetsk, Luiz Adriano, against BATE Borisov in October 2014.\n\nScoring twice against Monaco this Tuesday night in the Champions League (3-2), Désiré Doué confirmed that he is Paris Saint-Germain's lucky charm.\n\nIndeed, PSG has always won when the former Stade Rennais player has scored!\n\n20 official matches where Doué scored... for 20 victories. Impressive!\n\nStarting for Diego Simeone this Wednesday on the pitch in Bruges, Antoine Griezmann played the 113th Champions League match of his career.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup champion thus surpasses Thierry Henry and his 112 Champions League appearances, becoming the second most capped French player in the history of the Champions League, behind Karim Benzema and his 152 matches.\n\n6:45 PM: Multiplex C3 and C4 (Canal + Sport 360)\n\n9:00 PM: LOSC vs Belgrade (Canal + Foot)\n\n9:00 PM: Multiplex C3 and C4 (Canal + Sport 360)\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

There's a lot of sacrifice to race at that level and work full-time,\" said Matthew.\n\nBut, for Billy, it is all worth it: \"The pure adrenaline rush that you get out of it just trying to go as fast as you can, it's really good fun,\" he said.\n\nBilly is one of 17 apprentices at SPP Pumps, who provide large water pump systems globally.\n\nMatthew said he felt it was important for his son to have a \"plan B\".\n\n\"In five years' time, he'll be a qualified engineer and he'll still be racing bikes,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"We hope he gets the best of both worlds,\" Matthew added.\n\nThe race season starts for Billy in April at the iXS European Downhill Cup in Portugal, with his eyes set on a place at the World Championships in South Korea later this year.\n\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "fullText": "ONE Championship Announces New Monthly Event Series in Japan\n\nTakeru Segawa, Nadaka Yoshinari, Yuya Wakamatsu, and Yuki Yoza Praise ONE Samurai, Ready to Lead the Japanese Combat Sports Scene\n\n(ONE), the world’s largest martial arts organization, held a press conference at Kanda Myojin Hall in Tokyo on Wednesday, February 18, to officially announce the launch of its new monthly event series, ONE Samurai.\n\n[ONE Samurai Press Conference Photos]\n\nONE Samurai will heavily feature Japan’s most popular martial arts stars and next-generation athletes across MMA, Muay Thai, kickboxing, and submission grappling. The series will also have appearances from some of the biggest international superstars, and there will be multiple World Title fights on each event.\n\nChatri Sityodtong, Chairman and CEO of ONE Championship, said: “In the past, Japanese martial arts organizations like K-1 and PRIDE were at their peak and were number one in the world. However, as they declined, the Japanese martial arts scene has been declining as well. ONE will create a new future for martial arts for Japanese fighters and fans. We will create Japanese martial arts heroes.”\n\nShuntaro Tanaka, CEO of Japan and Group Chief Commercial Officer, said: “It’s not all about stories and heroes – that’s Chatri’s philosophy of creating value. I listened to Chatri’s words about creating world-class heroes, about revitalizing martial arts and creating future plans, about wanting to work together to inspire and move people from the IP side. I also accepted his offer because personally, I have always loved martial arts.”\n\nU-NEXT, Japan’s leading streaming service with 12 million subscribers, will exclusively broadcast all ONE Samurai events, with ONE Championship committing to produce 60 events over five years. Global broadcast details will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe inaugural event, ONE Samurai 1, will be held at the Ariake Arena in Tokyo on Wednesday, April 29. Tickets are on sale now via ePlus and Zaiko.\n\nYuya Wakamatsu, ONE Flyweight MMA World Champion, said: “I can embody the dream of becoming ‘the modern samurai.’ I think this is the best stage to continue defending and proving that Japanese [athletes] are strong. I want fans to enjoy the battles and feel the courage at ONE Samurai.”\n\nNadaka Yoshinari, ONE Atomweight Muay Thai World Champion, said: “Last year, I appeared twice at events held in Japan, and I saw the excitement for martial arts’ return. I’m looking forward to seeing how much more excitement Japanese events will generate with ONE Samurai. In Muay Thai, I believe I’m world-class, so no matter which opponents challenge me, I will show complete fights and firmly defend this belt.”\n\nTakeru Segawa, former three-division K-1 Champion, said: “Now that ONE’s major Japanese events will be held here, the world’s strongest fighters will gather. I think ONE Samurai will be a major event that proves Japanese strength and puts martial arts at the center in Japan. I’m only one fight in, but I want to elevate ONE Samurai and connect it to the next generation. Even though my next fight is my retirement fight, I will prove my world-class strength and cap off ONE Samurai’s first major event in the best form.”\n\nYuki Yoza, former K-1 Champion, said: “I want to elevate ONE Samurai not just by challenging foreign fighters, but by surpassing my seniors. Since Takeru is retiring, I want to become the ace of ONE Samurai.”",

    "fullText": "There was no mistaking the school with the loftier boys basketball tradition Wednesday night.\n\nThe Alta Hawks brought their history, which includes four state championships, to Hillcrest High to take on the Huskies in a matchup between the 5A tourney’s No. 16 and No. 17 seeds.\n\nCrew Eckman scored 17 points, Colin Hansen had 13 and Coby Goodfellow 10 as the Hawks’ postseason heritage continued with a 60-48 over the Huskies in a first-round game at Hillcrest’s gym.\n\nAlta coach Travis Ohrn said he was proud his team advanced after a .500 season that was jilted by injuries to two of the team’s top players. The Hawks were no match for Region 6’s top three teams but they now have a chance to add another memorable event to school history Friday when they travel to take on top-seeded Timpview.\n\n“That’s why we play ‘em (the games). Our kids will have no trouble getting motivated,” said Ohrn, who beat Timpview for the crown in 2023 but lost to the Thunderbirds last year in a quarterfinal.\n\n“We know who’s next but we played good team basketball (tonight) and I knew if we kept doing what we were doing, we would get stops.”\n\nThe Hawks brought their boisterous student crowd and they had plenty to cheer about until their team’s 11-point second-quarter lead dipped to 42-39 early in the third quarter. At that point, however, Eckman broke loose for a layup, Hansen followed with a pair of free throws and Caleb Anderson made a short jumper.\n\nHillcrest never recovered. The Huskies, who sailed through most of their Region 4 schedule and finished the season with an impressive 15-9 record, hurt themselves with turnovers and also made just 4-of-8 free throws in the final period.\n\n“We’re undersized,” said Ohrn, who praised the 6-foot-6 Anderson and 6-2 Goodfellow for giving the Hawks a 26-22 rebound advantage. “It’s great to see kids step up when needed and at this time of the year.”\n\nHillcrest was led by Anthony Burris, who had 13 points off the bench, including a pair of three-pointers. Tyler Ashby and Cyrus Nielsen added 11 points each. The Huskies came a long way after losing 86-32 to Olympus in the season opener and had a 2-5 record after the first month of the regular season.",

    "title": "‘I Came Here To Become A Champion’ – Vero Sees Shir Cohen As Final Step Toward Gold At ONE Friday Fights 143",
    "description": "The Myanmar sensation looks to extend her streak against the Israeli star in their atomweight Muay Thai main event.",
    "fullText": "After two consecutive victories, Myanmar sensation Vero “The Kayan Leopard” is now setting her sights on ONE Championship gold. But before she can think about a World Title opportunity, she must overcome the toughest test of her career to date.\n\nOn February 20, the 29-year-old will face Israeli standout Shir Cohen in an atomweight Muay Thai showdown at ONE Friday Fights 143, airing live in Asia primetime from Bangkok’s legendary Lumpinee Stadium.\n\nLike Vero, Cohen arrives with serious credentials. The Israeli striker owns a 3-0 record in the world’s largest martial arts organization and was once positioned as a frontrunner for gold. That shared ambition only fuels Vero’s determination heading into their main event clash.\n\n“I’ve fought in this event three times already. Each opponent was different, each style was different. My first fight was completely new for me – everything changed my life. It was very hard. In my second fight, I won by knockout. In my latest fight, I won by decision. My opponent was difficult, but I tried my best. I think I did my best and I learned a lot.”\n\nVero entered ONE Friday Fights 97 in February 2025 with considerable hype as one of Myanmar’s brightest striking stars. However, she suffered a narrow split-decision loss to Francisca “Miss Scarface” Vera in a fiercely contested battle.\n\nAfter that setback, the Tiger Muay Thai representative recalibrated quickly. She stopped Junior Fairtex via first-round TKO at ONE Friday Fights 107, then edged Li Mingrui by split decision at ONE Friday Fights 132 to build a two-fight streak.\n\nNow, with her first main event assignment ahead of her, Vero understands the magnitude of the moment:\n\n“This Friday is very important for me. It’s my first time fighting in the main event. It’s important for me and for Myanmar. Please support me even more.\n\n“I’ve known Shir Cohen for a long time. Before she fought in ONE, I saw her fight at Fairtex [Fights]. She’s very good and she’s a nice person. We’re friends on Instagram. I’m happy many Myanmar fans also like her.”\n\nVero owns nearly 30 professional victories, many earned in her native sport of lethwei, and has steadily adapted to ONE’s 4-ounce Muay Thai format.\n\nThe smaller gloves reward sharper focus and punish hesitation, lessons she has embraced through experiences that have only strengthened her resolve.\n\n“I came here to become a champion. And for everyone in Myanmar who believes in me, this Friday I will show the best version of myself. I don’t care about pain. I’m ready.”\n\nAt ONE Friday Fights 143, Vero will meet Shir Cohen in a matchup between two surging contenders with World Title aspirations.\n\nCohen enters with a perfect 3-0 promotional record and refined striking fundamentals. The Israeli athlete blends speed, sharp combinations, and intelligent movement, making her one of the division’s most technically polished competitors.\n\nHaving studied her upcoming adversary closely, Vero said:\n\n“Her style leans toward kickboxing. Her punching fundamentals are very good. Her Muay Thai is good too, but I think she stands out \n\n“I think she’s not as strong in the clinch. When she punches, sometimes she walks forward too much. If she meets someone who fights smart and intercepts well, that could be a problem. That’s what I think. I’ve studied how to deal with her.”\n\nCohen was previously scheduled to challenge ONE Women’s Atomweight Muay Thai World Champion Allycia Hellen Rodrigues at ONE Fight Night 29 last year before an injury forced her to withdraw. That missed opportunity stalled her pursuit, and this bout marks a crucial step in rebuilding that momentum.\n\nVero understands exactly what defeating such an opponent would mean:\n\n“One year ago, she was scheduled to fight for the title. She’s very experienced. If I beat her, I should get a title shot too. She’s been here longer than me. Passing her is a very important test.”\n\nThe opportunity is clear. A decisive victory would place Vero firmly in the ONE World Championship conversation.\n\nBut beyond that, her focus remains on execution.\n\n“My plan is to fight smart. I want to be a fighter who uses her brain, not just rush forward. I want to be relaxed but heavy. If there’s a chance to knock her out, I’ll wait for the moment and finish it.

    "fullText": "In the Borders town of Jedburgh there are no fears of its historic hand ba' game dying out any time soon - unlike so many others already have across the UK.\n\nThe Uppies and the Doonies are set to do battle once again on its streets on the first Thursday after Shrove Tuesday just as they have for centuries.\n\nFormer provost Len Wyse said young people were \"more enthusiastic than ever\" to take part in proceedings.\n\nMany other similar street sports have been stopped due to the property damage and disruption they cause but he said it remained a popular pursuit in Jedburgh.\n\nThe first record of the Jedburgh event is in 1704 - although it was not held in 1901 when it clashed with Queen Victoria's funeral.\n\nAn attempt was made to stop the contest in 1849, citing the town's cholera outbreak, but that was overruled at the Court of Session.\n\n\"Hand ba' has gone on for many, many years - some people are not exactly sure how many,\" said Len.\n\n\"It originated - some say - from when we were fighting the English and got the Englishman's head and we used to roll it about the town.\n\nWhatever its origins, it remains a popular pursuit.\n\n\"We have got these small leather balls made and they have got ribbons on them depicting different things,\" explained Len.\n\n\"Like if it is somebody's wedding anniversary - like a ruby wedding - we will put ruby coloured ribbons on.\"\n\nThe two teams fight for possession of the ball and look to take it to opposite ends of the town.\n\n\"The Uppies are going up the Castlegate and they throw the ball over the castle railings and that is their score,\" said Len.\n\n\"The Doonies, they go 'doon the toon', and they roll it along the road and there is an underground stream that they roll it over and that gives them a score.\"\n\nThe sport is an easy one to learn and has remained the same for centuries.\n\nMore stories from South Scotland\n\nListen to news for the Scottish Borders on BBC Sounds\n\n\"There is only one rule and that is you don't kick the ball - you are only meant to throw it, smuggle it, whatever,\" he said.\n\n\"There is nothing really changed.\n\n\"The shopkeepers board up their windows because it is played on the High Street - they don't stop traffic or anything.\n\n\"Fortunately the A68 got diverted many years ago so it doesn't go through the middle of town.\"\n\nAlthough his playing days are behind him, Len has fond memories of one sneaky move for his team.\n\n\"I scored one a few years ago for the Uppies,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I was quite fortunate - it rolled out the maul and I just picked it up and nobody saw me so I just put it in my pocket, walked up to the Castlegate and I scored.\"\n\nHe said he was confident its popularity would last for years to come with competitors coming from other areas which still have similar games.\n\n\"There are a great deal of folk play in it,\" he said.\n\n\"It brings them in from other towns too. We get folk from Ancrum, Denholm and Bonchester - that's three places that all have their own ba'.\"\n\nHe added that the next generation seemed keen to maintain the tradition.\n\n\"The school let them away early to play - you get a great deal of youngsters turning up, they are more enthusiastic than ever,\" he said.\n\nThat means he is confident that it will not follow other events which have died out down the years.\n\n\"It won't because there are a lot of youngsters taking it up - playing it, but also looking after it,\" he added.\n\nUp'Ards go ahead on first day of Shrovetide Football\n\nUppies battle Doonies in town's historic ba' game",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona are preparing a new contract to ward off interest in Marc Casado as Manchester United eye a bombshell move for the 22-year-old midfielder, according to the latest report from Spain.\n\nThe Red Devils are on the hunt for a replacement for Casemiro, with the Brazilian behemoth set to leave Old Trafford after the club decided against renewing his expensive contract.\n\nKobbie Mainoo has been reborn under caretaker coach Michael Carrick, who took the reins from Ruben Amorim after INEOS brought an end to Amorim’s tumultuous tenure last month.\n\nIn a long line of perplexing decisions by the former Sporting Clube de Portugal manager, his aversion to Mainoo was perhaps the most baffling. Carrick has immediately corrected this error, while also restoring Bruno Fernandes to his rightful position as a No.10.\n\nHowever, the dismal form of Manuel Ugarte leaves the double pivot in midfield as the weakest area of the pitch for United, with a growing belief the Uruguay international will be shown the exit door alongside Casemiro this summer.\n\nThe club’s primary targets are Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton. All three players are expected to cost up to £100 million, however, with the exorbitant Premier League tax rearing its ugly head.\n\nAs such, United are also considering ‘cheaper’ midfielders on the continent – with Casado emerging as a highly rated option at the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nA report relayed by The Peoples Person reveals the Spain international is seen as a “crucial opportunity” to strengthen a stalling engine room, given Barcelona’s financial difficulties could facilitate a cut-price deal.\n\nThe Spanish giants are intent on keeping Casado at the Camp Nou, however, and have begun steps to ensure his long-term future remains in Catalonia.\n\nIn response to the growing interest in their academy graduate, with Atletico Madrid also in the hunt, Barcelona are ready to open talks over a new long-term deal, according to Diario Sport.\n\nCasado’s current contract expires in 2028 and contains a release clause worth €100 million – but the Blaugrana will “intensify” negotiations in the coming weeks to extend this after “initial contact” between both parties.\n\nThe Spaniard is understood to be fully committed to the current campaign. He is expected to wait until the summer before making a final decision on his long-term future, giving United a chance to convince him his future lies in Manchester.\n\nThis is a rapidly evolving situation which will be one to keep a close eye on as July 1st approaches and the Red Devils solidify their succession plan for Casemiro.\n\nCasado’s profile – an all-action midfield dynamo, combining outstanding work rate off the ball with quality on it – is a sensible one for United.\n\nIt will simply come down to whether a cut-price deal can be struck for the midfield enforcer due to uncertainty at Camp Nou, and the prospect of more first-team opportunities at Old Trafford.\n\nFeatured image Pedro Salado via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Joshua Dent made three free throws in the final 15 seconds as the St. Mary's men fended off host Seattle University's upset bid and won 72-70 Wednesday night.\n\nDent struggled from the floor (1-for-7 shooting), but made 5 of 6 free throws as the Gaels finished 21 of 27 from the line.\n\nThe win was the fifth straight for St. Mary's (24-4, 13-2 West Coast Conference) and kept it in the middle of a three-way battle atop the WCC standings.\n\nThe Gaels moved a half-game behind first-place Gonzaga - which played USF at Chase Center on Wednesday night - and into a tie for second with Santa Clara. The first- and second-place teams in the WCC during the regular season earn byes into the conference tournament semifinals.\n\nThe Gaels' final three regular-season games are at Washington State and home against Santa Clara and Gonzaga.\n\nMikey Lewis scored a game-high 22 points for St. Mary's, which also got 15 points apiece from Paulius Murauskas and Andrew McKeever.\n\nSt. Mary's broke open a close game early, breaking from a 7-7 tie to take a 21-7 lead at the halfway mark of the first half.\n\nBut the Redhawks (16-12, 5-10) steadily worked their way back before taking a 53-52 lead with 9:28 to play. From that point on, neither team led by more than two points until Dent's two free throws with 15 seconds to play gave the Gaels a 71-68 lead.\n\nWill Heimbrodt responded with a layup with 10 seconds left to cut Seattle's deficit to one. Forced to foul, the Redhawks again sent Dent to the line where he made 1 of 2 with five seconds left. Seattle didn't get a shot off after Dent missed the second free throw.\n\nJunseok Yeo led Seattle with 20 points.\n\nMaya Anderson scored a game-high 22 points and San Jose State broke a six-game losing streak with a 58-56 Mountain West Conference defeat of Utah State at Provident Credit Union Event Center.\n\nThe win was only the second in MWC play for the Spartans (2-14, 4-23).\n\nAnderson made 7 of 13 shots from the field - including 2 of 3 from distance - and 6 of 9 free throws to top 20 points for the third time this season.\n\nAitana Rosello Lopez led the Aggies (6-19, 2-14) with 14 points.\n\nThis article originally published at Local college basketball: St. Mary's men avoid upset, SJSU women snap skid.",

    "description": "Poor projections set up for a surprise",
    "fullText": "Despite multiple additions early in Spring Training, the San Diego Padres took a step back in 2026 projections according to both FanGraphs and PECOTA (Baseball Prospectus). In January, the numbers projected significant steps back for multiple players on the team but the lack of adding any higher tier talent seems to have negatively affected how the analytics view the Padres for the upcoming season.\n\nAt this point, FanGraphs projects a 79-83 record and fourth place finish in the NL West for the Friars. PECOTA is only slightly better at 80-82. While noting the loss of Dylan Cease, Luis Arraez, Yu Darvish and Robert Suarez, the poor projections for the remaining team from last year drags down any possible upside their additions could give the rankings.\n\nLast season’s lack of power continues\n\nThe only player projected to have a better season than last year is Jackson Merrill. Every other position player is worse or about the same in assessing their performance. While projecting Luis Campusano, Nick Castellanos, Sung-Mun Song and Bryce Johnson as the bench players, none of them have an fWAR above 0.8.\n\nMiguel Andujar is the platoon partner for Gavin Sheets or the DH and his fWAR is 0.6. No Padre position player has an fWAR above 5.4 (Fernando Tatis Jr.) while many are between 0.5 and 1.5. Tatis Jr. is projected to lead the team with 30 homers.\n\nThe starting pitchers fair no better. Michael King will only get 161 innings with a 3.68 ERA. Nick Pivetta takes a big step back with a 3.92 ERA and Joe Musgrove gets a 3.89 ERA projection. There is no belief in Randy Vasquez at 4.79 and Germán Márquez is the projected fifth starter with a 5.03 ERA.\n\nThe bullpen also gets very little love with lefty Adrian Morejon, who is widely considered a top reliever and was recently listed by MLB Network as a top 10 reliever in baseball, given an fWAR of 1.1 and a 3.40 ERA. Only Mason Miller gets any respect with a 2.44 ERA and fWAR of 2.3.\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels, St. Louis Cardinals, Tampa Bay Rays, Cleveland Guardians, Athletics and Cincinnati Reds are all listed as having better odds of making the playoffs than the Padres. With the Dodgers listed at 94% to win the division and 99% to make the playoffs, the Padres come in at 1.2% to win the division and 22.1% to make the playoffs.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants come in at 37.4% to make the playoffs and the Arizona Diamondbacks are at 32% to make the playoffs. The Padres got the benefit of the doubt for much of the offseason with multiple projections listing them as the second or third best team in the NL West. That is no longer the case.\n\nThe only way to get national respect for this team in 2026 was if A.J. Preller agreed with the media around the league and traded away Tatis Jr. in order to acquire a power bat and top-tier starter. Trading the organization’s best player doesn’t seem like a good way to improve a team that finished with 90 wins last season. Preller made it clear early on that was not an option and he recently stated that shedding salary was not a priority.\n\nWhile Preller has backloaded the team with starters returning from injury to compete for the fifth spot in the rotation, Randy Vasquez is facing a pivotal season in his career. Vasquez is out of options and must make the staff or be off-loaded at the end of spring. Reports from pitching coach Ruben Niebla and manager Craig Stammen has reflected that Vasquez has made the effort to take that step forward and has held onto the advances made at the end of last season.\n\nThe bats added, Castellanos and Andujar as 1B/DH options and Ty France as more of a defensive option, don’t deliver the power that fans had hoped. This puts the burden on the current roster to step up their game.\n\nNone of this goes into the projections seen on FanGraphs and Baseball Prospectus. They use algorithms and underlying metrics as well as aging statistics to determine their estimates. As fans who watch this team and know the players character and motivation, we can argue the numbers listed in these projections are devoid of the determination that we know these players exhibit.\n\nWill the heart and character of the players play a role in helping the Padres outperform these numbers?\n\nXander Bogaerts and Manny Machado can’t avoid the inevitability of aging. But not every player ages the same way and there are plenty of examples of good performances well into some athletes 30s. It is true that neither of them will play their pivotal positions for much longer, but the math used for these numbers doesn’t take into account the uniqueness of each player.\n\nIf just a few of the players play to the same level they did last season; if Tatis Jr. finds more power and Merrill stays healthy and takes another step forward; if Machado and Bogaerts stay relatively healthy and don’t regress as much as expected; then the offense should be fine. No matter if Andujar and Castellano aren’t big power hitters, both are improvements over Jason Heyward and Yuli Gurriel.\n\nThe Padres won’t have as many singles with Luis Arraez gone but Tatis Jr. will have better lineup protection with Merrill (or Bogaerts?) hitting behind him. The bottom of the lineup has little power as it presently stands unless Castellanos breaks out, Gavin Sheets plays above last year or another bat is added. But all of these issues were much worse last year and somehow this team finished three games behind the Dodgers.\n\nPreller may not be done, there is lots of time left for more moves and still plenty of decent players looking for jobs. The trade market will still be busy for another few weeks and I don’t know that we have ever seen Preller go a whole offseason without a trade.\n\nWith just a little luck, maybe the Padres can surprise some people. A snake-in-the-grass isn’t always a bad thing.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Undermanned, undersized and underqualified.\n\nYou can chalk up the USC Trojans 2025-2026 men's basketball campaign to one outlier: Injuries.\n\nTrojans head coach Eric Musselman has remarked on numerous occasions that Year Two under his management has been plagued by the lack of depth, primarily due to said injuries, with Rodney Rice, Amarion Dickerson, and now the newly banged-up Chad Baker-Mazara.\n\nMusselman has scratched the injuries as an excuse for his team's results, and recent losses have expanded the importance of those missing pieces.\n\nWednesday night would be no different.\n\nFrom the jump, USC would enter the Galen Center against the No.10 ranked Illinois Fighting Illini bruised and battered, playing yet another game without their leading scorer in Baker-Mazara, who was slated as day-to-day with a knee injury and freshman Alijah Arenas fighting an illness.\n\nMix that in with a poor performance all around from the rest of the Trojans on both ends of the floor, and the final score of 101-65 made sense.\n\n“I didn’t think USC played well on either side of the ball,” Musselman said in his opening statement to the media in the postgame.\n\nThat's as flat an answer as you're going to get in terms of the Trojans performance.\n\nBefore player introductions, the Illini faithful came in bunches and painted the Galen Center a sea of orange and blue in the stands.\n\nIllinois led 54-32 at the half, and that first half would be etched in the record books as the most efficient Division 1 men's college basketball over the last 30 years, according to statistician Ken Pomeroy.\n\nThe Fighting Illini were displaying a full-out shooting barrage as a team, with a total of seven players putting up double-digit figures in the points category.\n\nJunior guard Andrej Stojakovic led Illinois with 22 points on 6-7 shooting, and the Fighting Illini shot an impressive 52%.\n\nThe USC faithful had nothing to cheer about for 40 minutes and were eager to leave their seats once the final buzzer had rung.\n\nGranted, some fans did leave by the middle of the second half.\n\nThis was one of those games that USC has to chalk up fast and immediately hit the drawing board once more.\n\nUSC was simply outmatched, which is worth being heavily noted, and Musselman was very keen on focusing on the Trojans' next matchup against the Oregon Ducks this Saturday.",

After their 3-1 victory against Inter, they certainly have a chance of reaching the round of 16, while last year's finalists are left worrying about their own fate.\n\nFor the Norwegians, this was their third consecutive win this season against a team from the top 5 leagues (victories against ManCity and Atlético).

Their season ended in November, and the new season doesn't start until March. So far in 2026, all their matches have been in the Champions League.\n\nThis leaves plenty of time for preparation for the games, and next week they could secure their ticket to the round of 16 in Milan.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Here's Scottie Scheffler, and a poetic explanation of why we return to a \"frustrating\" game.",
    "fullText": "Scottie Scheffler took his right arm back, arched his back backward to the point where that arm was just above the back of his right knee, planted forward with his left leg — and threw.\n\nBut a good riddance. Now his ball had taken root among the trees near Riviera Country Club’s 11th green, where, two years ago at the Genesis Invitational, Scheffler had just sent a 5-foot birdie putt 4 feet past the hole.\n\nThe point here, though, besides wondering whether golf’s top-ranked player could have also been a quarterback of his hometown Dallas Cowboys?\n\nIf playing golf drives us to such frustration, why play golf? Clearly, there are other pursuits. A throw-a-ball-in-the-trees payoff sounds unpleasant. Scheffler said Wednesday that he doesn’t even have a proper method for measuring how good he is.\n\nThen again, maybe not being boxed in is freeing. Perhaps immeasurability is undeniably good.\n\nAt the least, Scheffler’s press conference ahead of this week’s Genesis Invitational wasn’t mundane. The session was reflective. Golf, he said, is limitless in its chances to learn. And if you’re the learning type like he is — “my mind has always been my greatest tool,” he said — that’s as welcome as a sunny day for a weekend tee time.\n\n“I think that’s why we keep practicing,” Scheffler said. “You never get to a place where you feel like you’ve got it figured out. I always like practicing and trying to improve and creating new shots.\n\n“I think golf is kind of the endless pursuit of trying to figure something out and I’m never going to get there, but there’s no harm in trying.”\n\nScheffler brought up rounds with Jordan Spieth, a fellow pro and longtime friend who he plays with often.\n\n“You talk about golf being this kind of endless pursuit of trying to figure this game out,” Scheffler said.\n\n“I play golf with Jordan a lot at home. I can learn so much just by watching and asking Jordan questions about the way he plays shots, and he does some things that are — work really well for him that wouldn’t work well for me and then certain ways he approaches things, I like asking questions and trying to figure things out.”\n\nIn this poetic explanation, you can keep coming back for more.\n\n“When it comes to competing in golf tournaments,” Scheffler said, “I can’t control what the other guy I’m playing with is doing. Like let’s say I’m tied for the lead going into the final round and I shoot 62 and the guy shoots 61. Yeah, I can definitely look at a few shots I’d want to have back, but at the end of the day, the tournament is over and you take your hat off, shake hands, say congratulations.\n\n“The great thing about golf is oftentimes we just get to show up the next week and start all over and compete again.”\n\nOver time, you even create friendships.\n\n“Like you look at a guy like Collin [Morikawa] last week,” Scheffler said. “I’ve been competing against Collin since we were like 14 years old. He wins a tournament, he announces he’s pregnant, and all of a sudden you just have this — it’s such a cool moment to see a guy who’s played really good golf over the last few years and hasn’t quite gotten the results and the wins, but he’s played pretty consistent golf, and then he gets to announce that he’s having a kid. It’s this moment, it’s like, wow. I competed as hard as I could, got beat, and it’s like, man, that’s awesome. You won, congrats.\n\n“You’re having a baby, even bigger congrats. Then we’re here this week and the prep just starts again.”\n\nSo yeah, same thing goes for throw-a-ball-in-the-trees moments.\n\nOn to the next hole. On to the next tournament. Here’s where things get really good.\n\nThe 2024 Genesis was the last tournament Scheffler played with the blade putter he hit that putt with on 11.\n\nAnd he’s since gone on to win 14 events, including three majors.\n\n“When things don’t go as planned,” Scheffler said, “I think it’s healthy to have a level of frustration with that, just because it takes so much work in order to get out here, and especially when you feel like you’re doing something right and doing things the right way and not getting the results.\n\n“I think it can always be frustrating, but I think that’s part of the game of golf is being able to manage that in order to execute the next shot.”\n\nThe post Why golfers keep playing ‘frustrating' game, according to Scottie Scheffler appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Football matches are not always won by the team with the strongest offense. Atlético Madrid has embodied this credo to perfection in recent years.\n\nThe team under coach Diego Simeone was known for an extremely well-organized defense, striking with cold precision and then retreating in a highly disciplined manner. Currently, however, there is little to nothing left of this Atleti.\n\nThis season, the Spaniards have been historically weak in defense. Yesterday’s 3-3 draw in the first leg of the Champions League playoffs against Club Brugge was already the ninth consecutive Champions League match in which they conceded at least one goal. When has that ever happened before? Never in the club’s history.\n\nIn the league as well, they recently suffered a clear 0-3 defeat against Rayo Vallecano. Six goals conceded in two games against the 17th-placed team in the league and against Brugge cannot be the standard for a top club. It almost seems as if the team has lost its identity. Maybe they should just play in the Copa del Rey from now on.\n\nIn last week’s 4-0 win over FC Barcelona in the first leg of the semi-final, Atleti showed that the old stability can still be there.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The 2026 league year is coming next month. It officially begins on March 11, with the legal negotiating period beginning on March 9.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have many roster decisions to make before then.\n\nLeading up to the new league year, we will profile every player on the roster, go over what they did last season, what their contract status is and what they face in 2026.\n\nNext up is running back James Conner.\n\nConner had a very disappointing year, as he played in only three games before suffering a severe ankle injury that ended his season. Before he got hurt, though, he was not as explosive or effective as in previous seasons. He averaged only 3.0 yards per carry for 95 yards and one touchdown in three games.\n\nConner enters the final year of his two-year, $19 million contract extension. He is scheduled to make nearly $6.4 million in salary and is due a $1 million roster bonus. His contract will count more than $9.8 million against the salary cap.\n\nSoon to be 31 years old, coming off a season-ending ankle when it looked like he might have lost a little something before he got hurt, it feels almost a lock that he will be a salary cap casualty and cut before March 15 when his roster bonus is due. The move will save the Cardinals nearly $7.6 million in cap space, leaving $2.25 million in dead money.\n\nWith a new head coach, we can expect the Cardinals to look for a new No. 1 running back.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

ON APPLE & GOOGLE PLAY\n\n(Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nFrom United’s point of view, there is no chance of such a deal materialising. Barcelona will have to shell out the clause upfront, though INEOS chiefs are said to be kicking themselves behind the scenes for setting such a low sum, given the impact he’s had in Catalonia.\n\nIn the 34 appearances he’s made across all competitions, the 28-year-old has returned a hugely impressive 10 goals and 13 assists.\n\nRashford has particularly excelled in Europe, where he has found the back of the net five times and notched four assists in eight matches across the first phase of the competition.\n\nSuch stellar showings have put him in excellent standing ahead of this summer’s World Cup, especially considering Thomas Tuchel was utilising him in the second half of 2024/2025, when he was on loan with Aston Villa and looking to revive his career after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.\n\n(Photo by Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)\n\nSurprisingly, it’s been suggested this week that current interim boss Michael Carrick would be keen on having Rashford at his disposal next season in the event he’s granted the job permanently – but the player himself has his heart set on a permanent Barcelona switch.\n\nFabrizio Romano shared an update on the Carrington graduate’s situation last night, saying: “Barcelona want to keep Marcus Rashford beyond this season. [They are] planning to negotiate and reduce the €30m (£26m) buy option from Man United.\n\n“MUFC insist on Rashford’s fixed price to be received in full: €30m — salary also a topic to discuss over [the] next months.”\n\nRomano: Man Utd to start negotiating deal for 23 G/A England star ‘over next months’\n\nJust in: Man Utd bring back ‘incredible’ player who clashed with Amorim\n\n“Night and day” – Man Utd will only sign ‘phenomenal’ EPL star on one condition",

    "fullText": "The Manchester City squad has been enjoying some time away from football this week. A rare opportunity for rest has come at the ideal time for Pep Guardiola’s squad. City has endured a hectic schedule over the past few months, and across that journey a host of City players have suffered injuries. Slowly but surely, City has had players come back from injury. John Stones has recently returned from a long injury layoff. Nico is also back after running himself into the ground for the cause from the end of November until January.\n\nJeremy Doku and Savinho are two other players whom City have missed due to injury. The pair look to be on the verge of returning, which is a huge boost for Manchester City ahead of a pivotal point in this season.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 2-0 win over Salford City last weekend, Pep Guardiola was asked whether or not Jeremy Doku or Savinho were getting close to returning to the pitch. The Manchester City manager provided a positive update on the pair’s fitness. Speaking on Jeremy Doku, Pep Guardiola said: “Jeremy is close. He still doesn’t train with us, but we will see. He’s a little better, but [against Salford] we needed wingers.”\n\n“We know how important he is. It helps us a lot in how we play. I’m more than delighted with how we behave. Antoine has played a lot of minutes, if you make shifts with Doku, Semenyo, Savinho, the opponents defend in their box for 90 minutes.”\n\nSpeaking on Savinho’s fitness, Pep Guardiola said: “He’s been out for six weeks. He could [have played] a few minutes, but we didn’t want to take risks. Training two days ago was wow, so good. He’s close. Now we have a long week and players coming back.”\n\nThe good news for Manchester City is that their injury list is starting to dwindle. Mateo Kovacic and Josko Gvardiol are City’s only two players who are out due to long-term injuries. However, Mateo Kovacic has returned to training recently, so the Croatian midfielder is on the comeback trail. After suffering an injury crisis of sorts throughout January, Pep Guardiola’s squad now has players returning and with that, depth. As the 2025/26 season enters a critical phase, Manchester City look to be hitting full strength in terms of the fitness of their squad. That could prove to be massive as the pressure of the 2025/26 season ramps up.\n\nJeremy Doku and Savinho returning would be massive for Manchester City. The pair would add depth and a different element to Manchester City’s attacking play, given their strengths as players. That is great news for Pep Guardiola’s side, and it remains to be seen if the pair will be available for Manchester City’s upcoming Premier League fixture against Newcastle United at the Etihad this weekend.",

The second one is obvious: how many times have we seen Olise or Davies trundle out of the locker room in training lugging the massive speaker around?\n\nAs for best and worst styles, all I can say is I hope Jackson’s style isn’t as bad as his performances on the pitch.",

    "fullText": "The streak continues! With a nearly wire-to-wire win over a very good Clemson Tiger team, the Deacs have now won 3 straight games in ACC play. After starting the season just 2-8 in the conference, Wake is now 5-8 and is potentially 1 win away from jumping all the way up to 9th place in the conference. It seems like maybe the team is starting to figure out how to play together and win games—better late than never.\n\nUpped the win streak to 3❕ pic.twitter.com/ymeaWIbfDJ\n\n— Wake Forest Men's Basketball (@WakeMBB) February 19, 2026\n\nThe first half was maybe the best half of basketball the Deacs have played all season—for a minute there it looked like Wake was going to blow the Tigers out of the gym. Clemson scored the first basket of the game and led for all of 47 seconds before Wake just started pouring it on. In the first 10 minutes of the game, the Deacs went on a 24-6 run to take a commanding 26-10 lead that they would hold for the remainder of the game. The basket must have looked like the size of an ocean out there for Wake, because they simply could not miss.\n\nGive him some dap 😌 pic.twitter.com/RvauFFCQw6\n\n— Wake Forest Men's Basketball (@WakeMBB) February 19, 2026\n\nThat 7-0 Clemson run continued into the 2nd half, with the Tigers scoring 9 of the first 10 points of the half to cut the lead down to just 5 points by the 16 minute timeout. In what would become a theme for the 2nd half, the Deacs answered back with a 5-0 run of their own to push the lead back to double digits.\n\nRight to the rack ✔️ pic.twitter.com/oC95XvE5dG\n\n— Wake Forest Men's Basketball (@WakeMBB) February 19, 2026\n\nClemson got back within 6 points several times throughout the half, but Wake did a phenomenal job of always answering back and keeping the Tigers at arm’s length. At times, it felt like Clemson was just 1 big momentum changing basket away from being able to catch up and vault into the lead, but the Deacs never let them get it.\n\nPerhaps the biggest shot of the night came from Sophomore Sebastian Akins. With a little over 2 minutes remaining, the Tigers cut the lead back down to 6, and it definitely felt like they were making their final push to get back in the game. We have seen Wake stumble at the end of games several times this season, so I can’t be the only one that started to worry that we were about to see the same thing again. Akins was having none of it.\n\nGimme 3 Seb 👌 pic.twitter.com/gZhCONaLib\n\n— Wake Forest Men's Basketball (@WakeMBB) February 19, 2026\n\nWith his 1st 3-pointer since the Longwood game in December, Akins stopped the Tiger run and put the Deacs back ahead by 9 points, effectively ending Clemson’s chances at winning the game. Akins would go on to make 5 free throws down the stretch to finish with 16 points on 4-7 shooting and help the Deacs win their 3rd straight conference game 85-77.\n\nThis is clearly a team that has not quit yet. The Deacs proved again tonight that they have the talent to not just play with, but beat, the top teams of the ACC. We are maybe starting to see the depth that was promised at the beginning of the season come into reality—led by Juke Harris’s 20 points, the Deacs had 5 players finish in double figures, and while Isaac Carr did not score in this game, he added 5 assists with just 1 turnover. Omaha Biliew, who finished with 8 points, probably would have finished in double figures as well if he didn’t foul out with 3 minutes remaining in the game. Juke has proven game in and game out that he is going to be able to score the ball, but if Wake can get more games like this from the supporting cast, they can turn into a pretty dangerous team to close out the season. I just wish it hadn’t taken them so long to figure it out.\n\nWith the win, Wake is now 5-8 in the ACC, and the chances of the Deacs finishing 8-10 or better have improved significantly. Obviously finishing in the middle of the pack was not the goal when the season started, but just a couple of weeks ago we were wondering if this team was even going to make the ACC tournament. Now, they have a realistic path to finishing at 0.500 in conference play. They could even be getting Nate Calmese back from injury before the start of the ACC Tournament (I remain skeptical on that but I guess we’ll see). There are still plenty of games left to played, but credit the Deacs for continuing to fight to turn the season around.\n\nHopefully, Wake can extend this winning streak for a couple of more weeks.",

    "fullText": "There was the exquisite side-footed flick to set up Caitlin Foord’s shot, the leap where she fell just an inch short of heading home, and the effort Leuven’s goalkeeper saved. There were the yells to her team-mates as she organised their press, the runs into midfield to recover the ball and the endless harrying that strangled Leuven’s ability to play out from the back.\n\nAlessia Russo was everywhere as Arsenal booked their spot in the Champions League quarter-finals with a 3-1 (7-1 aggregate) win over Leuven, and that is before you even mention her two goals.\n\n“She’s always switched on,” head coach Renee Slegers said after the match. “She’s always present in every phase, in the press, in our counter pressure, working all the way back. She does so many good things.”\n\nRusso is the forward who can drag teams through tournaments — not just because of her poaching, but via her diligent pressing and fine link-up play.\n\nHer seven goals across eight games are the most of any player in the Women’s Champions League this season. These have not been stat-padding contributions; many have been instrumental to Arsenal’s progress. Her double to secure a 2-1 comeback victory over Real Madrid and her assist for Beth Mead’s winning goal against Twente were pivotal.\n\nRusso’s double on Thursday — incidentally, her 49th and 50th goals for the club — rubber-stamped Arsenal’s progress to the quarter-finals, already all but assured by their 4-0 advantage from the reverse fixture last week. They also showcased exactly what she does best in the penalty area.\n\nMidway through the first half, Russo latched onto a through ball and drove into the box before passing back to a team-mate and dropping off slightly. She then darted back into the area to receive the ball with her back to goal, shrugged off Kim Everaerts, and fired home.\n\nIn the 90th minute, after Sara Pusztai had equalised on the night for Leuven and Mariona Caldentey had restored Arsenal’s lead from the spot, Russo added their third. This time — having brought down a high ball under pressure and made the pass that kickstarted Arsenal’s counter-attack — she popped up at the other end of the move and slotted into the bottom corner after turning her marker.\n\nThe chance that best sums up Russo’s value is one she did not score. With 15 minutes remaining, as Leuven attempted to build around Arsenal’s box, Russo dropped deep into her own half to pick up the ball as it was poked clear. She turned and dribbled to the halfway line before releasing Foord to chase on the left. With Leuven’s defenders focused on Foord’s run, Russo continued into the penalty area and leapt to meet a cross at the far post. She could not quite direct it in and a corner was given instead — but the move, beginning with recovering possession in her own half and ending with her on the receiving end of the ball in the box, perfectly sums up her knack for self-service.\n\nHer five Women’s Super League goals so far this season have been scored across only four games — but her direct output does not truly reflect her value. More so than her finishing, Russo’s physicality and hold-up play is what sets her apart as an elite striker: her ability to recover the ball in midfield and retain it under pressure while waiting for team-mates to join the attack is superb. The fitness that allows her to lead Arsenal’s press as vigorously as she did against Leuven is also remarkable.\n\nHaving such a robust target up top is particularly important when Arsenal are not at their most convincing, as they were not at times against Leuven. Though the tie finished 7-1 on aggregate, they had a few patchy moments in difficult conditions at Meadow Park. Russo’s chance in the 75th minute followed a sequence where Arsenal had looked unsettled under Leuven’s pressure, underlining her importance as a release valve.\n\n“That was really good,” Slegers said when asked by The Athletic about Russo’s build-up contributions, “especially then in the second half when (Leuven) started to take more risks in their press and how they do things.\n\n“Then we can play less into feet, or even sometimes not into feet because the pitch wasn’t perfect, but then she brings it down, controls it so well (under) pressure and then she has qualities to roll pressure and set other players up.”\n\nFifty club goals is a punchy headline figure, but Russo’s contribution is much greater than that. She is key not just for Arsenal’s finishing touch, but for their ability to maintain a threat on the counter, win the physical battle in midfield, and disrupt opponents’ build-up.\n\nThe 27-year-old has proven, for club and country, her ability to do those things when the stakes are highest. They will rarely be higher than when Arsenal face Chelsea in the quarter-finals, and — whether on the scoresheet or not — she will be crucial.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

To be fair to Ben Zekri, the Ar Rass outfit ultimately finished a brilliant ninth.\n\nThere was also the successful battle against relegation, and now trademark reaction to that, with Al Okhdood in 2023-24, not to mention similar successes before at Damac, Al Raed and Al Fayha.\n\nAt Al Shabab, Ben Zekri takes charge of a team laying 14th after 21 matches - only six points above the drop zone. And, even though the 2011-12 RSL champions won successive games late last month, they’ve lost their past two: at Al Kholood and then Friday’s 5-2 home defeat to Al Ahli.\n\nSo, no doubt looking over their shoulders, Al Shabab acted. And, in Ben Zekri, they’ve certainly given themselves the best opportunity to steer clear of the relegation dogfight.\n\n“Thanks to God, I am very happy to be here,” Ben Zekri told the club’s official channel upon his appointment. “This is a very old club, a club with a long history... I'm very happy to be in charge of such a club.\"\n\n\"I'm always committed to work. The Roshn Saudi League is a strong league - I must do a great job in it.”\n\nBen Zekri’s first assignment at Al Shabab feels especially apt: on Friday, they travel to Abha to face Damac, the team one place below them in the standings.",

    "fullText": "Cole Palmer’s friend says he will get the player back ‘home’ to his favourite team, suggesting it’s Manchester United.\n\nI’m sure Palmer will not be too grateful to his pal for writing this on his Instagram account this week, after Palmer first initially shared a photo of the two of them.\n\nI’m sure this story does not need any more fuel added to it, so Palmer will not be too pleased with his buddy for stoking this fire up.\n\nPalmer has been linked with United a lot in recent times, even though some have done their best to squash this story. It seems pretty clear that the rumours and links are just not going to go away.\n\nAs you can see above, Palmer’s friend, known as ‘Tunde’ on Instagram, posted the image along with the comment:\n\n‘1 day i will get CP to UTD back home where he belongs. Go ask him who his favourite team is.’\n\nWell, Tunde, I’m not sure whether you, or United, would be able to afford the massive fee that it would take to even make Chelsea think about selling Cole Palmer, who has a long contract at the club. Have you got a spare £180m perhaps!?\n\nReece James had a really nice interview today with Chelsea where he spoke a little about growing up in a football crazy family.\n\nLiam Rosenior’s bond with his players is becoming clear, and in particular his bond with Andrey Santos is notable.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

    "fullText": "A deal seeing any Liverpool player head to Old Trafford, or vice versa, has always felt unlikely but links between Mac Allister and Manchester United persist anyway.\n\nThe Argentine has been a regular at Anfield since his arrival and his father, Carlos, has now had his say on the current transfer speculation.\n\n“Alexis is only thinking about Liverpool at the moment,” Mac Allister’s father told Winwin. “We are waiting for an offer to renew his contract. We'll see what the club's plan is.”\n\nThe 27-year-old is under contract until 2028, so a renewal won’t have been a priority for Liverpool heading into this season, but the interest from Manchester United could force the club’s hand.\n\nMac Allister’s midfield partner Dominik Szoboszlai is also in line for a renewed deal on improved terms before the summer, and that deal could also shape Mac Allister’s demands.\n\nWhen asked if the player would consider a move if no contract offer arrives, Carlos Mac Allister said: “We'll wait and see what happens in terms of the renewal. That's all.”",

    "description": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat",
    "fullText": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US quietly funded a global effort to keep the internet from splintering into fiefdoms run by authoritarian governments. Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.\n\nManaged by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including $94m in 2024.\n\nThen came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won a lawsuit to get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration is now appealing against that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration this January withdrew from the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.\n\nThe cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.\n\n“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”\n\n“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects for Internet Freedom.\n\nTo report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.\n\nThe US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.\n\nThe purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.\n\nThe US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.\n\nThey also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.\n\nAnother technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.\n\nThe soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.\n\n“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”\n\n“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.\n\nTheir makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”\n\nMost recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them. Censorship regimes are getting worse worldwide.\n\n“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\nSome of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.\n\nOthers say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.\n\n“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies have exported sophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic – to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.\n\nSeveral recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.\n\nThe cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.",

    "description": "China's humanoid robots performed kung fu on national TV, stunning viewers with how quickly the technology has advanced.",
    "fullText": "China didn't just celebrate Lunar New Year this week. It staged a robotics flex.\n\nAt the annual Spring Festival Gala, the Lunar New Year show in China, humanoid robots from Chinese startup Unitree Robotics flipped, lunged, and swung swords and nunchucks just feet from child performers in a tightly choreographed kung fu routine.\n\nIn one sequence inspired by \"drunken boxing,\" a traditional Chinese martial arts style, the robots staggered, fell backward, then rose again — showcasing advances in control and coordination.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons to last year's broadcast, which featured Unitree humanoid robots performing a Chinese folk dance. The choreography then was noticeably simpler.\n\nThe gala, often likened to the US Super Bowl for its massive audience, also featured other Chinese robotics firms, including MagicLab, Galbot, and Noetix, in separate segments throughout the broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nReactions on Chinese social media showed viewers being struck by how quickly the technology has advanced.\n\nOn RedNote, a user who goes by Ma Xiao said in a video posted on Wednesday that during last year's performance, the robots were only \"doing very simple things.\"\n\n\"Now, they're doing kung fu, they're doing flips, they're doing synchronized dancing,\" he said. \"Everybody's shocked.\"\n\n\"Now the rest of the world knows what China's speed is,\" he added.\n\nAnother RedNote user, DKKD, posted a video of friends reacting to the performance on Tuesday, captioning it: \"Three Americans were scared by the Spring Festival robot.\"\n\n\"They were all shocked by the robot's level of evolution (including me),\" the user wrote.\n\nOne viewer in the video can be heard saying: \"It's way more impressive than last year. It's crazy.\"\n\nUnitree CEO Wang Xingxing said in an interview with Chinese media following the gala that the company expects to ship up to 20,000 humanoid robots this year, up from about 5,500 in 2025.\n\nGlobal shipments of humanoid robots could reach \"tens of thousands\" this year, with Unitree potentially contributing between 10,000 and 20,000 units, Wang said on Tuesday.\n\nChinese companies developing humanoid robots and autonomous systems are racing to outdo global rivals.\n\nIn September, Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, unveiled R1, a humanoid robot that drew comparisons to Tesla's Optimus. Two months later, EV and robotics maker XPeng introduced the latest version of its humanoid, Iron, which the company described as \"highly human-like.\"\n\nChina's elite universities are also moving to build talent for the sector. In November, China's Ministry of Education issued a notice stating that top institutions are preparing to launch a new undergraduate major in \"embodied intelligence,\" a field that combines AI with robotics.\n\nStill, China's rapid push into robotics hasn't been seamless.\n\nXPeng's Iron fell face-first during its first public appearance in China earlier this year. Its CEO, He Xiaopeng, later wrote on Chinese social media that the mishap was part of \"learning to walk.\"\n\nLast month, a Unitree humanoid kicked an engineer in the groin during a test. Humanoid robots stumbled and fell while racing against humans in a half-marathon in Beijing in April last year.",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a landmark trial about social media addiction. Parents who attended hope the 'tide will turn' against Big Tech.",
    "fullText": "Lori Schott, a mother from rural Colorado, said she stared down Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he walked into court in Los Angeles on Wednesday to testify in a landmark trial regarding social media addiction.\n\nSchott lost her 18-year-old daughter, Annalee, to suicide in 2020. She believes the content Annalee saw on social media platforms \"destroyed\" her mental health.\n\n\"I made eye contact with him for quite a long time,\" Schott said of Zuckerberg. \"I was not backing down.\"\n\nSchott is not a plaintiff in the case where Zuckerberg testified on Wednesday, but is among more than 2,000 individuals who have similar personal injury lawsuits pending regarding social media addiction and harm.\n\nThe case underway in Los Angeles centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. It is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media harm, like Schott's, could play out.\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, was named as a defendant alongside Google-owned YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat. TikTok and Snapchat both settled the lawsuit out of court.\n\nLast month, Meta warned investors that its mounting legal battles over youth safety could \"significantly impact\" its 2026 financial results. Attorneys for more than 100,000 individual arbitration claimants have \"sent mass arbitration demands relating to 'social media addiction'\" since late 2024, the company said in a 2026 10-K, which warned that potential damages in certain cases could reach into the \"high tens of billions of dollars.\"\n\nIn a statement, Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, said: \"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\" Otway highlighted changes the company has made over the past decade, including Teen Accounts, which give parents tools to manage their teens' accounts.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. A Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement: \"The Parties are pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, parents showed up hours before the courthouse opened in hopes of getting a seat inside. Many of them had personal stories about how they believed social media use harmed their children.\n\n\"We face a lot of stigma from people telling us we're bad parents,\" said Amy Neville, another parent who attended to show her support. She said that once the evidence comes out in the trial, she believes \"the tide will turn, and the general public will be on board with us.\"\n\n\"It is by design that social media is tearing their family apart,\" Neville said.\n\nOn the stand, Zuckerberg said that teens represent less than 1% of Meta's ad revenue and that most teens don't have disposable income, so it's not especially valuable to advertisers to reach them.\n\nZuckerberg said it's in Meta's best interest to create a platform that inspires people and makes them want to stick around for the long term.\n\n\"If people aren't happy with a service, eventually over time they'll stop using it and use something better,\" he said.\n\nSarah Gardner said that regardless of the outcome of the trial, she hopes it raises awareness about how the social media companies, and specifically Zuckerberg, have been operating. Gardner is the CEO of the Heat Initiative, an advocacy group that pressures Big Tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids. She was at the courthouse with the parents who believe they have been affected.\n\nGardner said she's hopeful the trial will empower more people to say, \"I don't want to be on Instagram anymore.\"",

They added that JetBlue was working with federal authorities to investigate the incident.\n\nData from the aircraft-tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the plane, an Airbus A320, making a circular loop in the air above Newark.\n\nIt departed from Newark at 5:30 p.m. E.T., 45 minutes later than its scheduled departure time, and returned about 20 minutes later.\n\nThere have been several instances of flights in the US making emergency landings because of smoke in recent years.\n\nIn November, a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong was forced to return to SFO. The airline said that the flight crew had detected a \"burning rubber smell in the cabin,\" and it returned to address the issue.\n\nLast February, a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Columbia, South Carolina, was forced to return after just 10 minutes in the air.\n\nCommunications between the pilot and air traffic control staff captured the Delta pilot saying, \"Got smoke in the cabin and need to plan a return back. Have the fire trucks roll for us, please.\"\n\nAnd in October 2024, a Frontier Airlines flight with nearly 200 people on board, arriving from San Diego, caught fire upon landing in Las Vegas. A video from an onlooker on X showed the plane's right engine aflame as it slowed to a halt.\n\nRepresentatives for the Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Sarah McLachlan, 58, says she had to rethink how she was parenting her daughter to rebuild their bond.\n\n\"I would have been softer on her in a different way. I was a hard ass,\" McLachlan told Amy Poehler on Tuesday's episode of \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\n\nMcLachlan shares two daughters with ex-husband Ashwin Sood: India Ann, born in 2002, and Taja Summer, born in 2007.\n\n\"It's funny because I thought so clearly in my own mind that I was being the antithesis of my mother. And I looked at the way she parented, and I thought, 'I'm going to do everything completely different,'\" McLachlan said. \"Then her words come spewing out of your mouth in a moment of anger and frustration, and you're like, 'Oh my God, I can't believe I did that.'\"\n\nShe said her older daughter would sometimes shut down or lash out when things got hard, and at the time, McLachlan didn't fully understand what was behind it.\n\n\"I looked at that and went, 'How do I help you with this? How do we move past this, because the world out there is scary and big, and you have to have some grit, and you have to do hard things so that you know you can,'\" McLachlan said, describing the tough approach she took with her daughter.\n\nIt was only after they went to family counseling that she realized her daughter was experiencing a lot of anxiety.\n\n\"The way I was communicating to her was just making her feel shitty about herself instead of building her up, which was completely the opposite of what I thought I was doing,\" McLachlan said.\n\n\"I had to eat a lot of humble pie and take stock and go, 'OK, look, I want a relationship with my kid. So, I need to learn how to communicate differently with her,'\" she said.\n\nThrough the process, she said her daughter also learned how to take responsibility for her own reactions.\n\n\"It was a long process, but it was beautiful and powerful. And we have such an open, loving relationship now because of that,\" McLachlan said.\n\nThis isn't the first time McLachlan has spoken about her relationship with her firstborn. In August, she told Variety that the chapter of their relationship inspired the second single, \"Gravity,\" on her latest album, released last year.\n\n\"It feels really sweet to be able to sing this song and know that we're in such a better place, having come through this really challenging time together,\" she said.\n\nIn September, McLachlan told People that therapy gave her a \"safe environment\" to connect with her daughter.\n\n\"What I realized is the way I was communicating my love to her, she was not hearing it, not feeling it,\" McLachlan said. \"I was not reaching her. And for me as a parent, that's devastating because you just want to take your kid in your arms and hold them and keep them in.\"\n\nIndia Sood did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Mere days into her week-long guest-cohosting gig on The View, reality star Savannah Chrisley has already been shut down by the permanent panelists over a false claim she made about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe moment came at the top of Wednesday's broadcast, as the cohosts led the show's Hot Topics discussion about Ocasio-Cortez's heavily criticized handling of a question about Taiwan at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 13.\n\nAs Joy Behar countered pushback to AOC's response — which included the New York congresswoman pausing for several moments during the scattered reply — she urged critics to focus on Donald Trump's multiple on-camera mishaps instead: \"Check him out before you start attacking AOC,\" the 83-year-old quipped.\n\n\"Mispronouncing a word is totally different than not knowing your position on Taiwan. What's important is how you recover from something. Trump, he's done things, and then he's continued on with his speech, and then continued on to meet with world leaders. So, the recovery is what matters, and AOC just didn't have a recovery,\" the Chrisley Knows Best personality said, while Behar stressed, \"He does it over and over again, how about the quantity?\"\n\nModerator Whoopi Goldberg replied to Chrisley by stressing that Trump \"is the president,\" and that she can put up with fumbled answers \"from congresspeople\" because in that case \"that's on you.\" But, she \"can't take it from the guy who says he's the leader of the free world.\"\n\nStill, Chrisley dug in, claiming, \"I understand that wholeheartedly. AOC, though, is also the Democrats' pick for the next election.\"\n\nThe panel quickly pushed back at Chrisley's assessment, with Goldberg and Sara Haines shaking their heads while the Oscar-winning Ghost actress repeated, \"No, no, no!\" while Behar added, \"You better tell that to Gavin Newsom!\"\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nLegal expert Sunny Hostin then elaborated, pointing out that Ocasio-Cortez has \"made it pretty clear that she's not running for president\" in 2028.\n\nOcasio-Cortez recently maintained that she's not entering the 2028 race for president following Trump's second term, stressing to the New York Times that she attended the conference in Munich \"not because I’m running for president, not because I’ve made some kind of decision about a horse race or a candidacy, but because we need to sound the alarm bells that a lot of those folks in nicely pressed suits in that room will not be there much longer if we do not do something about the runaway inequality that is fueling far-right populist movements.\"\n\nChrisley is at the Hot Topics table through the week, filling in for fellow conservative personality Alyssa Farah Griffin, who temporarily departed the show last week after the birth of her first son.\n\nOther guest panelists slated to sit in Griffin's seat during her maternity leave include Amanda Carpenter, Sheryl Underwood, comedian Whitney Cummings, and former View cohost Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who publicly slammed Behar and the show in early 2025.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Bill Gates pulled out of India's AI Impact Summit hours before his scheduled keynote address on Thursday, dealing another blow to a flagship event already marred by organisational ‌lapses, a robot row and delegate complaints over traffic disruptions.\n\nGates' absence, followed by another high-profile cancellation by Nvidia's Jensen Huang, ‌adds to a difficult opening for a summit billed as the first major artificial intelligence forum in the Global South, where India has sought to position itself ​as a leading voice in worldwide AI governance.\n\nThe Gates Foundation said the billionaire will not deliver his address \"to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities\". Only days ago, the foundation had dismissed rumours of his absence and insisted he was on track to attend.\n\nGates' cancellation comes after the U.S. Department of Justice released emails last month that included communication between late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and ‌the Gates Foundation's staff.\n\nGates has said the relationship ⁠was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and that it was a mistake for him to meet Epstein.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi called for children's safety on AI platforms as he addressed the gathering on Thursday, alongside French ⁠President Emmanuel Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.\n\n\"We must be even more vigilant about children’s safety. Just as a school syllabus is curated, the AI space should also be child- and family-guided,\" Modi said, after standing on stage with top AI executives ​and ​posing for photographs with their arms raised in a show of strength.\n\nHowever, ​India's first major AI summit has been marred by ‌management lapses that have left attendees shocked and angry over what they described as a lack of planning by the Indian government.\n\nThe summit exhibition halls were shut to the public on Thursday in a surprise move that led to more anger among participating companies that had put up stalls and pavilions.\n\nThe venue compound was largely deserted after three days of large crowds at the event.\n\nOn Wednesday, Indian university Galgotias was asked to vacate its stall after a staff member presented a commercially available robotic dog made in China ‌as its own creation, sparking a public uproar.\n\nPolice shut roads to give preference ​to VIP movement at the summit, creating chaos in the city of 20 million ​people.\n\nOn Wednesday, footage on social media showed scores of ​attendees at the summit walking for miles in central Delhi as roads were shut for traffic, with no ‌availability of taxis and no shuttle services arranged.\n\nReposting one such ​video, opposition leader Mahua Moitra wrote ​on X that the poor management had besmirched India’s reputation globally.\n\nStill, there has been more than $100 billion of investment in India AI projects pledged during the summit, including from the Adani Group conglomerate, tech giant Microsoft, and data centre firm Yotta.\n\nThe Indian ​government has said it expects total pledges ‌to exceed $200 billion in the next two years, although analysts have warned the rapid build-out risks straining India's power grid ​and water supply.",

    "fullText": "Luxury fashion may portray an image of glamor and exclusivity, but not all that glitters is gold.\n\nBehind the more than five-figure price tags and highly coveted brand names, the industry has struggled with declining sales and cautious consumer spending amid ongoing economic uncertainty.\n\nFounded in 1963, Kering is the French multinational luxury goods group behind some of the most recognizable high-end houses, including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen.\n\nDespite being the world's second-largest luxury group, with revenue of €14.7 billion ($17.38 billion) in 2025, Kering has faced mounting pressure in recent years. Leadership changes, shifting consumer preferences, and broader industry headwinds have challenged its performance.\n\nNow, the company is preparing to embark on a major transformation that will reshape its entire business.\n\nKering (PPRUY) shuttered 133 stores across its brands in 2025, representing a net reduction of 75 units, and bringing its total store count to 1,719 as of December 31. The company said during an earnings call that the closures targeted underperforming locations that no longer aligned with its strategy to increase sales and elevate brand positioning.\n\nAn additional 100 store closures are already scheduled worldwide, with further reductions under review. Gucci is expected to account for the largest share of those cuts.\n\nAsia-Pacific: 42\n\nKering said this move aimed to reinforce its operational discipline while protecting its brand, delivering a higher-quality retail footprint.\n\nThe company also reduced its inventory by 8% in 2025 and plans to trim it further in 2026 to lower costs and better meet consumer demand.\n\nThe closures come amid Kering's declining financial performance.\n\nFor the full year of 2025, total revenues fell 13% year over year and 10% on a comparable basis. Gucci, the group's largest and most influential brand, suffered the biggest decrease, with revenue down 22% and 19% on a comparable basis, according to its latest earnings report.\n\n\"These results are not where we want to be, but they mark the bottom and the first steps of the turnaround we have initiated,\" said Kering Senior Analyst Luca Solca in the earnings call.\n\nTo reignite growth, Kering plans to reduce its dependence on fashion while expanding into other high-potential luxury categories.\n\n\"This discipline is precisely what provides a healthy financial foundation to fund our comeback,\" said Kering CFO Armelle Poulou in the earnings call. \"To support our brands, we continue to invest selectively in key areas while maintaining strict cost control in others.\"\n\nIn October 2025, Kering agreed to sell its beauty division to L'Oréal for $4.7 billion, granting it a 50-year exclusive licensing agreement, expected to take effect in the first half of 2026, according to a company press release.\n\nBoth companies are also forming a joint venture focused on luxury, wellness, and longevity, aiming to accelerate innovation in fragrance and cosmetics for its major luxury Houses, a space they view as high-growth and high-value in the long term.\n\n\"This partnership allows us to focus on what defines us best: the creative power and desirability of our Houses,\" said Kering CEO Luca de Meo in the press release.\n\nBeyond beauty, Kering sees jewelry as a resilient and underdeveloped opportunity within its portfolio. Though currently a small contributor to the group's revenue, the category has withstood the broader luxury downturn better than fashion.\n\nTo strengthen its capabilities, Kering acquired Raselli Farco at the end of last year and plans to continue investing in this sector. The company will share its full jewelry strategy in more detail at Capital Markets Day in April.\n\nKering's leadership team repeatedly emphasized creativity as the foundation of the turnaround.\n\n\"Creativity is our North Star,\" said Solca in the earnings call. \"It is what sets luxury apart. But creativity only becomes value when execution follows at the same pace: in retail, in supply chain, in merchandising, in marketing. This is where we are putting our energy into.\"\n\nSolca added that, on the ground, Kering's products are reconnecting with consumers. The company saw sales improvements in the second half of 2025, suggesting early signs of stabilization.\n\n\"The momentum is real: early, fragile, but real. And I can guarantee you that we will build on it,\" said Solca.\n\nKering is not the only company struggling; fashion has been navigating a persistent slump over the past few years.\n\nMcKinsey & Company's State of Fashion 2026 Report projects low-single-digit growth for the global fashion industry in 2026. Macroeconomic volatility and tariff pressures are expected to continue shaping value-conscious consumer behavior, particularly in the U.S., where consumer sentiment remained low throughout 2025.\n\n\"In the end, 2026 will likely be another year of dislocation for fashion companies,\" said McKinsey & Company Fashion Retail Analysts.\n\nGlobal retailer closes 132 stores across several brands\n\nBad Bunny’s bargain outfit breaks Super Bowl fashion tradition\n\n159-year-old retail giant announces more store closures\n\nMost recently, luxury retailer Saks Global also disclosed plans to close an additional nine stores following the shutdown of hundreds of locations and its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY), the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate, also faced headwinds, with revenues declining 5% for the full year of 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, e-commerce continues expanding its share of consumer spending.\n\nWith 84.3% of Americans shopping online, U.S. e-commerce spending reached $1.34 trillion in 2024 and is projected to surpass $2.5 trillion in 2030, according to Capital One Shopping.\n\nStill, physical stores remain the dominant preferred format for most consumers, accounting for around $14.4 trillion of total retail sales of $18.9 trillion in 2025, according to Euromonitor research gathered by EY.\n\n\"It's clear that the physical store still plays an important role,\" said EY Retail Analysts Malin Andrée and Jon Copestake. \"Not only do stores have plenty of runway left in delivering revenue, but they also have opportunities to drive new growth and alternative revenue streams and, by working in tandem with digital channels, they can maximize returns on investment.\"\n\nDespite its turnaround efforts, Kering's shares have dropped 9.25% year to date as of February 17. The stock currently carries a consensus \"hold\" rating from Wall Street analysts tracked by MarketBeat.\n\nRecently, the company underwent significant leadership changes. In September 2025, Luca de Meo replaced longtime CEO François-Henri Pinault, and creative director roles at its top three fashion houses, including Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Bottega Veneta, have also shifted.\n\n\"Kering has changed designers across its three main brands simultaneously, a risky move given the group's reliance on figures like [Deputy CEO] Francesca Bellettini, who holds significant sway over appointments and brand direction,\" said Third Bridge Luxury Apparel Analyst Yanmei Tang to Fashion Dive.\n\n\"This top-heavy approach often leads to reactive, short-term decisions aimed at plugging immediate gaps.\"\n\nGucci is Kering's largest brand, accounting for 45% of its total revenue. For years, the company has relied on its performance, leaving it vulnerable to fluctuations.\n\nIn 2025 alone, Kering appointed Francesca Bellettini as the new Gucci CEO in September, and Demna took over as the creative director in July.\n\n\"Creative transitions take time, and the retail environment has not been supportive,\" said Carrara Advisory Industry experts. \"Consumer sentiment in China weakened. U.S. aspirational buyers pulled back. European tourism shifted. This confluence of factors placed Gucci in a vulnerable position.\"",

    "fullText": "Friday night went dark for more than 11,000 households in Myrtle Beach when some Santee Cooper customers lost power for more than an hour.\n\nDespite a release from the city shared on Facebook, which said the outage was a result of several transformers blowing out at the Santee Cooper facility on North Oak Street, the electricity provider maintains a different issue was responsible.\n\n“No transformers ever blew,” said Santee Cooper public relations specialist Tracy Vreeland. “There was one broken insulator.”\n\nAn insulator connection on a transmission pole was corroded, likely from salt air, and broke, according to Santee Cooper.\n\n“This insulator broke, the wire fell down onto another wire, and so that’s why it ended up being as widespread as it was,” Vreeland said.\n\nAlthough the city’s release said both Santee Cooper and City of Myrtle Beach Public Works teams “were working” to get power back, the city wasn’t involved in restoration efforts.\n\nSantee Cooper was able to restore power only after locating the damaged insulator.\n\n“Once we could pinpoint where the problem was, we were able to get in there and change it out and bring everybody back on, but we didn’t know exactly where the outage had occurred, so that was what took us so long,” said Vreeland.\n\nSeparate from power restoration, city staff directed traffic at major intersections, adjusted traffic lights on side streets to flashing lights and kept sewage pump stations operating.",

    "description": "A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested",
    "fullText": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested during its immigration crackdown to mandatory detention.\n\nU.S. District ‌Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, vacated the decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals after finding the ‌administration had failed to comply with her earlier order declaring unlawful the underlying policy of denying detainees the chance to seek release on bond.\n\nSykes' Wednesday ruling, ​in a class action lawsuit that covers migrants nationwide, is more sweeping than decisions by hundreds of other U.S. judges holding the policy is unlawful and ordering detainees to be freed or given bond hearings.\n\nSykes, appointed by former Democratic President Joe Biden, called the administration's actions \"shameless\" and accused it of trying to continue its \"campaign of illegal action\" by still refusing bond hearings despite her prior ruling.\n\n\"Respondents ‌have far crossed the boundaries of constitutional ⁠conduct,\" Sykes wrote.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice, which oversees the board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSykes' ruling means the board's decision can ⁠no longer be used by immigration judges to deny bond hearings, said Niels Frenzen, a professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law who represented the plaintiffs.\n\n\"We hope that DHS and the immigration courts will now comply with the court's orders to ​provide ​bond hearings to the thousands of noncitizens who have been arrested,\" he ​said in a statement.\n\nFederal immigration law prescribes mandatory ‌detention for \"applicants for admission\" to the United States, while their cases proceed in immigration courts and they are ineligible for bond hearings.\n\nBucking a long-standing interpretation of the law, the DHS last year - as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown - took the position that non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a decision ‌in September that adopted that interpretation, leading to immigration judges nationally employed ​by the department to mandate detention.\n\nSykes in a ruling in December declared ​the DHS policy unlawful but stopped short of vacating ​the board's decision.\n\nBut she said it was clear further relief was needed after Chief Immigration Judge Teresa ‌Riley issued guidance instructing her colleagues that they ​are not bound by Sykes' ruling ​and that they should continue following the board's decision.\n\nThose immigration judges are employed by the Justice Department.\n\nSykes, in Wednesday's decision, criticized DHS for repeatedly and inaccurately suggesting that operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were limited to targeting ​criminal non-citizens who were the \"worst of the ‌worst.\"\n\n\"Maybe that phrase merely mirrors the severity and ill-natured conduct by the government,\" Sykes wrote. \"Even though these press ​releases might contain an inkling of truth, they ignore a greater, more dire reality.\"",

    "fullText": "With no Henri Veesaar or Caleb Wilson in the starting lineup, the Tar Heels need contributions from virtually everyone else on their roster.\n\nWe're not talking about Zayden High or Jarin Stevenson, who are doing a respectable job filling in down low. In the case of this story, we're looking at North Carolina's backcourt.\n\nDuring UNC's lopsided, 82-58 loss at NC State on Tuesday night, the backcourt struggled mightily. Luka Bogavac, who the Tar Heels recruited for his international experience, sweet shot and ability to pour in 15 points on any given night, scored just nine points against the Wolfpack.\n\nSeth Trimble, North Carolina's captain and senior guard, contributed just four points on 1-of-9 shooting – and two made free throws. This continues a recent hot-and-cold stretch for Trimble, who scored 19 points against Pitt, just four at Miami (FL) and 16 vs. Duke.\n\nDerek Dixon struggled with his shot the most of any UNC backcourt member, making just two of 12 attempts, while Jonathan Powell and Jaydon Young combined for 14 points off the bench. Kyan Evans took just two shots in 15 minutes, while Isaiah Denis played two minutes.\n\nPost production is how the 2025-26 Tar Heels get most of their scoring, a stark contrast from 2024-25, which featured a guard-heavy lineup and undersized big men. North Carolina has plenty of talented guards on its current team, but they have to play consistently for team victories.\n\nI'm not talking every UNC guard scoring 10+ points on a given night, though that is a dream. Whether assists, taking better care of the basketball, getting higher-percentage looks or something else, guard play will dictate the Tar Heels' success, particularly as they face extensive roster injuries.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball: Guards have to play consistent for additional wins",

    "description": "Finnish scoring sensation Jesse Kiiskinen eyes a North American pro debut. Could his dynamic talent ignite the Griffins' playoff push?",
    "fullText": "The Grand Rapids Griffins may be getting some reinforcements soon, as one of the team’s quietly rising prospects could be on the verge of making the jump to professional hockey in North America. Finnish forward Jesse Kiiskinen, currently playing in Finland’s Liiga, may finally be heading to the Griffins as the Finnish season nears its conclusion.\n\nKiiskinen was acquired by the Detroit Red Wings in June 2024, along with a second-round pick, in exchange for defense prospect Andrew Gibson. While initially considered a quiet addition, Kiiskinen quickly emerged as a notable name in the Red Wings’ prospect pipeline following a breakout 2024–25 season. He recorded 44 points in 46 games with HPK, demonstrating a natural scoring touch that caught the attention of fans and scouts alike.\n\nKiiskinen also made an impact on the international stage, representing Finland at the World Junior Championships. In seven games, he tallied six goals and one assist, underscoring his potential as a dynamic offensive presence.\n\nJesse Kiiskinen \nGoal🚨 on the power play#LGRW pic.twitter.com/U636I9lzsd\n\n— Red Wings Prospects (@LGRWProspects) February 17, 2026\n\nThis season, Kiiskinen has been less prolific, posting 24 points in 45 games, but scouts and analysts note that while his scoring ability remains, the broader aspects of his game are still developing. With HPK sitting outside the playoff picture with a 14-6-8-23 record, and just nine regular-season games left through March 17, the timing could allow Kiiskinen to make the jump to North America.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Detroit Red Wings team site to stay connected to the latest news, game-day coverage, and player features.\n\nThe Griffins’ season extends until April 19, which opens the possibility for Kiiskinen to join the team for a few games before the season concludes. Such a move would provide a glimpse into how the Red Wings’ trade for Gibson might ultimately be evaluated.\n\nJesse Kiiskinen GOAL🚨 rips it past Trey Augustine. Prospect on prospect crime. #LGRW pic.twitter.com/Xiimc3zAj7\n\n— Red Wings Prospects (@LGRWProspects) January 6, 2025\n\nGibson, who made his professional debut this past season, posted seven points and a plus-three rating in 44 games with the Milwaukee Admirals, part of the Nashville Predators organization.\n\nAdding Kiiskinen could inject some excitement into the Griffins’ roster late in the year to hopefully help sustain their epic run this season while giving the young Finnish winger valuable North American experience.\n\nNever miss a story by adding us to your Google News favorites!\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "Cade Smith will not be competing in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, instead focusing on the Cleveland Guardians' upcoming season.",
    "fullText": "Three years ago, before Cade Smith made his Major League debut or even threw a pitch for the Cleveland Guardians, he had the opportunity to compete for his home country of Canada in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n\nSince then, Cade has established himself as one of the best high-leverage relievers in MLB, and for the first time in his career, enter the season as Cleveland’s closer.\n\nHowever, Smith is not playing for Team Canada in the 2026 WBC. It was a decision that he recently told Foul Territory was his own as he heads into\n\n“It was my decision [to not play in the WBC], Cade said.\n\n“In ‘23, it was a phenomenal experience. Like, that was my first experience pitching in major league stadiums in front of sold-out crowds and that kind of environment. I had so much fun and enjoyed that. So, just this year, being at, kind of where things are architecturally, I didn't feel that it was wise for me to take that time away. I wanted to make sure that I was here and completely present and focused on the year coming up.”\n\nThe 2026 season will be Smith’s last year on a minimum MLB contract before his arbitration eligibility next winter. Considering that through his first two years, Smith has a 2.42 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, and 17 saves under his belt, he is in line for quite a large payday, even in his first year in the arbitration process.\n\nThat inevitable payday is contingent on one thing, though: health.\n\nSmith has pitched in 150 games through his first two big-league seasons. That’s a heavy workload for any pitcher in MLB, let alone one with an average fastball velocity of 96.4 mph.\n\nIt’s hard to blame Cade if he didn’t want to compete in the WBC because of this high workload, and solely focus on the upcoming season.\n\nPerhaps three years from now, in the 2029 WBC, Cade will get another chance to rep Candada, but for now, he’s concentrated on the Guardians.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "After Iowa women's basketball's (20-5, 11-3 Big Ten) two victories over Washington (65-56) and Nebraska (80-67) this past week, the Hawkeyes have held onto their previous ranking in the latest USA TODAY Sports Women's College Basketball Coaches Poll.\n\nIn the Hawkeyes' win over the Huskies, sophomore guard Chit-Chat Wright carried the offense behind her 21 points on 6-for-13 shooting, 5-for-8 from 3-point territory, and 4-for-5 from the free-throw line in her 38 minutes of action. Senior forward Hannah Stuelke also notched her seventh double-double of the season and the 18th of her career with 14 points and 16 rebounds.\n\nAgainst the Cornhuskers, sophomore center Avav Heiden dominated en route to a career-high-tying 27 points on 12-for-15 from the floor and 3-for-3 from the charity stripe, along with to go along with her 11 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 blocks, and 1 steal. As a result, this was the 6-foot-4 Sherwood, Ore., native's sixth double-double of the season. Sophomore guard Taylor Stremlow also added a career-high 17 points on top of Heiden's sensational effort.\n\nDespite the wins this past week, Iowa remains at the No. 12 spot in this week's Coaches Poll.\n\nIn addition to Iowa, six other Big Ten squads are within the updated Top 25. NO. 2 UCLA leads the group, followed by No. 5 Michigan, No. 10 Ohio State, No. 15 Maryland, No. 16 Michigan State, and No. 23 Minnesota.\n\nNebraska is the lone conference representative in the receiving votes category, earning just 1 vote.\n\nIowa will have two matchups this week to improve its standing in the next Coaches Poll, as the Hawkeyes travel to Purdue on Feb. 19, before returning home for \"Senior Day\" against No. 5 Michigan on Feb. 22. Tipoff against the Boilermakers is scheduled for 6 p.m. CT on B1G+, while the clash against the Wolverines is set for 11 a.m. CT on FOX.\n\nHere's a look at the full USA TODAY Sports Women's College Basketball Coaches Poll:\n\nNo. 24 Princeton; No. 25 Iowa State;\n\nIowa State 33; Princeton 23; Rhode Island 17; Washington 12; Richmond 2; Rice 2; Oklahoma State 2; Nebraska 1;\n\nContact/Follow us @HawkeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Iowa news, notes, and opinions. Follow Scout on X: @SpringgateNews\n\nThis article originally appeared on Hawkeyes Wire: Where is Iowa women's basketball ranked in the USA TODAY Coaches Poll?",

    "description": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the […]",
    "fullText": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the place. And with the Minnesota Vikings holding the 18th overall pick, NFL.com’s Daniel Jeremiah believes Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores will scoop a Harrison Smith replacement: Oregon safety Dillon Thieneman.\n\nNFL.com ties Minnesota to Thieneman as the Smith succession plan, signaling a 2026 secondary transition.\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether Smith will retire, but if so, Thieneman might have the juice to fill his shoes.\n\nAnother mock draft for the Vikings — more defense.\n\nJeremiah: Thieneman to Vikings at No. 18\n\nBecause Lewis Cine didn’t pan out and the fact that Smith may indeed retire soon, Minnesota will need a safety for the long haul. Jeremiah thinks Thieneman is the right guy.\n\nHe wrote Tuesday, “After studying Thieneman’s impressive 2025 tape at Oregon, I went back and watched the film from his career at Purdue, where he played in 2023 and ’24. His range and playmaking skills were evident back then, too. He would be an excellent replacement for Harrison Smith.”\n\nJeremiah continued the defensive trend for the Vikings’ spot in mock drafts. Most editions have the club selecting a defensive back or defensive lineman.\n\nThieneman is 6’0 and 200 pounds and will turn 22 in August. He’s known for his versatility at safety, which sounds like a page from the Smith playbook. His ball-tracking is elite for a rookie prospect, and he is known for high football IQ. NFL.com recently compared him to Jevon Holland, a safety for the New York Giants.\n\nA to Z Sports‘ Rob Gregson on Thieneman: “You turn on three years’ worth of tape from Thieneman, and it just gets better and better. After bursting on to the scene as a true freshman in 2023, where he recorded six interceptions, Thieneman then led the Big-10 in tackles in 2024, before doing a little bit of everything for the Ducks in 2025.”\n\n“You’re betting on instincts and explosion with Thieneman. He may not be elite laterally and challenged in terms of his man coverage projection, but if you need a player who can play the high post, poach the middle as a robber, and align as a box safety for a plus one help in the run game, Thieneman is your guy.”\n\nNFL.com’s Lance Zierlein: “Savvy three-year starter with NFL size, speed and alignment versatility. Thieneman is an extension of his defensive coordinator, aligning and adjusting the secondary to motion and pre-snap shifts. He’s an instinctive, rangy safety who can roll down into big nickel or robber positioning.”\n\n“He has a good feel for play design and route concepts in zone but has average change of direction to match breaks in man. He’s not a big thumper near the line, but he rushes into the action with a relentless pursuit that should allow him to keep stacking high scores in the tackle columns. Thieneman checks important boxes for teams looking to add versatile playmakers in the secondary.”\n\nThe 2026 Safeties + a Smith Verdict\n\nIf one pretends that Smith will indeed retire, Minnesota’s safety group would look like this in 2026 with Thieneman:\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, as of February 18th, there’s been no official retirement announcement from Smith, which is a bit odd. He can still call it quits, but with each day that passes, Smith is more likely to return for Year No. 15, especially with Flores back in the saddle as the defensive coordinator.\n\nThieneman ranks No. 37 on the Consensus Big Board at the time of this article’s publication. He might be a 2nd-Round commodity. If the Vikings don’t reach and pick him at No. 18, the team’s draftboard might resemble this, based on the best player available and long-term roster need:\n\nEmmanuel McNeil-Warren (S, Toledo)\n\nKayden McDonald (DT, Ohio State)\n\nJordyn Tyson (WR, Arizona State)\n\nThe NFL draft is about nine weeks away. Minnesota has at least nine picks line up this cycle — four more than last year, when the club had a skimpy cupboard due to the expensive Dallas Turner trade in 2024.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEver since we heard the news that Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans will be returning in 2026, but will be exploring his options, naturally, many think that means he will play elsewhere.\n\nOf course, that is entirely true, and it has allowed the thought process to begin about which Super Bowl-contending teams could be interested in his services.\n\nBut for Buccaneers fans, the thought of Evans, a franchise great, not only playing for a different team for the first time in his career, but potentially winning a Super Bowl, isn't something they want to think about.\n\nHowever, Sports Illustrated's Karl Rasmussen offered up one sentence from his piece on Evans' landing spots that might soothe the nerves.\n\n\"Just because Evans is going to explore his options in free agency doesn’t mean his departure is inevitable,\" Rasmussen wrote.\n\nMore:Chiefs could pull off incredible free agency move for Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe biggest thing is, does Evans want to return to chase a Super Bowl? Because if so, then his time in Tampa is likely over, as Todd Bowles' team isn't in the hunt right now.\n\nBut if he wants to keep playing football with the franchise that gave him his start, and that he loves with all his heart, along with the locker room, then Tampa Bay wins the tug of war.\n\nWith reports stating Evans is set to meet with the Buccaneers in the coming weeks, there's a chance he remains a Buc in 2026.\n\nBut until that move is made official, the option that he moves on remains a very real possibility.\n\nESPN analyst makes stunning call on future of Chiefs' Travis Kelce\n\nBills face huge $19 million decision on underrated star\n\nPatriots named as potential landing spot for $25 million sack monster\n\n2 huge free agency decisions set to impact Bills' Josh Allen\n\nAnalyst urges Ravens not to make 'stupid' offseason move\n\nAnalyst ripped to shreds over embarrassing Mike Evans Buccaneers Super Bowl take\n\nWill Ravens' Lamar Jackson need Superman cape under new OC?",

    "fullText": "SAN ANTONIO – The Phoenix Suns have emerged from the NBA All-Star break healthy as they have no one listed on their injury report due to an injury.\n\nThe Suns (32-23) face the San Antonio Spurs (38-16) Thursday, Feb. 19, at Moody Center on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin. They are seventh in the Western Conference while the Spurs are second.\n\nGrayson Allen (right knee sprain) and Isaiah Livers (left shoulder sprain) suffered injuries against the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 5 and sat out the next three games going into the NBA All-Star break.\n\nThey were scheduled for a re-evaluation after the break.\n\nThe Suns will be without Dillon Brooks, who will serve a one-game suspension Thursday for picking up his 16th technical foul in a Feb. 11 loss to defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n\"He said I'm playing victim all the time. When I don't play the victim, I'm a bad guy. Choose one.\"\n\nDillon Brooks on a conversation with lead official James Williams during Suns loss to OKC.\n\nNow has 16 technical fouls. If it stands, he'll receive 1-game suspension. #Suns pic.twitter.com/XL1A9QRal0\n\n— Duane Rankin (@DuaneRankin) February 12, 2026\n\n“He knows his technical situation,” Suns general manager Brian Gregory said Feb. 18. “We've had plenty of sit-downs and talks. He also knows how important he is for us to be on the court. So, I think with that, I think he understands exactly where he's at.”\n\nBrooks leads the NBA in technical fouls this season. Each two additional technical fouls will result in a one-game suspension (18th, 20th, 22nd, etc.).\n\nJalen Green isn’t on the injury report as he participated in workouts and improved his conditioning during the All-Star break.\n\n“Yeah, he's in a good spot right now,\" Gregory said. \"You know, injuries, unfortunately, are part of this league, and he's done an unbelievable job. His spirit on a daily basis in terms of attacking the rehab, attacking the recovery, attacking the workouts has been spot on from Day 1.”\n\nGreen has played only seven games this season, mostly due to a right hamstring injury, after playing every game the previous two seasons with the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe explosive 6-4 guard played in two of Phoenix’s last three games before the break after suffering a left hip contusion Jan. 30 against Cleveland that sidelined him three games.\n\nCole Anthony remains listed on the team’s injury report as “not with team.” Sources informed The Arizona Republic last week the Suns were looking to waive Anthony.\n\nThe Suns acquired Amir Coffey and Anthony from the Milwaukee Bucks in a three-team deal sent Nick Richards to the Chicago Bulls and Nigel Hayes-Davis to the Bucks before the Feb. 5 trade deadline.\n\nHave opinions about the current state of the Suns?

    "fullText": "Former Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Cavan Biggio has signed a minor league deal with the Houston Astros.\n\nThe versatile left-handed hitter will join the team in spring training camp as a non-roster player.\n\nThe Astros announced that they have signed Cavan Biggio to a minor league deal pic.twitter.com/D8x0hjSyX8\n\n— FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) February 15, 2026\n\nThe 30-year-old is coming off a season in which he appeared in 37 games for the Kansas City Royals. The Royals had him all over the field, playing first base, second base, third base, two outfield positions and designated hitter.\n\nIn 69 major league at-bats with the Royals, Biggio slahed .174/.296/.246 with a .543 OPS and a 55 OPS+. Biggio also tallied 12 hits along with one home run and four RBIs.\n\nThe seven-year veteran reported to camp on Sunday and spoke about his excitement to get a chance with the Astros.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it was a big dream of mine, but the Astros, I loved that team more than anything growing up,” Cavan said. “Those teams growing up, I could name every player on those teams. This organization has always been very special for me, and it’s an absolute honor to don the uniform now.”\n\nCavan is the son of long-time Astors infielder, Craig Biggio. Craig played his entire 20-year career with the Astros and is the franchise’s leader in games played, at-bats, hits, runs, total bases, doubles and extra-base hits.\n\nCavan was the ball boy when Craig reached 3,000 career hits in 2007, alongside his brother, Conor.\n\n“That last year was something that obviously was truly special for us,” Craig said. “It was something that playing your whole career here with one team and one organization and being able to achieve a milestone like that in front of your fans and in front of your family and having your boys in the dugout as bat boy because they were old enough to do it, it was very special.”\n\nBiggio spent 30 games with the Dodgers in 2024. In 73 at-bats, the Houston native slashed .192/.306/.329 with a .635 OPS. He also recorded 14 hits, three home runs, 10 RBIs and 11 runs in his brief stint in L.A.\n\nHe was released in early August 2024 after he was traded to L.A. from the Toronto Blue Jays in June of that season.",

    "description": "Lars Nootbaar is at the team's spring training complex with his future with the organization in doubt",
    "fullText": "In the last year, almost every established veteran on the St. Louis Cardinals roster has been linked to trade rumors.\n\nThere was fire to a lot of smoke behind those rumors. Closer Ryan Helsley, starting pitcher Sonny Gray, first baseman/catcher Willson Contreras, second baseman Brendan Donovan and third baseman Nolan Arenado have all been dealt by the Cardinals in the last year.\n\nEven for the players who didn't or haven't been traded yet, those rumors haven't gone unnoticed.\n\nOutfielder Lars Nootbaar arrived to the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Fla., on Wednesday. Nootbaar was late reporting to camp due to the team not having a piece of equipment he needed to keep his rehab on schedule.\n\nAccording to a post on \"X\" from Jeff Jones of the Belleville News-Democrat, Nootbaar heard from his representation this offseason about the possibility of being dealt.\n\nDespite the injury and recovery, Nootbaar did acknowledge that he heard consistently from his reps throughout the winter about the possibility of his being moved. So, we’ll see how that works out.\n\n— Jeff Jones (@jmjones) February 18, 2026\n\nIt looks like the potential of being traded is still on the table for Nootbaar, who's currently recovering from surgery to repair a condition in his heels.\n\nNootbaar underwent a procedure in October to correct a condition in both of his heels. He was reportedly dealing with Haglund's deformities, which is a bone deformity that causes pain, enlargement and inflammation.\n\nAccording to Jones' report, Nootbaar has been able to throw and hit but is just getting around to being able to run without aid.\n\nIt's still unclear when Nootbaar will be able to compete in games.\n\nLast season, Nootbaar slashed .234/.325/.361 with a .686 OPS and hit 24 doubles, a triple and 13 home runs with 48 RBIs in 135 games.\n\nNootbaar's games played, hits, RBIs and doubles were all single-season career-highs for the 28-year-old, who made his major league debut in 2021. In the same breath, his on-base percentage, slugging percentage and OPS were all single-season career-lows.\n\nLars Nootbaar makes an UNBELIEVABLE catch in the 9th 😱 pic.twitter.com/7H3QMYGpTX\n\nNootbaar is currently under his second year of arbitration and is set to earn $5.25 million in 2026. He has one more year or arbitration for 2027 before he'll be a free agent ahead of the 2028 season.\n\nSt. Louis has moved on from the aforementioned veterans in efforts of building assets who can contribute and become focal points for the Cardinals' rebuilt roster.\n\nNootbaar is still relatively young and St. Louis will need some veterans to balance out the growing amount of young players who are expected to become faces of the franchise. Time will tell if Nootbaar will be one of those veterans of the future or another player that Cardinals choose to cut ties with.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "Manchester United are gearing up for a huge summer, and, according to the latest reports, INEOS have grand plans in mind.\n\nThe midfield is in the most urgent need of reinforcements, with as many as two additions possible, while the team also needs cover at the back and possibly a left-sided winger.\n\nAll this is going to cost a bomb, and according to The Daily Mail‘s Chris Wheeler, the Red Devils have devised two sets of targets, contingent on where the club finishes at the end of the season.\n\nFinishing within the Champions League places and trimming a bloated wage bill while also getting rid of the deadwood would transform United’s capability in the market.\n\nThe 20-time English league champions could raise as much as £100 million through player sales, with the likes of Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund likely to depart permanently.\n\nThat would hand them greater leeway when it comes to bidding for players and agreeing on wages. United are currently fourth, and with fifth place also good enough to secure entry into Europe’s premier club competition, INEOS will be quietly confident.\n\nIn case things go horribly wrong, the Old Trafford side will struggle to pay top midfield target Elliot Anderson’s wages, handing Manchester City a free run at the Englishman.\n\nINEOS have kept a backup list ready just in case. Hopefully, it does not come to that.\n\n“United’s budget this summer will be night and day depending on whether they qualify for the Champions League,” Wheeler was quoted as saying.\n\n“They’ll effectively be working with two different budgets, two different shopping lists and two completely different plans. If United secure Champions League football and £100m-plus, that would be transformative.\n\n“It would put them back at the top table in terms of the players they can attract and the salaries they can offer. Without a top-four or top-five finish, could United afford to pay Elliott Anderson’s wage demands? I’m not so sure.”\n\nUnited’s Premier League finish will also have a bearing on Michael Carrick‘s future, with Thomas Tuchel currently leading the race.\n\nBut with the squad and club captain backing the caretaker head coach, INEOS will have a tough time denying Carrick the top job if the season aims are met.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "LSU baseball has opened the season 5-0. What has stood out from the Tigers' fast start to the season?",
    "fullText": "BATON ROUGE — The only way LSU baseball could've played more this last handful of days is if it would've played a game Tuesday.\n\nNo. 1 LSU has played every other day since Opening Day on Friday, Feb. 13, working through five games in a six-day span and it came out the busy stretch unscathed. The Tigers (5-0) capped the homestand with a 12-1 run-rule victory over in-state foe Nicholls State at Alex Box Stadium on Wednesday, Feb. 18.\n\nPinch hitter John Pearson ended the game in the eighth with a three-run homer. Junior Jake Brown continued his torrid start to the 2026 season, going 2 for 5 with two RBIs and a run. Trent Caraway hit a first-inning grand slam.\n\nMORE LSU BASEBALL COVERAGE What Jay Johnson, LSU baseball players said after win over Kent State\n\nSenior Zac Cowan earned his first win of the season on the mound while freshman Reagan Ricken picked up the save in his first collegiate appeaance.\n\nWith the first handful of games out of the way for the Tigers, here are three takeaways for LSU as it gets ready to board the plane to Jacksonville, Florida to play Indiana, Notre Dame and UCF in the Jax College Baseball Classic over the weekend.\n\nIt's early, but what Brown is doing at the plate right now is eyebrow-raising. He's smashed four home runs in the first five games — back-to-back two-home run games against Milwaukee and Kent State — and is currently hitting .500 with 12 RBIs and eight runs.\n\nMore times than not, Brown has jumpstarted LSU's offense when it has needed a spark and the lineup is feeding off of his production and timeliness.\n\nThis is Brown's third year starting for the Tigers so his ascension shouldn't be a surprise. But how well he is playing and seeing the ball is scary for opponents.\n\nFor one, the starters outside of Cooper Moore have struggled against Milwaukee, Kent State and Nicholls. That should raise some flags but it is early. Guys like Casan Evans and Zac Cowan have pitched enough at this level that quick turnarounds are expected from them.\n\nBut LSU's starting weekend rotation doesn't seem to be fully nailed down yet. Evans and Moore will be there, but who the third starter will be is the question. Sophomore William Schmidt struck out a lot of batters during his start Sunday, but he also gave up three runs on as many hits with three walks.\n\nLSU's bullpen, however, was a bright spot for coach Jay Johnson and company through the first five games. Deven Sheerin is fully healthy from his ACL tear and has looked masterful. Mavrick Rizy, Cooper Williams, and Gavin Guidry were all unhittable with Guidry picking up a win and a save in two outings.\n\n\"I think pitching we're not totally just dialed just quite yet,\" Johnson said after LSU's win over Nicholls. \"I think we will move closer to it. There's way more positives from the mound than not. It's obviously a deep staff. And that's five games in six days. We're running out (freshman) Reagan Ricken for the last three innings and that guy probably could pitch on Friday.\"\n\nLSU's offense showed this opening stretch how difficult it could be on an opposing dugout. It scored 17 runs with two outs over the course of its first five games.\n\nA number of those run-scoring hits were for extra bases as well, including Trent Carayway's first-inning grand slam Wednesday with two outs. What has stood out is how well the Tigers' approach is with two outs, and especially with runners on and two gone.\n\nIf LSU can continue that trend, it'll be a difficult team to beat moving forward.\n\nCory Diaz covers the LSU Tigers for The Daily Advertiser as part of the USA TODAY Network.

He was the linebackers coach with the Panthers from 2013-17 before going to the Cardinals as the defensive coordinator and assistant head coach.\n\nHolcomb departed Arizona after one season and joined the Browns for one season as its linebackers coach and run game coordinator. He returned to Carolina for three seasons as defensive run game coordinator and then assistant head coach, defense in 2022 before the Panthers fired Matt Rhule, which led to Holcomb being named interim defensive coordinator.",

    "description": "Granlund's Finland surges toward Olympic glory, while Gudas and Dostal's medal hopes end in a thrilling quarterfinal overtime loss.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Olympic Games are coming to an end, as all four men’s hockey quarterfinals were played on Wednesday.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks had three players in action: Lukas Dostal (Czechia), Radko Gudas (Czechia), and Mikael Granlund (Finland). Damian Clara’s Italy squad was eliminated on Tuesday, and Jackson LaCombe was a healthy scratch for the fourth consecutive game for the United States.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas, Dostal Advance with Czechia, Clara Eliminated with Italy\n\nFrank Vatrano Talks Shoulder Injury and Tough Season\n\nWith the way the qualifying games shook out after the preliminary round, Czechia found themselves facing Canada for the second time in five games. They had lost 5-0 to open the tournament and were more prepared to face the gold-medal favorite in the quarterfinals.\n\nAn evenly-played first period saw Czechia take a 2-1 lead into the second period, and Canada handily controlled the majority of possession from there. Behind astute interior defending from Gudas and the blueline, Dostal made a handful of big saves and gave his team a chance to win.\n\nOndrej Palat gave Czechia a 3-2 lead late in the third period, but it was answered by Nick Suzuki four minutes later, and the game was sent to overtime, where Mitch Marner advanced Canada to the semis after a minute and a half of OT.\n\nGudas made his presence felt early and often on the defensive side of the puck, not only by providing his trademark physical play, but with keen anticipation skills that disrupted several Canadian attacks through the neutral zone.\n\nUnfortunately, one of those neutral zone pressures sent Canada captain Sidney Crosby to the locker room for the remainder of the game with a lower-body injury. Gudas stepped up on Crosby, as an outlet in the second period, and Crosby seemingly attempted to dodge the hit, but folded on his right leg in an unfortunate way. No penalty was called on the ice.\n\nGudas had an up-and-down tournament, but saved his best hockey for when it mattered most in today’s game. Gudas finished this game with an assist, a high-skilled play where he picked off a cross-ice neutral zone pass and turned it the other way, starting a 3v2. He also registered two penalty minutes and two shots on goal in 19:57 TOI.\n\nHe finished his second, and what will likely be his last, Olympic Games with a point (an assist) in five games played, but he won’t bring a medal home with him.\n\nMuch like the rest of the tournament and his entire 2025-26 season with the Anaheim Ducks, Dostal played very well. However, “very well” is below the superhuman level he needed to perform at if he was to carry his Czech team to the podium at these Olympics.\n\nAs mentioned, he did enough to earn a win in this game, but he didn’t solely win the game for Czechia. He brought his entire arsenal to this quarterfinal matchup: perfect lateral puck tracking, powerful pushes when pucks moved from the goal line to the slot or dots, and terrific rebound control.\n\nThe element that stood out most this tournament, with Czechia’s suspect blueline as a whole, was his ability to knock down dump-ins and individually start breakouts with pinpoint outlets to his defensemen or wingers up the wall.\n\nDostal finished this game by saving 37 of the 41 shots he faced for a .902 SV%. He finished his first Olympic Games medal-less, sporting a 1-3-0 record, and an .886 SV%.\n\nSwitzerland gave Finland quite the scare, as Switzerland had been one of the more impressive and cohesive teams in this tournament, even without the services of star forward Kevin Fiala. Switzerland got a pair of goals late in the first period of what was a high-intensity back-and-forth affair.\n\nSebastian Aho and MIro Heiskanen dashed the Swiss’s hopes of winning in regulation with a pair of late goals that sent the game to overtime, as the Finnish firepower proved too overwhelming and unrelenting for Switzerland. On the ropes, the Finnish coaching staff threw their forward lines into a blender halfway through the game with hopes of igniting a comeback, and they were eventually rewarded.\n\nFinland captain and Ducks’ forward Mikael Granlund started the game in the spot where he started the tournament: on the left wing of Roope Hintz and opposite Mikko Rantanen. As lines were tinkered with, he played with Sebastian Aho and Tuevo Teravainen for a stretch in the second, and played most of the third with Hintz and Kaapo Kakko. It will be curious to monitor how the lines shake out for Finland’s all-important semi-final game against Canada on Friday.\n\nHe was mostly a non-factor on the top line, but provided linemates with steady defensive habits, typically as an F3. When lines began to mix, he earned more puck touches, made several connecting plays to advance pucks up ice, and displayed elite edges multiple times when breaking down defenders along the offensive wall.\n\nGranlund finished this game scoreless with four shots on goal in 20:12 TOI, third-most among Finnish forwards.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Dostal, Gudas, Czechia Drop Overtime Game to Switzerland, LaCombe Scratched for Third Straight\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Granlund's Finland Dismantles Clara's Italy, LaCombe Scratched for USA\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas Defeats France with Czechia, Granlund Assists in Finland Win Against Rival Sweden",

    "description": "Pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, speaking Spanish, entered not guilty pleas through a translator to a rewritten indictment in Brooklyn federal court.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — A scheduled spring fraud trial for two Cleveland Guardians pitchers accused of colluding with sports bettors to rig bets and betray “America’s pastime” will likely be postponed until October, a federal judge said Wednesday as the men pleaded not guilty to a rewritten indictment.\n\nJudge Kiyo A. Matsumoto left a May 4 trial date on the books for now, but indicated she’ll probably move it to the fall in the coming weeks.\n\nPitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, speaking Spanish, entered not guilty pleas through a translator to a rewritten indictment in Brooklyn federal court.\n\nNo new charges were in the superseding indictment unsealed on Friday, as prosecutors charged a third individual with serving as a middleman between bettors and Clase. That person also pleaded not guilty Wednesday.\n\nThe pitchers were first charged in November with accepting several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two gamblers from their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 by placing more than 100 in-game prop bets and parlays on the speed and the outcome of certain pitches. Charges include wire fraud conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests.\n\nThe rewritten indictment released Friday added allegations that Clase used code words like “rooster” and “chicken” in communications about pitches to be thrown.\n\nPrior to a May 18, 2025, game against the Cincinnati Reds, Clase received a message to “throw a rock at the first rooster in today’s fight” and responded with: “Yes, of course, that’s an easy toss to that rooster,” the indictment said. However, Clase never entered the game and could not fulfill the plan to throw outside the strike zone to the first batter he faced, it added.\n\nA day earlier, though, Clase broke Major League Baseball rules by using his cellphone in the middle of a game against the Reds to signal to gamblers that a pitch would be outside the strike zone, enabling them to win about $27,000, the indictment said.\n\nClase, the Guardians’ former closer, and Ortiz, a starter, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July. Their teammates are just starting training camp for the new season. The team’s home opener is April 3.\n\nClase and Ortiz, who are free on bail, left the courthouse separately after Wednesday’s hearing. Neither commented. Lawyers for both men have insisted their clients never colluded with gamblers.\n\nLawyers for Ortiz have asked that he be tried separately, saying in court papers that if Clase passed along Ortiz’s pitching strategy to gamblers, he did so without Ortiz’s knowledge. They also noted that Ortiz is accused of throwing only two pitches that drew scrutiny over a 12-day span, while Clase is charged with colluding with gamblers on numerous pitches since 2023.\n\n“Mr. Clase may have abused his relationship with Mr. Ortiz as friends and teammates by convincing Mr. Ortiz to throw certain pitches at certain times — ostensibly for baseball reasons as far as Mr. Ortiz was aware,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nThey said they might present a defense to the jury that would cast “Ortiz as a victim of Mr. Clase’s scheme, rather than a knowing and willing participant.”\n\nClase, a three-time All-Star, had a $4.5 million salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract. Prosecutors say he started providing bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn’t seek payoffs until last year.\n\nProsecutors have said that Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary last season, joined the scheme last June.\n\nThe Guardians and Major League Baseball have said they are cooperating with the investigation. MLB said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity.",

    "fullText": "As expected, the Seahawks are for sale.\n\nDespite recent denials, the inevitable is happening. Owner Paul Allen died in October 2018. He left an express directive that the team will be sold, with the proceeds going to charity. After more than seven years, the league leaned on his sister, Jody, to get it done.\n\nThe timing is no surprise. We've previously reported that the league held a $5 million fine in abeyance with the understanding that the team would promptly be put on the market after Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe goal will be to sell the team to the highest bidder, in order to maximize the charitable contribution. The price tag, despite valuations in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion, is expected to land in the range of $9 billion to $11 billion.\n\nThe Seahawks organization, along with the team's fans, will be stuck with whoever the high bidder may be.\n\nIt's currently not known who it will be, or what that person will choose to do once they acquire full control over the franchise. It will be the next owner's prerogative to make changes, or not. To meddle, or not. To screw up a good thing, or not.\n\nAnd the fans will be stuck. Owners can't be fired. The fans can only hope the team lands in the hands of someone who will allow G.M. John Schneider to keep doing what he's been doing.\n\nBut no one other than the next owner will have any control over the situation. The next owner could be closer to Dan Snyder than any of the various good owners. (If we name one as an example, the ones not named won't be happy.)\n\nThe only thing that will matter is the money. As often is the case.\n\nEither way, the Seahawks will soon be meeting a new boss. They can only hope it's roughly the same as the old boss.",

He's awesome – tons of respect for him. But they need to beat Jon at some point,\" Martinez told MMA Junkie Radio of Cormier. \"Daniel Cormier hasn't beat Jon.

So that's always been the sh*t talk.\n\n\"'Oh, you could beat me in a fight, but I'd beat your ass in wrestling.' Even when I was telling Hulk Hogan, one day, it would be a hell of a dream because Daniel Cormier would actually think he's going to come out here and kill Jon, and Jon will shock him again and the wrestling world will go crazy. So yeah, that's a dream.\"\n\nDespite the magnitude of a potential wrestling match, Martinez isn't so sure it would materialize.\n\n\"Jon's cool, man. He's in his own world in a good way,\" Martinez said. \"He loves Gable Steveson. He's down there. He loves his family. So I don't think it's a priority to put on wrestling shoes, give Daniel Cormier a shot at even coming close to him. I think Jon loves the fact that he lives in Cormier's head.

Just live in my own moment.”\n\nThe gold medal win moved Shiffrin into a tie with Shaun White and Kaillie Humphries for second-most gold medals for American athletes at the Winter Olympics. She now has four total medals in alpine skiing, which moves her into a tie for most in the event by an American woman.\n\nAbout competing, Shiffrin said, \"The reality of our sport is you lose a lot more than you win. When you look back on my career, I know statistics and everything, but still I've definitely lost a lot more than I've won. So that's the one thing that's certain is that you're not going to win everything.”\n\nShe hasn't committed to her future, but has acknowledged that her career can't continue forever.

    "description": "The MLBPA has elected an interim executive director after Tony Clark's surprise resignation on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "One day after Tony Clark's surprise resignation amid a reported inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, the Major League Baseball Players Association elected Bruce Meyer as its executive director, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.\n\nThe vote was reportedly unanimous, with Meyer receiving the job on an interim basis after previously serving as deputy executive director.\n\nMeyer was the natural choice as Clark's No. 2 and the union's lead negotiator with MLB. He spoke earlier Wednesday about the importance of the union remaining united in the wake of Clark's ouster.\n\nAccording to Passan, Clark resigned on the heels of an internal investigation, which revealed an inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, who worked for the union beginning in 2023. The union held an emergency meeting Tuesday afternoon, but did not vote on an executive director until Wednesday.\n\nThe news comes less than a year before the current CBA is set to expire on Dec. 1. The union and MLB owners are expected to engage in a furious labor battle ahead of the new CBA, which many expect could lead to a lockout ahead of the 2027 MLB season. There is speculation the owners will push hard for a salary cap, something the players have opposed for years.\n\nMeyer joined the MLBPA in 2018 and played a central role in the last CBA negotiation. This election confirms he'll indeed be at the table for the upcoming negotiation.\n\nClark played a major role in helping negotiate previous CBAs for the players. He reportedly took an active part in negotiations as a player before being hired by the MLBPA in 2010. He was initially a director of player relations before being hired as the union's executive director in 2013. He oversaw negotiations ahead of the 2016 CBA and the contentious 2022 lockout, which resulted in Opening Day being postponed by a week as negotiations extended into March.",

    "description": "Despite his sharp statistical downturn in recent years, Robert Woods should be long remembered in fantasy football circles.",
    "fullText": "A torn ACL at age 29 altered the trajectory of one of the most underrated wide receivers of the past decade, and certainly one of the most underrated fantasy WRs. Now that Robert Woods has retired, let's recognize just how good he was.\n\nThere were three distinct phases to Woods' fantasy football career. His first four seasons were in Buffalo, where he caught passes thrown by QBs like EJ Manuel, Thaddeus Lewis, Kyle Orton, and Tyrod Taylor. Naturally, there was little room for glory. Woods' best fantasy numbers came in 2014.\n\nA switch to the Rams beginning in 2017 helped make him a fantasy mainstay. In his first year there, he was joined by rookie WR Cooper Kupp, second-year QB Jared Goff, and third-year RB Todd Gurley. It was the foundation of an offensive juggernaut, and as managers know all too well, it's often wise to invest in starters on high-scoring teams. The Rams led the league in scoring that season.\n\nDespite frequently sharing the field with one of the game's best running backs and a rapidly rising wide receiver, Woods carved out a unique fantasy niche. In Year 1, he was the WR19 in points per game -- the first of five consecutive seasons finishing in the top 20. Few WRs this century can make the same claim.\n\nHowever, in that fifth season in L.A., Woods tore his ACL at age 29. He was never the same after that, finishing outside the top 70 in each of his remaining seasons with Tennessee and Houston.\n\nIt's been more than five years since Woods was fantasy-relevant. But it doesn't take away from what he achieved: one of the most consistent statistical outputs by a WR in the modern NFL.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Robert Woods retires: an underrated fantasy football legacy",

    "fullText": "With free agency a month away, it’s time to check in on the Raiders’ wide receiver position to give it a condition of either Strong, Stable, Unstable, Serious, or Critical.\n\nBackups: Dont’e Thornton, Shedrick Jackson, Phillip Dorsett, Brenden Rice, Justin Shorter\n\nFree agents: Tyler Lockett, Alex Bachman\n\nWhen last season began, Jakobi Meyers was the only proven starter on the team. And the only other sure starter was Tre Tucker. By midseason, Meyers was traded and the Raiders offense was a complete mess. Mostly not because of the receiving corps, but the lack of talent there wasn’t helping. They rotated guys through the lineup, but little was learned from that.\n\nJack Bech had the makings of a decent slot receiver coming out of TCU but has a lot to prove. Thornton was given every opportunity to be a starting X receiver and only proved that he has all the physical tools and none of the other requirements at the position.\n\nAs of now it’s Tre Tucker and a lot of questions. At very least, they need to add a starting caliber X receiver. They would be wise to look for a good slot receiver too. Just to cover themselves. They simply cannot expect Fernando Mendoza to have a real shot at success with this receiving corps.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Raiders Wire: Fernando Mendoza early Raiders success unrealistic without big WR moves",

    "fullText": "With just 15 days until the start of the 2026 NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series season and only 15 days since he announced he had hired Ron Douglas to consult in hopes of elevating the Top Fuel team’s performance, Doug Foley made another surprise move.\n\nHe announced Wednesday that he will yield his seat to veteran crewman Gary Pritchett and transition to a full-time team-owner role, beginning immediately.\n\n“We are going to do a driver swap in 2026,” Foley said. “I am going to get out of the seat. I just felt like we could be better all the way around, and I kind of wanted to focus more on just taking the team to another level. So, I decided to get out of the seat. I just didn't feel like our team was at the level it could be, and that's my goal to fix that.”\n\nPritchett, a former Top Alcohol Dragster competitor and longtime Top Fuel crew member with the Torrence Racing team, said, “I feel like all the stars are kind of aligning and [am] really excited for the opportunity. It feels like I got the opportunity I've been waiting on my whole life.”\n\nThe change reunites Pritchett with crew chief Doug Kuch, who guided him through his Top Fuel licensing procedure in 2015.\n\n“Doug Kuch actually got me my Top Fuel license back in 2015, in Charlotte,” Pritchett said, remarking that the relationship is “coming full circle.”\n\nFoley, a seasoned Top Fuel driver with a handful of IHRA victories and a longtime co-owner with the late Tim Lewis, said the move allows him to focus on strengthening the organization both competitively and commercially.\n\nDoug Foley Racing will compete in a combination of NHRA and IHRA events in 2026.

    "description": "Social media users claimed Seattle's Super Bowl champions declined an invitation, but evidence is lacking.",
    "fullText": "A decades-long custom of championship-winning sports teams making a celebratory trip to the White House has become a political lightning rod throughout U.S. President Donald Trump's time in office, leaving fans uncertain as to whether the Seattle Seahawks will make the trip to D.C. following their Super Bowl win on Feb. 8, 2026.\n\nOn Feb. 17, rumors began spreading online that the Seahawks had explicitly declined a White House invitation. The claim spread on multiple platforms (archived, archived, archived), including an X post (archived) that received more than 3.8 million views, as of this writing. The X user didn't appear to have any related, official role that would lend credibility to his claim:\n\nOther posts, including one from a sports parody X account (archived), continued to gain momentum, with many users in the comments apparently believing the claim that the Seahawks either declined an invitation from the White House or the White House rescinded an invitation to the Seattle team.\n\nEither way, the claim lacks evidence. Neither the Seahawks nor the White House has made any official announcement, as of this writing, regarding whether the team will make an appearance at the White House. We reached out to Seahawks spokespeople and the White House, as well as top players' representatives, and did not immediately receive responses. We will update this story if we do.\n\nSeveral news media outlets, including NBC Sports, reported on the rumor, similarly noting the claim lacked supporting evidence.\n\nThe Seahawks' official site (archived) and X account didn't feature any news release corroborating the claim, as of this writing.\n\nFollowing the Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl win in 2025, several players — including quarterback Jalen Hurts — chose to skip the scheduled appearance with Trump. An NBC White House correspondent reported their expected absence just hours before the team's visit took place in April 2025.\n\nIt's possible, judging by precedent, that a Seahawks visit will take place that hasn't, as of this writing, been scheduled. In 2021, for example, the Super Bowl champion Buccaneers didn't make the trip until July.\n\nIf Trump's White House did decline to invite the Seahawks, it wouldn't be the first time a Super Bowl champion's audience with the president intentionally did not take place. In 2018, during Trump's first term, his office released a statement (archived) after several Philadelphia Eagle players publicly indicated they would decline. Trump's statement claimed the players disagreed with Trump because \"he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\"\n\nBecause neither the White House nor an official representative for the Seahawks confirmed whether the team will appear at the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl win, we leave this claim unrated.\n\nCaplan, Anna Lazarus.

    "description": "In a unanimous vote, the MLB Players Association has selected Bruce Meyer to be its interim leader.",
    "fullText": "PHOENIX — Bruce Meyer, the tenacious veteran litigator who has been the Major League Baseball Player Association’s lead negotiator, was voted unanimously Wednesday by the players to be their interim executive director, replacing Tony Clark.\n\nMeyer, who was promoted to be the union’s deputy executive director in 2022, has been MLB’s public enemy since he joined the union in 2018. He frequently has clashed on even small agenda items with MLB, which has accused him of being bad for baseball.\n\nMeyer is considered the union’s most fierce litigator since the days of Don Fehr and Gene Orza, and once again Wednesday expressed his deep resentment towards MLB’s hopes for a salary cap, believing that a lockout Dec. 1 is inevitable when the collective bargaining agreement expires.\n\n“A lockout is all but guaranteed at the end of the agreement,’’ Meyer said Wednesday afternoon after meeting with the Chicago Cubs, and spending the morning with the Kansas City Royals. “The league has pretty much said that. Their strategy in bargaining has always been to put as much pressure on players as they can to try and create divisions and cracks among our membership.\n\n“It never worked. I don’t think it will ever work.’’\n\nMeyer, who said he will continue to be the lead negotiator, said that he and his staff have a duty to the players to listen to whatever MLB offers, but showed his disdain towards even entertaining a salary cap.\n\n“Our position and the historic position of this union for decades on the salary cap is well known,’’ Meyer said. “It’s the ultimate restriction. It is something that owners in all the sports have wanted more than anything, and in baseball in particular. There’s a reason for that, because it’s good for them and not the players.’’\n\nMeyer, even with the sudden resignation of Clark over an inappropriate relationship with a union employee, insisted Wednesday morning there is no disarray among the union ranks, and its resolve remains strong.\n\n“I think anybody who's going to assume that and act on that,’’ Meyer said, “is really making a mistake. I'm not going to say (the timing of Clark’s resignation) is a great thing. This is unforeseen. There have been some issues hanging over (him), and in some respects, it's good to get them out of the way sooner rather than later.’’\n\nMeyer, while respected for his fierceness, does have his detractors. There was an attempt to remove him from the office two years ago, an effort led by attorney Harry Marino, who organized the efforts to have minor leaguers unionized. It failed when Clark came to Meyer’s defense.\n\nThe eight-person executive subcommittee pushed for Meyer to be voted as the executive director in their meeting Tuesday, but after pushback by at last three players on the call, no vote was taken. The group of 72 players, including player representatives from 30 teams, decided to reconvene at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday after polling their own teammates. If Meyer didn’t receive enough support, they likely would have turned to Matt Nussbaum, the union’s general counsel.\n\nNow, Meyer will be running the whole show, much to MLB’s fear thanks to past negotiations.\n\nWhen the 99-day lockout ended in 2022, and the rank-and-file voted to accept MLB’s last proposal, Meyer sympathized with the executive council who wanted to continue negotiations, even if it meant losing games.\n\n“Some players emerged from bargaining disappointed that we did not accomplish more,’’ Meyer said in a letter to players two years ago, “and in particular that we did not miss games to see if more gains could be made. To be clear, I sympathized and still do with these players and this position.’’\n\nMeyer, who becomes the seventh executive director of the union, expects negotiations with MLB to begin in April on the next CBA, and just like the last round, tranquility will not be on anyone’s bingo card.\n\n“I'd say I'm known as a tough litigator who also knows how to make deals when necessary,’’ Meyer said in a Q&A with the MLBPA newsletter. “In the sports area I've been involved in just about every type of issue, including labor, antitrust, licensing, collective bargaining and others. But the common thread is I have a passion for player advocacy and defending player rights.’’\n\nLet the negotiations, with plenty of rancor, begin.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: MLBPA selects Bruce Meyer as interim boss after Tony Clark resignation",

    "fullText": "SEATTLE — The Washington Huskies have parted ways with offensive coordinator Jimmie Dougherty.\n\nWashington has not yet filled Dougherty’s role. No offensive coordinator has been listed on the university’s website for the 2026 season.\n\nDougherty, who last season added the offensive coordinator title after serving as the Huskies’ passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2024, said it was an “honor” to represent the University of Washington Tuesday night on social media.\n\n“To the city of Seattle, words can’t express what you mean to me and my family!!!” Dougherty said. “Most of all the players, love you guys forever, thank you.”\n\nDougherty, 47, began working alongside Washington head coach Jedd Fisch in 2021 when both were at Arizona. When Fisch was hired at Washington, Dougherty followed him and eventually became an offensive coordinator for the first time since he held that role at San Jose State in 2014.\n\n“I have worked with Jimmie Dougherty for 7 years and am appreciative for his many contributions to our success as an offense and as a team,” Fisch said on social media. “I want to thank Jimmie and wish him all the best in the future.”\n\nIt is unclear where Dougherty, who has also previously coached at Illinois Wesleyan, San Diego, San Jose State, Michigan and UCLA, is headed next. Whoever fills his role will inherit an offense that will be led by quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who was the subject of controversy last month because of his entering and exiting the transfer portal.",

    "fullText": "The derby. Is there a more raw feeling in football than seeing your club face another just down the road? Local bragging rights. Ownership of territory. Your land is ours now.\n\nK League has several major derbies, but hidden beneath the surface, unheralded rivalries are screaming out for your attention.\n\nSupporters of Jeonbuk Hyundai, Pohang Steelers, and Ulsan HD can rightly spit out their cornflakes when glossing over an article that largely passes them by. Veteran followers of K League will know that the Donghaean Derby between Pohang and Ulsan is among the three most significant rivalries in Korea. Jeonbuk share rivalries with those clubs — and several others in the league. Add the price on their heads for consistently winning titles, and every Jeonbuk fixture feels like an event in 2026.\n\nIf you're interested in the destination of the trophy, or in seeing the best players lining up for the best teams, examine the schedule for matches involving those three clubs and Daejeon Hana. However, this article is written for the groundhopper. The casual fan looking for something a little different. A train journey to a less familiar destination. A match off Broadway, if you like.\n\nThis article leans heavily on clubs located in or near Seoul. That isn’t inherent bias towards the capital region — merely a reflection of geography. Across K League 1 and 2, 15 of 29 clubs are on or near a Seoul Metro line.\n\nHere is a list of underrated rivalries worth checking out in 2026.\n\nSuwon Samsung Bluewings vs. Suwon FC (K League 2)\n\nSuwon Bluewings love some razzamatazz at Big Bird.\n\nSeparated by just3.3 km, this is currently the only city derby in Korea’s top two divisions. For the first time ever, the two sides will meet in K League 2 in 2026, following relegations in 2023 (Bluewings) and 2025 (Suwon FC).\n\nOn a national scale, this fixture never truly captured the wider football public’s attention, but when the distance between the two grounds can be covered on foot, it demands inclusion.\n\nStaring down automatic relegation in November 2023, unproven manager Yeom Ki-hun appeared to be turning the tide when the neighbours met in a proverbial six-pointer. Despite falling behind early and being reduced to ten men, the Bluewings stormed back to win 3–2. Their survival hopes remained alive — but ultimately, it wasn’t enough. The clubs finished level on points, yet Suwon FC’s superior goals-scored record sent the Bluewings down.\n\nIncredibly, Suwon FC boast a winning record against their bigger, richer, and historically more successful neighbours. In 16 K League 1 meetings, Suwon FC have won nine to the Bluewings’ six, with one draw.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Suwon Samsung Bluewings, Castle Park — Sunday, May 3, 19:00.\n\nSuwon Samsung Bluewings vs. Suwon FC, Suwon World Cup Stadium — Saturday, August 15, 16:30.\n\nAside from being the only current city derby in the top two leagues, the stadiums are a spectacular contrast in style. Suwon Stadium is an ageing, multi-purpose ground with limited pitchside seating, minimal facilities, and no roof cover. Big Bird, by contrast, is a majestic football-specific arena with an iconic roof and a riot of seat colours.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nSeoul will be on the menu for hungry Bucheon this year.\n\nApproximately15 km — across the Han River — separates two clubs who have never officially met in league competition. Until Seoul E-Land can convert investment into promotion, Bucheon will serve as Seoul’s nearest true rival.\n\nThe history is complicated. A team from Bucheon once faced the modern incarnation of FC Seoul — but that club is now Jeju SK. Bucheon FC 1995 was founded in response. Context aside, this one will be spicy.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Seoul World Cup Stadium — Tuesday, April 21, 19:30.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. FC Seoul, Bucheon Stadium — Sunday, July 19, 19:30.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Seoul World Cup Stadium — Tuesday, August 25, 19:30.\n\nEstablished K League fanbases enjoy visiting new grounds. Many Seoul supporters weren’t following the club during the Bucheon SK era. A packed away section is guaranteed when they make the short trip across the river. Likewise, Bucheon should travel well to Sangam. Two Tuesday fixtures, however, are far from ideal.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nIncheon's famous South Stand is an imposing structure.\n\nThe 031 Derby — named after the regional area code — pits Bucheon against Incheon to the west. The stadiums are18 km apart and easily reached by subway. The clubs first met in K League 2 last season and renew their rivalry in the top flight following joint promotion. This will be Bucheon’s first taste of K League 1 football.\n\nBucheon pulled off a major shock last September, defeating the champions-elect. The result forced the rest of K League 2 to take notice: Bucheon were not just promotion contenders, but genuine candidates for automatic promotion. They ultimately fell short of completing a 031 Derby clean sweep, but the win did nothing to derail their playoff ambitions.\n\nIncheon lead the series two wins to Bucheon’s one. Incheon claimed both home fixtures at Sungui Arena (3–1 and 1–0), while Bucheon exacted revenge on home soil in September.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Incheon United, Bucheon Stadium — Saturday, April 18, 16:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Sungui Arena — Sunday, July 26, 19:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Sungui Arena — Tuesday, September 8, 19:30.\n\nLong sandwiched between major K League powers, Bucheon — a compact city on Incheon’s eastern edge — now have an opportunity to bloody the noses of their neighbours. After years of scrapping with regional sides like Ansan Greeners and Seoul E-Land, this step up in opposition and status should produce genuine edge.\n\nOn the pitch, the colors will be familiar to fans of Milan's big 2. Anyone who grew up in the 90's watching Italian Football on Channel 4 with James Richardson will absolutely appreciate seeing red/black vs. blue/black again.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Ansan Greeners (K League 2)\n\nAt long last, Ansan have a rendezvous with Suwon, based 20 km east as the crow flies. The Green Wolves have waited six years for revenge following a 4–0 trouncing during the COVID era.\n\nAnsan supporters still recall the days of Hallelujah and Police — the Greeners’ predecessors in the city. Suwon FC remain the most visited away side to Wa~.\n\nIshida Masatoshi returned to Wa~ after a successful season with Ansan and tore his former club apart in a comfortable 4–0 win for Suwon. An Byong-jun was also on the scoresheet as Suwon continued their march toward promotion. Fortunately for the Greeners, COVID restrictions meant the gates were closed that October afternoon.\n\nSuwon currently edge the rivalry with seven wins to Ansan’s six, alongside two draws. Ansan dominated the early meetings before Suwon finally broke through in 2018.\n\nAnsan Greeners vs. Suwon FC, Wa~ Stadium — Saturday, July 4, 19:30.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Ansan Greeners, Castle Park — Sunday, November 1, 14:00.\n\nAbout the only recognisable feature of Ansan Greeners is the enormous VERDOR banner that follows the downtrodden club around the country. The trip to Castle Park will be a short one for their signature banner. If there is one image that will bring back the horrors of K League 2 for Suwon FC fans, it is that green banner.\n\nFC Seoul vs. FC Anyang (K League 1)\n\nThe mural that angered Anyang's fans.\n\nThanks to the dense cluster of clubs in the Seoul Capital Area — particularly south and west of the river — familiar names recur.\n\nSeoul and Anyang sit just24 km apart. Anyang hate Seoul. Why? Because the club now known as FC Seoul once played in Anyang as the LG Cheetahs. In 2004, they announced their return to the capital, moving into the vacant World Cup Stadium. This is both a rivalry and a derby.\n\nThe last meeting saw Anyang celebrate one of the greatest nights in their history — on Seoul’s turf. Goals from Thomas Oude Kotte and Bruno Mota secured a stunning 2–1 victory. Tears flowed in the away end. The win exorcised old demons and convinced Anyang they belonged at this level.\n\n[READ: For Anyang, life will never be the same again]\n\nPerfect balance: one win, one draw, and one defeat each.\n\nFC Anyang vs. FC Seoul, Anyang Stadium — Sunday, April 5, 14:00.\n\nFC Seoul vs. FC Anyang, Seoul World Cup — Tuesday, May 5, 19:00.\n\nFC Anyang vs. FC Seoul, Anyang Stadium — Saturday, August 22, 19:30.\n\nThe rivalry is established and only set to intensify. When Seoul welcomed Anyang to Sangam last February, the home fans held up a mural reading 1983 - their year of formation. Anyang were furious. They feel some of that history belongs in the Violet city.\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United (K League 1)\n\nI can’t fully explain it — and I may be wrong — but the overdue meeting between Incheon and Anyang feels like fertile ground for a genuine rivalry.\n\nAnyang were a lifetime K League 2 club until lifting the title in 2024. They effectively took Incheon’s place after Incheon suffered their first relegation. Incheon’s rapid return and Anyang’s survival now place them on a collision course. The clubs are separated by33 km of Gyeonggi Province sprawl.\n\n[READ: A League You Have to Walk To: Football and Geography in Korea]\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United, Anyang Stadium — Sunday, March 22, 16:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. FC Anyang, Sungui Arena — Sunday, July 12, 19:30.\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United, Anyang Stadium — Wednesday, August 26, 19:30.\n\nPost-match pints. Incheon and Anyang have their go-to bar for beers. Anyang's, named after a famous football club in England, is a shrine to global football. Liverpool and Anyang dominate, but don't be surprised to see scarves from Japan, Russia, and South America on the walls. Have a pint, meet new friends, and keep the fists on the table.\n\nCheonan City FC vs. Chungnam Asan (K League 2)\n\nThe first ever K League clash between Asan and Cheonan.\n\nOtherwise known simply as “the Derby,” Cheonan and Asan are neighbouring cities divided by one landmark: Cheonan-Asan KTX Station. You can’t travel between the two grounds without passing beneath the high-speed tracks. The clubs are also five stops apart on Metro Line 1 — just13 km.\n\nOn a clear November afternoon, the provincial rivals drew 1–1 at Yi Sun-sin Stadium. Cheonan led until half-time. Asan equalised with 30 minutes remaining. With little left to play for, the draw felt especially flat for Asan, who had narrowly missed promotion in 2023.\n\nAs the more established club, Asan hold the stronger record (five wins to two). However, both of Cheonan’s victories came last season, and with the draw included, they are unbeaten in the fixture since September 2024.\n\nCheonan City FC vs. Chungnam Asan, Cheonan Stadium — Sunday, May 3, 16:30.\n\nChungnam Asan vs. Cheonan City FC, Yi Sun-sin — Sunday, November 1, 14:00.\n\nMost fixtures on this list are Gyeonggi-based. While Cheonan and Asan sit on Metro Line 1, Asan in particular still feels remote — which only adds to the charm.\n\nJeju SK vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nBuses, trains, or bikes won’t help much here. Jeju SK, based on the island of the same name, trace their roots to Seoul. Forced from the capital under K League’s decentralisation policy, they relocated first to Bucheon. Then, in 2006, the club woke up in a different city again. Bucheon FC 1995 were born in response.\n\nBucheon knocked Jeju out of the cup last year, but their last league meeting came during the COVID-affected 2020 season. Jeju won 2–0 in Bucheon, scoring twice inside 13 minutes through An Hyeon-beom and Joo Min-kyu.\n\nRemarkably, the clubs have met only three times in league competition — all in 2020. Jeju won all three, scoring seven and conceding none.\n\n[READ: Buying Tickets and Football Guide in Korea (Updated for 2026)]\n\nJeju SK vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Jeju World Cup Stadium — Saturday, April 4, 14:00.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Jeju SK, Bucheon Stadium — Tuesday, May 5, 14:00.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Jeju SK, Bucheon Stadium — Saturday, September 12, 16:30.\n\nBucheon hate Jeju. When Jeju rebranded from Jeju United to Jeju SK last winter, it sparked outrage in Bucheon. As fate would have it, the sides were drawn together in the cup. Bucheon won — serenading Jeju off the pitch to chants of “Bucheon SK.”\n\nA crowd of zero witnessed those 90 minutes due to virus restrictions. Maybe it never happened.",

    "fullText": "PFL heads to Pittsburgh for its third event of 2026 with former middleweight champion Johnny Eblen leading the charge.\n\nEblen faces Bryan Battle in the middleweight main event of PFL Pittsburgh, which takes place March 28 at UPMC Events Center. The full lineup for the event was officially announced Wednesday.\n\nComing off of his first-ever loss after starting 16-0 as a pro, Eblen looks to get back on the championship track (and possibly a rematch with Costello van Steenis, who defends his title against Fabian Edwards on March 20) when he takes on Battle, a promising UFC contender derailed by weight-cutting issues. The bout marks Battle’s league debut.\n\nIn the middleweight co-main event, Dalton Rosta fights 2023 PFL light heavyweight tournament winner Impa Kasanganay.\n\nThe main card also features the PFL debut of Ariane Lipski da Silva. The veteran flyweight went 6-8 in the UFC before signing with PFL this past September. She fights Sumiko Inaba.\n\nMaking his comeback on the preliminaries is two-time PFL lightweight tournament champion Natan Schulte.

    "description": "Seattle brings back a familiar face for Cactus League catching depth",
    "fullText": "The offseason may be officially over, with the first slate of spring training games set to begin in just two days (!), but the Mariners aren’t done making moves, and they’ve brought back an old friend for at least the Cactus League.\n\nThere has been enough ink spilled about how Garver’s previous two years with Seattle didn’t live up to the expectations of his two-year, $24 million contract he was signed to on Christmas Eve 2023. After spending 2025 as Cal Raleigh’s backup, it was an easy call for the M’s to decline their end of his mutual option, despite a couple of fun moments in the postseason. Seattle brought aboard Andrew Knizner and Jhonny Pereda to round out the 40-man roster, and with the former being out of options, the Garv man looks to be on the outside looking in for the backup catcher gig.\n\nThat doesn’t mean he won’t get a good look this spring, though. With Cal Raleigh set to suit up for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic, Seattle will find itself in need of extra backstops for a good chunk of the Cactus League. Garver also has a leg up on the rest of the competition when it comes to familiarity with the Mariners’ pitching staff, with prominent hurlers like Andrés Muñoz and George Kirby previously citing his work with them as reasons for their success. While it’s currently unknown if his minor league deal contains an opt-out clause, it’s not out of the realm of possibility he sticks around with the Rainiers should he not break camp – after all, Tacoma needs catchers, too.\n\nIt’s a mild surprise that Mitch Garver couldn’t find a big league deal elsewhere. Despite his multi-year struggles, he was still a capable option against left-handed pitching, and settled in nicely as the second-string catcher after the plan of deploying him as a primary DH went off the rails. In any case, he’ll be a solid addition to the club’s catching depth for now, and his previous work with Seattle’s pitching corps could stand a decent chance at rubbing off on Knizner and Pereda.",

Memphis also will provide access to treatment and sports medicine resources as needed.\n\nAbdul Hakim averaged 6.2 points, 4.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 22.3 minutes in 13 games, including 10 starts. He came to Memphis after spending two seasons at UT Rio Grand Valley, where he averaged 13.2 points in 19 games in 2023-24 and 13.3 points in 12 games in 2024-25.\n\nDavis, a South Carolina transfer, has averaged 7.2 points, 4 rebounds and 20.5 minutes in 22 games. He has made eight starts.\n\nMemphis (12-13, 7-5 American Athletic Conference) will try to end a two-game skid Thursday when it visits South Florida (18-8, 10-3).",

    "fullText": "The NFL‘s new league year is only a few weeks away. With that comes free agency and new deals being handed out left and right.\n\nOne of those names primed to get a nice new deal is quarterback Malik Willis. The signal caller market is very thin, which is a big advantage for Willis.\n\nHe will likely have more than one suitor. Here are three teams to keep an eye on as free agency approaches for Willis and the NFL.\n\nMORE: Colts make surprising QB decision for 2026 season amid Anthony Richardson uncertainty\n\nThe obvious connection here is new head coach Jeff Hafley. The two worked together in Green Bay for two seasons.\n\nIn that time, Hafley likely saw Willis up close as he gave his defense looks in practice. Willis got some clear development in Green Bay—something he saw firsthand.\n\nMORE: Chiefs WR Rashee Rice faces legal trouble as ex-partner files lawsuit\n\nWill Willis take his talents to South Beach? A familiar face makes comfort a little easier and plus no state taxes is a nice deal to have.\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but let’s face the facts. Head coach Kevin Stefanski likely wants his pick at quarterback.\n\nThe thin market makes it tough for him to have that. What a great prospect that Willis just happens to be a local product out of Roswell.\n\nMORE: Dolphins are nearing decision on quarterback Tua Tagovailoa\n\nCould a home reunion in Atlanta be the move for Willis? He’d have a two time NFL coach of the year, plenty of weapons, and a defense that is on the rise–all in his home state of Georgia.\n\nWhich city is the best destination for Malik Willis?\n\nBoth @fieldyates and I liked the same team…. pic.twitter.com/wafqpNfVxQ\n\n— Mina Kimes (@minakimes) February 18, 2026\n\nThe Steelers are in limbo with Aaron Rodgers (again). Will he stay or will he go? They need a plan.\n\nPittsburgh also needs to throw a different dart. The well of older QBs isn’t getting them over the hump. Willis could provide a spark and, in general, something different.\n\nThe Steelers almost drafted him in 2022 as well. Can they bring Willis to Pittsburgh and correct the wrong pick(ett)? Other analysts seem to agree with this spot as well…\n\nThe post Three teams that are looking at free agent quarterback Malik Willis appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Only 8 \"Love Is Blind\" couples are still married. Find out who's still together in 2026.",
    "fullText": "In the first six years of the hit Netflix dating show \"Love Is Blind,\" dozens of couples formed connections — but not every pair ultimately got married, and even fewer have stayed married.\n\nOnly eight \"Love Is Blind\" couples have gone the distance; of those couples, three have expanded their families in the years since we saw them walk down the aisle and say \"I do.\" Notably, \"Love Is Blind\" season nine, which took place in Denver, ended without a single couple getting married, underscoring just how rare lasting matches from the pods can be.\n\nWith season 10 of \"Love Is Blind\" now streaming on Netflix, there's no better time for a refresher on every couple who's still married — and where they are today.\n\nLibby Torres, Esme Mazzeo, Caralynn Matassa, Ayomikun Adekaiyero, and Palmer Haasch contributed to previous versions of this article. The article was first published in 2023.\n\nCameron and Lauren met and married on season one of \"Love Is Blind\" and are widely considered one of the franchise's biggest success stories. The couple, who share a dog named Mr. Sparx, celebrated their five-year anniversary in November 2023.\n\nThe couple share updates on their life on their YouTube channel, \"Hanging with the Hamiltons\", and co-authored the 2021 book \"Leap of Faith: Finding Love the Modern Way.\"\n\nIn October 2025, they added a new chapter to their story, welcoming their first child, Ezra. This comes after the couple had been open about facing struggles with fertility.\n\n\"To God be the GLORY! 🙌🏾🩵 Our son, Ezra William Hamilton, made his debut October 1st ,a little earlier than planned, but perfectly on God's time. After an unexpected turn with preeclampsia and a few days in the hospital, we've been taking it slow… healing, resting, and soaking up all the love,💛\" Lauren and Cameron said in a post on Instagram.\n\nMatt Barnett and Amber Pike also got married on \"Love Is Blind\" season one. Like Cameron and Lauren, they celebrated their five-year anniversary in November 2023.\n\nIn October 2024, the couple revealed that they were expecting their first child together on the inaugural episode of \"The Love Seat,\" the podcast hosted by their season one costars.\n\nIn April 2025, they welcomed their first child, a daughter.\n\n\"It may be the hormones but @barnettisblind and our baby girl have my heart so full I can hardly function. I hope this feeling never goes away,\" Amber said in a post on Instagram.\n\nBrett Brown and Tiffany Pennywell Brown met during \"Love Is Blind\" season four, which aired in 2023. They married in May 2022.\n\nAppearing on the \"Love Is Blind\" season six reunion episode in March 2024, Tiffany and Brett confirmed they're still happily married.\n\nThey closed on their house in September 2024.\n\nKwame Appiah and Chelsea Griffin Appiah met in the pods during season four and married in May 2022, though Kwame's mother didn't initially approve of the relationship. Despite some friction, they've managed to go the distance.\n\nChelsea and Kwame celebrated a year of marriage in May 2023 by adding to their engagement and wedding jewelry, and Chelsea shared in July 2023 that the couple had honeymooned in Santorini, Greece.\n\nChelsea announced in August 2023 that she was working for Netflix and helping cast people on \"Love Is Blind.\" She and Kwame also appeared at the season six reunion in March 2024, confirming they're still happily married.\n\nZack Goytowski and Bliss Poureetezadi-Goytowski met on \"Love Is Blind\" season four, but they didn't get engaged sight unseen like most couples on the show.\n\nZack chose Irina Solomonova in the pods, got engaged to her, and went on the couple's trip to Mexico with her before they decided they weren't a good match and swiftly broke up.\n\nAfter connecting in the pods, Bliss and Zack met in person when Zack returned from Mexico and had instant, undeniable chemistry. Zack proposed to Bliss while the season was being filmed, and she said yes. \"Love Is Blind\" followed their journey up to their wedding day in May 2022.\n\nLike all of the other season four couples, they had to keep their marriage a secret until April 2023, when the wedding episodes aired.\n\nAfter celebrating a year of marriage in May 2023 and announcing in November that they were expecting their first child together, their daughter, Galileo Terri Rayne, was born on April 26, 2024.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2026, the couple announced on Instagram that they are expecting their second child.\n\n\"We cannot wait to see Galileo become a big sister! Baby #2 coming Summer 2026 ✨,\" Zack and Bliss said in a joint Instagram post.\n\nAmy and Johnny had the most unproblematic romance on \"Love Is Blind\" season six. In the finale, they became the only couple from their season to both say \"I do\" at the altar.\n\nJohnny and Amy confirmed that they were still together at the season six reunion, which aired in March 2024. The reunion even featured a cute montage of their first year of marriage, including goofy moments at home and their trip to Paris.\n\nTaylor and Garrett had the most drama-free romance on \"Love Is Blind\" season seven, despite one disagreement over Garrett acknowledging a text from his ex. They were one of two couples to eventually make it to the altar. They confirmed at the season seven reunion, which aired in October 2024, that they were still married.\n\nDuring the reunion, Taylor and Garrett laughed at speculation that his glow-up — mostly longer, more styled hair — was due to Taylor's influence, though she said that he had driven the transformation.\n\nThey also revealed that they had decided to move to Washington, DC, rather than San Diego, as they had discussed on the show.\n\nDaniel and Taylor had the smoothest journey of any couple in season eight, except for one moment in episode six, where Taylor nearly derailed the relationship because she thought Daniel had stalked her on Instagram (he hadn't).\n\nThey confirmed at the \"Love Is Blind\" reunion, which aired in March 2025, that they're still married and had bought a home outside Minneapolis. Daniel also showed off his tattoo of Taylor's eyes.\n\nThe couple recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary and added a golden retriever named Sunny to their family.\n\nBrennon and Alexa Lemieux met on \"Love Is Blind\" season three and married in 2021.\n\nIn January 2024, they revealed that they were expecting their first child. In an interview with People announcing the news, Alexa said the two had been trying to conceive for more than a year, and she'd undergone fertility treatments that didn't work before unexpectedly conceiving naturally.\n\nAlexa and Brennon revealed on December 3, 2025, that they had decided to part ways. The announcement came a little more than a year after the birth of their daughter, Vienna Ziva Lemieux, in July.\n\n\"This choice was not made lightly, and it comes with a great deal of care, respect, and appreciation for the time we've shared,\" Brennon and Alexa said in a joint statement on Instagram.\n\n\"We entered this relationship with love and optimism, and we leave it with gratitude for the experiences that shaped us and the growth we each gained along the way. While our journey as a married couple is coming to an end, we remain supportive of one another, devoted to our daughter, and committed to navigating this transition with compassion.\"\n\nLike Brennon and Alexa, Matt and Colleen met on season three of \"Love Is Blind\" and married in 2021.\n\nColleen and Matt are quieter than many \"Love Is Blind\" cast members on social media, but they sparked conversation online because of their unconventional living arrangement.\n\nAfter the finale, they were married for about two years and lived separately before announcing they'd finally moved in together in June 2023.\n\nAfter almost four years of marriage, Matt and Colleen said in a May 2025 Instagram statement that they were parting ways.\n\nLydia and Milton met on \"Love Is Blind\" season five and bonded over their shared love of science. Their age gap worried Lydia at first, but they got married at the altar in June 2022. They later had a second wedding in Lydia's native Puerto Rico.\n\nAfter nearly three years of marriage, Lydia and Milton got divorced.\n\nDuring a June 11, 2025, appearance on fellow \"Love Is Blind\" alum Amber Desiree \"AD\" Smith's podcast, \"What's the Reality?\", Lydia opened up about life since her stint on the show.\n\nAshley and Tyler were the second couple to make it to the altar on season seven. Before they married, they had one obstacle to overcome: Tyler told Ashley that he had donated his sperm to a friend and her wife and fathered three children, something that he hadn't disclosed to her in the pods.\n\nWhen the show started airing, however, speculation and claims about Tyler's relationship with the three children circulated online. Despite breakup speculation, Ashley supported Tyler at the season seven reunion in October 2024, where the two reaffirmed their commitment to one another, and she publicly defended him in post-show interviews.\n\nHowever, on January 21, 2025, Ashley announced that she and Tyler had separated several weeks earlier and decided to divorce.\n\n\"While I had hoped for mutual understanding and transparency in our relationship, it has become clear that our paths are no longer aligned, making it impossible for me to continue in this marriage,\" Ashley said in a statement to People, also asking for privacy as she focuses on \"healing and building a new future.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider via Instagram DM, Tyler called the decision to split \"an incredibly difficult and emotional process\" for both of them and added that he takes \"full accountability\" for his role in their relationship difficulties.\n\n\"I respect Ashley's decision to move forward in a way that prioritizes her peace and happiness,\" he said. \"Ashley is an incredible woman, and I have nothing but admiration and gratitude for the love and support she has given me. I ask for kindness and understanding as we both move forward separately, focusing on healing and growth.\"\n\nJarrette and Iyanna's path to the altar on season two of \"Love Is Blind\" was relatively smooth. Though they encountered road bumps due to their differing lifestyles (Jarrette likes to go out, while Iyanna is more of a homebody), the two married and were still married when that season's \"After the Altar\" was filmed.\n\nThe two announced their separation with a now-deleted joint statement on Instagram on August 17, 2022, about a year after their marriage, and finalized their divorce in November of that year. The post-show special, which aired in September, revealed the cracks that had been forming in their marriage prior to the split, including that Iyanna had moved out of their home because of Jarrette's partying.\n\nDespite initially being amicable in their separate announcement, Iyanna later said on a podcast that Jarrette had cheated on her during their marriage, which Jarrette denied.\n\nIyanna hard-launched her new relationship in a 2023 wrap-up post on Instagram and got engaged in December 2024. Jarrette hasn't posted about his relationship status.\n\nDanielle and Nick were another season two couple who didn't make it. The two only had eyes for each other and seemed like a perfect match — which is why fans were shocked when People reported in late August 2022 that Danielle had filed for divorce from Nick earlier that month.\n\nInitially, the split was contentious, but they later reconciled and became friendly, with Danielle even appearing on Nick's podcast in May 2023.\n\nDanielle hard-launched her new relationship on Instagram in July 2024. Nick is also now in a relationship.",

    "description": "Gordon Ramsay and his wife, Tana, have six children together. The chef shares a peek at his family life in his new Netflix show \"Being Gordon Ramsay.\"",
    "fullText": "Gordon Ramsay may be famous for his foul-mouthed persona on TV, but behind the scenes, he's a proud father of six.\n\nThe Michelin-starred chef has been married to cookbook author Cayetana \"Tana\" Ramsay since 1996. Together, they have three sons and three daughters, including Holly Ramsay, who was walked down the aisle by her father at her star-studded wedding to Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty in December. Naturally, Ramsay designed the menu.\n\nRamsay shared a glimpse of his family life in his six-episode Netflix series \"Being Gordon Ramsay,\" which premiered on Wednesday.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the celebrity chef's wife and kids.\n\nCayetana \"Tana\" Elizabeth Hutcheson was in her early 20s — and engaged to someone else — when she met Gordon Ramsay at a New Year's Eve party in London, but she didn't think much of him at first, she told The Guardian in 2008. However, they shared a mutual friend and, after bumping into each other again, started dating.\n\nIn 1996, when Gordon was 29 and Tana was 21, they got married in Chelsea, London.\n\nAfter initially struggling to conceive and going through in vitro fertilization, they welcomed their first child, Megan, in 1998. By 2001, their first four children had been born.\n\nSpeaking to The Herald in 2008, Tana said they were surprised by how quickly their family grew.\n\n\"We knew we wanted a large family,\" she said, \"but for it to happen that close together is amazing. When I discovered I was expecting [our fourth child] Tilly, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God, how am I going to manage?' But you do.\"\n\nTana, who initially trained as a teacher, is also accomplished in the kitchen. She's published several cookbooks, including \"Tana's Kitchen Secrets\" and \"Tana Ramsay's Real Family Food.\"\n\nMegan Ramsay, 27, was the first in her family to graduate from college, her dad shared on Instagram at the time. She earned a degree from Oxford Brookes University in June 2019.\n\n\"So proud of this young Lady,\" he wrote alongside photos of Megan in her cap and gown, adding, \"hard work pays off!\"\n\nWhile she generally avoids the spotlight, Megan did appear on a 2021 episode of \"Hell's Kitchen\" to celebrate her 21st birthday alongside her father.\n\nAnd while she keeps a low profile, that didn't stop Ramsay from publicly disparaging her boyfriend.\n\nDuring a January 2022 appearance on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" Ramsay said Megan's ex-boyfriend, Byron, was \"a bit wet.\"\n\n\"You want a man to date your daughter, and he was just a little bit pathetic,\" he added.\n\nBut the Michelin-starred chef can be a doting dad, too. On Megan's 24th birthday in May 2022, he shared a photograph on Instagram showing the two together.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to this gorgeous lady,\" he captioned the photo. \"Words can't describe enough how proud you make me feel every day.\"\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Holly Anna Ramsay and Jack Scott Ramsay were born. They arrived seven weeks early, according to Hello! magazine.\n\nIn an Instagram post in December 2020, Tana recalled her struggles as a mother to premature twins.\n\n\"Seeing them become little chubby, healthy babies within the first year was a true blessing and I will always be grateful for the determination they showed and their feisty characters,\" she wrote.\n\nToday, the twins have a close relationship, but their professional interests differ.\n\nHolly Ramsay is a mental health advocate, podcast and documentary producer, influencer, and model. She has over 500,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nIn 2021, Holly launched the podcast \"21 & Over\" and opened up about her mental health journey, disclosing that she is a survivor of sexual assault.\n\n\"I went to university, studied fashion design, and I loved it. But by the second half of the first year I was being affected by my PTSD and I had no idea that this was happening,\" she said of the aftermath.\n\nOn December 27, 2025, Holly married Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty. She changed into her mother's 1996 wedding gown for their first dance.\n\nDuring an interview with Vogue, Holly said her father would get emotional every time she talked about the wedding.\n\n\"The other day I was asking him which car he and I would take to the church, and he welled up immediately,\" she recalled.\n\nJack is the athlete of the Ramsay family. According to People, he has played rugby and water polo, and he's studied jiu-jitsu.\n\nIn 2020, Jack joined the Royal Marines. Ramsay publicized his son's accomplishment in an Instagram post at the time.\n\n\"Can't tell you enough how proud I am of this young man Jack Ramsay you've made me feel like the proudest father today congrats on joining @royalmarines what amazing achievement,\" he wrote.\n\nA year prior, Ramsay celebrated his son finishing the famous Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\"Jack Ramsay you are an IronMan 19yrs old what took you so long! Congrats on an amazing achievement,\" the proud dad wrote on Instagram.\n\nIn 2015, Matilda, also known as Tilly, began starring in \"Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch,\" a children's cooking show on the BBC. Tilly later created a corresponding book, \"Matilda & The Ramsay Bunch: Tilly's Kitchen Takeover.\"\n\nBeyond her cooking show, Tilly has made her fair share of TV appearances, including as a contestant on \"Strictly Come Dancing\" and Australia's \"MasterChef.\" In 2024, she graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Nottingham.\n\nTilly frequently shares cooking videos on her TikTok, where she has nearly 10 million followers. She also hosted her own cooking show, \"Dish It Out,\" which premiered on Amazon in 2025.\n\nTana has spoken publicly about the pregnancy loss she experienced in 2016, and she encouraged people to discuss the often taboo topic of miscarriage.\n\n\"I found it really hard when people would talk to me and not mention it because it was like it never happened,\" she told Metro in 2020.\n\nIn an October 2021 Instagram post, Tana wrote about her family's experience.\n\n\"If all had gone as we hoped yesterday 14/10/21 would have been our little boy Rocky's 5th birthday, the day he was due not the day he was actually born when he was too little to survive,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Not a day goes by when we don't think of him,\" she continued, \"but, it wasn't meant to be.\"\n\nSpeaking on her husband's role during the hardship, Tana told Metro, \"Gordon was amazing, and he's always been one to talk about everything, and he was very good at sort of talking it out of me and never making me feel that, 'Oh, you know, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.'\"\n\nIn June 2023, she thanked her entire family in an Instagram post for their support throughout the hardship. \"I couldn't do this without my family, you are all everything to me,\" she wrote.\n\nIn 2018, when they were 18, Holly and Jack ran the London Marathon to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital and in memory of Rocky, Hello! reported.\n\nOscar James Ramsay was born in April 2019. In 2023, Tana shared photos of her son on Instagram for his 4th birthday, writing, \"4 already — wow where has that gone!! 4 years of loving you you crazy clever little boy - love you endlessly.\"\n\nHis sisters, Tilly and Holly, manage the toddler's Instagram account.\n\nA post shared by Oscar Ramsay (@oscarjramsay)\n\nRamsay once told Jimmy Fallon during a January 2021 interview that Oscar was his \"last hope\" of getting any of his children into the cooking industry.\n\nRamsay announced the birth via Instagram on November 11, 2023, by sharing a post showing his wife in the delivery room with their newborn son, Jesse James Ramsay.\n\nIn the caption, Ramsay confirmed that Jesse James would be their last child, writing: \"3 boys, 3 girls.... Done.\"\n\nRamsay had told the Daily Mail in 2021 that he and Tana were contemplating having one more child.\n\n\"I said it was a great idea. She said: 'Well, let's start planning.' So I'm like: 'Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I'm going to be the oldest dad at school, what's going to happen on sports day?'\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"But it's something we'd still consider, because it's been such a joy spending time with Oscar,\" he added.",

    "description": "I've followed the Mediterranean diet for more than five years, and I meal prep to save time and money. Here are my favorite meals to make ahead.",
    "fullText": "I have followed the Mediterranean diet for more than five years.\n\nIt's long been considered the healthiest diet, and this way of eating emphasizes the consumption of unprocessed foods and healthy fats.\n\nCommon ingredients people on the diet eat include vegetables, seafood, whole grains, and beans. While following it, I like to cook meals in advance in larger batches so I can enjoy them throughout the week or freeze them to eat at a later date.\n\nSome of my go-to Mediterranean-diet recipes stray slightly from more typical ones I've seen, but I try to stick with the core principles of this style of eating while keeping things interesting.\n\nHere are some of my favorite meals to make in advance and how I usually prepare them.\n\nChicken meatballs are versatile and can be easily incorporated into pasta dishes, salads, wraps, and sandwiches. Plus, they freeze well.\n\nTo make them, I usually combine ground chicken, chopped red onion, egg, breadcrumbs, and olive oil. Then, I mix in oregano, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper and form my meatballs.\n\nI pop them in the air fryer or oven until brown, let them cool, then freeze them in individual portions for later.\n\nStuffed peppers are easy to customize with different types of meat, rice, cheese, and vegetables.\n\nTo start, I cut each bell pepper in half and remove the seeds. I drizzle the peppers in olive oil and bake them for a bit while I cook my preferred filling on my stovetop.\n\nI often stuff peppers with a mix of cooked ground turkey (be sure to drain any excess juice), diced onions, canned diced tomatoes, garlic, tomato puree, chicken stock, and herbs.\n\nOnce I bake and cool the peppers, I freeze them. When I defrost them, I add grated cheese and heat them in the oven until they're hot and the cheese is golden.\n\nSometimes I spend a free afternoon cooking a large batch of beef stew I can fill my freezer with.\n\nTo make it, I brown ground beef in olive oil on my stove and set it aside on a plate. Then, I add diced onion, rosemary, and garlic to the pan I was using. I cook them for a few minutes and then add red wine.\n\nI then pour in beef stock, canned chopped tomatoes, and jarred grilled peppers. I add the beef back in and cook my stew in the oven for two hours.\n\nThen, I stir in canned butterbeans and olives and cook for another 30 minutes. I make a slurry with cornstarch and cold water and stir it into my stew to help it thicken. I let it simmer until I like the consistency.\n\nOnce it cools, I freeze individual serving sizes that I can thaw whenever I want them.\n\nHomemade fishcakes are a great way to incorporate seafood into your diet without spending a fortune at the fishmonger.\n\nTo make them, I fry chopped leeks on the stove and set them aside in a bowl. Then, I grind up a few tilapia filets in a food processor and add them to the leeks, along with an egg, breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley, lemon juice, and cumin.\n\nI form my mixture into small cakes, then fry them in a pan for five minutes on each side until golden brown.\n\nI freeze the cakes individually and usually serve them with garlic mayo and salsa.\n\nA one-pan chicken traybake is perfect to throw in the oven on a busy weeknight, particularly if you also need lunch prepped for the next day.\n\nFor mine, I chop potatoes, onions, and lemons into medium-sized chunks and toss them in a pan with olive oil, capers, jarred peppers, sundried tomatoes, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper.\n\nI start roasting them in the oven while I season chicken thighs with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n\nI fry the thighs skin-side down on the stove until the skin turns brown, then add them to the tray of things I began roasting. I cover the whole thing in foil for a bit, then keep baking and tossing everything around until my potatoes are crispy.\n\nOnce finished, I serve myself a portion and keep the rest for lunch the next day. It's very tasty leftover.\n\nNothing says batch cooking like a cozy soup.\n\nDrizzle diced carrots, onion, celery, and leeks with olive oil and cook in a large pan on the stove. Season with turmeric, harissa, and red-pepper flakes before adding chopped tomatoes, fresh cilantro, vegetable stock, and water.\n\nLeave to simmer uncovered for at least 30 minutes, then add cans of green lentils and chickpeas. Simmer for another half an hour.\n\nWhisk a couple of eggs, a tablespoon of flour, and lemon juice into a couple of cups of water, then add that mixture to the soup.\n\nLet it simmer for a few more minutes before pouring yourself a serving and freezing the rest.",

    "title": "The US Navy is pulling more and more warships into its Middle East force buildup",
    "description": "The Pentagon has dramatically reduced the number of ships it had in the Caribbean ahead of the Maduro raid, moving vessels toward the Middle East.",
    "fullText": "The US military added another warship to its large Middle East buildup in recent days, and a second carrier strike group is on its way, bringing additional fighter jets and missiles toward the region.\n\nThe large-scale deployment of American forces to the Middle East has escalated significantly this month as the Trump administration pressures Iran to strike a deal that would limit its nuclear and military capabilities.\n\nAs the US Navy's Middle East force presence has grown, its footprint in the Caribbean Sea — once the site of a substantial show of force ahead of US military action against Venezuela and its former president Nicolás Maduro — has shrunk dramatically.\n\nThere are 10 warships and an aircraft carrier positioned in the Central Command area of responsibility, the Middle East, and two more vessels situated on the outskirts of the region, according to a defense official.\n\nMuch of the US naval force in the Middle East was operating in the Arabian Sea as of Tuesday. That includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group — the guided-missile destroyers USS Spruance, USS Frank E. Petersen Jr., and USS Michael Murphy.\n\nThe Lincoln has dozens of embarked aircraft, including fighters, electronic attack jets, and early warning planes. The destroyers escorting the carrier are equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. Among its air wing are F-35 stealth fighters.\n\nThree additional destroyers — USS Mitscher, USS McFaul, and USS Pinckney — are also in the Arabian Sea. Pinckney arrived in the region in the past couple of days, the defense official said.\n\nAnother destroyer, USS Delbert D. Black, is in the Red Sea. And three littoral combat ships — USS Santa Barbara, USS Tulsa, and USS Canberra — are in the Arabian Gulf. These warships are designed for near-shore operations.\n\nUSS Roosevelt and USS Bulkeley, two destroyers capable of ballistic missile defense, are operating in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, which is part of US Naval Forces Europe and Africa's area of responsibility.\n\nThe defense official said the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group — destroyers USS Mahan, USS Winston S. Churchill, and USS Bainbridge — are also operating under that command, which covers the eastern half of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Ford carrier strike group had been operating in the Caribbean for months. However, earlier this month, it was reported that the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier was being sent to the Middle East.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the aircraft carrier was operating off the coast of Morocco near the Strait of Gibraltar, ship-tracking data shows.\n\nTwo additional destroyers — USS Thomas Hudner and USS Stockdale — that were previously in the Caribbean are now in the US Naval Forces Europe and Africa area of responsibility as well.\n\nThe departure of Ford and the five destroyers has diminished the Navy's presence in the Caribbean, which falls under the Southern Command area of responsibility.\n\nThe US armed forces initially positioned a large number of warships in the waters near Venezuela last year as part of President Donald Trump's effort to pressure Maduro. A few weeks after his capture, a dozen vessels were still present in the region.\n\nNow, only five remain, the defense official said. Those include the cruiser USS Lake Erie, the destroyer USS Truxtun, the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima, and the amphibious transport dock ships USS Fort Lauderdale and USS San Antonio.\n\nThe US and Iran held indirect talks earlier in the week, and officials hinted that additional dialogue could be on the horizon.\n\nHowever, US military assets — including aircraft such as fighter jets and refueling tankers — are still moving into and toward the Middle East, giving Trump plenty of options to strike Iran for a second time, which he has threatened. The US military bombed Iran's nuclear sites last year as part of Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nIran, meanwhile, conducted military exercises in the strategic Strait of Hormuz this week, and Tehran's leadership warned the US warships deployed to the region that it is capable of sinking them in the event of a fight.",

    "fullText": "At the World Liberty Forum at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, David Solomon revealed that he holds some bitcoin among his personal investments.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs CEO hasn't always spoken positively about the apex crypto token. In 2024, he said he believed bitcoin is a speculative asset without a real use case. More recently, he downplayed the potential threat that some think it poses to the US dollar, making it clear that he wasn't concerned.\n\nSolomon didn't reveal exactly how much he has invested in bitcoin or how long he has held it for, only that he holds a \"very, very limited\" amount. He added that he doesn't see himself as a forecaster but rather as an observer of crypto, implying that he believes it is important to understand it as the technology continues to intersect with finance.\n\nGoldman has warmed to cyrpto more recently. Solomon previously stated that the bank has a team assessing how to implement stablecoins. Yet, it hasn't embraced crypto as much as peers like JPMorgan, which has debuted tokenized offerings for clients and issued its own JPM Coin.\n\nIn his address at the World Liberty Forum, Solomon also discussed regulation, noting that he sees the regulatory approach of the last few years as burdensome.\n\n\"When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,\" he said. \"That absolutely happened in the last five years.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has prioritized easing regulations on the crypto industry, which initially spurred growth for bitcoin and other digital assets. However, the top crypto has been in a rut since hitting an all-time high last October, with prices down nearly 50% since then.\n\nBitcoin was down on Wednesday, struggling to gain momentum after its latest streak of declines. The token was trading at $66,500, down about 1%.",

    "description": "OpenCode creator Dax Raad argued it isn't necessarily a good thing that AI is lowering the cost of production for companies.",
    "fullText": "A company can use AI to code faster than ever — but that won't matter if the idea itself is lousy.\n\nThat's just one point from a scathing critique of the current state of AI in the workplace from veteran software engineer Dax Raad, whose blunt assessment is resonating with many workers online.\n\nRaad, the developer behind OpenAuth, said the bottleneck facing companies isn't coding productivity — it's a lack of good ideas, unmotivated employees, corporate bureaucracy, and \"the dozen other realities of shipping something real.\"\n\nBefore AI, companies were reined in by development costs, he argued in a February 14 post on X that has since gone viral on Reddit as well. While it's easier than ever to produce code, that doesn't mean the original idea was worthwhile — or that employees will produce more instead of simply using AI to work \"with less energy spend.\"\n\n\"your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping,\" Raad wrote.\n\neveryone's talking about their teams like they were at the peak of efficiency and bottlenecked by ability to produce code\n\nhere's what things actually look like\n\n- your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping\n\n- majority of workers have…\n\nRaad described a search for meaning among employees faced with potential productivity gains from AI, arguing that the \"majority of workers have no reason to be super motivated, they want to do their 9-5 and get back to their life.\"\n\nPart of the issue, he wrote, is that some workers may simply use AI to coast. \"they're using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend,\" he said. That can actually make work harder for those who are giving it their all, he wrote.\n\n\"the 2 people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon,\" Raad wrote.\n\nThere are also very real monetary costs to outfitting a company's engineers with AI coding tools and the tokens required to power new AI features.\n\n\"your CFO is like what do you mean each engineer now costs $2000 extra per month in LLM bills?\" he wrote.\n\nRaad, who also created OpenCode, an open-sourced AI coding tool, said that people shouldn't mistake his criticism of AI.\n\n\"so many people don't understand how I can be critical of AI while also building an AI tool,\" he wrote in a different post on X.\n\nThe OpenCode developer has begun to develop a reputation for expressing skepticism about AI's progress, or at least the hype around it. In a recent \"contrarian talk,\" Raad said that his job is just as hard as it was before AI.\n\n\"I'm tired of people feeling like suddenly the tables are going to turn and things are going to be easier,\" he said during a talk with the AI Engineer podcast. \"They're not easier. My life is just as hard as it's ever been. It's just as hard as it's ever been to do something amazing. But it's also where all the fun comes from, where all the purpose comes from.\"\n\nRaad's views have resonated within the development community. His post on X has been viewed roughly 793,000 times, and a user who shared Raad's thoughts on Reddit has received over 22,000 upvotes. On Medium, JP Capras, a fellow engineer, praised Raad's \"honest take.\"\n\n\"Omg, you guys are making me feel much less alone now :D,\" a Reddit user replied, adding that requests from their management have \"destroyed\" their development process.\n\n\"It's funny how accurate this is to my current situation,\" reads the top-voted comment on the viral Reddit post.\n\nSome companies have said AI has allowed them to do more, faster — and others have talked about the potential to \"fail fast\" and iterate. Okta, Salesforce, Snowflake, and Blackstone have all leaned heavily into utilizing AI.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, previously told Business Insider.\n\nRaad's perspective comes amid a broader concern about \"AI fatigue.\"\n\nSiddhant Khare, who builds AI tools, recently wrote an essay about what he described as how \"the tool that was supposed to save you time has consumed your entire day.\" In short, it's the view that whatever AI may increase in productivity, it comes at the cost of a burned-out workforce.\n\nSteve Yegge, an Amazon and Google vet, recently said companies should consider a three-hour cap on AI-assisted work or risk their workforces crumbling.\n\n\"I seriously think founders and company leaders and engineering leaders at all levels, all the way down to line managers, have to be aware of this and realize that you might only get three productive hours out of a person who's vibe coding at max speed,\" Yegge told \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" newsletter.\n\nRaad's larger point is that AI isn't a magic wand that companies can wave and expect to suddenly find success — and that real pain points remain.\n\n\"even when you produce work faster you're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Kevin Hassett said Fed researchers should be disciplined for their views on tariffs, sparking fresh concern from commentators about Fed independence.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump's economic advisor said that Federal Reserve writers behind a report claiming that Americans bear the brunt of tariffs should be \"disciplined.\"\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, criticized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's economic analysis of the impact of tariffs published last week, calling for the authors to be punished for their findings.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment. It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined because what they've done is put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first semester econ class,\" Hassett told CNBC.\n\nThe economists found that 90% of the economic burden of higher tariffs fell on US firms and consumers. The average tariff rate climbed to 13% from 2.6% in 2025 as part of Trump's sweeping trade policy unveiled last April.\n\n\"While importers pay the duty, the 'economic burden' of the tariff can be shifted onto exporters if they lower their export prices,\" the report reads. \"There is 100 percent pass-through from tariffs to import prices, and therefore on U.S. consumers and firms,\" the economists explained in the write.\n\nHassett defended the tariffs in his comments to CNBC.\n\n\"The basic theory of President Trump's tariffs is that, sure we're importing stuff from China, but we've got producers in the US that make the same stuff, maybe at a slightly higher price. If we bring the stuff home, create the demand at home, then that will hurt China and drive up wages in the US and American consumers be better off.\"\n\nHassett's remarks come as Fed independence is in focus. The Trump administration is in the midst of criminal investigations into Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed governor Lisa Cook.\n\nClaudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is known for creating the Sahm rule, a popular recession indicator, said the comments, specifically Hassett calling for the paper's authors to be disciplined, are \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nShe added that Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair, \"must\" be asked about Hassett's comments at his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"The Fed Chair has the ability to suppress research from the Fed. Will he if it disagrees with White House?\" Sahm wrote.\n\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider that Hassett's comments are \"distressing.\"\n\n\"At best it's an angry outburst instead of a reasoned response, and at worst it is meant to chill speech and curb central bank independence,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "The iconic chef might have been known by a completely different moniker — one that, it seems, he would have preferred.\n\n\"Scott's a lot better than fucking Gordon,\" Ramsay quips to his wife Tana.\n\nRamsay elaborated in a recent interview with BBC Radio 2, revealing he was named Gordon after his father.\n\n\"They christened me and mum said, 'We're going to name you after your father,'\" Ramsay said, noting that doctors originally believed he wasn't going to live for longer than two hours.\n\n\"Scott's a cool name,\" he added. \"I would've preferred to be called Scott.\"\n\nRamsay said his father believed that cooking wasn't a job for real men. He never ate at one of his son's restaurants before he died at the age of 53 from a heart attack.\n\n\"Deep down inside, I would love for my dad to have tasted something and even said, 'Yeah, good job,''' Ramsay said. \"I would've loved him to have understood, even though he didn't back what I was doing or believed in where it was going. You want validation from your parents.\"\n\nBoth Ramsay and Tana were in relationships when they first met while attending a mutual friend's wedding.\n\n\"I was looking at my mate thinking, 'Oh my god, your girlfriend is fucking gorgeous,'\" Ramsay recalled. \"She looked like a young Julia Roberts.\"\n\nTana, who was 18 when she met Ramsay, said it wasn't love at first sight with her future husband.\n\n\"I thought he was really arrogant, really full of himself; he used to really irritate me,\" she said. \"It took about a month, and then we were both single.\"\n\n\"I honestly thought for many months that Tana was out of my league,\" Ramsay added. \"I won her over with food.\"\n\nRamsay said he was \"transformed\" by the legendary chef, who became the first Brit to ever win three Michelin stars.\n\n\"He was like a father figure,\" Ramsay said. \"He had the gift of this Picasso; he put food on the plate like no other.\"\n\nRamsay said he was White's \"right-hand man\" at The Restaurant Marco Pierre White, working 18-hour days six days a week during his early 20s.\n\n\"I became very good very quickly,\" Ramsay added. \"He brought the natural talent out of me.\"\n\nRamsay said that The Restaurant Gordon Ramsay \"started with nothing.\" Since he couldn't buy expensive cuts of meat, he sold oxtail instead.\n\n\"But I still won two Michelin stars with oxtail,\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"When you get that third star, everyone says it's a sigh of relief, but it's not a sigh of relief,\" Ramsay said. \"It's fucking magical.\"\n\nThe Restaurant Gordon Ramsay remains open today and still has three Michelin stars to its name. During the docuseries, Ramsay hit back at critics who claim he cares more about being a \"TV chef\" than his actual restaurants.\n\n\"I didn't sacrifice the restaurants for TV, and I haven't used the TV to fake what's going on in the restaurants,\" he said. \"They go hand in glove.\"\n\nWhen Ramsay hosted a preview event for Bishopsgate, he opted to invite influencers to see the space instead of food critics.\n\n\"Ten years ago, we were depending on their pens,\" he said about critics. \"Ten years ago, we were depending on their insults. Ten years ago, we were depending on their egos, and they destroyed restaurants.\"\n\nRamsay noted how critics would often get personal throughout his career. He recalled one writer who called him a \"failed footballer that had a shotgun wedding.\"\n\n\"How does that relate to food?\" Ramsay asked. \"How do you write about a restaurant experience with that headline?\"\n\nNow, Ramsay believes that influencers are \"the most powerful critics on the planet.\"\n\n\"Being Gordon Ramsay\" also briefly follows Tilly's journey as she attends the Ballymaloe Cookery School in Ireland.\n\nTilly said she began cooking when she was very young, wanting to be \"part of everything\" that her father did.\n\n\"Cooking is definitely something that has brought us together,\" she said.\n\nDuring the docuseries, Ramsay goes with Tilly for the fitting of her first chef whites and visits her at the cooking school. Tilly hopes to someday open her own restaurant, just like her father.\n\nRamsay believes he could have \"been there a bit more\" for his four oldest children, who are now all in their 20s. So he's planning to do things a bit differently for his 6-year-old son Oscar and 2-year-old son Jesse James.\n\n\"I'll make more time for them because I never want them to say, 'You weren't there my first day at school. You missed my play. You missed my football match,'\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"But I'm shit at Nativity plays, I'm shit at Christmas carols, I'm shit at sports days because I want to compete and beat all the dads,\" he added. \"So maybe it's a good thing I didn't do all those.\"\n\n22 Bishopsgate will feature the restaurants Lucky Cat, Lucky Cat Terrace, Bread Street Kitchen, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High, and the culinary school Gordon Ramsay Academy.\n\nLucky Cat is a 250-seat Asian-inspired restaurant, while Lucky Cat Terrace has 60 seats in a rooftop garden with a retractable roof. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High is a 12-seat fine-dining restaurant, and Bread Street Kitchen will be an all-day brasserie.\n\nRamsay said he wants to make sure 22 Bishopsgate has \"some of the best restaurants in the world.\"\n\n\"It's sort of one of my final stakes in the ground, something I'm going to be best remembered for,\" he added.\n\nRamsay, who has a 20-year lease on the building, called it one of the \"most fraught projects I've ever done.\"\n\n\"The pressure with this project is that if it doesn't go to plan, it's my neck on the line, and I have to guarantee that every penny that we're borrowing, if it doesn't work, I have to pay that back personally,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to create something incredibly special to keep alive for 20 years, without a doubt.\"",

    "title": "I'm a busy dad who didn't have time to exercise. I managed to 'get jacked' with just 20 minutes of bodyweight exercise a day.",
    "description": "After years of inconsistent routines, a dad explains how committing to just 20 minutes of daily exercise helped him build lasting fitness habits.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Skye Mackintosh, a 29-year-old regional sales manager and father of two, based in Utah. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn October 15th, 2024, I saw a picture of myself sitting by the pool and didn't recognize myself. It was the biggest I'd ever been, and I felt like it wasn't really me.\n\nI decided to go a year without added sugar, and I lost some weight. If anything had even one gram of added sugar, I didn't eat it for a full year.\n\nAlthough I've never been particularly sedentary — I grew up hunting and fishing on my family farm, played basketball once a week or so, and used to run a lot — I had a hard time working out consistently. If I had days I didn't want to exercise, I just didn't. I've completed 75 hard a couple of times, and I even ran a 50k ultramarathon with six weeks of training, but I always just went back to how I was.\n\nSo, I wanted to find a way of working out that I would actually do forever.\n\nI decided to start posting evidence of my daily 20-minute workouts. I knew that if I put my fitness journey online, I wouldn't be able to face the embarrassment of not following through on my word.\n\nI chose 20 minutes because 30 isn't always achievable, and 10 didn't seem to be enough. My wife and I are going to have more kids, and then I'll have grandkids, and who knows where my career will take me. But regardless of what's going on, I figure I'll always have 20 minutes.\n\nI chose push-ups and jump squats to start with because I wanted to hit the core muscle groups while keeping it simple enough to do anywhere.\n\nAs my account grew, I started getting advice from people in my comments. They told me that I would mess up my posture or injure myself if I didn't work different parts of my body, so around day 35, I added one back exercise and one core exercise.\n\nI felt like I was plateauing with a full-body workout every day, so now I do upper body 3 days a week and lower body and core 2 days a week. On Wednesdays, I either play basketball or do some stretching, and Sundays are full rest days.\n\nAs I have gotten stronger, I've added more reps in those 20 minutes and some equipment, so it isn't too monotonous. Nothing crazy — just a kettlebell and pull-up bar, and some free equipment I have gotten from brands as my account got more popular.\n\nI always do movements that anyone can do with bodyweight or really simple, cheap equipment. For example, I really like lunges with a kettlebell or ab rollouts.\n\nA few commenters have said that my routine is getting too complicated and intimidating, and I get it; it would have been overwhelming if I had tried to jump straight into what I was doing on day 143 on day one. My whole point is to start where you are — don't compare my day 143 with your day one.\n\nI don't want to overcomplicate my diet, either, so I just try to eat as many whole foods as I can and hit my goal of 185 grams of protein a day.\n\nGetting jacked wasn't my main goal. It's not about seeing the abs or the muscles in the mirror, but what that signifies — that I'm dedicated and I can do hard things to become the man I want to be.\n\nIt helps that somewhere between day 30 and day 40, I realised I was finding working out fun, too. I was travelling, but it didn't feel like a pain to figure out how to fit in my workout. Instead, I was excited to do it.\n\nI've also gotten a lot stronger and improved my form. On day 100, I recreated the workout I did on day one, and what took me about 15 minutes at the start only took me five minutes. And while I could only do two pull-ups at the start, I can now do 15 with a 10-lb weighted vest.\n\nI sleep more deeply, too, and dream so much more. I also dream more when I'm awake — I have more confidence and self-respect, and feel able to take on more ambitious goals.\n\nI want others to feel the way I'm feeling, so inspiring people through my Instagram page has been so special. People have been messaging me to say they've worked out for the first time in years, or they are on day 50 of their own journeys.\n\nMy main advice is just to start and keep it simple. I wanted to test whether even something small, stacked over time, is better than great spurts of effort, and I've found that it is — it's all about consistency.\n\nIf 20 minutes seems overwhelming, start with 10, or even five. You don't need to put pressure on yourself to work out for 100 days in a row; you just need to do it today.",

    "title": "A leaked Pentagon list flagging dozens of universities as risks blindsided schools and military students alike",
    "description": "Military students face uncertainty as the Pentagon evaluates universities beyond Harvard, potentially affecting top-leveleducation plans.",
    "fullText": "University officials and military students say they were blindsided by a Pentagon decision to not only sever ties with Harvard University, but also put dozens of other colleges under review.\n\nTroops pursuing military legal and specialist careers are barred from attending Harvard through certain Defense Department-funded programs, officials say, and recent internal messaging has raised the prospect that other long-standing education partnerships could be affected as well.\n\nAfter an internal list of schools under review leaked online last week, Business Insider reached out to each institution for their reaction to the news.\n\nA spokesperson for The George Washington University said the school had not \"received any direct notification or communication\" from the Department of Defense. Northeastern University said the same, sharing that while it was aware of press reports on the matter, it was still working to establish facts.\n\n\"I'm a little bit flabbergasted,\" said a professor at one listed school. \"This is very strange.\" Another questioned what the long-term effects of this decision might be. It's a question military students are asking as well.\n\n\"We've had no clarification as to what's going on,\" shared a prospective lawyer currently on active duty and enrolled at one of the listed schools. Like the professors, they spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.\n\nLast Friday, screenshots of internal US Army emails began circulating online. The emails, which CNN first reported and Business Insider verified, identified Harvard University as \"fully off limits\" for service members seeking US military tuition assistance while marking 33 other schools as moderate or high risk. Self-paying students were also encouraged to apply elsewhere.\n\nOne email said that prospective students who had applied to or had been accepted to schools like American University, Stanford University, or Georgetown University, among others, \"should have a backup plan\" in case the Pentagon gives those schools the same treatment as Harvard.\n\nArmy spokesperson Cynthia Smith said in a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday that only US military ties to Harvard are being halted. Other university programs are under review, she said, but \"no further decisions have been made at this time.\"\n\nA separate defense official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive issues also told Business Insider that the list is still \"up in the air.\"\n\nSuch considerations signal a potentially significant shift in how the US military interacts with civilian universities — institutions that have long played a central role in educating military lawyers, specialists, and leaders rising to higher ranks — and raise questions about whether political factors are shaping where troops are permitted to study.\n\nThe Department of Defense declined to provide any further clarity and referred Business Insider to a social media post by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth earlier this month that said the Pentagon intends to sever ties with Harvard for all professional military education programs and fellowships.\n\nHegseth, who received a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School, said Harvard is \"one of the red-hot centers of Hate America activism,\" adding that \"too many faculty members openly loathe our military; they cast our armed forces in a negative light and squelch anyone who challenges their leftist political leanings.\" Harvard hasn't publicly responded.\n\nThe internal Army emails that leaked online were focused on soldiers applying to the Army's legal education program, a pathway to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG), the military's legal branch. Graduate degrees at civilian universities, however, are not limited to prospective JAGs and also include competitive programs for degrees relevant to other military jobs.\n\nThe potential blacklisting of universities beyond Harvard has prompted concerns among current and prospective students that coveted spots at their chosen schools may be eliminated.\n\nThe active-duty service member preparing for a military legal career at a top law school told Business Insider that they worry that even if they graduate, a degree from a blacklisted university might be viewed unfavorably when future promotion opportunities arise.\n\nAnother service member who is set to start school at a top institution in the fall — and is preparing to relocate their family — said they have not received information about how their studies may be affected; however, they fear that if they are barred from attending their chosen university, they might not have time to apply to another school.\n\n\"It's a thing you earn on merit that I would hate to have taken away,\" they said of their acceptance at a top institution.\n\nUS military officer culture has long prized continued study, particularly for those advancing to senior ranks who are expected to understand the global and strategic implications of American power beyond the boots-on-the-ground level. Civilian graduate programs have historically helped the military build legal, policy, and strategic expertise at senior levels.\n\nEducational priorities are shifting in the Pentagon under the current administration, which has labeled Ivy League schools and other universities as \"woke\" for some of their policies and programs. In some cases, the admin has also threatened federal funding freezes on several schools, including some on the Army list.\n\n\"This is such a slippery slope,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School and a retired Air Force JAG. She expressed alarm at the prospect of certain schools being off-limits for troops without transparency about the exact criteria the Pentagon is using to judge them.\n\n\"Everyone is just kind of scratching their heads,\" she said.",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in Los Angeles about social media's impact on youth. The judge cracked down on smart glasses in court.",
    "fullText": "As Mark Zuckerberg was ushered into the Los Angeles Superior Court early on Wednesday morning, one accessory in his entourage stood out: Meta Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nZuckerberg, wearing a navy blue suit and tie, arrived without any glasses. Flanking either side of him as he walked up to the courthouse were longtime executive assistant Andrea Besmehn and an unidentified man donning Meta's Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nMeta declined to comment about the accessory choice.\n\nAI-powered smart glasses weren't just a hot accessory in the California sun. They were a hot topic inside the courtroom.\n\nThe judge presiding over the trial announced that anyone using glasses to record inside the courtroom would be \"held in contempt of the court,\" according to CNBC.\n\nThis isn't the first trial where Meta's glasses have caused issues.\n\nLast year, while Meta battled the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust allegations, New York Times reporter Mike Isaac posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he had been reprimanded by the court for wearing Meta Ray-Bans.\n\ndo not wear camera glasses in federal buildings folks 😞\n\nThe glasses cameo came as Zuckerberg took the stand in a Los Angeles trial accusing major social media companies of building addictive products that harm young users. The case centers on a now-20-year-old plaintiff, identified in court filings as \"KGM,\" who alleged that Instagram and YouTube worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts after she started using the apps as a child. TikTok and Snap have already settled, leaving Meta and Google's YouTube as the remaining defendants in the trial, which could shape similar lawsuits nationwide.\n\nThe trial underway in Los Angeles is focused on design features that plaintiffs say keep teens scrolling. Zuckerberg's testimony follows an earlier appearance from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri.\n\nMeta's Ray Ban smart glasses have become a surprise hit. On the company's earnings call last month, Zuckerberg said that sales of the glasses more than tripled in 2025, and compared the moment to the shift from flip phones to smartphones.\n\nMeta has increasingly positioned the glasses as a vehicle for its AI ambitions. In addition to taking pictures and playing music, users can ask questions to Meta AI, Meta's AI assistant, about anything that they're looking at through the glasses.\n\nLast week, the New York Times reported that Meta is planning to add facial recognition technology to the glasses.",

    "description": "Even if a company doesn't cite a reason for relocating, experts say the change can signal financial, political, or other motives.",
    "fullText": "When a company moves its headquarters, it's making a statement — whether leadership spells it out or not.\n\nThat's the case with Palantir's surprise announcement Tuesday that it has relocated its home base to Florida from Colorado.\n\nThe defense-tech contractor disclosed the change in a one-sentence press release citing a new address just outside Miami. Palantir, led by cofounder and CEO Alex Karp, didn't provide a reason or say what it means for employees.\n\nThe lack of details has left many observers speculating on the motive.\n\n\"This seems like a pretty obvious attempt to put both Karp and Palantir in friendlier territory,\" said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\nThough Karp backed Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign, he has more recently praised the Trump administration's immigration and national security policies.\n\nOn a November earnings call, Karp called for tougher border policies and highlighted Palantir's work with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Israel. Palantir, which relies heavily on government contracts, has also faced protests in Colorado in recent years. Colorado is a blue state, Florida is red.\n\n\"Not only will the company receive a more welcoming reception and more eager labor pool in Florida, but Karp and his top deputies will probably be more comfortable spending time there than they do in Colorado,\" said Pozner.\n\nPalantir didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the reason for the headquarters shake-up or the move's impact on employees.\n\nPalantir was founded in California's Silicon Valley region in 2003 and moved to Colorado in 2020. At the time, Karp cited an \"increasing intolerance and monoculture\" in Silicon Valley. Karp owns property in Colorado.\n\nSome leadership experts point to Florida's more tax-friendly policies as a reason why Palantir has a new ZIP code.\n\n\"To me, this is dollars and cents,\" said Zack Kass, a former OpenAI executive who now advises companies and governments on leading in today's AI-centric business world. \"If building a better company meant Karp moving the business to Alaska, he'd probably do it.\"\n\nA number of finance and tech heavyweights have planted flags in Florida in recent years, including Citadel, Thiel Capital, and Thoma Bravo. In January, venture capitalist David Sacks proclaimed that Miami will soon replace New York City as America's financial capital.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the leadership of the state of Florida,\" said Citadel's Ken Griffin at the America Business Forum in Miami in November. \"This is a great place to call home.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees, though, as others have noted that Miami's social scene hollows out in the summer and the city lacks a major university to pipe in tech talent.\n\nWhatever the incentives are behind Palantir's change of address, headquarters moves in general are rarely about real estate, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management professor at Bentley University. Instead, they often speak to the kind of identity leaders want for their companies.\n\n\"In a world where so much work is hybrid or distributed, the HQ is often more symbolic than operational,\" he said. \"Geography communicates. It says something about who you want to attract, who you align with, and what kind of company you believe you are.\"\n\nLeBlanc pointed Elon Musk's decision to move some of his companies' headquarters from California to Texas for political reasons as an example. In 2024, the billionaire lashed out at California for being the first state to outlaw schools from having to notify parents if a child changes their name, pronouns, or gender identity at school, calling the move the \"final straw.\"\n\n\"Particularly in founder-led companies, those moves often reflect worldview as much as strategy,\" LeBlanc said. \"Geography has become part of executive messaging.\"",

    "title": "FCC Chair Brendan Carr calls Stephen Colbert's censorship concerns 'fake news'",
    "description": "FCC Chair Brendan Carr addressed Stephen Colbert's claims that CBS pulled a Democratic lawmaker's interview over federal regulatory concerns.",
    "fullText": "Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said it's \"fake news\" to suggest that the government pressured CBS to pull a Democratic lawmaker's interview from Stephen Colbert's \"The Late Show\" earlier this week.\n\nCarr addressed the latest flash point moment between broadcasters and the FCC in his Wednesday remarks during the commission's February open meeting, saying there was \"no censorship by the government here.\"\n\nSpeaking to Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Wednesday evening, Carr doubled down, describing the incident as \"Democrat on Democrat violence,\" rather than evidence that the commission had pressured CBS not to air the interview.\n\nInstead, Carr said, CBS's advice to \"The Late Show\" not to air an interview with James Talarico, a Democratic Texas state representative running for a hotly contested US Senate seat, was an appropriate response to prevent the commission from enforcing its equal time rule.\n\nThe equal time rule requires TV and radio broadcast stations to provide equivalent airtime opportunities to legally qualified political candidates, or risk fines or, potentially, the revocation of their broadcast license. The rule does not apply to bona fide newscasts, interviews, or on-the-spot news.\n\nThe rule has rarely been applied in recent decades. Broadcasters had generally understood a 2006 FCC ruling to mean that interviews on daytime and late-night talk shows were exempt from the rule. However, the FCC said in revised guidance sent to stations last month that \"This is not the case.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Colbert and other establishment Democrats want to put the thumb on the scale in this Democrat primary for one candidate over the other,\" Carr told Ingraham. \"I don't know, you'll have to ask them, but we're going to enforce the law and hold broadcasters accountable.\"\n\nCarr told reporters during the FCC's open meeting that the commission was pursuing \"enforcement actions\" against the talk show \"The View\" over its broadcast of an interview with Talarico.\n\n\"What we're doing now is simply applying the law on the books in an even-handed manner, and for people that benefited from a two-tier system of justice during the Biden years, they may feel like that's weaponization, but that doesn't make it so,\" Carr told Ingraham.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox News, CBS, The Late Show, and the campaigns of Talarico and primary opponent Jasmine Crockett did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. The FCC pointed to Carr's remarks during the open meeting when reached for comment.\n\nCBS previously said in a statement that it did not specifically prohibit \"The Late Show\" from broadcasting the interview, but that it did provide the show with legal guidance.\n\nColbert, who has hosted \"The Late Show\" since 2015, told his viewers on Monday that CBS lawyers said \"in no uncertain terms\" that his late-night talk show could not air the interview with Talarico. He also said he was told not to acknowledge the decision on air, which prompted his decision to post the interview on YouTube.\n\nRep. Crockett, a Democrat running against Talarico, said during a Tuesday appearance on \"The Briefing with Jen Psaki\" likely gave her primary rival a \"boost.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday social media post, Talarico's campaign confirmed that the fervor around the incident had a positive effect, saying it had raised $2.5 million in 24 hours after the Colbert interview was scrapped.",

    "description": "DoorDash offers more choice than Amazon by working with a wider range of grocery chains, CEO Tony Xu said during the company's Q4 earnings call.",
    "fullText": "DoorDash CEO Tony Xu says that his company's grocery offering has a key advantage over Amazon: choice.\n\nAmazon is doubling down on grocery delivery, especially perishables like produce and ice cream. The retail and tech giant said last month that it's expanding same- and next-day grocery delivery to more parts of the US this year, adding to the thousands of towns and cities it already serves — news that sent shares of Instacart and DoorDash tumbling at the time.\n\nDoorDash, though, has something that shoppers want and that Amazon isn't replicating, Xu said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike Amazon, which owns Whole Foods and several of its own food brands, DoorDash works with existing grocery chains. The delivery service has struck deals in recent years. Last year, it expanded its partnership with Kroger and signed new deals with regional chains, including Schnucks in the Midwest.\n\nFew customers complete all their grocery shopping at a single chain, Xu said. Many stop at multiple stores each week, especially to find specific fresh groceries, such as produce, meat, and seafood.\n\n\"Consumers prefer choice,\" Xu said on the call, adding that he expects there to \"continue to be very strong interest in the DoorDash product\" as a result.\n\nDoorDash is also expanding its services for retailers, such as fulfillment through its DashMarts, convenience store-sized retail spaces designed for picking and delivering orders.\n\nXu said DoorDash is \"doing that for every single grocer so that they have the capability to compete against companies like Amazon.\"\n\nDoorDash shares rose as much as 14% in after-market trading on Wednesday, despite disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and guidance for 2026. The company's stock took its biggest one-day hit in November after it unveiled plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on tech improvements.\n\nWhile DoorDash has become known for restaurant deliveries, its gig workers are increasingly making grocery deliveries — many of which make more financial sense for DoorDash.\n\nXu said DoorDash has attracted more big grocery orders from customers, not just small fill-in trips. That matters in the grocery industry, where grocers tend to make more money when customers buy a wider range of goods.\n\n\"People use us for both the quick runs as well as the stock-up use cases,\" he said.\n\nRavi Inukonda, DoorDash's CFO, said on the call that DoorDash's retail and grocery business expects to \"be unit-economic positive\" in the second half of 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta is deepening its ties to Nvidia in a move that could further pressure Intel and AMD, even as AI demand remains strong.",
    "fullText": "Meta is doubling down on its relationship with Nvidia in what the AI chip giant called a \"multigenerational\" deal.\n\nThe agreement, announced Tuesday, calls for Meta to build data centers powered by millions of Nvidia's current and next-generation chips for AI training and inference.\n\nThe move underscores how Meta is deepening its reliance on Nvidia, even as the social networking giant develops its own in-house chips and works with competing suppliers like AMD. Reports also suggested Meta has explored using TPUs — chips designed by its rival, Google.\n\nThe Nvidia deal could cool speculation around Meta's purported TPU talks, said Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy — though Big Tech companies often test several suppliers at the same time.\n\nThe deal arrives amid increased competition in AI infrastructure. While Nvidia leads the market, rivals including Google, AMD, and Broadcom are working to chip away at its dominance.\n\nCrucially, the partnership will see Meta deploy not only Nvidia's GPUs, but also CPUs.\n\nCPUs, long dominated by Intel and AMD, are the central processors that work with GPUs inside data centers. They're used for general computing tasks and are core to essentially all modern computing systems, whereas GPUs are used in specialized cases that require more compute power, such as AI training and graphics in gaming. By supplying both, Nvidia stands to capture even more spend and deepen its role within Meta's AI stack.\n\nWhile that increases competitive pressure, Moorhead said the demand for infrastructure has become so high that Nvidia's rivals will unlikely see outright declines in the near term.\n\nNvidia has been making its CPU ambitions more explicit, Moorhead said, including marketing its forthcoming Vera CPU as a stand-alone product. This emphasis reflects how CPUs play a larger role as AI workloads move beyond model training and toward inference.\n\n\"CPUs tend to be cheaper and a bit more power-efficient for inference,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group.\n\nBoth Moorhead and Enderle said that Meta's decision to source both GPUs and CPUs from a single vendor can also reduce complexity, with chief information officers often favoring a \"one-throat-to-choke\" approach to problem resolution.\n\nIn addition to GPUs and CPUs, Meta will use Nvidia's networking equipment inside data centers as part of the deal, as well as its confidential computing technology to run AI features within WhatsApp.\n\nThe companies will also work together to deploy Nvidia's next-generation Vera CPUs beyond the current Grace CPU model, Nvidia said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "8 luxury crossbody bags that are worth the splurge, according to style editors",
    "description": "I prefer crossbody bags for their comfort and convenience. These luxury picks stood out for their beautiful materials and thoughtful design details.",
    "fullText": "I was standing in a shivering mass of well-dressed spectators in the Upper East Side this past New York Fashion Week. Among them I noticed a subtle trend: accessories with a practical edge, like deep pockets, adjustable fastenings, and an emphasis on comfort.\n\nLuxury crossbody bags embody this utilitarian aesthetic. You can sling one on and carry it hands-free, and because their weight is distributed more evenly than with a shoulder bag, they're also the most comfortable travel purse.\n\nBeyond their high-quality materials and stylish designs, our favorite luxury crossbody bags we've tested also come with intuitive pockets to keep you organized whether you're exploring a new city, running a quick errand, or attending a formal event.\n\nI used to be the type who would stuff everything in my pockets so I wouldn't have to hold anything while I'm out. But since investing in the form and function of a luxury crossbody bag, I can see the appeal of being a purse girl. Here are 8 splurge-worthy styles that will work hard while adding intrigue to your outfit.\n\nSee \n\nI brought along this luxury crossbody bag from Parisa Wang when I traveled to Rhode Island for my best friend's wedding. Parisa Wang partners with artisans who typically work with top luxury brands like The Row and Prada, and you can tell by the elite craftsmanship. It starts at the very bottom with tiny gold feet that protects the yummy chocolate suede from coming into contact with the floor.\n\nOn its sides are slip pockets that snap shut on their own with a satisfying magnetic closure, and inside is a wide main compartment where you can easily fit a variety of bulbous items (overpackers rejoice). The long strap is removable, so I carried it is as a handbag anytime I wasn't wearing it slung over my shoulder.\n\nThe Gabrielle comes in two larger sizes, as described by style editor Samantha Crozier in our guide to the best work bags for women. \"The Gabrielle 35 looks and feels like the ultra-coveted suede Margaux bag from The Row, which will run you $5K or more,\" she writes. '\"But dare I say that the Gabrielle is cuter?\"\n\nThis brand is literally fit for royals, as it's been spotted on Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. It's not a traditional work bag — you won't find a padded laptop sleeve or built-in tech compartments — but the Strathberry Tote is considered a holy grail over on the Reddit's r/handbags forum as a luxury office purse.\n\nThe mid-tier luxury brand has a reputation for delivering exceptional materials and meticulous construction at a price that, while still a splurge, feels justified in the luxury space. Each Strathberry bag takes an artisan at least 20 hours to complete, and that care is evident the moment you see it up close. The stitching is precise, the leather feels rich and substantial, and the suede lining is soft to the touch.\n\nIts signature music bar hardware is weighty, polished, and unmistakably luxe — the kind of detail that elevates even the simplest outfit. It also comes in Midi and Mini sizes.\n\nTravel writer Maria Yagoda tested the best travel purses, where this versatile Lo & Sons bag came out on top. \n\n\"The interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder,\" according to Maria.\n\n\"In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options,\" she continues.\n\n\"The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable.\"\n\nMy own favorite part about the Aoyama is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder. Just don't get the Ivory colorway, since I found it stains more easily.\n\nRead \n\n\"KAAI's Rebel Crossbody is the Rolex of functional purses,\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. The Belgian brand created this luxury crossbody bag with a unique, asymmetrical design and a long strap that can easily fit over a puffy jacket.\n\n\"Like all of KAAI's beautifully made bags, it's lined with a blue suede material that feels luxurious to the touch. On the outside, the single-source leather is treated to be resistant to weather and stains. This is super important to me, since I wouldn't carry a bag this nice outside without trusting how well the leather can stand up to the elements. But all my KAAI bags have remained like-new, even though they're some of my most used pieces,\" continues Samantha.\n\n\"The only issue with this bag is that it is relatively narrow and structured, so you won't be able to stuff it,\" she advises. \"A phone, wallet, lipstick, and keys fit perfectly, but anything bulky or irregular would prevent the bag from closing.\"\n\nI tested the Petite version of one of Clare V's bestselling styles, the Moyen Messenger. The Petit is one of my favorite crossbody bags I own, but the larger size has a more practical advantage with the same relaxed, woven leather look. And I know this bag is a hot commodity because sure enough, Quince has its own dupe. \n\nClare V. is a Los Angeles-based brand that makes what I call 'character bags.' You can build an outfit around them and make them your own with their extensive collection of interchangeable straps. I'm not a huge bag charm person myself, but the D-rings on this luxury crossbody make it the perfect backdrop for colorful key chains.\n\nThe medium-sized Moyen Messenger comes with two straps, so you can wear it as a shoulder bag or a crossbody. It has a slouchy, curved construction like the hobo bags that are making a return. Even better: the soft, flexible leather lies flat, so I'm easily able to pack it in my carry-on.\n\nThe Mini Maestra from Senreve takes modular design to another level. This 4-in-1 luxury crossbody can also be worn as a tote, satchel, or backpack, depending on whatever you need it to be. The top features a flap and the Senreve's signature studded belt closure, and inside is a zipper to secure your belongings. \n\nExecutive editor Sally Kaplan tested out the full-sized Maestra as a luxury work bag and confirmed it to be worth the splurge. Besides its fashion-forward shape, the 100% leather is seriously high-quality. It comes in both pebbled and long-grain finishes, and inside it's lined with smooth suede. This premium leather is also water-repellent, so you can wear it out in the rain without fussing over stains. Plus, it comes with a lifetime warranty.\n\nSee similar styles in our guide to the best convertible backpack tote bags.\n\nI was inspired to test out this style when I was getting ready to go out with my friend, and she asked me if my bag was a Polène. In fact, it was from Quince. But when a Quince dupe can pass for French luxury, it makes me skeptical that the real deal could be any good to begin with.\n\nInstead, I was happily proven wrong. The 'Cognac' shade of the Numéro Dix is the perfect color for people who wear similar gourmand shades like chocolate and almond. It's made with a single panel of structured, full-grain leather that has a deliciously rich sheen.\n\nIt also beats out the Quince dupe in terms of storage capacity. Because the crescent shape has a flared base, I can fill it from the bottom up with my everyday carry. I've only worn mine as a crossbody or shoulder bag, but it also converts to a belt bag and the adjustable strap extension means it can fit a tall frame. There's now a JW Pei dupe of the same style.\n\nThe real Numéro Dix feels worth the splurge because it's a true heritage piece and the materials are primed to age gracefully. The simple, stylish shape puts an elevated twist on the contemporary saddle silhouette.\n\n\"Despite its teeny-tiny silhouette, this miniature crossbody can hold a surprising amount of items,\" writes freelance style reporter Talia Ergas. If you're getting your looks together for vacation season, Talia found the artisan-made Milaner Grazia Mini to be the perfect little clutch for tying your whole outfit together.\n\n\"My iPhone fits effortlessly across the bottom, and there's plenty of room for my sunglasses, a small wallet, and some odds and ends like mints and a chapstick,\" Talia writes. \"I love this hand-woven leather bag because it has the elegance of a clutch with the ease and comfort of a crossbody bag. The strap is removable, though, which is convenient for occasions when I might prefer to swap in its shorter strap for a wristlet.\"\n\nYou can tell a luxury crossbody bag by its intuitive design details, artisan-level craftsmanship, and longevity. Our favorites are typically made from high-quality leather — like full-grain or pebbled Italian leather — and feature precise stitching, durable hardware, and thoughtfully-placed pockets. The result is a versatile accessory that will age gracefully despite regular wear.\n\nBetween small and medium is best if you want something to comfortably weigh on your shoulder. A small bag that's about 8 inches wide will fit only the essentials, but be more streamlined to carry. Medium crossbody bags of about 14 inches offer a bit more space for a small tablet or a bulky sunglasses case.\n\nA luxury crossbody bag typically uses higher-quality materials — like full-grain leather, suede lining, and solid metal accents — that hold up significantly better over time. Cheaper bags will instead use bonded leather or flimsy hardware that can peel, scratch, or tarnish quickly. If you carry a bag daily, think about in terms of cost-per-wear. The durability of a luxury crossbody bag will prove itself in the long run.\n\nCrossbodies are already practical by design — they keep your hands free, and many of our favorites can be converted into a shoulder bag. A luxury version elevates that functionality with easy-to-carry proportions, reinforced stitching, smooth straps that don't dig into your shoulder, and scratch-resistant, water-repellent materials.\n\nYes. As someone who used to try and carry everything in my pockets, I found that luxury crossbody bags are the easiest gateway into stylish personal organization — especially if you prefer a lighter load. A well-designed crossbody prioritizes smart compartments and a streamlined shape, so you don't feel the bulk as you go about your business.\n\nRead how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "title": "What Are Heart Rate Zones, and How Can You Find Yours?",
    "description": "For when you need to be in \"zone 2\" and have no idea what that is.",
    "fullText": "Heart rate zones are a way to describe how hard you're working during a cardio workout, like running or cycling. The faster your heart beats, the harder you're working. So an easy jog might have you in zone 2 for a whole workout, while a HIIT workout might have you bouncing between zones 1 and 5. Read on for a breakdown of what heart rate zones are, how to use them, and some of the caveats you should know when you're training this way.\n\nOne quick thing before we dive in: Heart rate zones are for cardio. Cardio means exercise that involves doing the same rhythmic movement over and over, like running or swimming or stair climbing. Heart rate zones mean nothing for strength training, even if you have an app or watch that reports them to you as if they matter.\n\nWhen you do cardio, your heart has to beat faster to get nutrients and oxygen to your muscles. Your heart rate is the number of time your heart beats in each minute. So if you can easily measure your heart rate—which fitness watches and trackers can—then you have a number that tells you how hard you're working.\n\nThe exact numbers you'll see for hard and easy workouts are different for everybody, so we have the idea of heart rate \"zones.\" Depending on exactly how your watch or app calculates it, you might see something like a \"zone 2\" when your heart rate is between 50% and 70% of maximum. A workout that goes a bit harder might put you into zone 3. In many systems the highest zone, for the very hardest parts of the hardest workouts, is zone 5.\n\nOnce you know your zones, you can follow workouts or targets for those zones. For example, you might go jogging and try to keep your heart rate in zone 2 for 30 minutes. Then on another day, you might do a workout that aims to have you cycling hard in zone 4 for several minutes at a time, with recovery time where you pedal easy in zone 1.\n\nEach zone has its benefits. Most commonly you'll hear people talking about the low-fatigue aerobic work of zone 2, or the benefits of tempo work that mostly happens in zone 4. But there's a lot to be said for getting a variety of work in all different zones. Every zone is good for you, even the zone 3 that is sometimes incorrectly painted as a \"gray zone\" where nothing happens. (Hot take: Zone 3 is great and most of us could use a little more of it.)\n\nBefore I tell you how to find and use your zones, I'm going to start with a huge caveat. You may hear everybody talking about zone this and zone that, but if you're new to exercise or new to heart rate tracking, you're actually better off ignoring zones for a while. Pay more attention to how you feel. A workout that's meant to be easy should feel easy, regardless of what number is on your heart rate monitor. A workout that's meant to be hard should feel hard.\n\nOver time, if you watch your heart rate during exercise, you'll start to notice which numbers go with which feelings. Knowing that you see (for example) 140 on your watch when you're in the middle of an easy workout means a lot more than knowing that your device considers it to be \"zone 2.\"\n\nZone workouts are hard for beginners to follow, for a few reasons:\n\nYour zones may be hard to stay in, especially the lower zones like zone 2. If your heart rate skyrockets into zone 4 as soon as you start to jog, a zone 2 jog may just not be possible right now.\n\nYour zones may not be properly calibrated. You need an accurate max heart rate to set your zones properly (more on that below), and an age-based formula is not guaranteed to be correct.\n\nYou have more important things to do than stick to zones! Your body needs to learn technique, pacing, and all kinds of physical and psychological skills. Every brain cell you spend on obsessing over zones is a brain cell that's not available for the more important tasks before you.\n\nRemember, the reason your watch tells you your heart rate is because that's something that is easy for the watch to measure and display—not because it's the most important thing for you to pay attention to.\n\nThere isn't just one heart rate zone system! There are dozens, if not hundreds. Some have three zones, some four, some five, and some even more. Even when two apps or wearables use a five-zone system, they don't necessarily set the boundaries of the zones in the same places. For example, some systems will set \"zone 2\" at 60% to 70% of your max heart rate, while others will use 65% to 75%.\n\nThe different systems also don't agree on what those percentages are of. Sometimes it's maximum heart rate, which we'll discuss below; sometimes it's heart rate reserve, which also takes your resting heart rate into account. Less commonly, you might find zones based around other metrics like lactate threshold.\n\nI know you're not going to be happy until you see me set out a chart of numbers, so here goes. This is not the only zone system out there, but it's one that works decently well for most purposes, and you'll find versions of it in several different apps and wearables. It's not the best, but it is perhaps the simplest. You'll need to know your maximum heart rate (MHR), and then you can take percentages of that to know your zones:\n\nZone 1: 50% to 60% of your maximum heart rate (MHR), though some systems will go up to 65%\n\nZone 2: 61% to 70% of MHR; some systems will go up to 75%\n\nZone 3: 71% to 80%, or it might be more like 76% to 85%\n\nZone 4: 80% to 90%, or sometimes 85% to 95%\n\nIn these systems, zone 1 is for warmups or very easy recovery between intervals. Zone 2 is for easy aerobic training, like a light jog—something you could keep up for hours if you're reasonably fit. Zone 3 is for stuff that feels like a medium intensity, like a faster jog, something that would tire you out to do for more than an hour, but you can keep it up pretty steadily. Zone 4 is when things get intense, usually for just a few minutes at a time, and you’ll only bump in zone 5 for a few seconds during your hardest intervals. You can’t sustain work in zone 5 for much longer than that.\n\nNow that you know the zones, you’re only missing one thing: your maximum heart rate, which forms the basis for them all.\n\nCommonly, these systems will recommend you subtract your age from the number 220 to find your max heart rate. Occasionally they’ll use another formula. But these formulas are often wrong, since they give a single number for everybody at the same age. We're supposed to believe all 43-year-olds have a max heart rate of 177, but in reality there are plenty of 43-year-olds with a max heart rate over 200, and it's not rare to find some 43-year-olds with a max heart rate in the 150s. (Similar caveats apply to any age.) The person with the 200 max will wonder why they're always in \"zone 4\" when they feel like they're in zone 2, and the person with the 150 max will wonder why they feel like they're dying when they're in \"zone 3.\"\n\nSo don't rely on a formula, especially if you're seeing zones that don't make sense for how a workout felt. Ideally you’ll do a max heart rate test as I describe here, or make an educated guess by looking up the highest heart rate that your device recorded during one of your hardest workouts.\n\nYou can do a little reality check on your zones by making sure they feel right. Here's what they should feel like:\n\nZone 1 will feel very easy, barely like you’re exercising at all.\n\nIn zone 2, you’ll start to feel hot and sweaty, but you can still easily carry on a conversation.\n\nIn zone 3, your breathing will get a bit heavier. The lower end of zone 3 is still conversational, but toward the top of this zone you’ll only be able to say a few words at a time.\n\nIn zone 4, you’re working hard and not in the mood to talk, but you probably feel like you could keep this effort up for a while—or a few more minutes at least.\n\nZone 5 is your absolute top speed, and you can only stand it for a few grueling seconds.\n\nIf you aren’t sure of your max heart rate, try using this effort-level guide for a while. When you actually do get to a workout that calls for zone 5, give it your all—then check your heart rate monitor to see what number it gave you.\n\nI have more on zone 2 here, including what it is, how to do it, and why it might be just a teensy bit overrated. Zone 2 refers to an easy effort that you can carry on basically forever. If you're a beginner, walking might be a zone 2 workout. For an athlete, zone 2 might be a brisk jog that they could keep up for a few hours. The best marker of a zone 2 workout is that you stop because time is up, not because you're too tired to continue.\n\nThere's nothing special about staying in zone 2, except that it's low-fatigue and so you can do a lot of it. If you find your heart rate inching up into zone 3, that's honestly totally fine. The more exercise you do, the more you have to pay attention to the intensity of it. Athletes who are exercising 10 hours every week need to make sure that some of those workouts are easy ones. But if you're getting in a few 30-minute jogs or exercises classes, any intensity is fine so long as you end most workouts feeling good and not totally exhausted.",

    "title": "My Favorite Ways to Upgrade a Laundry Room on a Budget",
    "description": "Laundry rooms can be grim, utilitarian places—but they don’t have to be.",
    "fullText": "As anyone who’s ever had to schlep their dirty linens to a laundromat knows, having in-house laundry is a godsend. But the convenience of doing laundry whenever you feel like it starts to feel less convenient if you're lacking in the necessary storage, shelving, or work space. If a total laundry room renovation isn't in the budget, though, don't fret: You can upgrade your home's laundry hub with just a few relatively inexpensive additions. Combined with some fresh paint and some other low-cost improvements, you can have a more beautiful and functional laundry area on a small budget.\n\nIf you’ve got a separate washer and dryer setup in your laundry area, picking up some appliance pedestals with built-in drawers is an easy way to add some useful storage. You’ll need to measure vertically in your laundry space to make sure you’ve got the required height, and you’ll probably need some help moving and lifting the appliances into place. But once that’s done, you’ll not only have a place to store all those unsightly bottles of detergent and other stuff, it will be easier to load and unload your clothes because you won’t have to bend down so far.\n\nIf your laundry area is its own room with a door, you can maximize your storage space by adding a slim shelving unit behind the door. It will be just deep enough to hold all your laundry materials, cleaning up the area without taking up any valuable floor space.\n\nIf your laundry area lacks storage, you’ve got a few options. One of the easiest things you can do is to add a countertop over your washer and dryer set. This could be as DIY as cutting a slab of wood or using a leftover remnant from a kitchen remodel, or you could purchase a topper with edge rails like this one. This instantly transforms the top of your appliances into a usable flat surface that won’t let things slide off as soon as you turn your back. If you have more vertical space and need more options, a tiered over-the-appliance shelf system is a great option, giving you multiple shelves plus hanging rods to get everything off the floor and organized.\n\nEven if you only iron your clothes once in a while, having a real ironing board makes a huge difference, and having that ironing board conveniently located near your laundry is ideal. If you have nothing but space, you can just have a board set up, of course, but if you don’t have a ton of space, or you’re just looking to keep the place tidy, you could opt for an over-the-door ironing board or a wall-mounted version like this. The board folds up when not in use, but is always easily accessible.\n\nIf you want a fancy version, you could install the Iron-A-Way Ironing Center, which is pricey and probably requires professional installation, as it’s designed to recess into the wall and connect to the home’s power.\n\nHaving a utility sink in the laundry area is great—it lets you rinse out clothes, clean up detergent spills, and wet-scrub stains right there. If your laundry area isn’t plumbed, you might not relish the idea of hiring a plumber to run water and drain lines for a sink—but you don’t have to. This portable sink can give you that basic functionality without any wiring or plumbing. Just fill it with water, charge it using a USB-C cable, and place it in your laundry area to use whenever you need it.\n\nIt’s a simple addition, but having a place to hang clothes to dry right there in the laundry area is a great convenience. You can buy a freestanding drying rack, of course, but as an upgrade, consider a wall-mounted option instead. This one from mDesign looks great and folds up when not in use.\n\nDispensing liquid detergent can get messy, and when you’re in a rush, those measurements can get sloppy, too, leaving you with insufficient detergent for the load or wasting detergent, running up your costs. This rechargeable electronic detergent dispenser fits on top of most plastic detergent bottles and dispenses precise amounts of detergent with the touch of a button. If that’s a bit too fancy for your laundry area, you could pick up a cheap dispenser cup holder like this to make it a little easier and neater to fill your detergent cups.\n\nIf you need some folding and storage space in your laundry area but there’s no vertical or wall options, take some inspiration from your kitchen and bring in a freestanding island or laundry cart. This one from Kitsorack is a clothes hamper with a shelf, so you can stuff your dirty clothes in there and have your supplies stored on top, but any mobile cart or island will make your laundry area more usable.",

    "description": "Meta is weighing facial recognition for its Ray-Ban smart glasses, raising serious privacy concerns.",
    "fullText": "According to a New York Times report, Meta plans to add facial recognition technology to its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses. The feature, called “Name Tag” within Meta, would allow users to identify people and get information about them through Meta's AI. The feature could be rolling out as early as this year.\n\nAdding the feature is not a done deal, however. According to an internal document cited by The Times, the company is weighing the “safety and privacy risks\" of introducing facial recognition as well as discussing how to navigate the response to a no-doubt controversial feature.\n\nA document quoted by The Times suggests Meta is deliberately timing a potential rollout to minimize scrutiny. “We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document from Meta’s Reality Labs reads.\n\nThis would not be the first time Meta dabbled in facial recognition. Meta debated adding facial recognition to the first generation of its Ray-Ban smart glasses in 2021, but decided against it due to privacy concerns. And Facebook, Meta's social media platform, identified and tagged people as early as 2010, but the company pulled the feature in 2021, citing \"many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society.”\n\nConcerns also include the risk of doxxing. The ACLU characterized facial recognition used by law enforcement as a \"systematic invasion of privacy,\" though personal use of the technology raises different issues. Facial recognition glasses could enable instant doxxing, linking anyone's face to publicly available information, including social media profiles, addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nMeta says it isn't planning to release a universal facial recognition tool. The company is considering glasses that identify only people a user knows based on their connection on a Meta platform, or only identify people who have a public account on a Meta site like Instagram. \"While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature—and some products already exist in the market—we’re still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,\" Meta said in a statement.\n\nPrivacy concerns aside, the technology has genuinely beneficial applications, particularly to people with vision problems. According to The Times' report, Meta originally planned to introduce Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the blind before releasing it to the public, highlighting a group that could potentially benefit from facial recognition technology, though that plan was scrapped for unknown reasons.\n\nMike Buckley, CEO of Be My Eyes, an accessibility technology company that works closely with Meta, said he has been in discussions with Meta about facial recognition glasses for more than a year. “It is so important and powerful for this group of humans,” Buckley told The Times.",

    "description": "This is a great chance to get the latest budget-friendly Pixel.",
    "fullText": "Google is releasing their budget a-series version of the Pixel 10 on March 5, a whole month earlier than the 9a was released in 2025. There is not much dividing the 10a from the 9a, but there are a few software updates that can make it worth it for some people. Throw in a $100 Amazon gift card, and it's hard to say no. Google has the pre-orders for the Google 10a out already, going for $499, plus the gift card. Alternatively, you can get their Pixel Buds 2a instead of the $100 gift card for the same $499 price.\n\nLifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt actually got her hands on the Pixel 10a during a recent Google demo event. As she pointed out, the specs on the Pixel 10a are not like the Pixel 10. It's more similar to the 9 instead. It has a Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage, as well as the same camera system, with a 48MP main lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera. The battery life is the same 30+ hours, too, and the MagSafe-like Pixelsnap feature is gone. The main upgrade here is a brighter 3,000 nits screen, a thinner bezel, and an improved Corning Gorilla Glass 7i cover glass. But the value might be in the software and AI.\n\nThere are two AI camera features that debuted with the Pixel 10. One is Auto Best Take, which takes 150 frames in one click, chooses the best picture, and automatically deletes the rest (or stitches together elements from multiple shots to make a new \"best\" image). And Camera Coach, which guides you with AI on how to take the best picture. Google also brought Satellite SOS for the first time to an a-series phone. It lets you connect to a Satellite and ping emergency services for help if you have no cell signal.\n\nIf you're thinking of upgrading from a Pixel 9a or later, there's not much here to make it worth it. However, if you have anything older than a Pixel 9 or are switching to Pixel for the first time, this is a great opportunity and phone to do so.",

    "title": "My Favorite 'Glances' From Garmin’s Latest Software Update",
    "description": "Garmin added sleep alignment, lifestyle logging, and battery usage, plus new training plans.",
    "fullText": "A new software update for recent Garmin watches adds “glances” for types of data that weren’t previously viewable from the watch face. These include battery usage stats, lifestyle logging, sleep alignment, and even a few extras like sports scores. The update also includes features other than glances, including, notably, fitness coaching. The features I’m writing about are now available in the Forerunner 570, Forerunner 970, and Vivoactive 6, as well as the Fenix 8 series, Venu 4, and X1. (The watch in my photos here is a Forerunner 570.)\n\nGlances are those little strips of data that you can see when you scroll up (or down) from the main watch face—things like the weather and your training status, for example. Garmin’s newest stable update for the Forerunner 570 and 970 is numbered 16.28, and has been rolling out slowly over the past week. (I just got it on my 570.) Here are my favorite new glances:\n\nBattery usage: The new battery widget has the charge level, of course, but tapping it shows you a graph of your battery life, including its long-term history, and a list of which apps or functions have been using the most battery.\n\nLifestyle logging: If you’ve been using the new Lifestyle Logging feature in the Garmin Connect app, you can now do it from your wrist. This is where you select a few health-related habits to track every day. The glance will tell you how many items you’ve logged today, and you can quickly answer these yes or no questions without opening your phone.\n\nSleep alignment: The sleep glance has been around a while, but it now includes more data, including your optimal sleep window and whether you’re aligned with it.\n\nSports scores: You can select a handful of your favorite teams to receive up to date scores on your wrist. This was surprisingly easy to set up without even unlocking my phone: You just choose a league (MLB, NFL, NCAA men’s or women’s, to name a few) and then scroll until you find the city name for your favorite team. Alphabetizing by city rather than team name is smart, especially if you’re going through the menus picking all your hometown teams. This widget seems to show the next upcoming game if your chosen team hasn’t played a recent game.\n\nWeight tracking: From this glance you can see your current body weight, and tap through to see trends and history.\n\nBesides the glances, Garmin added a bunch of other features to its watches. According to the release notes, Garmin says that pace readings (presumably during runs) have been improved to be more responsive. I look forward to trying that out. There are also color filters—instead of just turning on a red shift for nighttime, you can choose other colors as well.\n\nTraining plans also get more capabilities. In addition to the usual running and cycling plans, there’s now a fitness coach, similar to what launched on the Venu 4. This lets you set up a plan that gives you a mix of cardio and strength workouts, though I found that the coach's endurance workouts don’t actually specify the activity. Typically, when selecting my “basic endurance” workout that’s planned for today, the watch prompts me to select from my usual list of endurance activities: run, trail run, treadmill run, indoor bike, and so on. The coach, however, will simply tell you to do \"endurance\" or \"cardio\" for 20 minutes. You could choose to run, but you could also hike or use the elliptical, for instance.\n\nFor the strength workouts, I told the coach that I have access to a full gym, so my next strength workout will include deadlifts and squats. It looks like a pretty solid plan for somebody who wants well-rounded fitness without committing to running a race.",

    "title": "Google I/O 2026: How to Watch and What We Know so Far",
    "description": "Google is prepping to reveal new features in May.",
    "fullText": "Google I/O 2026 is nearly upon us. This is Google's annual opportunity to showcase the software features (and perhaps some of the hardware) the company has been cooking up behind the scenes. Like other big tech keynotes, anyone can tune in live and catch Google's latest announcements as they happen. Here's when Google I/O 2026 will kick off, and what we know about the conference at this time.\n\nGoogle tends to kick off its I/O event in May of each year, and 2026 is no different. This year, Google I/O will run May 19 through May 20. If you're used to watching one single livestream, that two-day schedule might come as a surprise. But I/O isn't just an announcement: It's a developer conference, spanning keynotes, demos, and product sessions.\n\nBut if you're only interested in the company's main keynote, you'll want to get May 19 on your calendar. Google hasn't announced the exact time for its presentation, but it usually starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET), based on previous years.\n\nWhile Google invites a select group of journalists to watch its presentations live, and encourages developers to register to attend its various events, you can tune into the livestream wherever you are in the world. Google hasn't confirmed where its livestreams will be hosted this year, but looking to the past, you'll likely be able to stream the keynote from the official I/O website, as well as Google's official YouTube channel.\n\nThe short answer? We don't really know! Google is keeping I/O news close to the vest, and rumors haven't been particularly prolific this year—at least, not yet. Seeing as it's only February, it's entirely possible we'll hear more about Google I/O 2026 as we get closer to May.\n\nThat said, there are some things you can expect to see regardless of leaks and rumors. Android 17 will almost assuredly take center stage at Google I/O this year. Google just released first beta for the OS on Wednesday, though it doesn't change all that much about Android 16 at this time. That said, I suspect beta testers will discover a number of new features and changes between now and May, as Google continues to add new things to its test software ahead I/O.\n\nLike the past couple of I/O's, this year should also be all about AI. Google seems to come out with new AI announcements multiple times a week, including adding its Lyria 3 AI music model to Gemini, or adding an agentic bot to Chrome to browse the internet for you. I expect Google I/O 2026 to be full of AI features—perhaps more than some of us would like to hear about.\n\nI/O 2026 could also show off some hardware, but that's no guarantee. Google did just announce the Pixel 10a, the company's latest \"budget\" phone, and it could reveal other devices in May, but I/O really is more about the software than the hardware. (It is a developer conference, after all.)",

    "title": "Apple Is Adding ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to CarPlay in iOS 26.4",
    "description": "You'll need to wait for a new update to try it.",
    "fullText": "When Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.4 this week, testers immediately got to work looking for each and every new feature and change. To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\n\nAs spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.\n\nAccording to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant.\n\nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n\nThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.",

I played well for a lot of it but made some big numbers which put me out of contention on Sunday.\n\n\"I feel there is enough good in there for me to be encouraged going out there this week.\n\n\"I think the fact that I'm hitting a lot of good shots, putting it close and converting a lot of putts, that has to give me confidence not just for this week but going forward.\"\n\nMcIlroy's best finish in the tournament came four years ago when he ended in joint 10th.\n\nMcIlroy practised on Wednesday on the Riviera course, which includes a change to the par-three fourth hole.\n\nIt has been extended from 237 yards to 273 yards and the Northern Irishman is not a fan of the change.\n\n\"I don't think it plays any differently, you're just hitting a slightly longer club - actually I think it's a horrible change.\n\n\"Fifteen percent of the field hit the green last time when it played 230. If you want it to be a 275 par-three you have to change the apron leading up on to the green.\n\n\"It can't be kikuyu, it has to be another type of grass that can help you run it on to the green.\n\n\"Because in the right conditions you try to fly it on to the green with a three iron it's going to finish up on the fifth tee box.\n\n\"That's sort of what I mean that it's not a great change.\"",

    "fullText": "Scotland's incredible dismantling of England prompted joyous scenes among their fans, but also left a familiar question hanging in the air - can they back it up?\n\nThe Scots have now beaten England nine times in the Six Nations, with the first victory in 2000 coming in the final round of the Championship.\n\nFollowing six of the other eight triumphs, Scotland have gone on to lose their next match.\n\nWhich brings us to Principality Stadium on Saturday. Round three and an opportunity for Scotland to properly put themselves in the mix for the title.\n\nThe emotional and physical energy expended in delivering these incredible Calcutta Cup victories has proved hard for Scotland to recover from and then replicate.\n\nScotland bounced back brilliantly from the gut punch of defeat to Italy in Rome to dispatch England in sensational fashion, but the memories of the Stadio Olimpico will remain with them, serving as a cautionary tale as they prepare to face a Wales side at a low ebb.\n\n\"We'll obviously be sitting there with Italy in the back of our mind and that performance,\" Scotland second row Scott Cummings said.\n\n\"We know that we can't let our performance dip to that point again. We know that we can push on and we believe we can push on. But the weekend was just a start for us, now we need to back it up.\n\n\"In the nicest way possible, we've beaten England before. We've done this before in the Six Nations quite a few times and we probably haven't backed it up after that, so that's definitely a big focus for us.\"\n\nPodcast: Can Scotland back it up?\n\nScotland trio ruled out for visit to Wales\n\nThe latest Scottish rugby news, views & analysis\n\nCaptain Sione Tuipulotu spoke before the England match about how Scotland were \"a desperate team\" with their Six Nations hopes on the line.\n\nThat desperation for a win surely applies to Wales this weekend.\n\nSteve Tandy, the former Scotland defence coach now in charge of Wales, has watched his side get battered in their opening two matches against England and France.\n\nThey sit bottom of the table having scored only 19 points across two games while conceding 102.\n\nFrance ran riot with eight tries in Cardiff to consign Wales to a 13th consecutive Six Nations defeat.\n\nYet Scotland have had enough bad experiences in Cardiff to never take a victory for granted, even with Welsh rugby in dire straits.\n\n\"I obviously know some of their coaching staff, Steve Tandy and [former Glasgow head coach] Danny Wilson,\" Cummings said.\n\n\"They'll be obviously pretty up for this game, having worked with us in the past.\n\n\"We're expecting a pretty solid, gritty performance from them, and they'll definitely be tough to break down.\n\n\"They're going to be a team that's obviously hurting and, like we were last week, that often brings the best out in teams. So we're expecting a massive fight from them.\n\n\"I want the heat on us. We need to view every single moment as the most important moment of the match. If we don't, then I don't think we'll get the win out of it. So I don't think the pressure's off us.\n\n\"In international rugby, the pressure's always on you to perform well. I think for us it's going to be a massive game, but we're definitely not resting on the weekend being a finished performance.\"",

    "fullText": "There has been a very interesting question on the OSM US Slack lately.\n\n“Does anyone have a method to search through the OSM database for a building of a particular shape? I need assistance finding OSM buildings with this specific shape. They should be located in NJ, DE, northeastern MD, eastern PA, or southern NY.”\n\nThe question quickly exploded into a huge discussion. At the time of writing, there are already 71 replies.\n\n“You could load OSM buildings into PostGIS and then use ST_HausdorffDistance to compare the geometries.”\n\nFrom there, the discussion veered into how to solve that specific puzzle and find the exact OSM building in question.\n\nOne person added, “So the strategy is: create the shape of the building you want to search for, scale it to, say, fill a 100x100 m bounding box or something. Ask Postgres to, within a search-area bounding box, take each building and scale it to a 100x100 m bounding box, compute the Hausdorff distance with the scaled input shape, and return all OSM element IDs and their Hausdorff distances, sorted in ascending order.”\n\nAnother said, “What I’m currently doing is combining several shape exports into a single file with around 20,000 objects that have concavity. Concavity plus more than 10 nodes eliminates most buildings.”\n\nAt that point, instead of hunting that elusive specific OSM building, I became more interested in the generalized version of the problem.\n\nSo I added my two cents to the discussion:\n\n“The generalized version of this problem would be : Can we represent a shape in some kind of data type that allows us to computationally check whether two objects have the same shape, regardless of rotation and scaling?\n\nI haven’t studied the Hausdorff distance yet, but I’m wondering whether it can solve this problem, or if there’s a better alternative—Hu moments, Procrustes analysis, Fourier descriptors for contours…”\n\n“Hu moments are a good option. Elliptic Fourier Descriptors, Shape Context Histograms, Turning functions, etc. I’ve experimented with those four while trying to classify sports pitches more accurately. You can actually get pretty far with just compactness, convexity, and aspect ratio, thankfully.”\n\nDo you have any other ideas on how to solve this problem?",

    "description": "Lyria 3 is now available in the Gemini app. Create custom, high-quality 30-second tracks from text and images.",
    "fullText": "The Gemini app now features our most advanced music generation model Lyria 3, empowering anyone to make 30-second tracks using text or images in beta.\n\nSince launching the Gemini app, we've built tools to encourage creative expression through images and video. Today, we're taking the next step: custom music generation. Lyria 3, Google DeepMind’s latest generative music model, is rolling out today in beta in the Gemini app. Just describe an idea or upload a photo, like “a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" and in a matter of seconds, Gemini will translate it into a high-quality, catchy track. To push the creative envelope further, you can even ask Gemini to take inspiration from something you upload.\n\nLyria 3 improves on audio generation from our Lyria models in three important ways:\n\nThe Gemini app creates 30-second tracks with custom cover art generated by Nano Banana. This makes it easy to quickly share with friends by downloading or simply clicking the share link. The goal of these tracks isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\n\nCreators can also explore Lyria 3 on YouTube’s Dream Track. Available in the U.S. and now rolling out to YouTube creators in other countries, Lyria 3 will enhance the quality of each unique Shorts soundtrack. Whether it's creating a lyrical verse or a vibey backing track, being able to better customize the soundtrack will take creators’ Shorts to the next level.\n\nAll tracks generated in the Gemini app are embedded with SynthID, our imperceptible watermark for identifying Google AI-generated content. We are also giving you more tools to help identify AI content, broadening our verification capabilities in the Gemini app to include audio, along with image and video. Simply upload a file and ask if it was generated using Google AI, and Gemini will check for SynthID and use its own reasoning to return a response.\n\nSince we first launched Lyria in 2023, we've sought to develop this technology responsibly in collaboration with the music community. We've learned a lot through these collaborations and our experiments, like Music AI Sandbox, and have been very mindful of copyright and partner agreements as we've trained Lyria 3.\n\nMusic generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content. We recognize that our approach might not be foolproof, so you can report content that may violate your rights or the rights of others. Additionally, in order to use our products, users must adhere to our Terms of Service and Gen AI prohibited use policies, which prohibit violations of others’ intellectual property and privacy rights.\n\nLyria 3 is available in the Gemini app for all users 18+ in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean and Portuguese, with plans to expand quality and coverage of more languages, rolling out on desktop today and to the mobile app over the next several days. And Google AI Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers will enjoy higher limits.\n\nOur goal with music generation in the Gemini app is to help you add a fun, custom soundtrack to your daily life. Try it out today at gemini.google.com.",

    "fullText": "You're migrating your monolith to microservices. The architecture is already clear: event-driven, async messaging, specific latency requirements. You just need help implementing it. Or you're fixing a bug. You know what's broken and what needs to stay the same. You want a surgical fix. What's the best way to work with an agent to achieve these goals without changing other parts of your app, or wasting tokens going in circles?\n\nWhen we launched Specs and the spec-driven development workflow, we built them around the traditional PM/engineering flow: requirements first, then design, then tasks. This works great for many projects and we’ve seen hundreds of thousands of developers default to this approach when building anything new.\n\nHowever, when we talked to Kiro users, we heard a clear pattern: not everyone starts from requirements. Especially when working on existing, brownfield apps, some developers came in with the technical architecture already mapped out. Others were fixing bugs and needed to carefully define what should change and what shouldn't. They didn't want to give up the structure of specs, but the current flow was not flexible enough for these types of tasks.\n\nWe didn’t want to ask developers to change how they were already approaching these projects, so today, we're shipping two new ways to use Specs: the Design-first workflow and the Bugfix Spec.\n\nWhen we first designed Specs, we were motivated by what Laurence Tratt calls \"the circular specification problem\" and \"the observer effect\" in software development. Tratt identifies a fundamental tension: the only way to know exactly what software we want to build is to fully specify it, but a complete specification is at least as much work as creating the software itself. This creates a catch-22 where we have to build the software to truly specify it. This is wishful thinking, especially for large projects. As Tratt observes, software occupies a \"liminal state\" between fantasy and reality—full of soft constraints that are hard to quantify until you actually build something. The act of creating software is itself an act of specification. That doesn’t mean working with no plan, but reaching a middle-ground that gives you enough structure so you can make progress quickly.\n\nRequirements-first and Design-first are two sides of the same coin, each addressing different aspects of this circular specification problem:\n\nRequirements-first works when you understand the behaviors and outcomes you need, but the technical path is unclear. You're exploring \"what should this do?\" before \"how should it work?\" Great option for net-new projects where your options are open.\n\nDesign-first works when you already have a technical vision—perhaps from experience, architectural constraints, or prototyping—and need to work backward to formalize what that system actually accomplishes. It's like whiteboarding a solution and then summarizing \"what this product does.\" This can apply to building a new feature on top of an existing app - you have to work within your current architecture and tech stack.\n\nBoth approaches embrace iteration and feedback. Neither pretends you can perfectly specify software upfront. Instead, they meet you where you actually are in your thinking, then help you work through the circular specification problem from different starting points.\n\nThe developer already knows the stack (FastAPI and mcp-python), the high-level architecture (an MCP server), and the constraints (no UI capabilities). They're not asking \"what should I build?\", they're asking \"help me build this thing I've already designed.\" In this case, starting with a design document makes more sense, because it matches how they're already thinking about the problem.\n\nSo now, when you create a new Feature Spec, Kiro asks you to choose: Requirements-first or tech Design-first. If you choose tech Design-first, you pick your level of detail. High-level design for system diagrams and components, or low-level design for algorithms and function signatures. Kiro generates your design document first. You iterate on it, exploring different technical approaches. Once you're happy with it, Kiro derives the requirements from your design, which ensures they are feasible. The rest of the spec workflow is the same: tasks, implementation, property-based testing to check if implementation matches what you want.\n\nTech Design-first works especially well when you have a pre-defined architecture, when you're prototyping to see if something is feasible, or when you're working with strict non-functional requirements that constrain your design choices. It's ideal when the technical approach is the starting point, not the destination.\n\nWhen fixing bugs, you have a different set of constraints and goals. You're not building something new, but correcting something that exists. Your surface area is different too. Change too much, and you risk breaking something that was working fine. You want the minimum change that fixes the problem.\n\nSo what’s the best way to work with an agent to do that? We found that developers who used Specs to successfully fix bugs shared two characteristics. First, they defined the detailed scenario that caused the error, not just the error message itself. Second, they explicitly stated what should not be modified. This is how experienced developers think about bugfixes, they fix what's broken but don't touch anything else.\n\nWhen you create a Bugfix Spec, Kiro follows a similar approach by generating a structured document with three sections:\n\nCurrent Behavior describes what's happening now: \"WHEN a user submits a form with special characters THEN the system crashes with a validation error.\" By being more comprehensive in this step, Kiro will better diagnose the conditions where the bug happens.\n\nExpected Behavior describes what should happen instead: \"WHEN a user submits a form with special characters THEN the system SHALL sanitize the input and process the form successfully.\" This tells Kiro what the solved state looks like so it can later check that it actually fixed the bug.\n\nUnchanged Behavior describes what must stay the same: \"WHEN a user submits a valid form THEN the system SHALL CONTINUE TO process it exactly as before.\" Instead of being implicit about what should not change, the Bugfix Spec explicitly states it. This helps Kiro check that regressions are not introduced and informs the property tests to validate.\n\nThis structure forces you to think explicitly about what changes and what doesn't, and helps the underlying model understand your intent more precisely. Kiro builds these sections for you automatically, you don't need to spend time writing this .md yourself. You can review and refine these conditions, then Kiro proceeds to create a design.md and tasks.md, just like a Feature Spec, but tailored for surgical fixes.\n\nWhat makes this work well is the unique way Kiro does testing. Kiro generates property-based tests (PBTs) for all three categories. Tests that verify the current implementation has the bug. Tests that verify your fix resolves it. And tests that verify unchanged behavior continues working exactly as before. Without these PBTs, it’s difficult to check if the agent actually fixed the bug for a comprehensive set of conditions, and that the changes were indeed surgical.\n\nBugfix Specs shine for complex bugs that benefit from structured problem-solving, situations where regression risk is high, or when you need documentation for your fix.\n\nSpecs changed the way many developers approach AI development to ship solid software. But when working with existing apps, especially over large codebases, you might prefer a different approach. Sometimes you begin with requirements, because you know exactly what you want to build. Sometimes you already know the technical approach, and it’s non-negotiable. Sometimes you're fixing a bug and need surgical precision because you don't want a regression to affect all your users. Now Specs support all three use cases.\n\nLearn",

    "description": "Without snow in the mountains, the places that depend on the West’s rivers will hurt for water.",
    "fullText": "If you are reading this on the East Coast, congratulations on the warmer weather you’re finally getting this week. It was cold and snowy for a while there. Here in the West, we wish we’d been in your shoes. Spare a thought for the tens of millions of us who live on the other side of the continent, where a catastrophe is unfolding.\n\nIn Colorado, where I live and grew up, this winter has been especially warm and dry. Last year closed with the warmest December in the history of recordkeeping. It was 8.9 degrees warmer than the average from 1991 to 2020, and the warmest of all in a record that goes back to the late 19th century. Over this past weekend, my neighbors and my family walked with our dogs and our kids in T-shirts and shorts, because it was in the mid-60s in Colorado Springs. About 60 miles north, my family in Denver saw a new record high of 68 degrees—on February 15.\n\nBut temperatures are not the only reason this winter is a catastrophe. This year, our snowpack is among the lowest ever measured, which means it won’t be enough to fill the rivers that are born in our mountains, which feed  reservoirs and water farms from here to Los Angeles. Snow is finally coming to the mountains this week, but we still cannot avoid one of the worst water years in modern history. The West is already experiencing the worst drought we have seen in 1,200 years, as our junior senator, John Hickenlooper, reminded me in an email over the weekend. Colorado politicians have to be attuned to these dynamics: “The snowpack is pretty much as large as all of our reservoirs combined. That’s why winters like this one are so terrifying,” he wrote. Drought can mean economic disaster.\n\nHickenlooper, who was also the state’s governor and the mayor of Denver, is not a man given to hyperbole. It really is that dire. Unless a lot of snow falls soon, Colorado’s environment and economy will take a huge hit. Ski resorts are losing money now. In the spring, rivers that usually offer waist-high whitewater rapids and fishing pools will instead be a trickle; in the summer, farmers will lose peach crops. Hydrologists, fire scientists, and climate researchers are bracing for summer too; their spectrum of worry ranges from concern to actual panic.\n\n“It’s as bad as you think it is,” Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, told me. On top of the ongoing, decades-long drought in the region, all of Colorado is in a snow drought too. The amount of water stored in the snowpack is the lowest it’s been at this point in winter since at least 1987, when comprehensive measurements began, he said. Going back to older records, some of which date from the Dust Bowl, the 2025–26 water year is the third-worst ever measured. In the two worse years, snowpack measured about 40 to 42 percent of average at this point in winter; this year, Colorado is sitting around 58 percent of median overall, and lower in some areas.\n\nClimatologists say that a weak La Niña pattern in the Pacific is partly to blame, parking a high-pressure “heartbreak ridge” farther east than usual, which continually pushes moisture away from the mountains. But the abysmal snowpack is also causing a bad feedback loop, allowing the mountains to warm more than usual. The pattern could finally break this week, and “we definitely have time to make up ground,” Allie Mazurek, a climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center, told me. But she also cautioned that “at this stage, it is looking almost impossible for us to get back to an average snowpack.”\n\nSchumacher’s predecessor, the longtime state climatologist Nolan Doesken, used to say that Colorado’s snowmelt is well behaved. Rain comes in a flash and is gone just as quickly, but we know where snow falls, where it will lie in wait, and which rivers it will feed months later. Flakes accumulate on cold ground, and when the Rockies stay cold the way they should, the snow remains for many months. And the surrounding air stays colder with snowpack than without it. This winter, temperatures are soaring 10 to 12 degrees above normal in northwestern Colorado—temperatures that region would not be seeing if the ground were covered in snow, Mazurek said.\n\nWestern water monitors use a metric called snow water equivalent, which is just what it sounds like, to estimate how much water will flow into rivers when the snow melts. Since 1987, the Snowpack Telemetry Network, SNOTEL, has measured snowpack by weighing the snow that falls at hundreds of stations across the West, including more than 100 currently active ones in Colorado. Other measurements are taken by hikers who snowshoe up to designated spots and measure the snowpack by hand. Climate scientists have been doing this for decades. Last week, the snow water equivalent in the Colorado River basin was tied for the lowest ever recorded, according to Brad Udall, a senior water scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on the Colorado River.\n\nThat snowpack forms the headwaters of rivers including the Colorado, the Rio Grande, and the Arkansas. And the Colorado River feeds the two largest reservoirs in the United States: Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Both reservoirs are critically low and have been for years: Powell is about 25 percent full, and Mead is at about 34 percent. If Powell’s water level drops another 40 or so feet, which it could this year, there won’t be enough water to generate hydroelectric power at Glen Canyon Dam. Water managers are starting to worry about “dead pool” too, in which the lake will get too low to let water flow through Glen Canyon toward Lake Mead; they are likely to reduce water flow out of Powell this year to avoid it.\n\nIn most of the Colorado River’s upper basin—in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming—water is not collected in many reservoirs; instead, it is diverted out to thousands of small locations, from streams to irrigation ditches. And “this year, there just isn’t going to be any water in these rivers. Or there will be water, but instead of 12 weeks or 16 weeks of water, it will be four weeks of water,” Udall told me. “Under western water law, people can basically completely dry these rivers up.”\n\nThis is bad timing, because Colorado and the other basin states are currently failing to renegotiate key parts of the more-than-century-old Colorado River Compact, which expire later this year. Along with seven states, the river-management agreement includes the federal Bureau of Reclamation, 30 tribal nations, and Mexico, and controls how the river flows into and out of Lakes Powell and Mead. The states missed a major deadline on February 14, which means that the Bureau of Reclamation will instead impose its own plan—one that none of the states are likely to be happy with. In Colorado, at least, some residents are concerned that the Trump administration will punish the solidly blue state by simply giving more water to, say, Arizona, which Donald Trump won in 2024. This is far from an irrational worry. In late December, Trump vetoed funding for a pipeline, already under construction with bipartisan support, that would bring water from a reservoir to rural communities in southeastern Colorado. The fight over the Colorado River could shape up in similar fashion, pitting state against state. (In response to a request for comment, a Department of the Interior spokesperson pointed me to a press release in which Secretary Doug Burgum said that the department had “listened to every state’s perspective” and that a “fair compromise with shared responsibility remains within reach.”)\n\nFurther in the future, the effects of water reductions will spill through the western economy. Agriculture, water recreation such as fishing and river rafting, and entire mountain ecosystems—both environmental and economic—will falter. For now, though, we are worrying about our trees budding six weeks too early, and pouring buckets of water around their trunks to keep them hydrated in the warmth. We are updating our fire checklists and go bags during red-flag warnings: One went up yesterday as I was working on this story. Winter fire watches are abnormal, but we are growing all too accustomed to them. And we are checking the snow forecast every day.",

    "description": "Newcastle's Anthony Gordon only had one thought in his mind as his side faced Qarabag in the Champions League...",
    "fullText": "Anthony Gordon had already scored a hat-trick.\n\nBut the ruthless Newcastle United forward only had one thought in his mind at the Tofig Bahramov Republican Stadium.\n\nGordon had just won his side a penalty against Qarabag in the first leg of their last 16 Champions League play-off tie, and he was not about to hand the ball over after Kieran Trippier felt Nick Woltemade should get a chance to take the spot-kick.\n\nIt brought back one or two memories of the single-mindedness of Newcastle's greatest ever goalscorer, Alan Shearer.\n\nIn fact, after already netting four goals against Sheffield Wednesday, in 1999, Shearer told striker Paul Robinson where to go after his team-mate asked him if he could take a spot-kick.\n\nSo it was rather fitting that this was a night where Gordon overtook the Newcastle legend as the club's all-time top scorer in the Champions League with 10 goals.\n\n\"We should be in it together,\" Gordon told TNT Sports after netting four goals in his side's 6-1 victory.\n\n\"But I'm an attacker. I'm the penalty taker, so I want to score as many goals as I possibly can.\"\n\nQarabag, in truth, played right into Gordon's hands.\n\nThis side had previously drawn against Chelsea and defeated Benfica, Eintracht Frankfurt and Copenhagen.\n\nBut the sight of the rapid Gordon playing further forward than Woltemade appeared to catch Qarabag a little cold.\n\n\"I have to say I was surprised by how high Qarabag defended, and how they kept a high line in the first half when the Newcastle goals were going in,\" he said.\n\n\"I was thinking, 'are they not watching Newcastle and their recent games?' Because why did they allow so much space for Gordon, who was brilliant all evening?\"\n\nGordon has impressed in such a role away from home in recent weeks - opening the scoring at Anfield last month and setting up Jacob Ramsey's winner against Spurs last week.\n\nHe gives Eddie Howe's side something different through the middle with his movement and pace, and the Azerbaijan Premier League champions could not cope.\n\n\"I think he's been really good in that position,\" Howe said. \"Looking back to the Liverpool game, where I thought he was excellent, he scores.\n\n\"He's shown he wants to play there and then he's got the quality to play there. His pressing today was incredible for us. That gave us the platform to rebuild off of his work.\n\n\"Of course he's taken the four goals and will get the headlines, naturally, but his all-round game was really strong.\"\n\nGordon's first goal set the tone for Newcastle.\n\nIt only took the rapid forward two minutes to open the scoring after he beat the offside trap to latch on to Dan Burn's through ball before coolly picking out the bottom corner.\n\nHaving scored his second from the spot, to make it 3-0, Gordon's speed caused Qarabag problems once again from the restart just seconds later when he pounced on some slack play from defender Kevin Medina and rounded Mateusz Kochalski to score his hat-trick.\n\nOn a night Gordon spurned one or two opportunities from open play, there was no chance of him letting go of the ball when he won his side another spot-kick before the break.\n\nGordon stepped up and dispatched a second powerful penalty past goalkeeper Kochalski.\n\nIt was a night he smashed a number of records, including becoming the only Englishman to score three or more goals in a knockout stage game in the Champions League.\n\nNo wonder Gordon did not want to come off midway through the second half, as the watching Pat Nevin observed.\n\n\"He is actually gutted,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"Any striker would feel exactly the same. You know it's the right thing.\n\n\"You don't want to get injured. You know you need to rest, there's big games coming up. But you also know there's goals. He's taken it well, though.\"\n\nGordon left the field to the sound of his name being chanted by those delirious Newcastle supporters in the away end.\n\nThe travelling support embarked on a gruelling 2,500-mile trip to be there - the longest any English fan base had ever travelled in the Champions League.\n\nYou suspect it was worth it as they repeatedly sang about not wanting to go home in the closing stages.\n\nWhat a difference 10 days make.\n\nA crestfallen Howe admitted he was not doing his job \"well enough\" after his side were booed off following a bruising defeat against Brentford at St James' Park earlier this month.\n\nIt led to a brief period of soul searching and one or two home truths behind the scenes, and Newcastle have responded.\n\nA side who once suffered with travel sickness have now defeated Qarabag, Aston Villa and Spurs on the road in little more than a week.\n\n\"I'm so proud of everyone because football is a highly emotional place sometimes and it's very fickle,\" Gordon added.\n\n\"People get so down and so up on you depending on your form. To go through what we went through to the position we're in now is really important and shows the character we have.\n\n\"Football does change fast so we have to keep it going, keep the momentum, because it can go the other way just as fast.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "After blowing a two-goal lead to draw against the Premier League's bottom club Wolves, there will be no dodging the questions on whether Arsenal are mentally ready to end their 22-year wait to become champions.\n\nFor the first time really this season, the title race is not completely in the control of Mikel Arteta and his players.\n\nIf Manchester City - five points behind in second place - win all of their remaining 12 games, which includes a home meeting against Arsenal, they will finish first.\n\nThe same, though, can be said for the Gunners, who have 11 matches left - and they win the April encounter at Etihad Stadium.\n\nBut after dropping four crucial points in successive draws against Brentford and Wolves, they are in danger of being haunted by the ghost of past failures.\n\nThree successive runners-up finishes, two of them to Pep Guardiola's men, provide a constant reminder.\n\nFormer Arsenal forward Alan Smith admitted \"that word bottle will be used quite a bit in the next few days\".\n\nThe scenario seemed a lot different when Piero Hincapie slotted home his first goal for the club in the 56th minute, adding to Bukayo Saka's fifth-minute opener.\n\nBut the Gunners lacked the control and ruthlessness to finish off a Wolves side that had lost their nine previous meetings and are heading for the Championship.\n\nThe hosts showed remarkable spirit to fight back with Hugo Bueno's 20-yard curler giving them hope. Then, in the fourth minute of added time, 19-year-old Tom Edozie - off the bench for his senior debut - pounced on a mix-up between Arsenal pair David Raya and Gabriel and his shot went in off Riccardo Calafiori for a dramatic, dreamy leveller.\n\nArsenal next face London derbies with Tottenham and Chelsea and they have worryingly started to wobble at a decisive stage in the season.\n\nArteta knows his side will come under fire and scrutiny.\n\n\"Any opinion you have to take it on the chin,\" he said. \"Any bullet, take it, because we didn't perform at the level required.\n\n\"Anything anyone says can be right because we didn't do what we had to do. The way to do it is on the pitch on Sunday [against Spurs].\"\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards said his side \"knew there is a massive pressure\" on Arsenal at the minute - and they capitalised on that.\n\nThe Gunners have not been performing at their best since the start of 2026 and won only two of their last seven league matches, with victories against Leeds and Sunderland.\n\nArteta added: \"Certain basics we have to do, we did them so poorly, one after the other.\n\n\"It is better not to judge it. We are all too emotional about it. You have to take the hit because we deserve it. It is very easy with emotion to say things that can damage the team. Everyone wants to do their best.\"\n\nOnly Crystal Palace and West Ham (both eight) have dropped more points from winning positions in the league in 2026 than Arsenal (seven) and the Gunners have now failed to win from a leading position in three of their last five league games.\n\nThis was also the first time in Premier League history that a side starting the day bottom of the table avoided defeat to the leaders, despite trailing by two or more goals.\n\n\"It feels like a pivotal moment, a vital one, maybe a turning point,\" Smith added on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's in Manchester City's hands now. With their experience and Guardiola's experience they will really fancy it now. They can almost feel the nerves of the Arsenal team watching that.\n\n\"Having been 2-0 up against the team rock bottom on nine points is just not good enough for the team hoping to win the title. It doesn't bode well for Arsenal to be able to handle the pressure.\"\n\nPressure mounts as Arsenal blow two-goal lead to draw at Wolves\n\nThe result also meant Arsenal failed to win an away league game in which they had a two-goal lead for the first time since April 2023 at West Ham, stretching back 18 matches.\n\nForward Saka, who ended a 15-match goal drought in all competitions, said there was a \"big difference\" with how his side performed in the second half compared to the first.\n\n\"Disappointed, not much else to say,\" added the England international. \"We dropped our standards big time and we got punished for it.\"\n\nJust a day after signing a new five-year deal, he had put his side in front after playing in the No10 role again, but could only watch in dismay at the end having gone off in the 73rd minute after receiving treatment.\n\n\"It's very flat,\" added Saka. \"It's time for us to reflect on the last few performances and fix the issues immediately, so we can get back to winning games, go on a run and build momentum because we've lost that a bit right now.\"\n\n\"I just think we have to get back to our level. Do the basics right and we've got more than enough quality in this team to win games, especially in the games where we've been dropping points in recently. We need to fix that and that's all our focus is right now.\"\n\nWith a north London derby to follow at Tottenham on Sunday, Arsenal have to respond quickly.\n\nSpurs will have Igor Tudor at the helm and they will hope he can give them the 'new manager bounce' to add to the Gunners' misery.\n\nArteta admitted: \"We need to go through the pain, looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now on Sunday.\n\n\"Anything we say from here is fine but we need to keep it all in our tummies and show it on Sunday.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, bought the franchise in 1997, saving it from potentially being moved to Southern California.\n\nHe oversaw the Seahawks' first Super Bowl win in 2014 but died in 2018, aged 65, from complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nHis estate announced on Wednesday that it has \"commenced a formal sale process\" for the franchise \"consistent with Allen's directive to eventually sell his sports holdings and direct all estate proceeds to philanthropy\".\n\nAccording to Forbes, Allen paid $194m (£143.6m) for the Seahawks and the publication's most recent valuation was $6.7bn (£5bn) - making it the 14th most valuable franchise in the NFL.\n\nThe most recent NFL team sale saw the Washington Commanders purchased in 2023 by a group controlled by Josh Harris for a record $6.05bn (£4.5bn).\n\nThat was surpassed as the world's most expensive sports team purchase last year, when the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers were bought for $10bn (£7.5bn).\n\nAllen also owned the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. since his death, his sister Jody Allen has been executor of his estate, plus chair of the Seahawks and Trail Blazers.\n\nA sale of the Trail Blazers is already in progress with Tom Dundon, owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, having agreed a contract to buy the NBA team in a deal worth $4.25bn (£3.3bn).\n\nThe Allen estate has selected investment bank Allen & Company and law firm Latham & Watkins to lead the sale process of the Seahawks.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "A college student withdrew from consideration for a reporting role in our newsroom this week because of how we use artificial intelligence.\n\nIt reminded me again how college journalism programs are failing to prepare students for the workforce. I mentioned this in a column before, and readers asked me to explain.\n\nWe don’t generally hire straight out of college. We lack the resources for heavy training, so we look for experienced journalists who can hit the ground running. This role, however, is different. It includes a free master’s degree through online courses at Syracuse University. We will accept recent graduates.\n\nLike many students we’ve spoken with in the past year, this one had been told repeatedly by professors that AI is bad. We heard the same thing at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Cleveland in August. Student after student said it.\n\nThat’s backwards — and it seriously handicaps them as they begin their careers. I’ve written extensively about how we use AI to do more and better work. It has quickly become critical to everything we do, and to our success.\n\nThe job posting involves expanding local news coverage. Last year, we began covering Lorain, Lake and Geauga counties using powerful AI tools to help identify stories. Reporters Hannah Drown and Molly Walsh have uncovered a steady stream of compelling pieces, enriching our report. I choose nine stories each day for discussion on our Today in Ohio podcast, and their work regularly rises to the top.\n\nThe effort has been so successful we expanded it to Medina County this month. With the Syracuse fellowship, we hope to add northern Summit County in May.\n\nWe could not do this without AI. We once had large teams covering these counties. That’s no longer feasible.\n\nBecause we want reporters gathering information, these jobs are 100 percent reporting. We have an AI rewrite specialist who turns their material into drafts. We fact-check everything. Editors review it. Reporters get the final say. Humans — not AI — control every step.\n\nMost heartening, the experiment is proving the value of local journalism. Hannah Drown’s reporting in Lorain County has awakened residents, especially regarding a less-than-transparent county commission. People are paying attention and asking questions as never before.\n\nThink about that: An energized electorate, partly because of how we use AI.\n\nThe candidate who withdrew could not accept AI assisting with writing. It wasn’t a “sacrifice” they were willing to make for a foothold in a thriving newsroom.\n\nI don’t blame the candidate. I blame the school.\n\nJournalism programs are decades behind. Many graduating students have unrealistic expectations. They imagine themselves as long-form magazine storytellers, chasing a romanticized version of journalism that largely never existed.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not bad for newsrooms. It’s the future of them. It already allows us to be faster, more thorough and more comprehensible. It frees time for what matters most: gathering facts and developing stories to serve you.\n\nAnyone entering this field should be immersing themselves in AI.\n\nFortunately for those of us who know exactly what skills we need in applicants, AI has altered the landscape so dramatically that we don’t need journalism school grads. Before the Watergate era, many journalists did not have college degrees. They were just smart people who knew how to get information. They were naturals at talking to people. And they knew enough about how things worked to recognize news.\n\nThat’s what we need now. AI can help draft stories, but it cannot sit across from someone, make eye contact and build trust. The core skills today differ sharply from even a decade ago. We just need to be creative about where we recruit.\n\nIf you’re a student considering journalism, I’d skip that degree. Study political science. Learn technology. Understand how government, businesses and nonprofits work. Take communications law and ethics as electives. Skip much of the rest.\n\nWe need smart, inquisitive people who love to schmooze and find adventure in change. Be that.",

    "description": "The admission comes after former President Barack Obama went viral for claiming aliens are real",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, says the president has a speech pre-written and is ready to address the discovery of aliens.\n\nLara, 43, made the shocking claim in an episode of the New York Post’s Pod Force One podcast, published Wednesday, after she was asked about former President Barack Obama's apparent confirmation that aliens are real during an interview last weekend.\n\n“I believe I’ve heard on your podcast that you’ve discussed with the president these UFOs. Do you think that he’s about to make an announcement about UFOs, because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president?” host Miranda Devine asked.\n\n“What’s kind of funny is we’ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cause we’re like, ‘Well, what do you know?...”Lara began.\n\nHowever, the president reportedly “played a little coy” when she and her husband, his son, Eric Trump, inquired about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n“Eric and I were like, ‘Oh my gosh, he won’t even fully tell us, maybe there’s more to it,’” she said.\n\n“I have just heard kind of around that he’s actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don’t know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara added.\n\nHer comments come as Obama made a stunning admission over the weekend during an appearance on the No Lie With Brian Tyler Cohen podcast.\n\nWhen asked about extraterrestrials, Obama replied, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in — what is it? There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”\n\nThe Internet went wild over his admission that aliens are real, prompting the former commander-in-chief to take to Instagram to clarify his stance.\n\n“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify,” the former president wrote. “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”\n\n“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us,” he continued,\n\nDoubling down on his claim, he added, “Really!”\n\nIts long been speculated by many that aliens and UFOs are hidden at the mysterious Area 51 base in southern Nevada — and a documentary released last year suggested that Trump may soon confirm the existence of other life forms.\n\nIn The Age of Disclosure, director Dan Farah suggests that a massive government cover-up operation has concealed the existence of non-human intelligence, but that the cover-up will soon be exposed.\n\n“I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, ‘We're not alone in the universe,’” Farah told Entertainment Weekly in late November.\n\n“It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have.”\n\nDespite Farah’s claims, Trump has not yet shared a definitive answer about the existence of aliens since returning to office.",

    "description": "First in The Independent: A Congolese woman’s life is in ‘grave danger’ after ICE secretly flew her to an unknown African nation, according to an emergency motion filed in federal court",
    "fullText": "The life of a Congolese asylum seeker granted permission to stay in the United States is in “grave danger” after ICE secretly flew her to an unknown African nation, while the woman’s husband – a widely feared local politician who allegedly had her father shot dead as she watched – continues to hunt her across continents, according to a tranche of federal court documents reviewed by The Independent.\n\nIn addition to fearing for her own safety, “Jane Doe,” as she is referred to in legal filings, “hopes for the safety of her children, whose whereabouts are unknown to her because their father, her husband, is seeking to kill them and so they are in hiding, even to her,” states an emergency motion Doe’s attorneys filed Monday in Louisiana. “She hopes for the safety of her brother, who was kidnapped in Mexico by a cartel and she has not seen him since.”\n\nAt the age of 14, “Jane Doe” - as the devoutly Christian and former hairdresser in the Democratic Republic of Congo - was forced to become the African politician’s sixth wife in order to satisfy a family debt, according to the motion. For the next decade, Doe was physically and sexually abused by her husband and two of his sons, bearing four children while being “kept like a hostage,” says the motion, which seeks Doe’s immediate return to the U.S.\n\nIn late 2024, Doe managed to escape to her parents’ house, the motion goes on. But Doe’s politician husband quickly found her, brutalized her and her brother, ordered his bodyguards to execute her father in front of her, and burned the family home to the ground, the motion says. When Doe went to the police, they said her only option was to leave the country because “her abuser was too powerful and… they could not protect her,” according to the motion.\n\n“Ms. Doe went into hiding and fled the [Democratic Republic of Congo] with the help of her brother and his employer, who in secret obtained travel documents and plane tickets to Brazil,” it states. “Ms. Doe’s abuser continued to track her abroad. Within an hour of arriving in Brazil, Ms. Doe received a WhatsApp message from her abuser, stating he knew she was in Brazil and had ‘eyes everywhere.’ He threatened to kill her.”\n\nTerrified, Doe made her way through 12 different countries – even braving the notorious Darién Gap on foot – to get to the United States, where, the motion explains, “she believed human rights were respected.” It says Doe arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border on January 2, 2025, and immediately requested asylum. She was sent to the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, as her case was processed, and last June received permission to stay in the U.S. under a “withholding of removal” decision barring her deportation to DR Congo.\n\nHowever, that all changed on February 15, 2026, when ICE decided to send her to somewhere else.\n\nAttorneys for Doe say they were never contacted by authorities about their client’s sudden removal and “don’t even know where [ICE] disappeared [her] to yesterday in the dark of night.” Doe was loaded onto a deportation flight bound for Senegal, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana and Nigeria, without any further information provided, the affidavit states, adding, “Ms. Doe has no connections, resources, money or way of contacting anyone in the world.”\n\nThe motion contends that Doe’s “unlawful removal means her life is in grave danger.”\n\nDoe, according to a companion affidavit filed by one of her attorneys, is “an extraordinary woman.”\n\n“She has lived through extensive trauma, and despite that, she smiles on video calls with me and tells me how she’s learning to make bracelets in ICE detention,” it says. “She reads her Bible and leads Bible study among other women in her detention facility. She finds a way to continue to hold onto hope… She hopes for her future education to be able to study medicine, to work as a nurse, and one day to run an orphanage. She hopes to see the outside of the detention facility where she has lived in the United States of America for 13 months: January 2025 to now.”\n\nThe affidavit lauds Doe for fighting the June 2025 withholding of removal order, which the motion explains as “similar to asylum in that she proved it was more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of a protected ground if she were removed to the Democratic Republic of Congo and that the government there was unable or unwilling to protect her.”\n\nLast summer, ICE instructed officials that immigrants can be deported from the United States to countries other than their own with as little as six hours’ notice – or no notice at all.\n\nThat memo from ICE acting director Todd Lyons followed a Supreme Court decision that opened the door for ICE to send deportees to countries where they do not have citizenship, family or any other connections.\n\nICE has since spent more than $40 million and fought several legal battles over removals to far-flung nations where deportees have no connections whatsoever, including to several countries in Africa: Eswatini, Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda and South Sudan, among others.\n\nIn a June 2025 letter to authorities, filed as an exhibit in court, another attorney representing Doe wrote that she had been told ICE was considering Canada and Spain as possible third countries where they could deport her. However, her husband has family in both places, and could easily locate her there, the letter said. Guatemala, a third possibility floated by ICE, would be equally dangerous for Doe, who also speaks no Spanish, according to a follow-up letter.\n\nStill, immigration authorities denied Doe her right to a reasonable fear interview concerning any potential third country, which Monday’s motion calls an “extraordinary and illegal measure.”\n\n“Under our Constitution, this cannot stand,” the motion argues.\n\nThroughout, ICE has refused over the course of nearly nine months to communicate at all with Doe’s lawyers, according to the motion.\n\n“Defendants communicate – if at all – solely with [Doe]: a high school graduate with no legal training who is a native French speaker and knows only limited English,” it maintains. “... This does not provide Ms. Doe meaningful notice or opportunity to respond. By excluding counsel from the equation and refusing to engage with her attorneys, Defendants have committed abhorrent behavior violating Ms. Doe’s rights.”\n\nAt 11 p.m. on Valentine’s Day, Doe’s legal team was notified by a family member that Doe had been told she “was being ‘moved,’” the motion states. “She reportedly did not have any information or know whether this ‘move’ was a transfer to a different facility or a removal to a third country.”\n\nFinally, around 1 p.m., an ICE officer picked up the phone and said Doe had been flown out of the U.S. on a 4 a.m. flight dropping deportees off in five African countries, but “could not identify which… was her destination,” the motion states. The officer referred the attorneys to a pair of higher-ups, who also never responded to their queries, according to the motion.\n\nDoe’s lawyers argue the U.S. government has violated her Fifth Amendment right to due process, as well as a section of federal law that prohibits government agencies from”arbitrary or capricious” conduct.\n\nThey are demanding U.S. officials facilitate Doe’s return to the U.S., “without incident,” to release her upon entry, and to reimburse her for any costs incurred. Late Tuesday, a judge denied Doe’s motion and ordered her attorneys to refile their motion with additional specifics.\n\nDoe’s attorneys declined to comment on the record. An ICE spokesperson did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment.\n\nWith reporting by Alex Woodward",

    "fullText": "According to relatives, Ernest Joe Manzanares, 23, left home on July 28, 1988, to confront two family members — and then never returned\n\nIn July 2009, human remains were were found on property now known as Lake Hiawatha Preserve, but despite an extensive investigation, the case went cold\n\nDecades later, after additional analysis, the remains were identified as belonging to Manzanares\n\nHuman remains found nearly 17 years ago have been identified as a man who left home in 1988 and never returned.\n\nErnest Joe Manzanares, 23, was last seen when he left home on July 28, 198\n\n\"Ernest left his family’s home one night and never returned,” said retired Ocoee Police Det. Michelle Grogan at a news conference on Friday, Feb. 13. “His family has lived for four decades without answers. They didn’t know where he was, what happened to him or if they would ever see him again.”\n\nYears later, in July 2009, human remains were found on property now known as Lake Hiawatha Preserve by a work crew clearing overgrowth, the Clermont Police Department said in a statement.\n\n“Forensic consultations with the University of Central Florida, the University of Florida, and the Fifth District Medical Examiner confirmed the remains were human and belonged to an adult male,” police continued. “Evidence was submitted for forensic and DNA analysis in 2009.\"\n\nHowever, despite an extensive investigation, police said the case went cold.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn June of last year, the medical examiner’s office received approval for a genetic genealogy grant through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Clermont Police said.\n\nWith approval from the police, the medical examiner’s office submitted the evidence from the case to Othram, which specializes in using DNA technology to solve cold cases — and on Dec. 29, investigators were notified that the remains belonged to Manzanares.\n\n“This identification reflects years of persistence and collaboration,” Clermont Police Captain Malcolm Draper said in a press statement. “Although the case grew cold, it was never forgotten. Advances in forensic science, combined with the dedication of our investigative partners, produced answers that were not possible in 2009.”\n\n“We are grateful that this identification brings some measure of closure to the Manzanares family,” added Ocoee Police Chief Vincent Ogburn. “They now have the opportunity to lay their loved one to rest.”\n\nGrogan said at Friday’s news conference that calling Manzanares’ daughter was bittersweet. “She was grateful to finally have answers and to bring her father home,” said Grogan. “But like any child, she had always held on to hope that her dad might walk back into her life one day.”\n\nAlthough unknown to investigators when he disappeared, Grogan said during the news conference that in 2022 she spoke with Manzanares' mom, who wanted to \"clear the air.\"\n\nGrogan said that according to his mom, before her son disappeared, the family was \"experiencing domestic violence\" and in addition to moving from Colorado to live with his family, Manzanares convinced his father, who has since died, to move out.\n\nHis mom also said that Manzanares allegedly heard that his father and another now-deceased relative were planning to sell his sister and niece, then 7 and 8, to a motorcycle gang they were members of.\n\n\"I think in this day and age you would call it human trafficking,\" Grogan said.\n\nWhen he left to confront them, Manzanares told his mother he planned to return later that night, leaving behind his wallet and jacket.\n\nWhen pressed for questions, Grogan said that at this point in their investigation, they have no additional answers about what may have happened to Manzanares.\n\nAn investigation remains ongoing.\n\nIf you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential. The hotline is available 24/7 in more than 170 languages.",

    "description": "UO students, staff, faculty and community members rallied at Johnson Hall for 'A Day Without an Immigrant.' They demand ICE alerts on campus.",
    "fullText": "A dozen speakers took to the microphone at the \"A Day Without an Immigrant\" rally on the front steps of University of Oregon's Johnson Hall on Feb. 16.\n\nThis was the third \"A Day Without an Immigrant\" demonstration in a series that will culminate on International Workers' Day on May 1.\n\nA couple hundred participants huddled together on the slope leading up to the university's administrative building, protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in Eugene and nationwide. Students, staff, faculty and community members called for UO leaders to take action by way of using the UO Alerts system to give notification when ICE is on or near campus.\n\n\"I'm scared, I'm angry, I'm exhausted, but now isn't the time to give in to despair,\" said Isabel E, a UO student with the UO Young Democratic Socialists of America. \"It's time to act, to fight back, and to demand that this university fulfills its ethical duty to protect its students, its faculty and its city.\"\n\nMultiple student groups helped organize the rally, including YDSA, UO's Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán (MEChA), UO Student Workers and Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation. Faculty and staff also were present along with representatives from the Party for Socialism and Liberation in Eugene.\n\nUO student and MEChA member Xiomara Andrade stepped up to speak on behalf of MEChA President Maria Gaspar. She spoke about the recent UO Alerts going out, including one sent on Feb. 9 about \"water gel beads,\" commonly known as Orbeez, being shot at pedestrians near campus. Andrade called the alert \"insulting.\" She criticized the university's lack of ICE alerts, saying UO's administration cares more about its public image than its students.\n\n\"We need these alerts and we need them now,\" Andrade said. \"(Students) are looking over their shoulders instead of focusing on their future. At MEChA, we work firsthand with our immigrant and Latino community every single day. We aren't just looking at data, we are looking into the eyes of our peers and seeing the fear rise daily.\"\n\nUO students also called for a Latine Cultural Center, a center intended specifically for the Hispanic and Latino student population, similar to the Black Cultural Center. While the Multicultural Center exists, students say that space fills up quickly and isn't large enough for collaboration between Latino-serving student groups on campus. Latino and Hispanic students are the second-largest demographic at UO after white students. According to UO data from winter 2026, 17% of undergrad students are Hispanic/Latino, compared to 60% of undergrads who are white.\n\nToby Cole, a UO transfer student involved in YDSA and MEChA, said he came to the rally, in part, to find community. Cole, who grew up in Southern California, said it was a huge shock at first coming to a predominantly white institution, but he has been able to find community through groups like MEChA. He said there are lots of Latino students and some faculty, but he'd like to see more resources organized by the university itself.\n\n\"Latino student presence is strong, and it's healthy, but we aren't given space to grow,\" Cole said. \"I think that's the main thing that we're really trying to fight for.\"\n\nCole said Latino faculty have been doing what they can to support students, but Cole would like to see a Latino student specialist in UO's mental health counseling office, similar to Dr. Cecile Gadson, who is the African American/Black student specialist staff psychologist.\n\nAt Monday's rally, Cole said it's been powerful to see they are not alone as they look at all their peers who feel the same fear, but are willing to take steps to make a change.\n\n\"There's a really big fear on campus, but there's also a lot of strength that's coming out,\" Cole said. \"There's a lot of solidarity. Students that aren't Latino, aren't immigrants, aren't people of color are also rallying together and saying, 'Hey, you're my neighbor, you're my classmate, you're my friend. I'm going to protect you.'\"\n\nMiranda Cyr reports on education for The Register-Guard.

And they kick in at age 73 or 75, depending on the year you were born.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nRMDs can cause you a host of problems in retirement. Not only can they push you into a higher tax bracket, but they could also drive up the cost of your Medicare premiums by leaving you subject to surcharges known as IMRAAs, or income-related monthly adjustment amounts.\n\nThe good news? There's a step you can take to reduce your RMDs in retirement. But you'll need to plan ahead to pull it off.\n\nRoth conversions are a good option for getting out of RMDs or reducing them. But many people wait until the last minute to do a Roth conversion and end up moving a large sum of money at once out of a traditional retirement account. That tends to produce a very large tax bill.\n\nPlus, depending on your age, doing a large Roth conversion in a single year could put you at risk of Medicare IRMAAs. So a better bet may be to do your conversions over time.\n\nAnother option many people overlook? Rather than do a conversion, simply take withdrawals from your IRA or 401(k) before RMDs begin.\n\nLet's say you have to start taking RMDs at age 73 but you retire at 65. During that eight-year gap, you may have a fairly low income and therefore land in a fairly low tax bracket.\n\nIf you withdraw funds from your IRA or 401(k) during that time, you'll have less money subject to RMDs down the line. You can then reinvest the money you're withdrawing so it doesn't go to waste.\n\nIf you do those withdrawals during a fairly low-income year, not only might your tax bracket not rise too much, but you may not risk pushing your income into IRMAA territory. So all told, it's a strategy that could spare you a lot of financial pain.\n\nOne reason older people run into trouble with RMDs is that they wake up at the last minute and realize they're a year or two away from potentially large mandatory withdrawals. A better bet? Plan early.",

    "fullText": "Home Depot and Lowe’s have dominated the home improvement and hardware retail sectors for decades, continuing to rise above hardware cooperatives True Value Hardware and Ace Hardware, and making life even harder for independent hardware retailers.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has also surpassed True Value and Ace as the No. 3 destination for home improvement products.\n\nHome Depot captured an average of 28% of the home improvement market sales in 2025, while Lowe’s followed with 17% of the market, and Amazon had about 11% of sales, according to the Numerator Home Improvement Tracker, which was updated on Feb. 4.\n\nWith Home Depot, Lowe's, and Amazon holding a combined 56% of the market's sales last year, the hardware cooperatives and independent retailers have had a difficult time competing and remaining in business.\n\nAce, True Value, and independent hardware stores are a convenient source for tools and other home improvement products for me, as I can quickly navigate a smaller store for my needs as opposed to much larger big-box stores.\n\nAnd I find that the employees at the smaller stores near me have often worked at the stores for years and have a quick answer for my needs.\n\nHowever, even long-time community hardware stores that have operated for over 50 years are struggling to stay open.\n\nIndependent hardware store C&H Hardware of Yakima, Wash., which operated for 65 years, had enough problems competing against the hardware and home improvement chain giants, but the store could not compete against lower online prices and shut down permanently in November 2025.\n\n\"This year has been tough because everybody’s buying online now,” C&H store owner Jay Fleck said before shutting his doors permanently. “You can get stuff online cheaper than you can come in and pay us.”\n\nFleck said business was good at C&H before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, but business deteriorated afterward.\n\n“It was smooth until Covid hit,” Fleck said. “Of course, we were fortunate to have stayed open. A lot of other places had to shut down. So, we’ve done pretty good through Covid. And after that, it was kind of over. It’s been a downhill slide ever since.”\n\nAnd now, 53-year-old Home Depot rival Blossom True Value Hardware will close its doors for the final time in summer 2026 when its lease expires.\n\nThe Mountain View, Calif.,-based hardware store will permanently close, after suffering a loss of about half of its business since the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, longtime store owner Paul Zeitman told Mountain View Voice.\n\n\"Every year is worse than before. People are buying less and less,\" Zeitman said.\n\nZeitman explained that the store's monthly rent is reasonable but is no longer affordable.\n\nThe store owner said that Blossom True Value was allowed to remain open during the pandemic as an essential business and benefited from people buying hardware and home improvement goods to fix up their homes until the pandemic subsided.\n\nBankrupt restaurant chains permanently close popular locations\n\nMajor retail chain closes 35 stores nationwide, no bankruptcy\n\nAnother major retail chain closes warehouse operations\n\nThe retailer lost half its business as regular customers moved away, and e-commerce expanded further since the end of the pandemic, according to Mountain View Voice.\n\nThe store owner said Ace Hardware's expansion and opening of new stores in the region also cut into the retailer's business.\n\nZeitman said the final factor in the decision to close down was rising tariffs.\n\nMuch of Blossom True Value's merchandise is imported from China, and has been affected by the Trump administration's higher tariffs that have increased prices and cut into profits, while sales have also dropped, he said.\n\nRetailer distress has been blamed on high rents and labor costs, online shopping, and competition from big-box retailers, according to Mountain View City Councilman John McAlister, who is also Blossom's retail neighbor.\n\nHome Depot and Lowe's closest stores to Mountain View are in neighboring Sunnyvale, Calif.\n\nHome Depot, 28% of sales in 2025",
