    "fullText": "Twenty years ago, I was on the Olympic podium in Turin, Italy. Now, I’m back as a spectator, watching the figure skating events with both nostalgia and relief as I relive the highs and lows of my Olympic experience. I was keenly reminded of my own choice to pursue the Olympic dream at the expense of all else.\n\nIt stirred reflections on my skating career and all that has transpired since. Knowing what it took, I would still do it again in a heartbeat. At the same time, it’s hard to imagine my kids following in my footsteps — not only because of what I missed out on, but the weight of the hopes and expectations I carried.\n\nI first fell in love with the feeling of gliding across the ice at age seven. The next 10 years were full of joyful growth, quickly mastering difficult jumps, and early competitive success. Early mornings in cold damp ice rinks were filled with possibility and promise. I couldn’t get enough and hated anything keeping me away from the ice.\n\nBut when I was just 12, I was forced to take months off when another skater collided with me, slicing my calf open. Then again at 15 I fractured my lower back, sidelined for another three months. The time away from the ice only strengthened my resolve and commitment to qualify for the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. I made the games, but missed the podium and ended up a disappointing 4th place, determined to come back in 2006 and redeem myself.\n\nI moved across the country to work with a coach known internationally for minting Olympic champions, shutting down any outside interests. It paid off and I had my best year yet, winning almost every competition I entered.\n\nBut the time between the Olympics is long. Two years in and still a long two years out; stress mounted and joy faded. 2004 was a particularly brutal year; I withdrew from a season of competitions, crippled by mental health struggles and tortured by long, anxiety ridden nights, precipitated by the growing fear that my best days were behind me.\n\nJust two years earlier, I was a fresh upstart with almost no senior international experience. Making the Olympic team as a 17-year-old in my home country felt like there was only possibility ahead.\n\nFour years later, in 2006, I knew most of my career was behind me, and I was weighed down by the tremendous weight of expectation —mine, and my country’s. It was most likely my last shot at Olympic gold, but injuries marred my training leading up to the Games.\n\nThat’s the thing about an Olympic career, one can spend a whole lifetime training for a certain moment in time, only to be thwarted by the body’s limits.\n\nI knew that even one mistake would cost me Gold and that two would likely knock me off the podium. In the end, I stumbled but so did my competitors. I took home the silver.\n\nThe Olympics are the most glorious and, arguably, agonizing of human endeavors. With the gift of time, I am profoundly aware of the dark side that we glaze over, often oblivious to the costs. The world isharsh in judging our hero athletes — the media’s adulation over team medal counts obscures each athlete’s individual and very human trials and tribulations, focusing on times, records, and outcomes.\n\nIn 2006, I was alone on the world stage, and blamed only myself when I fell.\n\nIf falling was hard, harder still was walking away.  After two decades spent mastering my sport, I finally hung up my skates and found myself profoundly disoriented as the sense of self I achieved as a result of years of hard work on the ice, quickly disintegrated.\n\nBut in the best moments, I was able to transcend place and time, losing myself in the music. I felt the audience on the edge of their seats, cheering me on, and sharing in my triumphs.  My short program in Turin was one of those moments.\n\nAll of this played out for me when most young adults are headed off to college, experiencing their first real taste of independence, making lifelong friendships, and charting out what direction their careers might take. Their mistakes won’t be scrutinized in the public eye (at least that was largely the case before social media) and for most, passing final exams is the biggest source of stress.\n\nPart of me wishes that I, too, could have had those rights of passage.\n\nYet looking back at my life choices, I would absolutely do it all over again. Medaling at the Olympics was the realization of a dream that I had and committed to achieving in a way few people can ever understand. Other than having children, it was the most profound and meaningful part of my life and for that, I would not exchange it for anything.\n\nThese days, my world now revolves around two little people — constantly testing boundaries and figuring out who they are. I want my kids to know that accomplishing great things takes work.\n\nI want them to know the priceless triumph of overcoming their fears because they chose to show up, despite the nerves and doubt. But when success is defined by perfection in one particular moment, that’s a tough way to live and it’s not for everyone. It’s a deeply personal and consequential choice.  And yet, I would never want them to miss pursuing their dreams because the cost of admission is too high.\n\nSasha Cohen is the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, 2006 U.S. Champion, 2003 Grand-Prix Final Champion, and a three-time World medalist. Following her competitve career, she graduated from Columbia University's General Studies and now works as a financial analyst.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sasha Cohen knows Olympic dreams come with agony, but she would do it all again",

    "fullText": "Since leaving Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp has been making the most of his break from football management, taking some time to relax away from the touchline.\n\nThis week, he was seen ringing the bell at the Winter Olympics, continuing to enjoy life without the demands of daily training and matches.\n\nDespite his intention to step away from management following his 2024 departure from Liverpool, Klopp has still found himself linked to several high-profile jobs.\n\nRecent reports have suggested he could be in line for one of the vacant roles at either Chelsea or Manchester United. There were even claims that both clubs had reached out to his representatives over a possible return.\n\nBut according to Fabrizio Romano, both clubs have now denied those rumours.\n\nIn a recent update on his YouTube channel, Romano said he has spoken directly with both clubs regarding the speculation.\n\nAccording to him, while both clubs respect what Klopp has achieved, neither made any formal move to bring him in.\n\nRomano explained: “When contacted, both clubs – Manchester United and Chelsea – are playing down those reports, saying that nothing really happened with Jurgen Klopp apart from the admiration they have for one of the best managers in the world.”\n\n“Both clubs absolutely announce that they never had any advanced or concrete negotiations to appoint Jurgen Klopp.”\n\nChelsea have already filled their managerial vacancy by hiring Liam Rosenior. But with United still searching for their next manager, it wouldn’t be a surprise if talk about Klopp resurfaces later in the summer.\n\nReal Madrid are another club who could be looking for a permanent manager this summer, having brought in former Liverpool defender Alvaro Arbeloa as an interim coach. Despite the speculation, Romano says there’s nothing developing between Klopp and the Spanish club.\n\n“On the future of Jurgen Klopp, don’t forget that he’s still very busy with the Red Bull project, still focused on that,” he said.\n\n“With Real Madrid, I keep telling you guys, let’s see what happens with Arbeloa because he’s doing a very good job now. Second step, Jurgen Klopp has some people in the Real Madrid board appreciating him a lot, but at the moment I’m not aware of concrete talks. That’s the status as of today.”\n\nKlopp remains one of football’s most respected figures and could likely walk into any role he wanted. But so far, he’s kept to his word about taking time away from coaching.\n\nWhy PSG passed on Jeremy Jacquet before £60m Liverpool switch\n\nHow Anthony Gordon’s record pace could transform Arne Slot’s Liverpool frontline\n\nJadon Sancho sidesteps question about Liverpool legend during Paris date with Saweetie",

    "fullText": "In Major League Baseball, franchise value reflects far more than wins and losses — it represents legacy, market influence, brand power, and the emotional investment of generations of fans. According to Forbes, the sport’s most valuable teams are not just successful organizations but enduring cultural institutions that shape how baseball is experienced across the country and around the world. Leading the way are iconic brands like the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, whose global reach and financial strength mirror their long-standing competitive prominence. Close behind, franchises such as the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs prove that deep-rooted history and passionate fan loyalty can translate into extraordinary economic value. Meanwhile, the San Francisco Giants showcase how sustained success in the modern era can elevate a franchise’s stature both competitively and commercially.\n\nWhat unites these teams is their ability to transcend the game itself. Each operates as a powerful entertainment brand, drawing massive attendance, commanding lucrative media deals, and maintaining devoted followings that span generations. Their ballparks are destinations, their histories are woven into the fabric of their cities, and their influence stretches well beyond regional markets. In many ways, these franchises serve as pillars of baseball’s identity — setting financial benchmarks while carrying the traditions that keep the sport deeply connected to its past.\n\nFranchise value: $8.2B\nFew brands in sports carry the global recognition of the Yankees. Their history is stacked with championships, legends, and iconic moments that shaped baseball itself. The franchise thrives on tradition, star power, and unmatched cultural visibility. Whether contending or rebuilding, they remain baseball’s financial and symbolic powerhouse.\n\nFranchise value: $6.8B\nThe Dodgers blend historic prestige with modern dominance better than almost anyone. Their massive fan base stretches across Southern California and well beyond, fueled by consistent winning and aggressive investment in talent. The franchise excels both on the field and at the gate, drawing huge attendance year after year. They represent the blueprint for a contemporary big-market contender.\n\nFranchise value: $4.8B\nThe Red Sox carry one of baseball’s most emotionally charged legacies, rooted deeply in Boston’s identity. From the drama of historic droughts to the euphoria of multiple modern titles, the team lives at the center of passionate fandom. Fenway Park’s atmosphere alone is part of their brand value. Their history, rivalry, and regional loyalty make them perpetually relevant.\n\nFranchise value: $4.6B\nThe Cubs transformed from lovable underdogs into a global brand, especially after their long-awaited championship breakthrough. Wrigley Field’s charm and neighborhood feel give the franchise a timeless appeal. Generations of fans stayed loyal through decades of heartbreak, strengthening the team’s cultural footprint. Today, they balance nostalgia with modern competitiveness.\n\nFranchise value: $4.0B\nThe Giants built a 21st-century dynasty that elevated their national profile and market value. Their waterfront ballpark and strong regional following make them a cornerstone of West Coast baseball. Success across multiple championship runs reinforced their reputation for smart roster construction and stability. They embody sustained excellence with a distinctly San Francisco identity.\n\nTogether, these franchises represent the gold standard of value in Major League Baseball — where heritage, market strength, and sustained relevance intersect. Their financial dominance reflects decades of cultural impact, smart organizational leadership, and unwavering fan devotion. As the sport continues to evolve, these teams remain defining forces, proving that true franchise value is built not just on performance, but on legacy that endures across generations.\n\nOLYMPICS: USA figure skater Isabeau Levito gushes over Olympic Village\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes hilarious first move after Dolphins release\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 after Week 15\n\nMLB: Tigers infielder from Taiwan apologizes to Koreans after trash talk goes viral\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Most valuable franchises in MLB appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has urged his side to use the \"pain\" of a shock 2-2 draw with Wolves when they look to revive their Premier League title challenge against arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Gunners were on course for a routine win on Wednesday after goals from Bukayo Saka and Piero Hincapie put them 2-0 up at Molineux.\n\nBut bottom of the table Wolves hit back through Hugo Bueno and Tom Edozie.\n\nThe draw left Arsenal, bidding to end a 22-year-wait to be crowned champions of England again, just five points clear of second-placed Manchester City.\n\nIt was the second match in a row where Arsenal had dropped points following a draw with Brentford and meant they have now won just twice in their last seven league games.\n\nCity, who have a game in hand, twice chased Arsenal down to win the Premier League in both the 2022/23 and 2023/24 seasons and their April clash with the Gunners could prove pivotal to the title race.\n\nBut Arteta said: \"I'm going to be the first one to be close with them (the players) because it has nothing to do with attitude or desire, it is completely the opposite.\n\n\"It's part of football. Where it could've gone wrong today, it went wrong.\n\n\"If you look at the way we conceded the two goals today without conceding any other situations, it is very rare but it happens. And it happened for a reason and we need to react.\n\n\"If you are at the top you have to win and win, that's nothing new.\"\n\nArsenal are away to struggling Tottenham in a north London derby on Sunday, with Arteta saying: \"We need to go through the pain and go through it looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now and the next action is Sunday. We need to keep all that in our tummies to show it on Sunday.\"\n\nMeanwhile Saka told Arsenal.com: \"It's pretty flat. We're pretty disappointed with the result, it's the only way to describe it.\n\n\"I think it's a game of two halves. In the first half we started so well but in the second half we dropped the level and got punished for it.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the derby match, the England international added: \"It was already a big game and now it's still a big game...It's still in our control so we just need to focus on that, fix the issues we're having now and get back to winning ways.\"",

    "fullText": "This year’s crop of starting pitchers has a couple of amazing arms that will cost you a first-round pick if you want to roster them, and as much as I hate to say it, taking a pitcher that high is akin to dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight.  The same two pitchers were the top two off the board last year, so the waters may seem safe, but beware.  Those same waters seemed safe two years ago when Spencer Strider was the top arm off the board. Here are the top 30 SP right now in fantasy baseball:\n\nTwo straight Cy Young awards should be reason enough, but at age 29 and playing for what should be the largest ever free agent contract for a pitcher doesn’t hurt either.  The Tigers are sticking with him at the top of their rotation as they make a run for it all in 2026, but don’t be surprised if he’s dealt to a contender if Detroit isn’t competitive.  He’s basically guaranteed to be pitching for a contender for the entire season.\n\nMORE: Fantasy Baseball 2026 Catcher Rankings (16-30)\n\nThe Pirates have improved their offense from last year, so it’s possible we get more than the 10 wins from Skenes that we got last year.  Even without the wins, he dominates batters to such an extent that we can comfortably project him to have an era. at or below 2.00.  Flip a coin between these top 2 pitchers, I can’t be mad at either one going before the other.\n\nCrochet basically sits on a tier by himself as the #3 pitcher in the league.  He eclipsed 200 innings last year after setting a career high in 2024 with 146.  The comparisons to Chris Sale are mostly due to his left-handedness and his tall beanpole physique, but there is also the concern over workload issues, as he was a relief pitcher just 3 years ago.  He’s a great pick, but he makes me nervous.  I don’t wish injuries on anybody, but this guy is already a one-time TJS survivor.\n\nWoo is another young gun who emerged as a bona fide ace last year, finishing 5th in the AL Cy Young award voting.  His innings have been ramping up over the past 3 years, so I’m not quite as worried about him as I am Crochet.  If you take him, he’s going to cost you a more tolerable late 3rd round or early 4th round pick, and he’s a great anchor for your pitching staff.  You will also get to enjoy a full season of doing your best Ric Flair impressions every time he pitches.\n\nThe Mariners have a good pitching staff, in case you haven’t noticed.  Gilbert missed a month and a half of last season with a flexor strain but still managed to pile up over 170 Ks in just 131 innings.  He had posted 3 straight seasons heading into 2025 of 180+ innings, so he should be safe to get back to that total (barring another injury, of course).  He’s going right around the same spot as Woo in early drafts.\n\nHe was a stud last year, especially in the postseason, where he basically pitched in every game of the World Series. My only slight concern with him (as well as with all Dodger pitchers) is the fact that the team is on a mission to win yet another title, and they don’t care about our fantasy teams.  He won’t likely make 30 starts this year as Ohtani will be a two-way player for the whole season, and they will likely be using a 6-man rotation.  Set your expectations for 26 starts and about 160 innings, and you won’t be disappointed.\n\nHe became the de facto Yankee ace in the absence of Gerrit Cole last season and answered the call by finishing 4th in the AL Cy Young voting.  His 195 innings were a career high, and he has had a history of arm issues that have landed him on the IR over his career.  Expecting a repeat of last year might be a bit ambitious, but he’s still going to put up great numbers as long as he can post.\n\nThis guy just keeps doing it year in and year out.  In a time where it’s rare to find a pitcher who is able to give you 180 innings, Webb has AVERAGED over 200 innings per season over the last 4 years.  He’s still just 29, and he’s a great anchor to start your staff if you wait until the 4th round or so to take your first pitcher.  His spike in K rate can be attributed to his reliance more on his sweeper over his sinker and using his changeup more selectively as more of an out pitch to put batters away.  These numbers are in line with how he used his repertoire back in 2021 when he last averaged over 9 k/9, so it’s very possible that he stays with this approach going forward.\n\nThere was a lot to love about the 2025 season for Sanchez as he was the unanimous #2 pitcher in the NL last year, to Paul Skenes according to Cy Young voters.   He was one of only 3 pitchers to throw for over 200 innings, and it wasn’t much of a bump for him from 2024, when he threw 181, so we’re not too worried about overusage.  He’ll cost you a mid-third round pick, but I still like him just behind Webb, who has been going later.  If he’s there and Webb isn’t, I’ll jump on him to start my fantasy pitching staff.\n\nHe’s been one of the best pitchers in the game since May 2024.  His 2.43 era in 2026 was right in line with the 2.51 era he posted from May 1 on in 2024.  His 10.0 k/9 ranked him as the 10th-best strikeout pitcher amongst starters, and his 206 Ks ranked 8th in all of baseball.  The bottom line?  He’s an ace for the Astros, and he will be an ace for your fantasy team.  He’s a bargain in the early 4th round.\n\nGreene is this high based on pure ability, but that ability has been more of a tease than a league winner to this point in his career.  He has yet to throw for over 160 innings in any of his 4 major league seasons, but his K rate era. and ratio numbers over the last 2 years are quite inspiring.  If he can manage 180 innings, he’s going to be a Cy Young Award finalist.  He’s a rare breed of pitcher that can excel even while pitching in that bandbox in Cincinnati.\n\nHe was able to put the best parts of his previous two seasons together in 2025 as he had a career year for the Twins with 194 Ks in 171 innings pitched, along with a 3.42 era and a 1.07 whip.  Entering the season at 29 years of age, he’s poised to retain his mantle as the Twins ace and should be their opening day starter.  He’s an excellent #2 for your fantasy team and a fine #1 if you decide to wait on pitching for a few rounds.  He’s going after guys like deGrom and Sale, but in deeper leagues, I’d much prefer the younger Ryan.\n\nMuch like Hunter Greene, Sale has put up elite numbers without playing a full season.  Unlike Greene, Sale is on the wrong side of 30, and the likelihood of him reaching even as many as 25 starts seems like a stretch.  When he does pitch, he’s one of the best in the game. Just be aware that you aren’t buying a full season’s worth of stats.  He has much more value in a shallower league where decent replacements are available when he’s not.\n\nIf you can’t get Sale, why not get his twin?  DeGrom somehow managed to throw 172 innings last year.  Are we seriously betting on that happening again?  No.  If we were, he’d be much higher on this list after posting a 2.97 era with a sub-1 WHIP along with 185 Ks last year.  Much like Sale, deGrom is elite when he pitches, just don’t buy him expecting a repeat of last year’s numbers.  Much like Sale, he’s a great option for shallower leagues.  If somebody else wants to use their 3rd round pick on him, let them.  It won’t be me.\n\nNo matter what you may think about him, he’s been a workhorse over his career, averaging 30 starts and throwing at least 175+ innings over his last 4 seasons.  Now calling pitcher-friendly Comerica Park his home, his sinker-heavy approach should make him one of the toughest pitchers in the game to take deep.  It remains to be seen how Detroit’s patchwork infield will hold things down behind him, but he’s a solid bet to post 180 innings with about the same number of strikeouts.  He’s a great #2 for any fantasy or real-life staff.\n\nHe was a favorite sleeper of mine heading into 2025, and he outperformed my lofty expectations.  The K rate bounced back to his 2022-23 levels while he was in Miami and playing for a better team juiced up his win total.  The era took a bit of a step back, but that can be chalked up to the move from pitcher-friendly Marlins Park to Citizens Bank Park.  At just 28 years of age, with full health, he can take another step this year and give Skenes some competition for that CYA.\n\nThe Mets new ace has New York fans buzzing as he brings a resume that includes three straight years of 30+ starts and 200+ Ks to Flushing for 2026.  He needs to figure out how to consistently go 6 innings if he’s going to take that next step to the land of the truly elite.  Even where he is right now, he’s in rarified air, so buy him banking on what he’s been doing, and keep your fingers crossed that there’s even \n\nHe was a hot target last season after finishing 4th in the AL Cy Young voting in 2024, earning him the opening day nod for the Royals.  He came out of the gate sluggish and ended up on the IL after just 6 starts.  The injury cost him most of the season, and upon his return, it took him a few starts to get right.  Over 3 short starts in September, he looked to be the pitcher we were hoping for with 22 Ks over 13 innings with a 2.77 era.  He might be a bit of a reach this high, but I believe in the talent as well as his\n\nHe’s been a workhorse, but now he’s a 35-year-old workhorse.  He has posted 31+ starts and 170+ innings in every season since 2021 and will remain atop the Blue Jays rotation for the upcoming season.  He likely has one more season in him at this level, but at this age, anything can happen (just ask Zack Wheeler).  The skills are still there, so as long as he keeps toeing the rubber, he’s going to be a fantasy asset.\n\nA shoulder injury messed with the beginning of his season, and once he returned, he wasn’t quite able to match his previous surface numbers.  Looking beneath the surface, his velocity was the same as pre-injury, and his K rate actually increased.  I’m willing to buy in at a discount if I can get it and expect a return to 2024 at minimum.  Entering his age-28 season, there’s potential for another step forward with full health.\n\nIf you are a fan of trends, then this is the year to grab Dylan Cease.  He’s been a lock for 200+ Ks every year for 5 straight seasons, but his era and whip have bounced up and down every year.  The trend would suggest that this year he’s due for improvement over the 4.55 and 1.33 rates from last year and another top 5 CYA finish.  His stuff is so nasty that I don’t think a move from San Diego to Toronto will matter very much.  He’s the epitome of a “one skill away” pitcher who might just win that CYA this year if he puts it all together.\n\nHe’s going to be a full two-way player this year for the Dodgers, but what does that mean for fantasy?  If you are playing in a league where you can only draft “One Shohei”, then you are likely drafting him to fill your DH role.  In that case, you can stop reading since he’s long gone by now.  If you are in a league that rosters Shohei the hitter and Shohei the pitcher as two different players, he makes for an interesting pitching option.  We can’t really draft him much higher than this because we can’t assume he will make many more than 20-25 starts.  Using his 2023 numbers with the Angels as the baseline, this is a good spot to take him.\n\nThe story has always been the same with Snell.  He’s an amazing talent, but he struggles to stay healthy, and he throws too many pitches to go deep into games.  He’s in the absolute perfect rotation, so he’ll be protected and won’t have to pile up innings.  The downside is he won’t pile up stats, so pay for 120-140 innings max.  On the bright side, he has shown he can amass 170+ strikeouts with under 130 innings pitched.\n\nHe missed all of 2024 with a shoulder injury, and last year, he suffered a few setbacks that delayed his arrival to the mound for the Crew.  Once he did return, he was back in peak form…..until another injury ended his season.  The injury that ended his 2025 was unrelated to the shoulder, and he’s entering camp at full strength, so I feel pretty good about him, even as he enters his age-33 season.  Buy in and bank on 130 innings as a baseline, and you won’t be disappointed.\n\nHe’s 36 years old now and has moved from St. Louis to Boston after back-to-back seasons of 200+ strikeouts for the Redbirds.  His era has been up and down over the last 5 years, and at 36 years of age, I don’t know if we can buy in expecting a bounce back.  The age always scares me, but if you can get him at a fair price (after the 8th round) he’s worth the add.\n\nBased on last year’s numbers, he should be higher on this list, but at 33 years of age, he’s never exactly been the model of consistency.  2025 was likely a career year for Pivetta, and I hate paying the full price for a season that likely won’t ever happen again.  Not only was his 2.87 era his career best, but it was also the first time in his career he pitched to an era under 4.  His underlying skills always suggested that he was due for improvement, but I don’t think we can buy into a repeat of last year.  If everybody is thinking the same way and he falls, I’ll be happy to take him here.  Just don’t count on much more than 150 innings, 160ish K’s, and a mid-3 era.\n\nHe’s young, and the skills say a break-out is coming.  It’s just a matter of staying healthy.  After missing all of 2024 with Tommy John Surgery, he struggled a bit to begin last year before finishing strong.  At just 23 years of age, he should be good to put up closer to 150 innings this year, and I think he’s a strong bet to post 175 Ks with a mid-3 era and low whip.  In keeper leagues, bump him up a little bit because 2027 might be a monster for him.\n\nHe was well on his way to establishing himself as a top-of-the-rotation anchor for Baltimore after a strong 2023, where he posted a K per inning over 168 frames with a sub-3 ERA.  Tommy John got him 8 starts into 2024, and when he finally made it back last year, he looked as good as ever.  Now at full strength entering his age-29 season, he’s poised to lead the Orioles rotation this year.  His K rate from the portions of 24-25′ suggests that there is a step forward coming.\n\nAnother piece (#4 so far) of this elite Mariner rotation.  He’s older now (33), and he’s not quite what he used to be, but he’s still very good.  He won’t likely give us the 200+ Ks that he did back in 2023, but he’s a solid bet to take his turn in the rotation 30+ times and give us 180 innings, 165 Ks with double-digit wins and solid rate stats.  He’s not super sexy, but he’s a solid pick in the later middle rounds of your draft.\n\nHe’s sort of the 6th Beatle, but the truth is, he might very well end up being the best of the bunch.  He missed all of 2024 after receiving the internal brace version of TJS, and upon his return, he gave the Dodgers 12 very nice starts (15 total appearances) where he totaled 89 Ks in 73.1 IP with a 2.82 era and a sterling 0.97 WHIP.  Then, when the postseason rolled around, he went to the bullpen.  That’s going to be the issue this year.  He’s not going to get 30 starts, but if he can get us 25, he’s well worth a pick in about the 10th round in mixed leagues.\n\nOLYMPICS: USA figure skater Isabeau Levito gushes over Olympic Village\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes

However, Cooper did not rule him out for the remainder of the 2026 Winter Olympics, which at most would be two games. Canada plays a semifinal game against Finland on Feb. 20 at Milan Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. Win or lose, there's a medal game next.\n\n\"Sid is by no means ruled out of the tournament,\" Cooper said. \"We’ve got the best of the best looking at him. We’re taking this day by day. And we’re not going to put anyone in harm’s way. But if he can play, he’s definitely going to. We’ll know \n\nCanada needed overtime to advance out of a quarterfinal match against Czechia, and had to make do for more than half of it without Crosby.\n\nCrosby was injured on a hard hit from Czechia's Radko Gudas, with Crosby's right leg buckling as he went down. He was also crunched by Martin Necas. Crosby hobbled to Canada's bench, then down the tunnel, and did not return.\n\nInstead, he addressed his teammates during the second intermission, when it was 2-2, essentially urging them to go get the victory.\n\n\"There was a lot more than that,\" Cooper said. \"You know, he's a true leader.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sidney Crosby injury update: Canada’s hockey captain not ruled out at Olympics",

    "fullText": "The NFL combine begins soon, running from Feb. 23 to March 2. To preview this important pre-draft event, we will be taking a position-by-position look at which prospects were invited and the level of need that the Indianapolis Colts have at each spot.\n\nThe NFL combine is held at Lucas Oil Stadium and is an opportunity for the top NFL draft prospects in this year’s class to go through measurements and various on-field drills, some of which are specific to their position group, and others measure the player’s overall athleticism.\n\nFor NFL teams, this event is another data point for them as they build out their draft profiles and big boards. However, it’s a significant data point, with players potentially flying up and down draft boards depending on how they perform.\n\nIn addition to the on-field drills, teams also get the opportunity to meet with players one-on-one as well, which is another important part of the evaluation process as they get to know them both on and off the field.\n\nTaylor is still under contract through 2026, so the need remains relatively low. With Taylor still just 27 years old, he could be a potential contract extension candidate this offseason.\n\nHowever, while the need at running back may not be high, the Colts could still make an addition here. Adding an inexpensive veteran option in free agency or a mid to late round pick in the draft to bolster the depth and competition behind Taylor could be on Chris Ballard's radar.\n\nBentley was on the practice squad last season, and Giddens was often inactive, still needing to develop parts of his game, particularly in pass protection.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Indianapolis Colts' 2026 NFL combine preview: running backs",

    "fullText": "Liam Lawson has been cautioned that the new 2026 Formula 1 cars might bring to light a weakness in his game this season.\n\nThe Racing Bulls haven’t had a standout pre-season so far, but Arvid Lindblad did manage to put in more laps than anyone else during Wednesday’s morning session.\n\nHe handed over driving duties to Liam Lawson for the afternoon as both drivers get ready for the season opener in Australia.\n\nJack Doohan, watching from trackside in Bahrain, noticed something in the Racing Bulls setup that could be an issue going forward. Still, team principal Alan Permane will hope there’s enough time to address any problems with the VCARB 03 before racing gets underway.\n\nMeanwhile, commentator and journalist Nelson Valkenburg believes a familiar problem could return for Lawson. He suggested that issues from his short spell at Red Bull might reappear this year with the new regulations:\n\nValkenburg spoke about Racing Bulls’ performance during an appearance on the Nailing the Apex Podcast and said: “Yes, it felt very uninterested in headline lap times, but they had some performance niggles and some engine problems and hydraulics.\n\n“I don’t know, where the foundation of the Red Bull feels incredibly strong and stable, less so for the Racing Bulls team, but we can put them in this similar category [to Audi]. Could be fifth, could be eighth.\n\n“I’m becoming a fan of Lindblad. When I spoke to him, he didn’t look shell-shocked, and that’s a good place to be after your first few test days.\n\n“For Lawson, I worry a bit simply because we’ve learned over these days that there is a way of going fast into corners that makes the car a little tail happy.\n\n“Which is probably a nightmare scenario for Liam Lawson, considering what we saw at Red Bull last year.\n\n“You go through the gears, your weight transfers to the front, you do a lot of engine braking and the car. You have to hang on to the rear as you turn into the corner; basically Max’s dream right?”\n\nWhile there are certainly areas for concern when it comes to Racing Bulls’ chances this season based on what has been seen during pre-season testing so far in Bahrain. However they’ll hope that they still have time before things get going for real against McLaren in Australia next month.\n\nWhile the early feedback on the new regulations hasn’t been overwhelmingly positive for Lawson, he’s still young enough to develop the skills needed to thrive under these conditions.\n\nRacing Bulls clearly believe in his potential – they wouldn’t have chosen him over Yuki Tsunoda if they didn’t think he could be a strong partner for Lindblad.\n\nOn the first day of Bahrain’s second week of testing, Lawson finished 12th, seven places ahead of Lindblad.\n\nThe times don’t hold much weight at this point in the season, but it’s still a small boost for Lawson as he heads into the final stretch of pre-season preparations.\n\nFerrari’s F1 car struggles with Verstappen’s high-revs downshift trick during Bahrain test\n\nCarlos Alcaraz says what he thinks about Formula 1 after watching Bahrain test\n\nAnthony Davidson accuses Fernando Alonso of ‘burning up’ tyres in Aston Martin during F1 testing",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid has submitted \"all available evidence\" to Uefa as the governing body investigates allegations of racism made by their forward Vinicius Junior.\n\nThe move comes after the Brazilian star reported racial abuse during a Champions League knockout round play-off tie in Lisbon.\n\nVinicius Junior claims he reported the abuse, allegedly from Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni, to referee Francois Letexier during Tuesday’s match.\n\nUefa confirmed on Wednesday that it had launched a disciplinary investigation into the events.\n\nIn a statement, Real Madrid confirmed their cooperation: \"Real Madrid CF announces that it has today provided Uefa with all available evidence regarding the incidents that occurred (on) Tuesday, February 17, during the Champions League match that our team played in Lisbon against SL Benfica.\"\n\nThe club added, \"Our club has actively co-operated with the investigation opened by Uefa following the unacceptable episodes of racism experienced during that match.\"\n\nThe Spanish giants also expressed gratitude for the support shown to their player.\n\n\"Real Madrid is grateful for the unanimous support and affection that our player Vinicius Jr. has received from all sectors of the global football community,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"Real Madrid will continue working, in collaboration with all institutions, to eradicate racism, violence and hatred in sport and in society.\"\n\nThe match was temporarily halted for 10 minutes in line with UEFA regulations after Vinicius reported the abuse following his goal celebration. He was subsequently shown a yellow card for the celebration.\n\nFollowing the game, Vinicius took to Instagram, writing in Portuguese: \"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. But they have protection from others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish.\n\n“Nothing that happened today is new in my life and my family’s. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. Still not understanding why. On the other side, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\"\n\nPrestianni has since denied making any racist comments towards Vinicius via his own Instagram account. Benfica, his club, has also criticised what they termed a \"defamation campaign\" against their player.\n\nAdding to the controversy, Benfica coach Jose Mourinho has faced criticism from anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out, which described his post-match comments as \"gaslighting.\"\n\nMourinho told Amazon Prime: \"I told (Vinicius), when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. They (Vinicius and Prestianni) told me different things. But I don’t believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.\"\n\nHe further remarked that \"something happens, always\" in matches featuring Vinicius.",

    "fullText": "Former Oklahoma Sooners assistant director of player personnel JP Losman left the program last offseason to get back to an on-field role, and it's a move that paid off, as he's earned a promotion this week.\n\nLosman spent three seasons at OU, but served as the assistant quarterbacks coach at Washington last year. After head coach Jedd Fisch and the Huskies parted ways with offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Jimmie Doughtery, they made the decision to promote Losman to quarterbacks coach, according to a report from ESPN's Adam Rittenberg.\n\nLosman aided in the development of star UW quarterback Demond Williams Jr., and he has extensive experience playing the position as well. He played his college ball at Tulane, where he served as a two-year starter in 2002 and 2003.\n\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) February 18, 2026\n\nAfter being a first-round pick in the 2004 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills, he also played for the Oakland Raiders, Seattle Seahawks, and Miami Dolphins. His coaching career began at Clemson in 2017 and Brent Venables brought him to Norman in 2022. Losman's wife, Zulaikha, was also on staff with the Sooners during the same timeframe he was. She served as OU's director of SOUL mission, player/parent relations.\n\nLosman's time with the Seahawks saw him partner with Fisch, who is the Huskies' offensive play-caller. Washington is still searching for a new offensive coordinator.\n\nFor the Sooners, they have replaced three position coaches already this offseason. OU officially announced the hiring of tight ends coach Jason Witten, and Oklahoma is reported to be hiring LaMar Morgan to coach defensive backs and Deland McCullough to coach running backs.\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Former Oklahoma staff member earns promotion at Big Ten school",

    "description": "Inside the Hungarian midfielder's season as the main character at Liverpool, his friendship with Mohamed Salah and why the Reds are keen to extend his contract.",
    "fullText": "On his forearm, Dominik Szoboszlai has a tattoo in Hungarian which reads 'Talent is a divine blessing, but without incredible will and humility, it is worth nothing'.\n\nDig a little deeper and you find the quote is attributed to Steven Gerrard.\n\nWhen midfielder Szobozlai arrived at Liverpool from RB Leipzig in 2023 for £60m, there was a reason why he took the number eight shirt that had become synonymous with Gerrard at Anfield.\n\nEarlier that summer, Alexis Mac Allister turned down the chance to take the number, but Szoboszlai craved that main-character energy.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been Liverpool's main character this season, scoring his 10th goal of the season last weekend, to go with seven assists.\n\nWhen it was put to him that he was having a \"Steven Gerrard season\", he politely disagreed and insisted he was writing his own story.\n\nOnly forward Hugo Ekitike has more goal involvements and captain Virgil van Dijk has played more minutes than Szoboszlai for Liverpool this season - and close friend Mohamed Salah described him as \"one of the best players in the world right now\".\n\nThe Hungary international may insist on being his own man, but when it comes to taking responsibility as others struggle, and having his own goal of the season competition at the club, there are certainly similarities to the iconic and inspirational Gerrard.\n\nSzoboszlai hasn't always played in his preferred number 10 position this season, but is scoring more frequently - his stunning free-kicks against Arsenal and Manchester City came in games he started at right-back. The step-up in both consistency and output has been clear.\n\nIn a tumultuous Liverpool campaign that has involved speculation about the future of Salah and defenders Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson, perhaps the most important negotiation will be with Szoboszlai, who has just over two years to run on the initial five-year deal signed in 2023.\n\nSpanish outlet Marca reported comments last week from Hungary boss Marco Rossi in which he said Szoboszlai's one dream was to play for Real Madrid. The club's Brazilian forward Vinicius Jr also named the Hungary captain as one of his closest friends outside Real.\n\nEncouragingly for Liverpool supporters, talks over a new contract have started, and Szoboszlai said earlier this month he loved the city and the club. His agent, Matyas Esterhazy, added this week on Hungarian TV the player was not looking for a move elsewhere.\n\nThose who see him on a daily basis at Liverpool describe him as highly competitive with a clear desire to excel.\n\nSzoboszlai is regularly among the first to arrive at training and it's no surprise he's high up in terms of the club's running and physical stats. No Liverpool player has covered more distance this season.\n\nIn a recent video on Liverpool's channels, Milos Kerkez - who plays with him for club and country - said Szoboszlai would be a 400m runner if he wasn't a footballer.\n\n\"He could jog from Liverpool to Hungary and not get tired,\" joked left-back Kerkez.\n\nSzoboszlai is a man determined in his own right, but Salah's high standards are understood to have a big influence on him. Away from football, the pair enjoy playing backgammon and often hang out together at each other's houses.\n\nWhen he was described as \"disrespectful\" last month by Barnsley boss Conor Hourihane for attempting a backheel in his own box that led to a mistake and goal for the League One side, Szoboszlai spoke up to defend himself.\n\nPrivately, manager Arne Slot had a word too.\n\nSzoboszlai's prime years are ahead of him. He was handed the national team captaincy at 22 and Liverpool view him as a future skipper, just like Gerrard.\n\nWith vice-captain Robertson expected to depart this summer and Van Dijk's deal expiring in 2027, the possibility is certainly there.\n\nAsked if Szoboszlai has the attributes to be a future leader, Slot said: \"Yes, but he is still young. He has a lot of attributes already, especially when it comes to leading by example. There is still a step to make in terms of leadership, being vocal and a voice in the dressing room if I compare him to Virgil, which is completely normal.\n\n\"Virgil is 34 and has seen [James] Milner, [Jordan] Henderson and these players, so it's really good for Dominik that he sees Virgil. That would be the next step for him; to be as vocal and as loud as Virgil but that comes with time.\n\n\"But for all the other things, he has a lot to become a very influential player for Liverpool and you could call that a leader.\"\n\nDuring his first season at Liverpool which was Jurgen Klopp's last campaign, Szoboszlai struggled in a game at Luton, and his frustrations summed up when he booted a ball outside the stadium.\n\nSzoboszlai returned later that summer with a point to prove and has been ever-present under Slot since - 2025 was the year he became a husband, father and a Premier League winner.\n\nThis term, he has already played more minutes for Liverpool than he did in 2023-24 and only 302 minutes short of matching his tally for the previous campaign.\n\n\"Obviously he has been very good [this season],\" added Van Dijk. \"He's also a player who I think can still make the next step in terms of being a leader for this team. It starts by leading by example and that's something he has done so far this season.\n\n\"But also everything around it, there is still progress to be made and that's a good thing in my opinion, so hopefully he will be very important for the years to come at Liverpool.\"\n\nWhen Klopp signed Szoboszlai - who had impressed at Red Bull Salzburg before joining RB Leipzig in 2021 - he said: \"This is a signing for our present and also for our future.\"\n\nLiverpool will be keen to make sure that remains the case.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Morgan Rogers has long been touted as a Chelsea transfer target, and he’s a top player. Tottenham are now being linked as well.\n\nWhile there’s plenty of season left, it’s no surprise to see attentions turn to the summer. Chelsea will likely look to add another attacking options, and a very popular choice among fans would be Morgan Rogers. The Aston Villa attacker has long been linked with us, and looks a world class star.\n\nNow Tottenham are also being mentioned in connection with the 23 year old. Football Insider report that Spurs could look to be more aggressive in the market now they have new people in charge. After a heavy spend last summer, they’d still likely have to sell, but we can see why Rogers is a popular option.\n\nMorgan Rogers in action for Aston Villa. (Photo by Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)\n\nWe have our doubts about whether Chelsea will be signing Rodgers, as the reported demands of around £100m just make it such a hard deal to do. But if we make it into the Champions League and Liam Rosenior is really happy with the squad, we can see perhaps one big spend in the summer.\n\nOne thing we don’t forsee is Tottenham being the ones to buy him. They’ve even less likely to spend that sort of money, and they’re a far less tempting destination for a player right now. Frankly, it looks most likely he spends another year at Villa right now.\n\nLiam Delap continues to be linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge, but we really don’t see it as likely just yet.\n\nIt looks like Marc Cucurella could be missing for a while, so Chelsea fans are wondering about what possible solutions there could be at left back.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

    "fullText": "Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. \n\nUttarakhand, resuming at 149/5, were bundled out for 233 in 90 minutes. Karnataka, instead of enforcing the follow-on, chose to rest their bowlers and give their batters time in the middle.\n\nThe day began with Karnataka snuffing out Uttarakhand’s resistance swiftly. In reply, Karnataka opened with Mayank Agarwal (21) and Kruthik Krishna (52). Mayank fell at the stroke of lunch, edging Abhay Negi to wicketkeeper Saurabh Rawat. The post-lunch session saw a brief wobble as Shreyas Gopal (0) and Karun Nair (8) departed in quick succession, momentarily slowing the tempo.\n\nKruthik, however, continued his impressive run, bringing up his second successive half-century. But just as he looked set for more, he misread Avneesh Sudha’s googly and was trapped in front. From there, R Smaran and KL Rahul combined to toy with an increasingly weary Uttarakhand attack. Rahul raced to 70 not out off just 67 balls, with three fours and five sixes. He signalled his half-century by launching a Negi delivery into the long-on stands. For now, Kar-nataka’s focus remains clear — complete the formalities and prepare for one final push at a long-awaited ninth title. The final is likely to be staged at the KSCA Rajnagar Stadium in Hubballi.\n\nBrief scores: Karnataka 736 in 194 overs (Smaran 135, Patil 54; Rawat 4-154, Mishra 3-173) & 299/6 (Smaran 127, Rahul 70;) vs Uttarakhand 233 (Raichandani 55, Rawat 45, V Patil 3-40).",

(Photo by Selim Sudheimer/Getty Images)\n\nThe Bundesliga outfit travel to Glasgow for tonight’s Europa League knockout play-off first leg, with the Scottish champions arriving in fine form after five consecutive wins.\n\nMeanwhile, Stuttgart head into the clash sitting fourth in the Bundesliga, having claimed five victories from their last six matches. Hoeness is also relishing the chance to experience the atmosphere at Celtic Park once again, nearly a decade after his previous visit.\n\nA view of Celtic Park Celtic v Livingston, Scottish Premiership, Celtic Park, 11 February 2026. Photo Mark Runnacles IMAGO/ Shutterstock\n\nThe 43-year-old was present in the stadium during his time as a Bayern Munich youth coach, watching as Bayern defeated Celtic 2-1 in the Champions League back in 2017.\n\nSpeaking via Daily Record, Hoeness said: “I expect a lot. I think they are a team who have had a really turbulent season with a lot of changes in coaches. The current coach is there for a second time this season; he has a special history here.”\n\n“He’s a very experienced coach. It’s a team who have really found form again recently after ups and downs this season. They’ve played a lot of games but have now gone 10 games undefeated. It’s one of the toughest draws we could’ve got but it’s also one of the most exciting.”\n\n“We’ll have the opportunity to play in this historic stadium. It has a really special energy that can be unleashed when the teams harness the energy from the fans. The noise that they make, it gives the team power and energy and we’ll have to be able to counter that.”\n\nCeltic fans display a banner against the board during the Scottish Premiership match between Celtic and Falkirk at Celtic Park on February 01, 2026.

It’s going to be really challenging, but these are the games you want to be competing in when you’re competing in Europe. We’re going to try and put ourselves in a good position heading into next week.”\n\nHoeness has highlighted several key players he believes pose a major danger in the Celtic ranks, while also warning that the club’s recent January arrivals could add further unpredictability and create significant challenges for his side.\n\nThe Stuttgart manager said: ”Yes, I would say so.. in general, you can say it’s a really experienced team.”\n\n“Almost every player is around 26/27. They have two new players – Adamu and Cvancara – who are known from the Bundesliga, and the other played in the Premier League [Julian Araujo].”\n\nReo Hatate of Celtic celebrates scoring his team’s second goal with teammate Daizen Maeda during the UEFA Europa League 2025/26 League Phase MD5 match between Feyenoord and Celtic FC at De Kuip on November 27, 2025 in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

    "fullText": "Celtic and VfB Stuttgart face off at Celtic Park on Thursday evening in the first leg of the UEFA Europa League knockout round play-off, with a spot in the round of 16 at stake.\n\nThe Bhoys ended the Europa League league phase in 21st place, collecting 11 points from eight matches and scoring 13 goals in the process.\n\nMartin O’Neill’s side are currently enjoying a 10-game unbeaten run in all competitions and have found the net at least twice in each of their last five fixtures, a sequence that includes a 3–2 comeback win over Kilmarnock at the weekend.\n\nCeltic have several injury problems to contend with ahead of Stuttgart’s visit.\n\nLeft-back Adam Montgomery is unavailable due to a calf issue, while right-back Alistair Johnston and midfielder Callum Osmand remain sidelined with hamstring and tendon problems and are not expected back until early March.\n\nIn central defence, Cameron Carter-Vickers is out for the rest of the season with an Achilles injury, and winger Jota is also ruled out long term after suffering a cruciate ligament problem, further reducing O’Neill’s choices both at the back and in wide attacking areas.\n\nBelgian midfielder Arne Engels is another absentee; he is recovering from a thigh injury and is only anticipated to return to action in a week or two.\n\nPossible Celtic starting XI: Schmeichel; Araujo, Trusty, Scales, Tierney; Nygren, McGregor, Hatate; Adamu, Cvancara, Maeda\n\nThe match will kick off at 8pm BST on Thursday, 19th February.\n\nUK fans can watch the match live on TNT Sports 1 and TNT Sports Ultimate.\n\nRead – Iconic Duos: Chelsea’s impregnable pairing made of steel and silk, Terry and Carvalho\n\nSee Also – Bayern open to defender departure as Chelsea and Spurs circle\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "fullText": "If you’re looking for a snapshot of why the Detroit Tigers think so highly of Max Clark, it turns out you don’t need a highlight-reel catch or a towering home run.\n\nDuring Tigers’ spring training in Lakeland, one Jeff Seidel of the Detroit Free Press stumbled into a moment that perfectly summed up Clark’s unflappable nature. After practice, Clark was standing in the clubhouse, calm as ever, when he was asked a routine question.\n\nBefore answering, Clark paused, walked over to a trash can — and casually emptied his mouth.\n\nThat’s when he delivered the line.\n\n“I think I just broke a tooth.”\n\nNo panic. No urgency. No sprinting for medical help. Just a matter-of-fact observation, like he was commenting on the weather.\n\nFor a second, it didn’t quite register. Did he really just say that? Was that… his tooth? In the trash?\n\nClark poked around the back of his mouth, confirmed something was off, then shrugged it off like it was a minor inconvenience.\n\n“We’ll get that figured out in a second,” he said.\n\nAnd with that, he nodded — politely — and invited the interview to continue.\n\nThis wasn’t bravado. It wasn’t a tough-guy act. It was something much rarer: complete composure in a moment where most people would absolutely lose it.\n\nA broken tooth would derail a lot of folks. At the very least, it would dominate the moment. Not with Clark.\n\nInstead of rushing to a dentist or calling for help, he centered himself, made sure everything was under control, and shifted his focus back to the task at hand.\n\nThat’s the kind of detail scouts and coaches obsess over — not because of the tooth itself, but because of what it reveals under pressure.\n\nInside the Tigers organization, moments like this don’t shock anyone.\n\nClark has built a reputation as a prospect who doesn’t flinch. Big crowds, big expectations, uncomfortable moments — they don’t seem to rattle him. Whether it’s on the field or in a clubhouse conversation with a literal dental issue unfolding, his approach stays the same.\n\nStay calm. Stay focused. Handle the moment.\n\nIt’s easy to talk about tools, projections, and ceilings. But baseball people will tell you that makeup matters — and sometimes, it shows up in the strangest ways.\n\nLike calmly finishing an interview… right after breaking a tooth.\n\nThe post Max Clark Shows Elite Composure in Bizarre Spring Training Moment appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Joan Laporta is campaigning hard to win next month’s Barcelona elections and has taken aim at match officials in his latest speech.\n\nThe Barca chief was speaking after seeing Hansi Flick’s team left fuming by an eight-minute VAR delay against Atletico Madrid and angry at the decision to allow a late winner for Girona despite a foul on Jules Kounde.\n\nLaporta claims some match officials have a real problem with Barcelona and has called on the team to play even better in the face of adversity.\n\n“There are certain referees who, when they officiate our games, screw us over. Excuse my language, but it’s true. It’s a recurring issue, a constant problem. It’s a reality. I could name them all,” he told reporters.\n\n“This hasn’t happened just once, but many times. In identical plays, they’ve been able to call the wrong thing to harm Barça. It’s blatant.\n\n“We are defending Barça against everything and everyone. Against people who simply can’t accept who we are and what we represent. They can’t stand what we are achieving with our team. This is the only way they can stop us because they can’t stop us on the field.\n\n“We have a team that can aspire to almost anything and face every possible adversity. The best way to deal with this dysfunction and its intentions is to be better and play better , to have a better team and overcome this adversity.”\n\nLaporta also took aim at Real Madrid and feels Los Blancos receive preferential treatment.\n\n“When we’re down, they try to take advantage and crush us. And when others are down, they help them,” he added.\n\n“They’ve learned to swim and they dive in like a pro. We know we have to fight against all that too.”\n\nBarcelona and Real Madrid are back in La Liga action this weekend. Real Madrid are up first on Saturday at Osasuna, while Barcelona play on Sunday against Levante.",

Hayes is also benefitting from the strong passing ability of both Doncic and LeBron James, averaging a career-high 77.2% from the field, as the duo has helped him find easy looks inside the paint.\n\nAs long as Hayes can continue to play the pick-and-roll well with Los Angeles' ball-handlers, he'll have the opportunity to be effective in the Lakers' offense.\n\nThat said, at 7' 0\", Hayes could be a bit better defensively, having never averaged one block or \n\nEither way, it appears Hayes could be a Laker for many seasons to come.\n\nDoncic and Hayes will return to action following the All-Star break Feb. 20 against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nLonzo Ball calls himself the 'scapegoat' following trade from Cavaliers\n\nSpurs' Mason Plumlee deal foreshadows another move to come\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo praises Kon Knueppel: 'One of the smartest rookies I’ve ever seen'\n\nCarter Bryant reveals what happened on final dunk attempt\n\nTyrese Maxey: 'I feel a lot less out of place' after second All-Star appearance\n\nKon Knueppel speaks after third-place in three-point contest",

    "fullText": "Blue Jays' Trey Yesavage leapfrogged shortstop in Toronto hierarchy originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrey Yesavage's rise has been incredible.\n\nThat was exemplified at the end of last season, when he only showed up to the Toronto Blue Jays for the stretch run and then became a dominant postseason force anyway.\n\nThat was lifted expectations for the young right-hander sky high, and he'll have to do his best to meet them.\n\nIt also provided a cool chance for MLB.com's prospect ranking staff to look back. They wrote an article released Thursday which compared who they thought would be each organization's top-ranked prospect, which they predicted two years in advance, to who it actually is.\n\nYesavage pulled off a leapfrog for the Blue Jays.\n\nThe writers had predicted Arjun Nimmala, a shortstop who currently ranks 77th in their top-100. Yesavage ranks No. 12.\n\n\"Toronto’s three most recent first-round picks all feature in our Top 100, and while Nimmala (the 2023 20th overall pick) ranks third of the trio, that isn’t a knock against him,\" MLB.com's writers explain. \"Still only 20 years old, the shortstop made nice improvements in terms of his chase rate at High-A Vancouver last year, and he has the potential to hit 25-plus homers at full maturity as he continues to add strength to his 6-foot-1 frame. He and top 2025 selection JoJo Parker could duke it out for the future of the shortstop position north of the border.\"\n\nGiven that Yesavage pitched across five levels of the organizational ladder in 2025, it's not shocking that he has risen from lower down the board to reach this point.\n\nClearly, he has even more believers now. His fastball-splitter combination has the potential to be dominant for years to come.\n\nAnd it's not like Nimmala has fallen off too far. He can still become an MLB contributor, too.",

    "description": "Wake Forest is getting healthy, Clemson, appears to be sick…but Georgia Tech may be terminal.",
    "fullText": "In Wednesday’s ACC Action, Virginia clocked Georgia Tech, 94-68, and Wake Forest surprised Clemson, 85-77.\n\nWake Forest basically dominated the entire game. A week or two ago, who would have expected that?\n\nWell, here’s something you may have missed – Clemson has lost three straight, to Virginia Tech, Duke and now Wake Forest. And all three losses were by double figures. Prior to this, the Tigers were 13-1 in their last 14 games. Brad Brownell has work to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Wake Forest, despite not really having anyone inside to speak of, is catching fire late. Too late, probably, but it’s still impressive that the Deacs have won three straight.\n\nSteve Forbes has continued to tinker with his lineup. In this one, he went with Tre’Von Spillers, Cooper Schwieger and Sebastian Akins up front and Juke Harris and Myles Colvin the backcourt. Harris led the way with 20 points.\n\nJake Wahlin paced the Tigers with 17.\n\nAs for Virginia, remember that scene in Braveheart when Longshanks realizes that if Wallace can take York, he can get the rest of England?\n\nVirginia shot up 39-9 in the first half. Obviously, the game was over at that point. Georgia Tech gave up 59 points in the first half, en route to losing their eighth straight game.\n\nThe question isn’t really how bad it was. The question is the fallout. NC State got nuked at Louisville two games ago but bounced back nicely against UNC and is still on target for a tournament bid. Meanwhile, Georgia Tech is on target to miss the ACC Tournament, since the bottom three teams won’t go anymore.\n\nHowever, it could still escape this fate as BC and Pitt also have just two ACC wins. We’ll see.\n\nThe other question is this: was it because the Yellow Jackets are really bad or because Virginia is really good?\n\nVirginia has certainly been winning and has won eight straight road games, which is tremendous. However, the Wahoos beat SMU by 4, lost to UNC by 5, nipped Notre Dame by 3, BC by 13, FSU by 3 and Ohio State by 4. We’re tentatively going with the Yellow Jackets being that bad.\n\nOver at WRAL, Pat Welter and Chris Lea discuss Hubert Davis’s UNC and reach the same conclusion we’ve discussed from time to time: Davis has no idea how to communicate with his team.\n\nThat doesn’t mean they won’t win games of course, but it does go a long way to explaining why guys who transfer from UNC do so well at their new schools. Consider Michigan’s Elliott Cadeau, Minnesota’s Cade Tyson and Vanderbilt’s Tyler Nickel for a few quick examples. Consider also that Caleb Love became a consistent and reliable presence at Arizona in his final two years.\n\nRecap: Big First Half Fuels Wake Past Clemson 85-77\n\nWake Forest answers questions about toughness against Clemson 85-77\n\nClemson Jr. Forward Jake Wahlin postgame following loss to Wake Forest\n\nClemson Tigers Fall Behind Early Again, Lose Third Straight Game to Wake Forest\n\nWake Forest remains hot, extends Clemson’s slide\n\nVirginia overwhelms Georgia Tech with historic first half\n\nAnother bad start sends Georgia Tech to eighth straight loss\n\nUVA Basketball: ‘Hoos dominant in 94-68 blowout win at Georgia Tech\n\nEvaluating UVA basketball’s resumé after 26-point win at Georgia Tech\n\nGo to the DBR Boards to find Blue Healer Auctions | Drop us a line",

    "description": "Should the Tennessee Titans re-sign OT Oli Udoh? Previewing NFL Free Agency for GM Mike Borgonzi.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Music City Miracles’ Tennessee Titans 2026 NFL Free Agency Primer! The negotiating window period begins on March 9th, but the Titans are able to re-sign their own free agents before then. General manager Mike Borgonzi is equipped with more than $100 million in cap space and will collaborate with new head coach Robert Saleh on their shared vision for the 2026 Titans.\n\nThe Titans are currently scheduled to possess 29 free agents (19 unrestricted), including several key starters and role players. Over the next few weeks, we’ll take an in-depth look at each free agent and provide arguments for why the Titans should, or shouldn’t re-sign that player. We’ll also offer our final verdict and a prediction to go along with our analysis.\n\nToday, we’re analyzing offensive tackle Oli Udoh.\n\nUdoh ended up playing a valuable swing role for the Titans behind starters JC Latham and Dan Moore Jr. As far as backup tackles go, he performed reasonably well. Pro Football Focus assigned identical overall and pass-blocking grades of 55.0. The Titans’ offense rarely suffered specifically because Udoh was in the lineup.\n\nPFF also credited Udoh with allowing 19 pressures, three sacks, and being whistled for six penalties. That’s a fair amount of negative plays for a tackle who earned just 274 reps at left and right tackle. Perhaps the Titans could identify a more suitable reserve tackle in free agency.\n\nSpotrac does not have a projected contract for Udoh. He signed a one-year, $1,170,000 million contract with the Titans last offseason. An extension would probably be in a similar range, maybe with a slight raise in pay.\n\nThe Titans should re-sign Udoh. His level of play improved as the campaign progressed forward. Udoh wasn’t a drive-killer when he entered games, and that’s the realistic expectation for reserve tackles. The former Elon standout was even better than recent starters at tackle for the Titans like Dennis Daley, Nicholas Petit-Frere, and Andre Dillard.\n\nThe Titans re-sign Udoh to another one-year contract.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from Kicker journalist Mario Krischel (as captured by @iMiaSanMia), Bayern Munich head coach Vincent Kompany could be contemplating having two starters sit out vs. Eintracht Frankfurt this weekend due to their respective yellow card count:\n\nJoshua Kimmich and Jonathan Tah could start on the bench against Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Both players are on 4 yellow cards, meaning another one would see them miss the game against Borussia Dortmund. Goretzka (also on 4 yellow cards) or Tom Bischof are the alternatives for Kimmich. Kim Min-jae or (Hiroki) Itō would replace Tah.\n\nThis could be interesting for Kompany, who has been reluctant to rotate much at the central midfield and center-back positions. Fans have been clamoring to see more of Bischof in the midfield, will this be the opportunity that the youngster has been waiting for? As for the backline, Kompany has the aforementioned options in Kim and Itō.\n\nNo matter who Kompany opts to go with, he will have proven Bundesliga players at all positions and that is not such a bad spot to be in against a talented squad like Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "title": "Mikel Arteta obsesses over the tiniest details. Is it now harming Arsenal’s title chances?",
    "description": "IN FOCUS: Arteta’s desire to control every single detail - right down the steering wheel on the Arsenal bus - is the reason they are leading the title race, writes Miguel Delaney. It is also exhausting",
    "fullText": "It was the sort of scene that just shouldn’t be possible for a team in command of first place.\n\nArsenal were going seven points clear and 2-0 up against the Premier League’s doomed bottom side - only to end the match arguing with Wolves players, after a chaotic late equaliser.\n\nThey suddenly looked like a team out of control.\n\nThere is a profound irony there, that could be seen in Mikel Arteta’s shell-shocked post-game press conference.\n\nThat is because he is a manager who seeks to control more about his team than any manager, including Pep Guardiola.\n\nIt is both the reason that Arsenal are where they are and also a problem that may ultimately prevent them getting where they really, really want to go. The very desire itself has become another issue.\n\nIn trying to fulfil all of that, Arteta has been empowered to fully indulge an instinct that was already there - and has taken them this far - but may now start to be self-defeating at the crucial moment when victory is so close.\n\nThose who know Arteta say he is the ultimate “probabilities guy”. He looks at every single detail - right down to the temperature on the ice baths and the steering wheel on the bus - and assesses what can be done to statistically improve the chances of success there.\n\nSome around the club have already started to wonder how that fits with the selection of Viktor Gyokeres as the main striker signing, a struggling player who may unfairly become a lightning rod for criticism if this doesn’t happen for Arsenal.\n\nOther sources insist that Arteta is no longer playing to the strengths of such attackers, in the way he did around 2022 to 2024. This can be witnessed in relatively pitiful goal numbers for attackers.\n\nAnd it is here where this desire for control is starting to turn into a lock, that is beginning to prevent Arsenal pushing on.\n\nArteta has become so obsessed with increasing probabilities that it is starting to make a long-awaited title less likely.\n\nThe team has become so controlled that they’re becoming constrained. The last two matches - a 2-2 draw against Wolves and 1-1 against Brentford - were vintage examples.\n\nArsenal went ahead in both games and could have kept playing as they were playing against inferior sides, but they seized up and consequently lost control of the game.\n\nThere’s just no need for it to happen, but the fact it does points to something psychological, where their biggest opposition genuinely is themselves.\n\nTheir approach is too clever for its own good, too over-coached, removing a freedom from players that becomes exhausting.\n\nHence this angst about everything, the deep desire for the title interweaving with Arteta’s innate desire for control to amplify the negative effect of both.\n\nIt now means the Basque has to get a hold of this to stop it becoming a negative cycle.\n\nArteta has already told his players that nothing is actually lost yet so they should enjoy the journey, but he may have to go further back in his own journey with this team; to look back to 2022-23.\n\nThe very approach is so different to four years ago and even two years ago.\n\nHence we have this situation where Arsenal are certainly a better squad, with more qualities, but don’t seem to be able to maximise what they’ve got in the same way.\n\nIn 2022-23, after all, many opposition coaches genuinely used to marvel at how difficult they were to play against. Arsenal would pen a team in, with the whirl of movement around Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka then unravelling them. There was real life, but there wasn’t yet experience.\n\nThe team was ultimately too young for the title and wasn’t yet ready, for which there’s no shame. They were also up against a Manchester City who finally became European champions and treble winners. It was asking a lot for a team on their first title challenge to reach that level.\n\nArsenal did get there the next season, and the 16 victories out of the last 18 games of the 2023-24 campaign were probably the best spell of the Arteta era. They were there, having got to 89 points.\n\nCity, the most lavish project ever witnessed in football, still just had more. They got two more points.\n\nBut that is also why last season might have proven another hinge moment, that could yet have turned things in the wrong direction.\n\nGuardiola endured an unprecedented crisis, partly related to his own power at City, and the opportunity was there for Arsenal. Just at that moment, though, they suffered a series of injury crises themselves. Questions were naturally asked about training, and Arteta's approach there. Again, that control.\n\nThe manager’s solution to that, however, was just to greatly deepen the squad last summer.\n\nBut this might have been where that desire for control - this will to constantly increase probabilities - was taken to recruitment, too.\n\nArsenal had greater numbers, but they didn’t necessarily have greater quality. The squad was widened but it wasn’t raised.\n\nThe attack, consequently, does not currently have that greater killer quality that most champions possess. They don't even have the goals of Chelsea's Diego Costa in 2014-15 or 2016-17.\n\nA question persists over whether they should have taken the money for Gyokeres, Noni Madueke and maybe even Eberechi Eze and just gone bigger on guaranteed stardust; to really test a club’s willingness to keep a player in the way champions do.\n\nThe effects of this can be witnessed in the goal numbers.\n\nThe following is a rather crude statistic in the era of proper analytics, but it still really feels like it matters. Who scores for Arsenal when they really need a goal; when they need an opener, an equaliser or a match-winner; those genuine clutch moments that do require teams to go deeper in themselves?\n\nWhen it comes to openers, equalisers or match-winning goals, Martin Zubimendi, Mikel Merino and Gabriel are on top with a mere three each.\n\nThe numbers for the attack just aren’t good enough, which is precisely why it feels like Arsenal are now receding. They’re not pressing home.\n\nLeandro Trossard and Saka are top of this statistic, with just two each. One of Saka’s was last night. Gyokeres does have two, too, but one of those was a penalty against Everton after Odegaard gave him the ball.\n\nThis is generally not champion material. They need more. You need players that offer those moments.\n\nCosta is raised because he offered eight of these goals in 2014-15 and 11 in 2016-17. Eric Cantona famously got four match-winners in consecutive games in 1995-96, contributing to 11. That same season, Ian Wright got seven for Arsenal. The formation of attacks might have changed in the modern game, but the need for individual inspiration does not.\n\nThere’s an obvious point to be made here that talents like Odegaard and Saka should now be producing more as they come into their primes, at 27 and 24 respectively, but then you also return to the question of play, and control.\n\nIs the team still geared that way to maximise their talents? Do they have the emphasis they did over 2022 to 2024? Or is it now too minimalist?\n\nNone of this is to say Arsenal won’t win the league. They’re still in a good position. They’re still probably the best squad in the country - maybe Europe - with the qualities to press this home.\n\nIt’s just that, in a classic contradiction, it is right now as if they are currently reducing their own strong chances.\n\nArteta needs to get a hold of it, but that may involve being able to let go.",

    "description": "Oil prices are up after three straight years of decline as geopolitical tensions ignite supply fears in the energy market.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices have climbed in recent weeks, even as a global surplus has left hundreds of millions of barrels floating offshore.\n\nOn Wednesday, oil prices ended over 4% higher as traders priced in the risk of supply disruptions amid tensions between the US and Iran and uncertainty over the war in Ukraine, after talks in Geneva ended without a breakthrough.\n\nOil futures edged up early Thursday, with US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures trading around $65.30 per barrel at 1:04 a.m., while international benchmark Brent crude was around $70.50 per barrel.\n\nPrices of both grades are around 15% higher this year after three straight years of decline, reflecting a return of the geopolitical risk premium despite a global oil supply surplus.\n\nThe key reason for the disconnect is that much of the surplus has materialized as sanctioned crude \"stuck at sea,\" while inventories in key pricing hubs have remained stable, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a Wednesday note.\n\nGoldman estimates the oil market ran a surplus of about 1.5 million barrels per day in 2025. Normally, that kind of oversupply would weigh heavily on prices.\n\nInstead, many tankers carrying sanctioned crude from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela are sitting at sea, using \"dark fleet\" and shadow shipping tactics to evade sanctions and keep oil moving.\n\nWhile that allows sanctioned oil to keep flowing, it also leaves more barrels lingering at sea, far from storage centers such as the US Gulf Coast and Northwest Europe — regions that anchor global crude pricing.\n\nSanctioned crude inventories on water have risen by around 130 million barrels from a year ago and now stand at roughly 375 million barrels, Goldman estimates. That accounts for about one-third of the increase in global crude inventories.\n\n\"Inventory builds matter less for prices when occurring on water,\" Goldman wrote, because traders discount barrels that may never reach key pricing hubs.\n\nThe buildup stemmed from weaker demand for sanctioned crude late last year, as India and China bought less Russian oil.\n\nThat softer demand reflected shifting geopolitical incentives, including changes in US trade policy, as well as expectations of steeper discounts or possible sanctions relief, the bank added.\n\n\"We assume that the pace of stockpiling moderates at sea but picks up on land,\" Goldman wrote.\n\nThe bank expects the share of oil inventory tied up offshore to fall from about 47% in 2025 to roughly 21% in 2026.\n\nHolding its global surplus estimate constant, Goldman's framework suggests that every 1 million barrels per day of sanctioned crude that piles up at sea for 12 months can lift Brent by as much as $8 per barrel.\n\nMeanwhile, every 100 million barrel reduction in oil stored offshore — as cargoes move into land-based inventories — could lower prices by $3 to $4.\n\nGoldman expects Brent to average $56 per barrel and WTI $52 in 2026, the bank's analysts wrote in a separate note on January 11.",

    "description": "People are using GLP-1s to cut back on alcohol use disorder, but there are already three FDA-approved drugs: naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram.",
    "fullText": "To some extent, Americans are talking about alcohol more than ever. We're having open conversations about the negative health impacts of drinking. People are consuming less booze overall and examining strategies to moderate, even as each drink packs more punch. There is one aspect of alcohol we're still not talking about: addiction, and, more precisely, the medical treatments available to combat it. What's even odder — your doctor may not know much about them, either.\n\nEven as researchers examine the potential for GLP-1s such as Ozempic and Zepbound to reduce alcohol consumption, the most underappreciated story in alcohol use disorder isn't the promise of new drugs. It's why the ones we already have are so rarely used. There are three FDA-approved medications to treat AUD in the US: naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram. They've existed for decades, are effective for some people in reducing or stopping drinking, and, addiction physicians say, have few drawbacks.\n\nDespite all of this, they are broadly unknown to patients and widely underprescribed. Just 2% of Americans with an alcohol disorder diagnosis receive approved medications for treatment, says Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. By comparison, 85% of people diagnosed with diabetes get approved treatments for it.\n\nThese drugs aren't a panacea — like all medications, some things work for some people and not others. But they're an important tool in a toolbox to treat a condition that affects millions of Americans and takes thousands of lives each year.\n\n\"The challenge here is to really treat addiction the same way we treat diabetes, hypertension, cancer, Parkinson's, depression, and the list goes on and on,\" Leggio says.\n\nAt a basic level, the medications used to treat alcohol use disorder do something quite simple: they make drinking less appealing.\n\nThe first is naltrexone, which was first developed to treat opioid use disorder. It blocks the warm, buzzy feelings of alcohol — people may still drink, but it doesn't do much for them. (They'll still get the impaired effects of alcohol, just not the euphoria.) Some people use naltrexone to undertake what's called the \"Sinclair Method,\" where they take the drug an hour before starting drinking so that when the session begins, the pleasurable effects from the alcohol are blunted. The idea is that if the person takes naltrexone every time they drink, the associated reward with alcohol will lessen, reducing cravings over time and thus leading to a significant drop in drinking or even abstinence. Some people may choose to take naltrexone only when they have what could be a potentially heavy drinking event, like a wedding, so they end the night with two drinks instead of 10. Naltrexone is also available through an extended-release one-month injection.\n\nAnother option is acamprosate, which restores brain balance after it's been thrown off by heavy alcohol use and can help reduce cravings, though it doesn't reduce alcohol's effects in the moment. It's prescribed more commonly in Europe. The final of the trio is disulfiram, which inhibits the body's ability to break down alcohol — essentially, it makes people sick if they drink. It's the least commonly prescribed of the three because of high rates of patient noncompliance.\n\nResearch shows that naltrexone can help reduce heavy drinking and cravings, and acamprosate can help promote abstinence and prevent a return to drinking.\n\n\"I really view medications as being tremendously helpful in turning the volume down on craving, on withdrawal symptoms, on some of the other reasons that people struggle,\" says Katie Witkiewitz, a psychologist at the University of New Mexico who specializes in substance use disorders.\n\nEffectiveness can vary among patients and can be modest, as with many medications. The same goes for side effects, which can include headache or nausea (sometimes caused by naltrexone), and lack of appetite or irritability (sometimes caused by acamprosate). Addiction specialists say the medications are generally well-tolerated by most patients.\n\n\"There's lots of benefits and very few drawbacks,\" says Sarah Wakeman, the senior medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham in Boston. \"These medications are incredibly safe, and you need very little, if any, lab monitoring.\"\n\nThe drugs are also hyper affordable — naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram are all generics, and they're generally covered by insurance. The exception is Vivitrol, the naltrexone injection, which is still under patent.\n\nGiven how straightforward these medications are, it's natural to ask why they aren't used more often. The answer is complicated, having to do with the stigma around addiction, lack of patient knowledge, and the ways in which our society and the medical establishment treat alcohol.\n\nAlcoholism is a disease of denial — individuals often minimize, rationalize, or lie about their drinking. Even people who drink moderately tend to fudge the numbers when asked about their alcohol habits, either by their doctor or people they know. Our culture writ large is in denial about alcoholism, too. We tend to treat it as a lack of willpower, as a moral failing, and a bad habit people need to knock off. We generally don't see it as the chronic condition it is.\n\nMany people may not realize they are engaging in problem drinking, and if they do, they may not go to their doctors about it. Treatment for alcohol use disorder has \"largely evolved outside of the mainstream of healthcare,\" says Dr. Caleb Alexander, a practicing internist and drug safety expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Historically, it's been siloed into specialty treatment programs — behavioral therapies, rehabilitation centers, or groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or SMART Recovery. These work for some people, but not everyone. Alexander adds that many of these settings don't have prescribers, formularies, or medication management that would provide access to AUD drugs. Some groups may also be opposed to medication intervention.\n\nThose who do seek help through the healthcare system often run into discouraging obstacles, and doctors themselves may be ill-equipped to help. Physicians are often poorly trained in addiction medicine in medical school or residency. They may not be versed in the medications available or have a misperception that they need specialization to prescribe them. Doctors are also people, and they may hold the same biases as anyone else about alcohol.\n\n\"A lot of doctors don't even want to have these conversations at all,\" says Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University who specializes in addiction and a former senior policy advisor in the Obama administration.\n\nThe result: the medications that are at doctors' fingertips go woefully under-discussed and under-prescribed. People lie to their doctors about their drinking instead of having open, honest talks. Because these drugs are generics and don't lead to a huge payday for manufacturers, there's no marketing money behind them, and they have no champions. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy: Since there is such a small market now, potential innovations for alcohol addiction are stunted.\n\n\"If doctors don't want to prescribe it and patients have never heard of it, then a company is not going to develop the next drug for drinking because they're like, 'It's a waste of money,'\" Humphreys says.\n\nThere are some online providers to fill the void, such as telehealth company Oar Health and Ria Health, which focus on medication-assisted alcohol treatment. They can be options for people who may be too embarrassed to go to their doctors or whose doctors are resistant to trying medications, but they're also costlier and may not come with the same level of supervision.\n\nThere are some signs that this neglect may not be a permanent state of affairs.\n\nResearchers are studying whether GLP-1s such as semaglutide and tirzepatide might help reduce alcohol consumption. While some early evidence is promising, experts say it's too early to tell just how effective they might ultimately be. If GLP-1s do prove useful in helping to treat alcohol use disorder, they have some advantages other medications do not: there's a lot of money and momentum behind them.\n\n\"They're already part of the cultural milieu,\" Witkiewitz says. \"People are using them, people are wanting them, and that's not something we typically see with medications.\"\n\nGLP-1 makers were initially hesitant to investigate the effectiveness of their drugs on alcohol use because they were concerned it might damage their brands, Humphreys says, in another example of just how pervasive the addiction stigma is. Now, \"the companies have decided they're going to go for it.\"\n\nAt the moment, GLP-1s are merely a hope in helping people manage problem alcohol use. The reality is that there are options out there, they're just often ignored. The overarching barrier has more to do with lack of will than lack of way. Ideally, there would be multiple other drugs under development for the treatment of AUD, and more patients and doctors would know about what's already out there.\n\n\"All these tools that we have, from 12 steps to AAs to behavior treatment to medications, they're not mutually exclusive,\" Leggio says.\n\nThe way we talk about and approach drinking can and should evolve. The FDA recently formally recognized a reduction in drinking as a valid endpoint in alcohol-related clinical trials, meaning the goal of medications under development doesn't need to be total abstinence — it can also be helping people to slow down. It's a \"paradigm shift,\" Witkiewitz says, and may lead to more drugs to help curb drinking and more doctors aware of the health benefits of cutting back.\n\nThe real test is whether we finally treat alcohol addiction like a disease rather than a character flaw. We've done it with other conditions before. While there's still a stigma around obesity, that is changing, thanks in part to GLP-1s, as more people accept the idea that weight loss is about more than willpower.\n\n\"There's this idea that medications are a crutch or making it an easy way out,\" Wakeman says.\n\nPerhaps a better parallel is depression. For years, it, too, was swept under the rug. People were told to shake it off. Today, it's widely understood as a treatable condition. There are a variety of medications available, and many patients try different formulations and dosages until they find the right fit. For some people, medication isn't the answer, and they use other strategies to combat and mitigate it. People aren't expected to be free of depressive episodes forever, even with treatment, and in many circles, it's quite commonplace to discuss, whether at the doctor's office or over lunch.\n\n\"Prior to Prozac becoming now a completely banal thing that you can talk about at a dinner party, depression was, 'You need a kick in the butt, pick yourself up, what's the matter with you?'\" Humphreys says.\n\nAlcohol use disorder could now be reaching a similar inflection point. The science behind treatments has existed for years, but the culture has lagged behind. GLP-1 drugs may help to accelerate a shift in how we think about medication to curb drinking. And if we're talking so much about the dangers of drinking, shouldn't we be giving people as much help as possible to slow down and stop?\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "The old saying \"Everything is bigger in Texas\" now applies to data centers.\n\nThe Lone Star State is on track to unseat Virginia as the world's largest data center market by 2030, new research from Jones Lang LaSalle shows.\n\nThe shift indicates how drastically the data center development boom has reshaped the US's digital infrastructure map and the landscape as a whole. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta plan to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure expansion in 2026 — a number so dizzyingly high that Wall Street is on high alert for signs of an AI bubble.\n\nMore than half of all data center construction in the US now happens outside the industry's traditional hubs, according to JLL's North America Data Center Report — Year-End 2025. Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.\n\nTexas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.\n\nThat amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.\n\nThat 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.\n\nPart of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.\n\nThe state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.\n\nTexas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.\n\nNorthern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Salesforce says it's at the vanguard of the AI revolution and has even toyed with renaming itself Agentforce in honor of its bet on AI agents. The company is rapidly adopting AI internally as well, and a survey obtained by Business Insider reveals how that's actually playing out behind the scenes.\n\nThe results — which were broadly positive — show that most employees feel AI is increasing their productivity, although fewer say it's lightening their workloads.\n\nSalesforce's annual \"Great Insights\" survey, which is not public, was conducted in November 2025 and released inside the software company the following month. It surveyed about 80% of the 76,000-person workforce.\n\nMost questions about AI received high favorability ratings: In addition to the 81% of employees who said AI tools boost productivity, 83% said they feel equipped to handle AI risks such as bias, and 81% said they felt encouraged to experiment with AI.\n\nMore than half of employees — 57% — said AI tools helped their team identify opportunities that would have been impossible otherwise. And 62% said their workload is more manageable because they use AI tools. Both of these were among the lowest results in the survey.\n\nSalesforce told Business Insider in a statement that the survey showed significant gains in AI use and strong enthusiasm. A composite it creates called the AI Readiness score was at 85% enterprise-wide, an 18% gain year-over-year.\n\n\"We're thrilled that our employees have moved on from adoption and are seeing AI tools make a meaningful impact in their daily work,\" a Salesforce spokesperson said.\n\nThe results suggest that Salesforce is ahead of the pack on encouraging AI adoption, said Jason Schloetzer, an associate professor at Georgetown University's business school who has interviewed dozens of executives about AI adoption. The results also show that, for some employees, AI intensifies their workload rather than reducing it.\n\n\"The gaps suggest people believe AI is enabling them to do more work, but it's not making their work easier,\" he said.\n\nSalesforce, which sells customer relationship management software, has garnered attention for an intense AI push led by CEO Marc Benioff. Last August, he said half of the work at Salesforce was being done by AI and that the company had eliminated 4,000 support roles because of AI agents.\n\nSalesforce's website says the company uses a mix of internal AI tools, including an AI from Salesforce-owned Slack that can quickly find old project templates, and Career Connect, which analyzes employees' strengths and weaknesses to help them move within the company.\n\nSalesforce is facing challenges despite its embrace of the AI revolution. Its stock is down over 40% in the past year as concerns mount about the fate of legacy software companies amid the arrival of AI tools from OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nThe company has also struggled to deliver on promises made in demos of its AI product Agentforce, Business Insider previously reported.",

    "description": "Kathryn Shiber is suing Centerview over claims of disability discrimination. Court docs suggest Wall Street culture itself will also be on the stand.",
    "fullText": "A lawsuit offering a rare look at the daily grind of junior investment bankers is scheduled to begin next week, and court documents suggest that potential jurors will be asked to reckon with their relationship to Wall Street culture.\n\nThe case hinges on Kathryn Shiber, who alleges that boutique investment bank Centerview Partners violated disability discrimination laws when it fired her because she couldn't consistently work into the early morning hours. Shiber joined the firm as a junior banker in July 2020, after graduating from Dartmouth College. After a few consecutive days working past midnight, she said told human resources that she had to get between eight and nine hours of sleep each night because of an underlying mood and anxiety disorder, and got approval for some accommodations. In September, the New York-based firm fired her because she could not perform the essential job functions, according to her suit.\n\nThe proposed voir dire questions — the screening questions lawyers use to assess whether potential jurors can be impartial— hint that Wall Street's notoriously grueling culture will be on display once the trial kicks off.\n\n\"Do you feel it is fair for an employer to expect that employees work long or unpredictable hours if employees are compensated for those hours?\" Centerview proposes asking in its voir dire document.\n\nCenterview has also proposed asking potential jurors whether they have \"any opinions or beliefs about Wall Street, the finance industry, or investment banking\" that would impact their impartiality. Shiber's lawyers take it a step further, proposing that they ask specifically whether jurors have \"strong opinions\" about investment banking or \"people who work\" in the industry.\n\nDepositions filed in the case indicate that junior bankers, formally known as first-year analysts, should expect to work between 60 and 120 hours per week. Hours are unpredictable and can stretch into the early morning, Tony Kim, then a partner and now the co-president of investment banking at Centerview, said in his deposition. 24-hour days are possible, but rare, he said, adding that juniors staffed on an active deal are expected to check in before going to sleep.\n\n\"Junior bankers obviously don't need permission to go to sleep, but are expected to work together and communicate properly with teammates,\" Centerview told Business Insider in a statement. Shiber's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth sides have also proposed quizzing jurors on mental health and discrimination. Centerview's attorneys, for example, have proposed asking potential jurors whether they have ever requested accommodations at a job for a disability or filed a grievance for employment-related reasons.\n\n\"Do you think today's employment laws make it too easy for an employee to sue an employer for discrimination?\" Shiber's lawyers proposed asking.\n\nJunior bankers' mental health came under intense scrutiny in 2024, after Leo Lukenas III, an investment banking associate at Bank of America, died. Some firms implemented policies they said would help track and limit hours. But 2026 is expected to see an M&A boom, potentially pushing junior bankers to log even more hours as deal activity picks up.\n\nJurors could also be asked about Centerview bankers who might come up at trial. The voir dire questionnaire from Shiber's lawyers shows they have considered asking about Robert Pruzan, the firm's cofounder and a well-known M&A banker.\n\nWall Street, known for its high pay, has at times become a cultural flashpoint — most notably during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests over the financial crisis. More recently, President Donald Trump has introduced a policy that he has said will lower costs for everyday Americans by capping the interest banks can charge on credit cards to 10% for a year.\n\nAll the while, finance titans are earning record pay, and Americans' relationship to capitalism itself is changing — meaning that answering voir dire questions about the people who dot the halls of prestigious firms may not be a simple task.",

    "description": "OpenAI just poached the celebrity whisperer Charles Porch away from Instagram. It makes sense when you consider how anti-AI some celebs have been.",
    "fullText": "A \"detriment\" to human creativity, said Vince Gilligan, creator of \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Pluribus\" about AI. \"Horrifying,\" said James Cameron about the possibility of AI actors. \"I'd rather die,\" said Guillermo del Toro. \"Incredibly destructive,\" said Cate Blanchett.\n\nIt's not hard to see why OpenAI recognizes it has a bit of an image problem among some people in Hollywood. It appears that the company is now trying to change that.\n\nOpenAI just poached Charles Porch from Meta, where he oversaw celebrity partnerships for over a decade, as Vanity Fair reported earlier. Porch is generally recognized for helping make Instagram the cultural juggernaut it is today by helping celebrities who might have been confused by or disinterested in newfangled social media join and use the platform.\n\nPorch has deep connections in the entertainment industry — celebrities like Harry Styles attended his lavish wedding this summer in France.\n\nPorch wrote on his personal Instagram about his job change:\n\n\"From helping Beyoncé figure out how to launch an album exclusively on social media to onboarding Pope Francis to Instagram (he held my hands and asked me to pray for him) to watching creators become the next generation of entrepreneurs, the impact on culture that me and the team have been able to have is something that I take great pride in.\"\n\nIt's not clear exactly what Porch's new gig will entail. He told Vanity Fair that his first step will be to go on a \"listening tour\" to hear the hopes and fears about AI from creatives and celebrities. I've asked OpenAI for comment.\n\nFor Hollywood actors, filmmakers, and studio executives, those fears are pretty big. Why wouldn't Brad Pitt be alarmed to see a passably real AI-generated version of himself in a fist-fight against Tom Cruise?\n\nThe idea that AI could replace actors, screenwriters, and other creatives is alarming, especially as Hollywood as an industry is hurting. Box office sales haven't bounced back from the pandemic, streaming is complicated, fewer and fewer projects are being made, and efforts to cut costs by filming overseas have devastated Los Angeles' middle-class of film industry workers.\n\nOn top of that, AI is, as far as I can tell, widely considered a theft machine that gobbled up tons of images and videos from movies and TV for training data, largely without permission or compensation.\n\nYou can see a filmmaker or actor's point of view here: They stole my face and my work to build this tool, and now they want to use it to make soulless slop that will undercut the value of my work?\n\nNot great! I imagine Porch has his work cut out for him.\n\nOpenAI and other AI companies have started making deals with Hollywood. Disney made a $1 billion deal with OpenAI around the time Sora 2 launched, licensing Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader, and also becoming a customer and investor in OpenAI. Lionsgate and AMC made deals allowing their catalogs to be used for training Runway. (Business Insider, through our parent company, has a somewhat similar deal with OpenAI.)\n\nBut those deals with studios, while they might stave off copyright lawsuits and create some cash flow, aren't winning over the hearts and minds of the celebrities and creatives — the kinds of people who make headlines when they call AI \"horrifying.\"\n\nPerhaps OpenAI is realizing that celebrities still hold the kind of cultural capital that can't be built in the Bay Area. And while OpenAI has been pretty successful in pushing its agenda in Washington, thanks to an AI-friendly administration, it still has an uphill battle to win over the general public, which remains fairly skeptical of AI.\n\nAnd for that, you need to get the celebs on board. There's a beautiful irony now that these big AI companies are paying big bucks to hire human writers, and VCs are now obsessed with the concept of \"taste.\"\n\nIt turns out that kinds of \"soft skills\" that had long been undervalued in Silicon Valley are more relevant than ever now that AI can do a lot of the technical work. And someone like Charles Porch, who has the connections and ability to charm a roomful of Hollywood types and other cultural elites, is more valuable than ever. That's the kind of job AI can't take.",

    "description": "Meta's shift to AI builders is redefining roles, as product managers adopt AI coding tools for increased productivity and innovation.",
    "fullText": "Meta product managers are rebranding. Some are now calling themselves \"AI builders,\" a signal that AI coding tools are changing who gets to build software inside the company.\n\nOne of them, Jeremie Guedj, announced the change in a LinkedIn post last week. \"I still can't believe I'm writing this: as of today, my full-time job at Meta is AI Builder,\" he wrote.\n\nGuedj has spent more than a decade as a traditional product manager, a role that sets the road map and strategy for products then built by engineering teams. He said that while his title in Meta's internal systems still lists him as a product manager, his actual work is now full-time building with AI on what he calls an \"AI-native team.\"\n\nAnother Meta product manager also lists \"AI Builder\" on her LinkedIn profile, while at least two other Meta engineers write the term in their bios, Business Insider found.\n\nThe shift aligns with a message CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed on Meta's most recent earnings call: 2026 is when AI tools would meaningfully reshape how work gets done inside the company. AI coding tools have already shaken up the tech industry, allowing more people with fewer technical skills to build apps from scratch.\n\n\"We're investing in AI-native tooling, so individuals at Meta can get more done,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams. We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single very talented person.\"\n\nGuedj's role reads like a practical expression of that vision. In his post, he described his team as one \"where data and knowledge are AI-friendly at their core, and where humans and AI agents work together, synchronously and asynchronously.\"\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"AI builder\" isn't a formal Meta designation, at least not yet. Guedj acknowledged it isn't his official title.\n\nOne Meta employee who wished to stay anonymous because they weren't authorized to speak to the press said that the label is not an official role and is more likely an experiment within a specific organization as Meta pushes toward AI-native teams across the company. Reality Labs, Meta's division responsible for its smart glasses and virtual reality efforts, is one of those organizations, this person said.\n\n\"Software engineers are becoming product managers and product managers becoming software engineers,\" they added. \"The idea is to make individual contributors more productive.\"\n\nInside Meta, the drift from coordinator to builder has been visible for months. In November, Joseph Spisak, a product director in Meta's Superintelligence Labs, said that product managers at the company were vibe-coding prototypes and showing them directly to Zuckerberg.\n\n\"We can literally vibe code products in a matter of hours, days, and explore the space,\" Spisak said.\n\nIn January, another Meta product manager, Zevi Arnovitz, said on a podcast that using AI coding tools felt like being handed \"superpowers.\" Arnovitz, who said he has no technical background, described rebuilding his workflow around AI — operating less like a conductor moving work between engineering and design and more like a product owner who can execute.\n\nSome companies are moving beyond experimentation. In December, LinkedIn scrapped its long-running associate product manager program and replaced it with an associate product builder track.\n\nTomer Cohen, LinkedIn's chief product officer at the time, said on a podcast that the company wanted to train new hires who can code, design, and manage products — people \"who can flex across\" traditional role boundaries.\n\nLast year, Madhu Gurumurthy, the company's product head for AI models, tweeted that the company was moving to a \"building-first\" culture. In an age of vibe-coding, Gurumurthy said, product managers can show, not tell. \"Role profiles are blurring, creativity and building are happening in parallel,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Each company is approaching this differently and is still figuring this out,\" one product manager at Google, who wished to stay anonymous, told Business Insider. \"I've been encouraging designers and product managers on my team to blur roles a bit.\"\n\nAs Guedj, the self-proclaimed Meta AI builder, put it: \"Building has always been my passion. AI gave me the ability to turn ideas into real, working apps. That changed everything.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "title": "There's been a surge in AI use recently. Here's what's behind it.",
    "description": "AI token processing has soared recently on OpenRouter, while Nvidia GPU rental prices have jumped.",
    "fullText": "AI demand has surged in recent weeks, according to new data that could support tech giants' decisions to dramatically ramp up investment in this area.\n\nOpenRouter, which helps developers access different AI models, has seen activity roughly double in the first weeks of 2026.\n\nThis is measured by the number of AI tokens OpenRouter processes. AI models break down words and other inputs into numerical tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about ¾ of a word.\n\nOpenRouter handled 13 trillion AI tokens in the week that ended February 9. That's up from 6.4 trillion during the first week of January.\n\nSeen over a year, this recent surge is even more striking. AI models that OpenRouter taps into include Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, OpenAI's GPT range, and a host of open-source offerings from DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and others.\n\nThis data excludes AI tokens processed directly by the major AI companies, so it represents a small fraction of total activity. For instance, Google was processing 1.3 quadrillion tokens a month this past summer. However, the recent rate of change in OpenRouter's data is a valuable signal.\n\nAnand Iyer, a partner at VC firm Lightspeed, said the recent surge has been driven by an explosion in AI agent activity and especially the rapid emergence of OpenClaw, an open-source agentic system.\n\nThat's sparked an exponential increase in inference, which is how models, agents, and other AI services are run in the cloud.\n\n\"The demand for AI inference right now is coming from agentic platforms, especially OpenClaw,\" Iyer told Business Insider this week. \"We moved from simple chatbot experiences to agentic automation and execution, which has driven exponential growth of OpenClaw installations and OpenRouter usage.\"\n\nThere are other signs of rising AI use. Data compiled by Bloomberg suggests demand for Nvidia AI chips has increased lately. The chart below shows the cost to rent Nvidia H100 GPUs. As you can see, prices have rebounded strongly since early December, which implies robust AI demand.\n\nOpenClaw launched in November 2025. That coincides with the H100 rebound here.\n\nA third data point comes from Barclays analysts, who recently looked at online traffic to vibe coding services, including Lovable, Replit, and Wix's Base44.\n\nThe consumer website-based vibe coding services Barclays tracks saw traffic jump 17% month over month in January.\n\n\"This was the strongest growth since April 2025,\" the analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. \"The uptick in interest here was driven largely by frontier model improvements in late 2025 that made these platforms more effective.\"\n\nThe debate still rages over whether AI will be used enough to justify all the heavy investments being made. Big Tech companies recently increased capital expenditure plans to eye-watering levels, raising new concerns about a potential AI bubble.\n\nThis new AI usage data may suggest that demand could be strong enough to support such heavy spending.\n\n\"AI capex today, as we know it today, is largely driven by training requirements from large frontier labs,\" Iyer said.\n\nTraining is a data- and energy-intensive process in which AI models are created in massive data centers. Inference comes after models are run.\n\n\"The sustainability is warranted as long as the revenue produced by inference (which is growing exponentially) will justify the output from the training,\" Iyer said. \"Which seems to be working so far.\"\n\nOpenClaw is part of a broader evolution of generative AI. The era kicked off with a bang when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, and the chatbot became the fastest-growing tech product in history.\n\nMore recently, AI models have begun to support autonomous digital agents and similar tools that can use computers independently to accomplish complex tasks.\n\nOpenClaw's open-source technology supports agents that help users automate coding and other workflows by accessing computer files, email, calendars, and messaging services.\n\nIn January, Anthropic unveiled Claude Cowork, an AI agent that handles tasks such as document generation and file management.\n\nThe startup rolled out Claude Sonnet 4.6, its latest AI model, this week. It's gotten better at what Anthropic calls \"computer use,\" where AI models and agents use computers in similar ways to humans to get tasks done.\n\n\"The model sees the computer and interacts with it in much the same way a person would: clicking a (virtual) mouse and typing on a (virtual) keyboard,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog on Tuesday.\n\nThis type of machine-to-machine activity is behind a lot of the surge in AI token use lately. It makes sense: most people can use a computer for seven or eight hours a day. Then, they need a break or a nap. AI models never sleep and can hack away at a task uninterrupted until it's done.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "OpenAI and Meta alum Philip Su said that AI was turning software engineers into managers. The IC role is \"dead,\" he wrote.",
    "fullText": "Use AI at work? You might be a manager and not even know it.\n\nPhilip Su is on the frontline of AI. He worked at OpenAI until 2025, when he left to found his startup, Superphonic. Before that, he worked at Microsoft and Meta.\n\nIn January, Su made a provocative claim on Substack: \"AI Killed the Individual Contributor.\"\n\nSu wrote that software engineers are asked to perform tasks once reserved for managers: set priorities, resolve conflicts, and give feedback. Rather than building, they're spending time \"pondering and tweaking the machine that builds the thing.\"\n\n\"The halcyon days of the IC are over,\" Su wrote. \"Not because AI codes better than you, but because maximizing your productivity necessitates focusing your time on all the things that are, at the end of the day, manager tasks.\"\n\nSu doubled down this week on the podcast \"A Life Engineered.\" He said the IC role was \"probably over\" because engineers were delegating their work to AI.\n\nIf everyone's a manager (of AI), do we need managers (of humans) anymore? Su said yes. There's a \"human coordination problem\" that AI cannot solve, he said.\n\nSu's theory of managerial takeover comes amid the \"great flattening\" in Big Tech. Flat org charts are all the rage: few managers, many ICs. Elon Musk's companies are known for their lack of managers; Amazon and Meta have recently culled management layers as they aim to increase their IC-to-manager ratios.\n\nMeanwhile, tech CEOs are also embracing \"founder mode.\" The reviled opposite of that, according to Paul Graham's 2024 essay, is \"manager mode.\"\n\nBut maybe managers are back en vogue — so long as they're managing AI agents. Vercel COO Jeanne DeWitt Grosser told Business Insider that companies will see a new role: the \"agent manager.\"\n\nThe tools will get better, too. Su already finds that he has to review AI-written code \"less carefully\" than he used to.\n\n\"It might currently feel like managing a team of barely-competent interns,\" he wrote in his essay. \"It'll soon feel like managing a team of very high performers, each better, faster, and smarter than you.\"",

    "title": "Trump's plan to 'deprioritize' student-loan oversight has lawmakers worried about how your servicer is performing",
    "description": "After the major student-loan companies declined to release their own performance data, Sen. Elizabeth Warren requested information from the Ed. Dept.",
    "fullText": "Curious how your student-loan servicer is performing? You might be out of luck — for now.\n\nWhen asked by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren for data on their performances, the major student-loan servicers delivered nearly identical responses — exclusively reviewed by Business Insider — that referred the lawmaker back to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office.\n\nOne servicer, MOHELA, wrote in a January 5 email to Warren that it has \"a formal statement that FSA has requested we send.\"\n\nThe statement, which the other servicers also sent, stated: \"Because your letter requests information and data maintained by the Department's office of Federal Student Aid, we respectfully ask that the request be redirected to the Department via the Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs.\"\n\nMonitoring student-loan servicers' performance will become more critical this year as the Department of Education begins implementing its repayment changes that President Donald Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. It will also prove more difficult after the Trump administration slashed staff at the consumer watchdog that played a large role in doing so.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers have expressed confusion about the changes, and lawmakers and policy experts have previously stressed the importance of ensuring that servicers are equipped to effectively implement new repayment plans, borrowing caps, and other reforms.\n\nIn response to a prior information request from Warren, Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent wrote in a letter in September 2025 that \"FSA is prioritizing efforts to improve customer service to student and parent borrowers,\" and did not comment on formally releasing performance metrics.\n\nThe last comprehensive report on servicer performance and borrower data posted on FSA's website covered the quarter ending September 30, 2024. Past reports have included customer satisfaction scores, average speed to answer calls, and data on the servicers' portfolios. Warren and Sen. Jeff Merkley wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that, following the servicers' responses, they are requesting that the Department of Education publish servicer performance data and make it available to the public.\n\n\"ED has repeatedly refused to comply with Congressional requests for basic servicer performance data and now appears to be refusing to allow federal student loan servicers to provide this information, despite previous Administrations granting such requests,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nWarren and Merkley requested that the Department of Education provide data on a range of topics, including call center performance, customer service staff levels, and communication efforts to borrowers in delinquency and default.\n\nOversight over the industry has declined due to the Trump administration's gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog that Warren helped create. The CFPB's chief legal officer directed the agency's employees in an April 2025 memo to \"deprioritize\" student-loan oversight, saying that the goal was to shift oversight responsibility to the states.\n\nAdditionally, Warren and a group of her Democratic colleagues released a new report in early February detailing how private lenders are preparing for an influx of federal borrowers due to the new borrowing caps set to go into effect this summer. They wrote that their findings \"underscore an urgent need for oversight of the private lending market as these companies prepare to cash in on the Administration's agenda.\"",

    "description": "David Chong quit his Microsoft job to build a startup. Weeks later, most of his belongings were stolen, but he doesn't regret going all in.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chong, a 38-year-old startup founder in Toronto. He previously worked as a senior software engineer at Microsoft until resigning last September. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI resigned from Microsoft in September 2025. Less than a month later, I lost almost everything I owned.\n\nDuring my move from New York City to my hometown of Toronto, the trailer transporting my belongings was stolen in the middle of the night. The trailer was eventually recovered, but none of my belongings were.\n\nWhile resigning from Microsoft set me down this unfortunate path, I believe leaving Big Tech was the right move for me. I've had to learn what the Zen monks preach about letting go of your earthly possessions to reach enlightenment.\n\nIn 2016, I moved from Canada to New York City on a work visa. Before joining Microsoft, I worked at a smaller tech company for nearly seven years, starting as a junior employee and working my way up to a leadership role as a lead product engineer.\n\nWhen I joined Microsoft as a senior software engineer in 2022, it felt like a bit of a backtrack in terms of title. I thought it would be easy to get promoted back to a higher level, but it definitely wasn't; I held the same position for nearly three years.\n\nAt my previous employer, it felt like your work spoke for itself, but at Microsoft, it felt like I would have to develop a \"getting promoted\" skill — doing a lot of internal self-promotion to make sure my work got noticed outside my immediate team — to actually move up.\n\nFrom what I heard, the need to actively self-promote in order to move up is a broader trend across Big Tech. It seemed pretty non-transferable outside the Big Tech world, so I wasn't very interested in developing it.\n\nIn my last few years at Microsoft, the company went through multiple restructurings that moved me to different teams. In the most recent round, some of our managers were laid off.\n\nThe layoffs didn't make me too concerned about my job security, in part because my department seemed starved for engineering talent. However, I was growing frustrated with the slow promotion timeline.\n\nThere also seemed to be rising expectations at the company around productivity and working from the office. The message from leadership seemed to be that we needed to ramp up and adjust because times were changing.\n\nThe other thing that made me start considering leaving was that I wasn't learning as much as I wanted to, partially because I had become the most senior person on my team.\n\nIn early 2025, I started thinking seriously about leaving Microsoft and figuring out my next career move. It was a very difficult decision. I was working on a TN visa, which was tied specifically to Microsoft, and resigning would likely mean moving back to Toronto and committing to a future outside the US, unless I could find another company willing to sponsor me. I'd come to the US thinking about living here long-term. Microsoft had already started the green card process for me, and quitting would mean giving that up as well.\n\nAround last April, a friend opened my eyes to the possibility of entrepreneurship. I became more interested in that path and started doing a lot of research on how to build a business. I decided that if I left Microsoft, I would pursue entrepreneurship.\n\nIn September, I resigned from Microsoft. I wasn't too worried about giving up my $192,000 a year salary because I consider myself very risk-tolerant. I've saved up enough of a buffer to go without income for several years, and I don't have any dependents.\n\nLosing my belongings during the move definitely hurt my productivity, forcing me to delay my startup plans by a few months.\n\nOf everything I owned, all I had left was what I packed for the flight in my backpack and carry-on bag. I landed in Toronto without winter clothes or a bed — I had to sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag.\n\nI focused on resolving the move issues: trying to figure out what happened, contacting the police, and dealing with the insurance claim. I'd unfortunately gotten the lowest insurance rate for my move, so the insurance payout was less than even what I paid for the moving service.\n\nAnd of course, there was the financial impact of replacing everything. So far, I've spent around $12,000 on essentials like a couch, bed, air fryer, Instant Pot, and clothing. Since everything was stolen, I'm starting from scratch in more ways than one.\n\nHowever, I've made progress with my AI sales agent business, Falco, in recent months. It's still in development and isn't ready for customers yet, but it has launched publicly.\n\nWhen it comes to building a startup, I don't think the idea necessarily matters as much as the execution. I'm hopeful that if I just go all in, move fast, and constantly test my ideas, I should be OK. My plan is to give myself about three years to pursue entrepreneurship. If all else fails, I'll go back into the job market.\n\nMy advice is to try to put yourself in your own shoes five to 10 years from now. When I do that, I look back at the decision I'm facing and ask myself, \"Would I regret not doing this?\"\n\nIf the answer is yes, I try to do the thing I'd regret not doing. I've often heard that older people regret the chances they didn't take more than the ones they did.\n\nIn hindsight, I think this mindset is what helped me decide to move to New York and join Microsoft — two decisions that had their pros and cons, but that I don't regret. My first job in New York helped me build the experience that landed me at Microsoft, and Microsoft gave me the opportunity to grow my skills and meet some very interesting people.\n\nFor me, leaving Microsoft to start a business is a decision I don't think my future self will regret, even if I fail, so I'm going all in on entrepreneurship.",

In the year leading up to last Friday, he said that the gains in dollar-based assets have been the weakest when compared to 19 other markets around the world.\n\n\"The US is 20th out of 20,\" Citrone said, adding that gains in the US market fell around 30% short of the gains in emerging markets in the last year. \"That's a significant difference.\"\n\nInvestors around the world are swapping their holdings of US-based stocks for emerging markets at the fastest pace since 2021, according to Bank of America's survey of global fund managers in February.\n\nOn average, global investors reduced their position in US stocks by around 20 percentage points compared to their position the prior month. US stocks were the category that investors shifted away from the most, while the eurozone and emerging markets were among the top five areas where investors increased their positioning.\n\nTalk about \"Sell America,\" or investors shifting away from US assets, has picked up in recent months as markets eye potential headwinds, like hotter inflation and higher deficits in the US.\n\nFamed fixed-income investor Jeff Gundlach said last month that he was steering clear of the US entirely, and that he believed \"all\" investors should have exposure to non-US stocks in non-dollar currency.\n\nRon Temple, the chief market strategist for Lazard's advisory and asset management business, said in December that 2025 marked the last year of American exceptionalism, as he expected investors to continue shifting away from the US due to concerns about higher inflation and debt levels.\n\nCitrone added that he thinks the US market will continue to underperform the rest of the world, and that he was short US assets while betting on other markets, like Mexico.\n\n\"Most people are going to move some money from the US,\" he told CNBC earlier this week.",

Don't let emotion — whether it be fear or greed — guide your decisions. Invest early and often to take advantage of compounding.\n\nBut a new book of interviews with top investors from around the world features plenty of nuggets of advice that extend beyond the run-of-the-mill guidance.\n\nIn \"Stock Market Maestros,\" Lee Freeman-Shor, a former fund manager himself, and Clare Flynn Levy dig into the philosophy of 11 top money managers and break down their top takeaways in digestible bites.\n\nBelow, we've compiled six of the best nuggets of wisdom.\n\nYou might check your portfolio every day, but do you write about it? Doing so can be helpful, especially for remembering why you've invested in something in the first place.\n\nManeesh Bajaj, a portfolio manager at Brown Advisory, said he can sometimes correct flaws in his investment process by looking back at his.\n\n\"I write down the rationale for every trade I place,\" Bajaj said. \"Where there are lessons to be learned from looking at my decisions in aggregate, I will incorporate those into the process.\n\nBajaj added that keeping track can help him realize when to be more decisive with a trade, informing him when it's better to exit a losing investment.\n\nFor the average investor who can't watch markets all day long, stop-losses — which help you automatically get out of a position if it falls by a set percentage — are crucial tools for protecting capital.\n\nBut John Lin, the CIO of emerging markets value and China equities at Alliance Bernstein, said stop-losses are arbitrary and therefore potentially counterproductive if an investment thesis is still good.\n\n\"I don't use stop losses because they are too formulaic. What makes 20% or 40% the right number to cut your losses?\" Lin said. \"I know when I should throw in the towel, but it is based on other factors. And when I decide to get out, I cut the whole thing. In my experience, selling in stages usually means you bleed performance along the way.\"\n\nJohn Barr, the portfolio manager of the Needham Aggressive Growth Fund, agreed, saying his best-ever investments would have been cut short by stop losses.\n\n\"Stop losses would be a disaster for me because they would have stopped out every one of my top 20 biggest winners. The average drawdown of my 20 biggest winners during the time I have held them has been 60—70%,\" Barr said. \"And they can be down and out for a year or longer. I wouldn't know where to place the stop loss level. And if I used them, and they got triggered, I probably wouldn't have bought in again after I had sold.\"\n\nSay you invested in Nvidia in 2020. Your portfolio would be sitting pretty right now, and would probably have a heavy bias toward the stock given the 1,165% gain over the last five years.\n\nBut with the stock looking less invincible recently, it's a good idea to try and understand when to lock in some of those gains and pare down your position. But how to do that?\n\nOne strategy is to sell at least the amount of your original position to ensure you can't lose, or sell a set percentage, like half, of your position as it reaches different return milestones.\n\nDirk Enderlein, a portfolio manager at Wellington Management, and James Hanbury, the head of strategy at Lancaster Investment Management, say to think of it this way: If you were to open a position in a particular stock today, what's the weighting in your portfolio you would give it?\n\n\"I don't believe in letting a position grow and grow. You run the risk of falling in love with the idea, and when it goes against you, you don't want to bring the weight down. This is what ends investment careers,\" Enderlein said.\n\n\"I would argue that someone who let the position grow to 6% would not start the position at 6% if they were starting afresh,\" he added.\n\nIt can be hard to know when to get out of a losing stock. Gorm Thomassen, the CIO of AKO Capital, likes to use something he's dubbed the \"Boiling Frog\" screen — it alerts him to small but negative changes occurring that he should be aware of before it becomes too late.\n\nFor example, warning signs would appear when a company's financial health appears to weaken, when a similar company warns its profits or earnings are set to take a hit, or when levels of insider selling spike.\n\nThomassen said he looks at the screen once a month.\n\nAndrew Hall, a fund manager at Invesco, said he sends some of his stocks back down to his \"farm team\" when they get too expensive. It's a reference to minor league baseball, where players go to develop or rehab before heading to the Majors, and in Hall's case it means reducing the stocks to small positions.\n\n\"I only do that if I think the chance of monetising it in the future is higher than if I were to exit,\" he said. \"Perhaps it would be better to sell and watch it on the bench. But the reality is nothing focuses the mind like having an ownership stake. And the size is small enough that if I get it wrong it does not really affect performance.\"\n\nHall, the Invesco fund manager, said he uses several methods for taking emotion out of his decision-making process.\n\nOne is that he waits until the evening before making a choice on an investment because it gives his emotions time to dissipate. He also goes on runs to think out a given investment decision he has to make. And when he finally does buy, he puts his position to work over the course of multiple days to ensure he still likes his thesis.\n\n\"For example I will buy 10 basis points a day for five days instead of buying 50 basis points on one day,\" he said. \"This is a way of lowering the emotional impact of the decision. And it gives me the opportunity to stop buying if it becomes clear that it was the wrong thing to do.\"",

    "title": "The biggest names in AI are gathering for a summit in India. Here are 5 of the biggest takeaways.",
    "description": "From Sam Altman to Demis Hassabis, AI leaders gathered in India to speak about the future of the technology.",
    "fullText": "AI's biggest power players showed up in India on Thursday.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Scale AI's Alexandr Wang, and Mistral's Arthur Mensch spoke in succession at the AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi.\n\nFrom a potential \"AI divide\" to calls for stronger global coordination, here are five of the biggest takeaways from the summit so far.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said the world must not let the digital divide \"become an AI divide.\" He said expanding access to compute infrastructure, connectivity, and training is essential as AI reshapes economies.\n\nPichai said AI represents \"the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes\" and could drive \"hyper progress\" across science, healthcare, and economic development. But its benefits are neither \"guaranteed nor automatic.\"\n\n\"We must be equally bold in tackling problems in regions that have lacked access to technology,\" Pichai said. \"We cannot allow the digital divide to become an AI divide. That means investing in compute infrastructure and connectivity.\"\n\nGovernments must act both as regulators and innovators to ensure AI improves public services and broadens opportunity, he added.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that while AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there's a gap between those capabilities and real-world impact.\n\n\"There is this duality between the fundamental capabilities of the technology and the time that it takes for those capabilities to diffuse into the world,\" he said.\n\n\"There are just frictions to adopt things through enterprises, and I think even more so in the developing world,\" he added.\n\nThe Google DeepMind CEO said India will be a \"powerhouse for AI\" across the world. He praised summits that bring together scientists, policymakers, and technologists, the latter of whom he said can't be left alone navigating AI.\n\nHassabis said we're in \"one of the most momentous\" times in human history and compared AI to the advent of fire and electricity.\n\n\"It's gonna be something like 10 times the impact of the Industrial Revolution, but happening at 10 times the speed, probably unfolding in a matter of a decade rather than a century,\" he said.\n\nGiven this level of impact, he said we need to use a scientific approach to understand AI's capabilities and build guardrails so that the technology \"serves the purposes that we want.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said rapid advances in AI could require new global governance mechanisms, something akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\"In particular, we expect the world may need something like the IAEA for international coordination of AI,\" Altman said, adding that such a body would need \"the ability to rapidly respond to change in circumstances.\"\n\nAltman said AI's trajectory could create risks that no single company or country can manage alone.\n\n\"We need a society-wide approach about how we're going to defend against this,\" he said, referring to the possibility of highly capable \"bio models\" becoming available.\n\nLong-term AI development is a responsibility to future generations, Altman also said, adding that it is a \"moral imperative\" to ensure future generations can benefit from and build upon technological progress.\n\nMeta's former chief scientist said we're still missing something \"big\" in AI.\n\n\"Why do we have systems that can pass the bar exam and win mathematics olympiads? But we don't have domestic robots. We don't even have self-driving cars,\" LeCun said. \"We certainly do not have several cars that can teach themselves to drive in 20 hours of practice like in 17-year-old.\"\n\nHe said that babies and animals have a much better understanding of the physical world around them than any AI systems today, which is why we don't have \"smart robots\" yet.\n\nHe said what is needed is world models — \"mental models of the world that allow us to think ahead, apprehend new situations, plan, sequence of actions, reason, and predict the consequences of our actions.\"\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company. His new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said we need to make AI effective for the Global South, and that needs conscious planning.\n\n\"We need to make AI as effective in every language as it is in English, and today, it is not,\" he said. \"Performance tests show that's the case.\"\n\n\"One of the good things to come out of this week is new announcements to better data in other languages, to provide better tools and measurement systems for AI that is built in other languages,\" he added.\n\nThe other thing that needs to be done is to work on problems that matter to the Global South. That means focusing on improvements in agriculture for India, and addressing food security in Africa.",

    "title": "I've been selling on Amazon for a year. After storage fees bled me dry, I'm pivoting my e-comm strategy away from it.",
    "description": "A year since launching an e-comm company, I haven't cracked the Amazon code, and the learning curve has gotten expensive.",
    "fullText": "When Amazon tried to charge my business account $288.56 last month, the payment didn't go through. Instead, I got an \"insufficient funds\" notification on my phone.\n\nTurns out, it's expensive to let inventory — especially \"aged inventory\" — sit in an Amazon warehouse.\n\nThe \"aged inventory surcharge\" quite literally bled my business partner and me dry. By February 2026, our business bank account balance sat just above $6.\n\nIn 2024, inspired by the successful e-commerce entrepreneurs and Amazon sellers I write about, I decided to start my own business. I convinced a friend to join me, and we each put in $5,000 from our own savings to launch a pickleball paddle company. We hired my high school English teacher to design our logo, we worked with a sourcing company to find a manufacturer, and we spent about a year developing our paddle before placing our first inventory order in early 2025. The minimum order quantity was 500 units.\n\nWe shipped 250 paddles to ourselves in Los Angeles and sent the other 250 to Amazon.\n\nThe plan was to run a hybrid Shopify-Amazon model while we figured out who our typical customer was. That was advice from an e-commerce industry veteran. He told us that, on Shopify, we'd earn better margins because there are fewer platform fees, but we'd have to generate our own traffic through social media, ads, and word of mouth. On Amazon, we'd sacrifice margin, but gain visibility. As he put it: \"Amazon is guaranteed traffic. There's a guaranteed flow of people who are going to see your product every single day.\"\n\nAfter a year, we haven't cracked the Amazon code, and the learning curve has gotten expensive.\n\nAmong the various Amazon seller fees is an \"aged inventory surcharge.\" It's charged on units stored in its fulfillment network for 181 days or more, in addition to its standard monthly storage fees. The surcharge increases the longer your inventory sits.\n\nItems aged 181 to 210 days cost $0.50 per cubic foot. At 211 to 240 days, it jumps to $1 per cubic foot. Our inventory, sitting in the 331- to 365-day range, costs $5.90 per cubic foot. We didn't fully understand the cost structure until it started hitting our bank account.\n\nHere's a screenshot from our Amazon seller account showing our service fees between November 2025 and February 2026.\n\nLast month, we owed nearly $300 in service fees — much more than we were bringing in in sales. Rather than continue to see that number climb (items aged 456 days or more would cost us $7.90 per cubic foot or $0.35 per unit, whichever is greater), we decided to pull most of our inventory out of Amazon.\n\nThe removal process took five minutes. We submitted a removal order for about 200 paddles, and were surprised when 40 of our units arrived on my doorstep the next day. According to Amazon's website, removal orders can take 90 days or more to process before leaving a fulfillment center, plus another two weeks for delivery.\n\nWe're still waiting on the rest of the inventory, and we haven't fully escaped fees. There's a removal fee, which is charged per unit and based on the unit's shipping weight, that we expect to show up on our next statement. Plus, the 30 or so paddles that we left in Amazon's warehouse will trigger storage fees.\n\nWe don't want to abandon Amazon entirely; we just don't have the time and resources to dedicate to figuring out that sales channel.\n\nFor now, we're shifting our focus to Shopify, in-person events, and wholesale partnerships. If we hit another sales dry spell, at least we won't be paying hundreds of dollars a month just to store our own product.\n\nWe're not discouraged. It's just one more lesson in our crash course in e-commerce, but it's a big one: Understand the fees. On Amazon, unsold product isn't harmless. It's expensive.",

    "description": "Some tech workers are about to get caught \"sleepwalking\" as the culture shifts under their feet.",
    "fullText": "It's a tough time to be just average.\n\nWorkers who are decent at their jobs — but not superstars — are facing a tougher slog in industries like tech, where employers have the upper hand, and AI threatens to automate their roles.\n\nWhat used to be a spectrum of employee performance is hardening into something more binary. Companies are focusing more on two camps: hotshots and underachievers.\n\nThis corporate sorting risks leaving the solid performers who make up the bulk of healthy companies feeling overlooked — and potentially vulnerable, workplace observers told Business Insider.\n\n\"Good-enough, B player is the most dangerous place to be,\" said Jeff Hyman, who has been a recruiter for about 30 years. In part, that's because poor workers don't last long, and midlevel workers might have a false sense of security.\n\n\"They're sleepwalking,\" Hyman said. \"They're spending time polishing their LinkedIn while AI is just starting to, task by task, nibble at their job description.\"\n\nThe split-screen is particularly apparent in tech: Dell is revamping its sales compensation program to boost rewards for its highest performers and trim what goes to those who don't meet their full quota, Business Insider reported this month. In January, Business Insider reported that Meta plans to reward its strongest performers with larger payouts, while Amazon has said it's looking closely at each worker's impact.\n\nIt's an idea long used in marketing — like segmenting a customer base — to reimagine how they manage their workforce, said Richard Smith, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The thinking goes that leaders should focus on the MVPs who hold \"strategic importance\" for a company in the long term.\n\nLast year, for example, Microsoft gave managers what it described as new and enhanced tools to help them accelerate high performance and \"swiftly address low performance,\" Business Insider reported.\n\nRewarding the stars has \"always been the case, and now it's just more unapologetically so,\" said Alan Stein, a career coach who worked at Facebook, Google, and Salesforce. In part, that's because of a crush of available workers.\n\nWith US companies hiring at one of the lowest rates in over a decade, employers have more leverage and potentially less incentive to invest heavily in developing middle-tier employees, said Smith, who runs the Human Capital Development Lab at Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe tech industry's latest approach, Stein said, marks a departure from what he saw as an \"everybody has potential\" ethos that emerged during the pandemic-era hiring boom.\n\n\"It was a lot of talk,\" said Stein, CEO of Kadima Careers, which offers job seekers coaching on how to get six-figure roles.\n\nIt was little surprise, he said, that Big Tech would ultimately direct a bigger share of payouts to those who get it done — just as pro sports teams reward their standouts.\n\nAt many large organizations, Stein said, about 10% to 20% of employees fall into the \"walks on water camp,\" with a similar share marked as underperformers. The majority sit in the middle — the solid, reliable \"worker bees,\" he said.\n\n\"They can't all be Zuckerberg,\" Stein said, referring to Meta's CEO. \"They need people that get the work done.\"\n\nOne risk for employers that focus heavily on their upper crust is that it can damage morale on the B team and signal to people at other firms — including the rock stars — that a company isn't a great place to work.\n\nBeyond recruiting headaches, a workplace where fear dominates tends to undercut what CEOs often say they want: innovation, creativity, and collaboration.\n\nSmith frames it as a math problem: Is it more valuable to improve the top 5% of your workforce by 20%, or 80% of your workforce by 5%?\n\nFinding ways to create that broad-based improvement creates \"a lot more impact,\" Smith said.\n\nThat risk of middle-child syndrome extends beyond tech to professional services such as law, auditing, engineering, and consulting — all of which are experiencing major shifts, thanks in part to AI, he said.\n\nNot all companies are stepping up efforts to trim their lowest-rated people. After online speculation that it would make a round of performance-based layoffs, Meta told Business Insider this month that it's not planning to cut the bottom 5% of workers this year, as it did in 2025.\n\nThe news isn't necessarily all bad for mid-tier workers either, Stein said. Even in tech, good-enough performers often still receive raises and enviable perks.\n\n\"You still have the free lunch. You still have the equity, and you're still a free agent. You can go somewhere else,\" he said.\n\nHyman, who's CEO of Recruit Rockstars, a recruiting and career management firm, said he advises B players to \"make yourself irreplaceable\" by honing skills AI can't yet do well. That includes showing superior judgment, building relationships with customers, and navigating ambiguity.\n\nIt might also mean learning AI to the point where you can go to your manager and announce that you've created an agent to automate work.\n\n\"That at least buys you time,\" Hyman said.\n\nYet, as soon as AI reaches a tipping point where it can handle a sufficient number of tasks that an average or above-average worker can do, Hyman said, \"that B player is in trouble.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

Its creator, Peter Steinberger, recently joined OpenAI after being courted by AI CEOs, including Sam Altman and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. OpenClaw can organize users' schedules, monitor vibe-coding sessions, and run other AI agents. It can also be locally run on your computer, which can eat up a lot of memory. That's driven a bit of a frenzy for devices with higher memory, like some Mac Minis.\n\nPeople are buying up the 5\"-by-5\" computer at a pace Apple can't seem to keep up with, as the tech giant shows weekslong wait times for the higher-memory Mac Minis. New York-based shoppers, for example, can get the 16-gigabyte Mac Mini by this weekend, while the 24-gigabyte and 32-gigabyte options have shipping and pick-up windows that extend until March 18, as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCustom and higher-memory configurations often take longer to ship, but the online buzz around the Mac Mini and OpenClaw is easy to link.\n\nResellers on eBay are also trying to cash in on the hype. There are dozens of new Mac Mini listings asking for the retail price or more for brand-new and pre-owned computers.\n\nBefore you snap up your M4 chip Mac Mini, you might consider waiting for a new wave of devices to drop.

These threads have amassed thousands of comments in the past few weeks.\n\nAmong the items people are discussing are portable GPS devices, digital cameras, iPods, and paying for novelty ringtones.\n\n\"I paid $700 for one of those in... 2003?\" one Reddit user says of a portable GPS device. \"Best purchase ever because I'm directionally challenged and relied on MapQuest (!) printouts on the passenger seat.\"\n\n\"Ringtones. Oh you want one of your ringtones to be a 5 seconds snippets from Lose yourself. That'll be 8.50$. People would flex about their ringtones,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nIn another post, a Redditor reminisced about USB storage drives.\n\n\"I remember in 5th grade, a flash drive was on our required supplies list, and I got one that was 512mb. A teacher told me that was more than I would need for the rest of my life,\" they wrote.\n\nThe PalmPilot, BlackBerry, plasma TVs, and SD cards have also gotten repeat mentions.\n\nSome of these pieces of tech — namely the digital camera — have been reborn in recent years as status symbols for a generation craving a time that felt more authentic.\n\nAs part of the push to get offline, many Gen Z and millennials are rejecting new technology by Bricking their phones — blocking certain apps and websites — and leaning into in-person hobbies.\n\nKathryn Jezer-Morton recently wrote for The Cut that 2026 is all about \"friction-maxxing\" — a rejection of the numbing convenience that AI and technology bring us, which Jezer-Morton says is distancing us from life itself.\n\nIt's as if consumers are harking back to a time when it felt as though technology was made to work for us, rather than make our lives more complicated.\n\n\"After a period of intense euphoria and excitement with regards to AI, we are coming down on the other side of the hill,\" Thomas Roulet, a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The tool is democratised and has become normalised, and people realise it hasn't made their work easier or less intense — quite the opposite,\" he added.\n\n\"So it's normal to find GenZ employees — who will have to go through their entire career using those tools — to be disillusioned,\" he said.\n\nWhen the future of AI is being predicted by some tech execs and experts as a white-collar bloodbath with millions of workers laid off, or that those living without AI glasses could be at a \"cognitive disadvantage,\" it's no wonder.\n\nIn an uncertain time, one thing that's sure in 2026: de-digitalizing your life is officially a status symbol.",

    "fullText": "AI is shaking up the job market — but in some cases, companies are blaming the technology for layoffs they were already planning, says OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n\"I don't know what the exact percentage is, but there's some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do, and then there's some real displacement by AI of different kinds of jobs,\" Altman told CNBC-TV18 on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday.\n\n\"I expect we'll see more of the latter over time,\" he said.\n\nAltman added that although new types of jobs would be created in the AI era, the \"real impact of AI doing jobs\" would begin to be palpable in the next few years.\n\nCompanies that have cited AI when reducing employee head count include Amazon, IBM, Salesforce, and HP. There is no evidence of AI washing at these companies, a term used to describe companies overstating the role of artificial intelligence in a product or business decision.\n\nAltman, whose company provides AI tools that reshape and displace jobs, has previously said the technology will cause job disruption, but that people will find new forms of work and adapt.\n\nOthers have been more explicit. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, warned last year that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next five years. Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, said last month that he was already seeing some evidence that AI was causing a hiring slowdown at the company for junior roles.",

    "description": "A year on from the federal layoffs, Jay Gulledge, 59, said that while he has landed on his feet, he feels for other USAID workers who haven't.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jay Gulledge, 59, who is based in Tennessee. The termination of his employment at USAID and current employment have been verified by Business Insider.\n\nWhen the Trump administration dismantled the US Agency for International Development last year, I was one of the thousands of employees who lost their jobs. I was 58 at the time.\n\nA year on from being laid off, I'm happy with how things have turned out for me: I work for an exceptional organization with great colleagues.\n\nBut, every so often, when I talk to a former colleague or see one of their LinkedIn posts, I start to feel survivor's guilt. I ask myself: Why was I so lucky?\n\nI've had a long and winding career, and my route into working at USAID was circuitous.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I was an academic scientist. I went on to work at a climate-change think tank, then in middle management at a laboratory. I took some years out to consult and build a real-estate portfolio, with the aim of generating passive income.\n\nIn my 50s, I became interested in international development. There's a long-running American Association for the Advancement of Science fellowship program that places scientists and engineers into US federal agencies.\n\nI didn't have a background in international development, just an interest. The fellowship was a foot in the door of USAID and, starting in September 2022, I spent a year there as a fellow before joining as a climate change integration adviser on a two-year direct-hire contract.\n\nWhen I joined the fellowship, I was 56, and I expected USAID to be the final chapter of my career.\n\nMy work fit squarely within the Biden administration's priorities, but I knew those priorities would shift with a change in government.\n\nWhen Donald Trump won the 2024 election, and later when Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were in the news, I assumed my days were numbered.\n\nNone of us imagined the agency would be shut down entirely.\n\nThe atmosphere last February was chaotic. We'd heard a lot of different things, and we didn't really know what was going on.\n\nMany colleagues described this period as scary. It didn't feel scary to me. Sadness was my dominant feeling, not a personal sadness, but hurting for the world and my country. USAID had inefficiencies, but it helped millions of people who aren't getting that help anymore.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, I received an email that my termination would take effect on March 5.\n\nLosing my job was a hit, but at 58, I was later in my career, I had some passive income from my real-estate portfolio, I don't have kids, and I was going to be able to pay my bills. It wasn't going to devastate me financially or harm my family in any significant way, like it may have done for others.\n\nWhen my termination took effect, I tried to find a job that would bring me career satisfaction. That late in my career, I didn't need to find a job purely for the money.\n\nI was hearing that many of my colleagues were applying for dozens of jobs and getting no calls back. The market was flooded with job seekers in areas related to my expertise. There were thousands of competitors for every job, and the risk was that I might not find anything.\n\nI didn't apply for many jobs, and largely avoided international development roles, because I had former colleagues who were far more qualified for them than me.\n\nI knew that if all else failed, I could return to investing in real estate.\n\nI was unemployed for about six months before I found the perfect role as the director of scientific programs at PSE Health Energy, a research center that examines the health implications of the energy system.\n\nA year on, I'm happy with where I've landed. I love learning about new scientific concepts and working with exceptional colleagues.\n\nStill, there's an undeniable sense of loss. I worked for years to move into international development, intentionally cultivating that path, and it was taken away from me. There's nothing I can do about that.\n\nI also still feel survivor's guilt. It's not a daily thing, but it often comes up when I pause to reflect. I think about my former colleagues, really capable people, who are still unemployed.\n\nFor many of them, they'd been at USAID for their whole careers, and really cared about their work. My identity was not built around my job because I'd only been there for a couple of years.\n\nI landed on my feet, but the sheer number of people let go meant not everyone could. They must feel an even deeper sense of loss than I do.\n\nBusiness Insider contacted the Office of Personnel Management for a comment but did not receive a response.",

    "description": "Business Insider's investigation into data centers was awarded the George Polk Award for Environmental Reporting.",
    "fullText": "AI's impact is still largely unknown, but what's powering its rise is pretty clear.\n\nData centers are the backbone of artificial intelligence, and they are real-world evidence that businesses are betting big on the tech.\n\nAn AI project can rise and fall without many people noticing. A 50,000-square-foot data center that pops up in your neighborhood is a lot harder to ignore.\n\nIt's not just their sheer size that's tangible. The cost of these data centers, both economically and environmentally, is very real.\n\nThat's why Business Insider embarked on an investigation to better understand these data centers' impact. That work just earned us a very prestigious award.\n\nThe investigation was a full newsroom effort, with multiple reporters, editors, videographers, and designers chipping in. From environmental implications to complex financing to neighborhood drama, we covered the topic from all angles.\n\nWe've also got an incredible video and interactive map worth checking out.\n\nWinning an award doesn't mean our work is done.\n\nBig Tech companies keep ramping up their spending. Amazon and Alphabet recently announced plans to spend $200 billion and $185 billion, respectively, on AI infrastructure this year.\n\nNew states are also vying for data-center business, threatening traditional hubs like Northern Virginia.\n\nFinancing these deals is becoming increasingly complex and exotic, ranging from 100-year bonds to various types of securitization. In short, it's not just tech companies carrying the risk for these massive bets.\n\nYou can even include yourself in that group if you've noticed your utility bill went up recently.\n\nIt's still not entirely clear if these companies' AI efforts will eventually pay off. In the meantime, society is footing the bill.",

    "description": "As a club coach with Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon and an international coach with Australia, Joe Montemurro has experience of pressure from both sides as he talks to BBC Sport.",
    "fullText": "As a club coach with Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon, and an international coach with Australia, Joe Montemurro has experience of pressure from both sides.\n\nThe recent flurry of club managerial sackings in England has highlighted the volatility of elite coaching.\n\n\"You only see from the outside,\" reflects Montemurro.\n\n\"I think clubs now have a lot of short-term processes that they have to achieve instead of having long-term visions and that puts a lots of pressure on coaches from day one - because sometimes, you've got to fix cultures, you've got to fix structures, you've got to fix organisational processes before you can start getting the results.\"\n\nMontemurro suggests time is a precious commodity.\n\n\"The nature of what we do means we don't have time anymore. It's a high-pressure scenario - results aren't just about winning matches.\n\n\"It's fan engagement, it's commercial, it's money, it's economics, it's all the other 'side dishes', if you want to call it that.\"\n\nFrom 2017-2021 Montemurro was head coach of Arsenal Women. In 2021, he managed Juventus' women side, before becoming the first non-French manager at eight-time Women's Champions League winners Lyon in 2024.\n\nAfter winning league titles at all three clubs, Montemurro was appointed the Matildas head coach in June 2025.\n\n\"It's been an interesting transition,\" he tells BBC Sport from Australia. \"You're used to the day-to-day contact with players and staff, the excitement of games coming quickly.\n\n\"In international football there are little gaps between tournaments and windows that give you more time to reflect and work on other areas.\"\n\nMelbourne-born Montemurro's international journey is about to accelerate. The Women's Asian Cup begins on 1 March in his homeland, with the final set to be staged at Stadium Australia in Sydney - the same arena where Australia's men lifted the trophy in 2015 when Ange Postecoglou led the Socceroos to a 2-1 extra-time victory over South Korea.\n\nThe Matildas are chasing a second Asian Cup crown after a penalty shootout final win over North Korea in 2010 - a tournament where a 16-year-old Sam Kerr scored her first two international goals.\n\nHosting the Asian Cup comes at a pivotal moment for women's football in Australia, building on momentum generated by the Fifa Women's World Cup 2023, which the country co-hosted with New Zealand.\n\nFifa president, Gianni Infantino described that tournament as the \"best and greatest and biggest\" in history with a record-breaking near two million tickets, external sold and an average attendance of about 30,000 fans per match.\n\nThere will be an exodus from the Women's Super League (WSL) with 13 of Australia's 26-player squad currently playing in this country, underlining the depth of Australian influence in England's top flight.\n\nMontemurro understands the tension that creates for clubs.\n\n\"The timing is never perfect,\" he adds. \"I've been in that position when you lose players. It's unfortunate. But one thing clubs sometimes forget is that it's an honour for these players to represent their country.\n\n\"These tournaments don't come around often. For the Australian players, it's a home tournament - the opportunity to do well in that is exciting.\"\n\nMontemurro accepts there are \"pros and cons\", particularly as the WSL season reaches decisive months, but believes most clubs \"now plan for such absences\".\n\nJapan have called up 16 players from the WSL for their squad, including Ayaka Yamashita, Aoba Fujino and Yui Hasegawa from WSL leaders Manchester City.\n\nPlayers will travel around 21 February to prepare for the tournament which runs from 1-21 March.\n\nShould Australia reach the final, English-based players will miss two WSL games and an FA Cup fifth-round match.\n\nArsenal trio Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley and Kyra Cooney-Cross are heading to the tournament, and, should Australia progress to the quarter-finals, Chelsea will be without striker Kerr and defender Ellie Carpenter for their League Cup final against Manchester United, which takes place on 15 March at Ashton Gate in Bristol.\n\nMontemurro has also backed Manchester City forward Mary Fowler to return to fitness for the tournament, despite playing only 15 minutes since rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in April 2025.\n\nThe full list of WSL players in Australia's Asian Cup, external squad:\n\nCharlize Rule (Brighton and Hove Albion)\n\nEmily van Egmond (Leicester City)\n\nAlanna Kennedy (London City Lionesses)\n\nKaitlyn Torpey (Newcastle United)\n\nClaire Hunt (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nMontemurro is also clear the women's game in Australia must raise its professional standards.\n\nA recent report, external from the Players Football Association in Australia highlighted low average salaries of A$30,000 (£15,500) in the domestic women's league, with around 63% of players working second jobs.\n\n\"There are minimum standards that all professional leagues are ascertaining,\" says Montemurro, 56. \"We need to make sure we adhere to those standards.\n\n\"There's really no excuse from my perspective. There should be the minimum standards of proper 12-month contracts, pay that's relative to a professional contract [and] all the benefits that come with that.\n\n\"But also the environments that clubs adhere to in terms of their minimum standards - the proper medical, the proper technical, tactical analysis, everything that a professional sporting organisation should have.\n\n\"I think the biggest question is to understand what are the minimum standards from a worldwide perspective that we should be achieving in Australia. We must adhere to those.\"\n\nRecent FIFPRO research, external shows the 2026 Women's Asian Cup could generate up to US$82.4m (£61m), potentially making it the tournament's most commercially successful edition. Yet, the current prize pool remains $1.8m (£1.3m) - unchanged from four years ago and just 12% of the men's equivalent.\n\nAsked if that should increase, Montemurro adds: \"Totally. If national organisations are investing substantially in travel, tournaments and preparation, the prize pool should reflect that.\n\n\"If we're serious about these being major tournaments, there needs to be an incentive to take part.\"\n\nThe Women's Asian Cup will stage matches in Perth, Gold Coast and Sydney.\n\nPerth's 60,000-seat stadium will host the opener on 1 March as Australia face the Philippines, while the final will be played in Sydney at the 79,500-seat Stadium Australia on 21 March.\n\nAustralia are among the favourites, alongside two-time winners Japan, but China are the reigning champions after winning their ninth title in 2022.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "With Chelsea facing leaky Burnley at Stamford Bridge this week, FPL managers have a tough choice of captain between Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro.",
    "fullText": "The best FPL captain this week comes from Chelsea as they face a Burnley side that has conceded a league-high 32 goals away from home.\n\nThat is nearly three goals per game - so who do you choose out of Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro?\n\nThe pair have scored 43 and 48 FPL points in the past five gameweeks respectively, the two form players in that period.\n\nIf you own both, this is an near-impossible choice but I've gone for Palmer here with penalties adding to his potential.\n\nIt means no place for Erling Haaland this week - the re-emergence of expensive midfielders such as Palmer means tough choices. Let's hope that doesn't backfire although the Norwegian might be an injury doubt this week.\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nDon't miss our FPL special Q&A with expert FPL Heisenberg, live on the BBC Sport website on Friday, 20 February at 15:30 GMT.\n\nGoing all-in on Arsenal's defence backfired as they conceded in both games, with only captain Gabriel (14 points) doing anything attacking wise.\n\nDitto going double Palace defence. Deary dear.\n\nThank goodness for Palmer (12) and Joao Pedro (10) leading the team to a below-par 56 points.\n\nEmiliano Martinez, Aston Villa, keeper, £5m - Leeds (h)\n\nVilla have two clean sheets in their past five games and they have only conceded three times in that run - and allowed a fourth-best nine big chances.\n\nMartinez owners might feel unlucky not to got more out of him.\n\nDaniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, £5.9m - Wolves (h)\n\nPalace's defence was a massive disappointment last week as they folded in the first half against Burnley.\n\nI'm putting that down to the randomness of Premier League football and going for the fixture - bottom of the league at home - over form.\n\nMunoz carries so much attacking threat and one bad game is not enough to move away from him.\n\nJames Hill, Bournemouth, £4m - West Ham (a)\n\nOnly four players have more points than Hill's 29 in the past four gameweeks.\n\nHe's the dream budget option to end the season with, as Bournemouth have a nice fixture run to finish with.\n\nHe'll probably be in the side next week too for Sunderland at home.\n\nNordi Mukiele, Sunderland, £4.6m - Fulham (h)\n\nMukiele has picked up defensive contribution points 12 times in 24 starts. His five assists is the third-most among defenders and Sunderland have eight clean sheets this season.\n\nAll decent routes to points for a budget defender.\n\nMohammed Salah, Liverpool, £14m - Nottingham Forest (a)\n\nIs Salah back as an FPL option?\n\nHe's had a terrible season by his standards and is only the 41st-ranked midfielder in FPL but...\n\nIn the four games since his return from the Africa Cup of Nations, the signs are there that a haul is imminent.\n\nSalah's had 14 shots in that time (more than anyone else in the league), 12 in the box, three big chances yet no goal to show for it. He does have three assists.\n\nForest have been flakey to say the least this season and Liverpool are hitting a bit of form.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £9.8m - Everton (a)\n\nFernandes has been fantasy gold dust since his return from injury in gameweek 21 so don't let his blank at West Ham last time out put you off.\n\nThe Portuguese has 44 points in those six games and there's not even a penalty in there. By contrast, Cole Palmer has the same amount of points in six games but with four penalties.\n\nFernandes' potential is off the charts and Everton have only one clean sheet in their past seven.\n\nCole Palmer (captain), Chelsea, £10.6m - Burnley (h)\n\nHe might have relied on penalties for his recent surge in form but that is what makes Palmer such a great FPL asset in the first place.\n\nIf you're chasing points in your mini-league, Palmer is the best differential with just a 15% ownership.\n\nAnd Burnley at home... well it doesn't get much better!\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Manchester City, £8.0m - Newcastle (h)\n\nAny worries that Semenyo's production might suffer from his move to City, with so many forward options, have been unfounded.\n\nHe's scored in both his home matches and now takes on a Newcastle side who have conceded eight in their past three games.\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen, Crystal Palace, £6.1m - Leeds (h)\n\nAs soon as Strand Larsen moved to Palace, he became an enticing FPL option and his two-goal debut haul will have managers drooling.\n\nFacing Burnley's defence last week might have had something to do with things but the Norwegian gets a crack at another leaky defence.\n\nDon't be fooled by Wolves' clean sheet at Forest last time - they allowed 35 shots and could have conceded five!\n\nJoao Pedro, Chelsea, £7.7m - Burnley (h)\n\nIt must be a while since a striker not called Erling Haaland has had a run of form like Joao Pedro's.\n\nFive games, four goals, five assists and nine bonus points. And now he takes on Burnley.\n\nIgor Thiago, Brentford, £7m - Brighton (h)\n\nOnly one goal in five for the Premier League's second-top scorer but he now enters an incredible run of fixtures until gameweek 33, including games against Wolves and Burnley.\n\nWith penalties on his side and still at a decent price, he's a brilliant pick.\n\nMartin Dubravka, Burnley, keeper, £4m - Chelsea (a)\n\nEl Hadji Malick Diouf, West Ham, defender, £4m - Bournemouth (h)\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Everton, midfielder, £4.9m - Manchester United (h)\n\nOmar Alderete, Sunderland, defender, £4.1m - Fulham (h)\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "John Murray reflects on 30 years of commentating on matches across the globe for the BBC.",
    "fullText": "Wednesday's trip to Azerbaijan was the latest in a list of unusual destinations for John Murray to commentate from. He has seen it all during three decades behind the microphone for the BBC - from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, to the Arctic Circle and numerous World Cups.\n\nThe Radio 5 Live commentator, 59, has attended more than 200 stadiums while narrating some of the biggest football matches across the globe since joining the organisation in 1994.\n\nBefore Newcastle's Champions League match against Qarabag on Wednesday, the Northumberland native sat against the picturesque backdrop of the Azersun Arena in Baku - more than 2,500 miles away from home - to reflect on a career that has taken him to five continents.\n\n\"When I was growing up, listening to the radio and watching television, it was really commentary to matches in far flung places that captured my imagination,\" explains Murray.\n\n\"I always remember those European matches because in those days - we're talking 1970s, early 1980s - it was quite a rarity that those matches would be shown live on television.\n\n\"Access to those matches on the radio - and international matches as well - were a big part of what really fired my imagination.\"\n\nBefore he joined the BBC, Murray's first taste of life in the gantry came on a \"raucous\" night at Stoke City's Victoria Ground when he was \"thrust\" on air while working for local Teesside station TFM Radio.\n\nHe later travelled to Pisa to cover Middlesbrough's Anglo-Italian Cup match against the Serie B side as he continued to hone his craft as a budding broadcaster.\n\n\"It must have been my first game abroad and the stadium there was right next to the Leaning Tower of Pisa,\" he recalls.\n\n\"That was a fantastic way to start - you can't get any better than your first [European] commentary next to a World Heritage site.\n\n\"There were only a couple of hundred people at the ground, but right outside is the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\"\n\nEven after covering matches across Asia, Africa, North America, South America and Europe, each season still manages to spring something new on Murray.\n\nIn January, he found himself surrounded by \"snow-capped mountains\" on a historic night inside the Arctic Circle as Norwegian minnows Bodo/Glimt stunned Manchester City in the Champions League.\n\nMurray regards it as one of the most surreal nights of his career, likening the landscape to the 1983 Bill Forsyth film Local Hero, which was set in Scotland.\n\n\"I could see rooftops with snow on them from just outside the ground. It was such an unusual place,\" he says.\n\n\"As I said at the time on the radio, it just had the feel of the film 'Local Hero'. I was thinking, how are we here for a Champions League match?\n\n\"And not only that, but it helps when you get a match that is a real event. For them to beat Manchester City, Champions League winners only a few years ago, in the way that they did, that is part of package.\n\n\"When you get the match, as well as the setting, to describe as well. There weren't many better examples than that.\"\n\nBut it was much closer to home that Murray encountered what he described as the most \"challenging\" 90 minutes of his broadcasting career.\n\nIn January 2021, eighth-tier Marine hosted Tottenham in the FA Cup third round.\n\nOngoing Covid-19 restrictions meant matches were played behind closed doors, with broadcasters, journalists and a small number of other media personnel spread around the ground to adhere to social distancing guidelines.\n\nFor the first time, Murray was forced to commentate from behind the goal rather than his usual position along the touchline.\n\n\"I was really uncomfortable about that because it just didn't feel right,\" he admits.\n\n\"Normally I'm side on, the teams are playing left to right, right to left. There I was commentating with one team coming at you and the other team going away from you.\n\n\"It's not an experience I'd particularity want to repeat again.\"\n\nIt was only a few weeks ago that Murray was prompted to reflect on his remarkable career when a colleague asked how many stadiums he had visited.\n\nAfter revisiting the question during this interview, the self-proclaimed \"stadium geek\" settled on an answer of \"more than 200\".\n\n\"I don't know how I'd work out how many it is. During the course of that, I've probably seen a little bit of everything,\" he says.\n\nDuring that time, Murray has commentated on World Cups in South Korea, South Africa, Brazil and Qatar. Yet it is the FA Cup he holds in the highest regard.\n\nMurray made his FA Cup final commentary debut in 2010 when Premier League champions Chelsea beat Portsmouth at Wembley Stadium to secure a first domestic Double.\n\nBut it is the competition's early rounds that continue to rouse him - most recently when he covered non-league Macclesfield's upset of holders Crystal Palace.\n\n\"It was a match that had so many of the ingredients that you would want for a cup upset,\" he adds. \"There is nothing like that.\n\n\"For all the World Cup finals, internationals and Champions League finals, there is still nothing like being there and experiencing an FA Cup upset like that. That was one of the biggest.\"\n\nSo after thousands of matches in hundreds of different stadiums across the world, which game ranks as Murray's favourite?\n\n\"Easy question,\" he says with a smile. \"It was always a difficult question until the 2022 World Cup final - that was an amazing match to be at.\n\n\"But because it was the World Cup final and Lionel Messi was involved, Kylian Mbappe was involved, the to and fro of the game, the drama and excitement.\n\n\"That is the one I'd pick out, which is a really boring, easy answer. Yes it was a World Cup final, but it was the best spectacle.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Ange Postecoglou says he would not consider a return to managing Celtic despite the \"amazing experience\" he enjoyed in Glasgow.\n\nThe Australian lifted five trophies in two years at the club, and won the affection of fans with his attacking style of play before leaving for Tottenham Hotspur in 2023.\n\nPostecoglou has been out of work since being sacked by Nottingham Forest in October and has been linked with a return to Celtic in the summer as the Premiership champions search for their next permanent manager.\n\nThe 60-year-old told The Overlap it was not in his nature to return to a job he had done before.\n\n\"I don't go back,\" he said. \"I don't think that's been my career.\"\n\nHowever, Postecoglou talked about his time as Celtic manager in positive terms, saying he loved the passion of the fans.\n\n\"I loved Celtic,\" he said. \"What a football club. If I was younger, I probably would have stayed there longer for three or four years.\n\n\"I think I could have made progress with them in Europe. But at the time, it had taken me a lot of time to get to this space and the opportunity to join Tottenham was too good.\n\n\"In terms of going back, I don't go back. I don't think that's been my career.\n\n\"Whatever the next step is, I think it will be something new, something I can make an impact in, somewhere I can win things.\n\n\"It doesn't diminish the affection I have for Celtic. It was a great experience. For two years, to be within a community that is so passionate, and it's crazy how passionate they are, obviously I was fortunate enough to have success.\n\n\"It's a positive experience and I loved every minute of it. I look back on it fondly but... I won't go back. It's not how my career plays out.\"\n\nHe also described the city rivalry with Rangers and shared memories of his first season in charge, when the club won the Premiership and League Cup.\n\n\"Nobody is going to talk to me about rivalry,\" Postecoglou said. \"I lived and breathed it there.\n\n\"The perfect weekend in Scotland is Celtic winning, Rangers losing. Celtic winning, Rangers winning is not a good weekend.\n\n\"I remember the first year I was there we won the double but Rangers were in the Europa League final. I got more text messages the night they lost the Europa League final than the night we won the league.",

    "description": "Former Celtic and Stuttgart defender Andreas Hinkel gives BBC Sport Scotland his analysis of the sides' upcoming Europa League tie.",
    "fullText": "In what has been a really up and down season for Celtic, they have done well to navigate a path through to the Europa League knockout phase play-off.\n\nHaving got to this stage of the competition, there is no doubt they face a stern test on Thursday against a Stuttgart side brimming with quality and challenging for the Bundesliga's Champions League spots.\n\nFormer Germany international defender Andreas Hinkel – who played for both clubs – is expecting \"two tight games\".\n\nBut what is the key to Celtic finding a way of achieving what would be a very notable European scalp?\n\nUpsetting Stuttgart's rhythm could be the key.\n\nHinkel, who also coached at the Bundesliga club, explains: \"In general Stuttgart, they always want to have control, they want to have the ball, it is always difficult to press them.\n\n\"Sebastian Hoeness, the manager, he wants to dominate the game so I think this is a key thing at Celtic Park as well.\n\n\"If Celtic can press, if Celtic can destroy the build-up, if they are inside the game, the crowd is there - something can happen at Celtic Park.\n\n\"If Stuttgart take control, of course the crowd will be a little bit quieter, it can affect the game so I think it is quite important how it goes on at Celtic Park.\"\n\nStuttgart's quality is illustrated by the fact they finished 11th in the competition's league phase standings - just one point behind the top eight who automatically progressed to the round of 16.\n\nThe German side are a solid collective unit, but within that are individuals Martin O'Neill and his team will have to be very wary of.\n\n\"I don't want to mention just one player but I think [Deniz] Undav, the striker, is in good shape at the moment,\" Hinkel says.\n\n\"But we have some other players like [Jamie] Leweling, [Chris] Fuhrich, there are a few players there with a big target, they want to go to the World Cup and they want to present themselves as good as they can for the German national team.\"\n\nHinkel believes Stuttgart may have \"a small advantage over the two legs because the second one is at home\".\n\nIf Celtic are looking for an added source of optimism it could perhaps come from Stuttgart's away record in this season's competition.\n\nThey have lost three of their four away games - at Basel, Fenerbahce and Roma.\n\nAlthough it should be said there is no shame in that, and a 4-0 win at Dutch side Go Ahead Eagles is also an impressive outlier.\n\n\"The first leg at Celtic Park is important because away over the years Stuttgart had some results in the Champions League or the Europa League where they lost quite heavily,\" said Hinkel.\n\n\"For example, in Belgrade they lost 5-1. If you have a game like this at Celtic Park everything can happen if the crowd is there and team gets into the rhythm and they play and attack and something can happen like that.\n\n\"Stuttgart is a very good side, they are fighting for the Champions League places in Germany but since Martin O'Neill took over again, Celtic get the results. They get results when it is not that easy - it is always close at the end, maybe in injury time.\n\n\"But they get the results and it is a good side and I think the mentality is back so I expect tight games.\"\n\nO'Neill ready for tough Stuttgart test as Celtic boss reaches 1,000 matches\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Undisputed heavyweight champion Claressa Shields tells BBC Sport how she stays motivated as she prepares to face Franchon Crews-Dezurn.",
    "fullText": "Six months before the 2012 Olympics, American Claressa Shields took her first step on the path to greatness.\n\nAged only 16, Shields beat national champion Franchon Crews-Dezurn, who was eight years her senior, at the US Olympic trials.\n\nShields would go on to win gold at the Games in London and earn a further two victories over Crews-Dezurn in the amateur ranks.\n\nA fourth successive win followed when they met on their professional debuts in 2016 - and the pair are set to reignite their rivalry on Saturday when Shields defends her undisputed heavyweight status.\n\n\"Me and Franchon have always said that for some reason we are always intertwined in each other's lives,\" Shields told BBC Sport.\n\n\"If you take it back to when I was 16, she was ranked number one in the country and I was ranked number seven and the people who were ranked lower had to pull out a ball and it would tell you who we were fighting against - I pulled out number one.\n\n\"Now we meet again on the first fight of my major deal.\"\n\nThe major multi-fight deal that Shields speaks of was signed with Wynn Records and Salita Promotions in November.\n\nIt is worth a staggering $8m (£6.1m) and also came with an additional $3m (£2.2m) signing-on bonus.\n\nThose figures are unheard of in women's boxing but Shields, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, five-weight world champion and three-weight undisputed champion, is no stranger to raising the bar.\n\n\"I have never heard of a man getting that kind of signing bonus. I've heard of men getting a $1m (£739,000) signing bonus but never $3m,\" Shields said.\n\n\"I would love to ask ChatGPT, 'Has a man ever got a $3m signing bonus for a boxing contract?'\n\n\"My contract now is big overall and I'm getting back paid. When I came out of the Olympics with two gold medals, I should have got a $1m signing bonus for whoever I went with but that didn't happen.\n\n\"Now it's years later but I'm getting it all back. I've been able to make millions over the past few years.\"\n\nShields is the self-proclaimed Greatest Woman of All Time (GWOAT) and has a catalogue of evidence to back that claim up.\n\nThe 30-year-old won her first world title in just her fourth professional bout - becoming a unified super-middleweight champion.\n\nThat sparked a run of 14 successive world title fights and Shields is yet to lose in 17 contests as a professional.\n\nHer last defeat came as an amateur in 2012 against Briton Savannah Marshall - a defeat she atoned for in 2022.\n\nDespite achieving more than most in a full career, Shields does not lack the motivation to reach new highs.\n\n\"It's seeing how great I can be as a fighter,\" Shields said.\n\n\"I want to get my skillset and body to the position where I can go the extra mile and get the knockout after I've dominated these girls for five or six rounds.\n\n\"It's all about how great can I be. When it's all over, you don't get your youth back.\"\n\nAfter experimenting with mixed martial arts twice - winning two and losing one - Shields has made clear her intention to stick to pugilism for the rest of her career.\n\nShields turns 31 next month and intends to continue boxing until she is 38, leaving the door open for plenty of tests.\n\nUnified welterweight champion Lauren Price and Mikaela Mayer, who holds the WBO welterweight title and is also a unified champion at light-middleweight, have both called out Shields in recent times.\n\nWales' Price has urged Shields to come down from heavyweight, but that would mean the American dropping five divisions.\n\n\"If Mikaela and Lauren want to prove their greatness - and I'm willing to give them that chance - then it's 163lb and 165lb. I don't have to prove anything,\" Shields said.\n\n\"Lauren has no excuse for 165lb (75kg) because we both fought at 75kg for our Olympic gold medals. Let's not make excuses with the weight classes.\"\n\nPrice won Olympic gold at middleweight in 2020 but has spent her entire professional career at welterweight and defends her world titles against Stephanie Pineiro Aquino in April on BBC Two.\n\nMayer is a three-division world champion and has fought as high as light-middleweight.\n\n\"I don't know why these girls think I have to go down two or three weight classes when Terence Crawford went up three weight classes to fight Canelo [Alvarez],\" Shields said.\n\n\"The thing I find so crazy about this is when I was at 154lb, 160lb and 168lb - no-one would fight me. Now I'm at 175lb all these girls are calling me out to fight.\n\n\"Where were you all when I was undisputed at 160lb twice? Where were you at when I was at 154lb? I couldn't get a fight. I had to beg girls to fight.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano will undergo stricter \"neurological and concussion\" medical tests before they are cleared to return to MMA.\n\nThe long-retired duo are scheduled to meet in a five-round featherweight bout on 16 May in California.\n\nRousey, 39, has spoken at length about serious concussion problems throughout her athletic career and said it contributed to her decision to retire from MMA 10 years ago.\n\n\"We're going to put her through neurological and concussion battery testing and make sure she's okay,\" California State Athletic Commission executive director Andy Foster told ESPN., external\n\n\"We're going to have our doctors take a look.\n\n\"The fighters are going to have to do a lot of medicals, both of them.\"\n\nThe California State Athletic Commission requires additional testing for fighters over the age of 40.\n\nThe commission uses recommendations from the Association of Ringside Physicians to screen older fighters.\n\nThose recommendations include blood work, neurocognitive testing, a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac testing.\n\nRousey to face Carano in first MMA bout in 10 years\n\n'More than a fighter' - how Rousey finally found peace\n\nCarano, 43, retired from MMA 17 years ago while Rousey hung up her gloves 10 years ago, but did compete in the WWE from 2018 onwards.\n\nRousey told BBC Sport in 2024 how she suffered from concussions before she transitioned into MMA from judo.\n\n\"I had been hiding concussions and neurological injuries for so long that it just became part of it,\" she said.\n\n\"And that was the point I was forced to really self-assess and be like, 'your brain has taken too much damage for too many years'.\"\n\nFoster says he currently has no concerns about the contest as long as they \"pass their medicals and pass all their neurological batteries\".\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with this fight,\" he added.\n\nRousey v Carano will headline the first MMA event on Netflix. Rousey is a former UFC champion – becoming the first female to sign with the promotion – while Carano is considered one of the pioneers of the sport in the women's code.\n\nCarano retired before Rousey made her MMA debut, but the rivals have long been linked with a match-up and the UFC tried to make the fight at the height of Rousey's career.\n\nAfter a five-year unbeaten streak, Rousey lost her UFC bantamweight title to Holly Holm in a shock defeat, and when she was knocked out by Amanda Nunes in her comeback the following year, she retired from MMA.\n\nRousey has a 12-2 record while Carano is 7-1, with her only loss against Cris Cyborg in her last bout in 2009.\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Jack Crowley will start at fly-half as Ireland head coach Andy Farrell makes five changes to his starting XV for Saturday's Six Nations match against England at Allianz Stadium.\n\nSam Prendergast started in Ireland's opening loss to France and last week's victory over Italy, but Farrell has brought Crowley back into the XV after the 26-year-old's impact off the bench against the Azzurri.\n\nPrendergast is not named in the matchday squad with Farrell opting for the versatile Ciaran Frawley on the bench.\n\nMunster's Crowley will partner Jamison Gibson-Park in a changed half-back pairing as Craig Casey drops to the bench.\n\nThree-time British and Irish Lion Tadhg Furlong is recalled at tight-head prop having returned from a calf injury against Italy.\n\nIn a changed back row, captain Caelan Doris switches back to his familiar number eight role behind flankers Tadhg Beirne and Josh Van der Flier, with Jack Conan and Cormac Izuchukwu making way.\n\nFarrell has changed to a split of five forwards and three backs on the bench, having gone with a 6-2 for the first two games.\n\nBritish and Irish Lion Finlay Bealham has been recalled to provide tight-head cover, with Ronan Kelleher, Tom O'Toole, Nick Timoney and Jack Conan rounding out the forward replacements.\n\nWing Tommy O'Brien, who was left out against Italy, joins Casey and Frawley as the backline options on the bench.\n\nIreland and England both have one win from their opening two games, with Steve Borthwick's side targeting a return to form after last week's dispiriting Calcutta Cup loss to Scotland at Murrayfield.\n\n'A lightning rod for excitement' - Pollock gets start\n\n'Brotherly rivalry' between Irish and English Lions\n\nCrowley's return to the starting line-up is not surprising given Prendergast's struggles against Italy.\n\nWhile Crowley kicked a penalty dead at the end of the game to deny Ireland a possible bonus-point try, Farrell - who last week hit out at \"keyboard warriors\" stoking the fly-half debate - said he played \"outstandingly well\" after replacing Prendergast.\n\nCrowley only started one game in last year's Six Nations after playing every minute of Ireland's triumphant 2024 campaign.\n\nSaturday's game presents another big opportunity for him after he started the autumn Test defeat by the All Blacks in Chicago, only for Prendergast to be preferred for South Africa's visit to Dublin later in November.\n\nWhile Prendergast will be disappointed to miss out altogether, Frawley can cover fly-half, centre and full-back from the bench.

    "description": "Jos Buttler's form is a concern but Will Jacks and Sam Curran have shown promise. What to make of England's unconvincing start to the World Cup?",
    "fullText": "England‘s group stage at the T20 World Cup was a mixed bag - some good but overall unconvincing.\n\nSam Curran and Will Jacks have provided reasons to be positive but Jos Buttler‘s tricky start is a concern.\n\nWe have taken a look into the numbers behind his struggles and the other themes of England’s first four matches…\n\nScores of three against both Italy and Scotland mean Buttler made only 53 runs across the group stage – a low return for one of England's key men.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had a quiet winter with no fifties in 15 international innings across all formats, though a 97 not out in the SA20 in January casts doubt on those writing him off entirely.\n\nButtler's dismissals against Italy and Scotland were almost identical.\n\nLooking for his first boundary from his fourth ball, he miscued a length ball in the off-stump channel to mid-off.\n\n\"Maybe he is trying too hard to get a score on the board,\" said Buttler's former England team-mate Dawid Malan.\n\n\"The last two innings he has played, he has tried to hit the ball over mid-on.\n\n\"Knowing him and playing with him, his gameplan is generally to look to the off side first and then pick up leg side, so maybe he's just going back to his basics.\n\n\"I don't think we have to worry.\"\n\nAll three of his dismissals against pace, including nicking off against Nepal seamer Nandan Yadav, have come against balls clocked between 75-82mph.\n\nSince the start of 2024, Buttler has struggled against pace bowlers in that bracket more than any other – with an average of 35.8 and a strike-rate of 129.\n\nPerhaps more concerningly, given the tournament now returns to the turning tracks of Sri Lanka, his average against spin in T20 internationals has dropped to 24.1 since 2024 from 61.8 across the two years prior.\n\nButtler's other dismissal in this tournament came against Roston Chase's off-spin.\n\nEven with making 202-7 against Italy, there remains a feeling England's batting is yet to fully fire at this tournament.\n\nThey posted 184-7 against Nepal, were bowled out for 166 by West Indies and wobbled when chasing 153 in their victory over the Scots.\n\nThe problem has not been batters getting in.\n\nEnglishmen have reached 25 runs 14 times so far – the most of any team in the competition – but only four of those knocks have been converted into fifties. No England player has made a score above 75.\n\nWill Jacks rejected the notion this is due to batters failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Responsibility in T20 can be misunderstood,\" he said. \"Sometimes the responsibility is to try and hit 30 off the over.\"\n\nMalan believes The Hundred may be having an impact.\n\n\"There's more emphasis on the first 10 overs now, so if you lose wickets in those first 10 overs then it makes it harder towards the end, but you still need to keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"I used to always worry more about the second 10 overs, so it was about setting things up and then being able to get to that 180 or 190-mark, if the score and wicket dictated it.\n\n\"A lot of these players are playing in The Hundred which is less balls, meaning you have to keep going earlier, and it doesn't really teach you to soak up the pressure for an over or two.\"\n\nCaptain Harry Brook has now got out against spin in three innings in a row after beginning the tournament with 53 against Nepal.\n\nThis is a familiar issue for Brook, who averages 47 against pace in T20 internationals since the start of 2024 but only 23.5 against spin.\n\nBrook's struggles are curious, given his stunning 136 not out on a turning pitch in a one-day international in Sri Lanka last month.\n\nThe return to Sri Lanka for the Super 8s may help Brook because in India he is averaging 20.5 in T20s.\n\nCould Harry Brook struggle in that department then?\n\n“It has probably been his weakness but, saying that, when you bat at four, five or six in T20 cricket and you're walking in at the ninth or 10th over, the majority of balls you are going to face are spin,” Malan said.\n\n“If he is out there for eight overs and he is facing six overs of spin, there is a high chance he's going to get out against spin after starting against spin.\n\n“He changed his technique at the beginning of the year to become better at spin.\n\n“He keeps his bat on the floor for longer whereas he used to stay up.”\n\nOne of the positives of this World Cup so far has been Jacks' promising returns as England's finisher.\n\nHis 39 not out from 18 balls in the four-run win over Nepal was crucial – so too his maiden T20 international fifty against Italy from the tricky position of 101-5.\n\nJacks only took on the finishers' role at the start of last summer but is faring well compared to others before him.\n\nJacks' bowling is more of a concern, however.\n\nWith leg-spinner Adil Rashid, plus two left-arm spinners in Liam Dawson and Jacob Bethell, in the squad, Jacks' bowling role is more significant given he turns the ball in the other direction as an off-spinner.\n\nIt is problematic for England that his six overs have cost 83 runs with two wickets in return.\n\nJacks has struggled most when being swept, conceding 31 runs from eight sweep shots in the group stage.\n\nThough his average amount of turn is only down slightly, 3.5 degrees in the pre-tournament series in Sri Lanka compared to 3.3, Jacks is drifting the ball far less - 1 degree compared to 1.7 degrees in Sri Lanka.\n\nSam Curran came through twice when England were under the most pressure during the group stage.\n\nAgainst Nepal, he successfully defended 10 from the last over.\n\nWhen Italy and Grant Stewart were flying in Monday, Curran stopped the runs and then dismissed the right-hander.\n\nCurran, who was out of favour until September last year, has taken on the role of England's death bowler to good effect.\n\nHe has been especially effective with yorkers – going at 5.07 runs per over with a full length at the death, compared to 14.14 with anything shorter.\n\nCurran is often credited with having a canny mix of slower balls but he has largely kept his pace above 80mph in those crucial final stages.\n\nMore significant has been his control of line…",

    "title": "The 20-year-old newspaper column that gave a hint to Man City's new tactics",
    "description": "Pep Guardiola is using new tactics this season by making Manchester City's attack more narrow, but did he hint at the idea 20 years ago?",
    "fullText": "Last week, Pep Guardiola replied to a journalist's question by saying: \"Do you want to be my assistant coach? You are brilliant, you are top.\"\n\nThe journalist asking that question was me.\n\nThe reason for my question was to try to gain insight into Manchester City's increasing use of narrow and fluid attackers.\n\nIn City's stellar side of 2017-18, Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling would finish games with white paint on their boots after being stationed high and wide.\n\nAlmost a decade on, Guardiola's system looks very different.\n\nTo understand why requires a deep dive.\n\nThis article contains content provided by X. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read X’s cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nIn my question I referenced an article Guardiola wrote for Spanish newspaper El Pais in 2006, in which he analysed Spain's 3-1 win against Tunisia.\n\nAn important aspect of that column was his analysis of how to break down low blocks, which has been a key theme this season.\n\n\"When you decide to play on the counter-attack, you have plenty of space. When you decide to attack [with the ball], you have less. [But] when you play on the counter-attack, the ball belongs to the opponent,\" he wrote.\n\nAt the start of this season, City leant into the counter-attacking strengths of individuals such as Erling Haaland and Tijjani Reijnders. By November, they had scored more goals from fast breaks than in the previous two league campaigns combined.\n\nIn response to increasingly physical and centrally compact defences in the Premier League, City were scoring by bypassing teams' low-blocks altogether.\n\nAnd although City still look to use their fast attackers, the Spaniard has applied the brakes in recent weeks, with his words from 20 years ago hinting as to why.\n\nPlaying more directly can lead to more turnovers, especially centrally.\n\nIn those circumstances, the attacking side can become stretched with the forwards far from the midfielders and defenders.\n\nIf a side's shape off the ball is not compact and a team loses the ball often, the logic behind Guardiola wanting to minimise the risk around playing directly is obvious.\n\n\"After [their opening goal], Tunisia wanted the game to be 14-a-side. They wanted a game with little space,\" he continued in his column.\n\nGiven how many Premier League teams now look to defend City in a way that mirrors how Tunisia played on that day, the rest of his words become even more insightful.\n\nAt the start of February, Pep said the game has more \"man-marking\" and is \"more aggressive\" whereas before it was more \"zonal\", referring to how teams behave when defending.\n\nBut \"if you do the process well, always the spaces are there\", he added - suggesting there wasn't a need to throw game plans in the bin, but to simply execute them correctly.\n\nSo how do Guardiola's City look to \"do the process well\" against physical mid and low blocks?\n\nCity recently beat Fulham 3-0 with 56% of the possession. Antoine Semenyo and Haaland played as split strikers with Phil Foden behind them.\n\nIn profile and shape, that City side was surprisingly similar to the Luis Aragones' Spain side that unlocked Tunisia's low block. Aragones' team was the side that became known for tiki-taka.\n\nBoth sides played with a narrow and fluid front three. In fact Guardiola described Spain's forwards as \"position-less\".\n\nThey were flanked by two full-backs, high and wide.\n\nXavi and Marcos Senna were central midfielders with license to push up when spaces presented themselves, protected by single pivot. For Spain this was Xabi Alonso and for City, Rodri.\n\nWhen I read his column from 2006 back to him and suggested comparisons with his current City tactics, Guardiola nodded. It hinted his comments from 20 years ago, at least in part, revealed the intentions of his current side.\n\nOn Spain's fluid Spanish front three, Guardiola wrote, \"[they come] to the centre so that [full-backs] Sergio Ramos and Pernia can go up but the key is knowing when they're dropping deep\".\n\nThe timing of those movements was the important detail.\n\nAnd with City's attackers taking turns to partner Haaland centrally in a fluid manner, their positioning and movement has been key for City.\n\nAt times Guardiola has been seen calling for restraint in his attackers' movements from the touchline, despite affording them more freedom in these areas than in previous seasons.\n\nHolding a high position pins opponents back, especially in a game that has become more 'man-to-man' in defence.\n\nDefenders and midfielders are less likely to step up and press the ball, wary of the likes of Foden and Semenyo behind them.\n\nThis gives City's defenders and defensive midfielders more room to build out from the back in what looks like a mini-game with the opposition's front two or three against a City back two and a midfield two often playing around them.\n\nThis helps City get up the pitch and push teams back, allowing Guardiola's side to dominate the ball.\n\nWhen possession has been established in the opponent's half, restraint is still needed for the narrow attackers.\n\nWhen analysing Spain, Pep said: \"If (the attackers) drop in too early, it creates a space problem, forcing Xavi, Senna, and Cesc [Fabregas] back and putting them up alongside Xabi Alonso.\"\n\nAnd for City this could easily be replicated if the attackers drop in too early, forcing Nico O'Reilly and Bernardo Silva alongside Rodri.\n\nAgainst compact sides that aim to block the middle of the pitch, the space exists deep - with the likes of Marc Guehi, Ruben Dias and Rodri - or out wide. Ensuring Rodri has the space to showcase his passing quality is essential.\n\nCity's attackers are encouraged to stay in-field too, to pull the opposition's wide midfielders and full-backs inside with them, creating space for Matheus Nunes and Rayan Ait-Nouri to attack.\n\nGuardiola elaborated on this after City's 2-0 win in the FA Cup against Salford City.\n\nHe spoke to Foden on the touchline with the playmaker stationed between the lines, centrally, which opened up space out wide. However, City failed to capitalise on it.\n\n\"We didn't make the process to get the ball to Ryan [McAidoo] in better conditions to make use of his incredible qualities one against one,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"When the team is so tight and shifts to one side, the ball has to go quickly to the opposite side and we were so slow to go to the opposite side.\"\n\nAlthough City didn't attack as Guardiola intended, the positioning of the narrow attackers here was in line with what he would have wanted.\n\nThis isn't to say that attackers shouldn't move from their narrow position at all.\n\nIn fact about Spain, Pep wrote: \"It's good the forwards drop deep to receive the ball, but they need to do it a little later. Spotting this is difficult.\n\n\"If they manage it, it will allow Xavi, Cesc, and Iniesta, to receive the ball behind the opposing midfielders.\"\n\nAnd in recent weeks, these well-timed dropping-deep movements have been seen at Etihad Stadium.\n\nWith City's attackers waiting before dropping deep, City's defenders are able to carry the ball into the space that opens up.\n\nForward passes and dribbles often cause opponents to drop deep in response which is often a cue City's attackers use to burst away from their marker – towards the ball.\n\nDelaying the drop-deep movements allows City's forwards to arrive on the ball at the right time, at which City's midfielders have been seen pushing up into the space behind the opposing midfielders, as per Guardiola's recommendations for 2006 Spain.\n\nCity have also often used the movement of attackers dropping deep to then find wide players in space unopposed too.\n\nIn response to my question, Pep focused on player quality.\n\n\"We adapt to the quality of the players that we have. We have just one proper proper winger right now in Antoine and we adapt the system to make comfortable the players.\"\n\nIt's telling that for one of the most successful coaches in football, his approach is player-led.\n\nIn recent years, numerous coaches have been hired and subsequently sacked for a tactical style they have been unwilling to waver from.\n\nGuardiola in 2026 still believes in unlocking low blocks by dominating possession, and pinning teams into their own half, as he did 20 years ago but in aiming to get the best of his team, tweaks his tactics based on his players, to perform these principles.\n\nAlthough Guardiola and his staff will be drilling into their players the best way to move and interact with their team-mates, the reason these tactics have worked well for City in recent weeks is due to the players suiting the positions they've found themselves in.\n\nPep has reinvented his side numerous times throughout his career. Promising coaches are sometimes described as playing like Pep but this claim is often less true given that Guardiola's sides looks so different, so often.\n\nDespite this, the way he thinks about the game and his core beliefs have been unwavering over a remarkably long time and his 2006 columns provide clues as to how the City manager was likely always destined for the top.",

    "title": "Voith Schneider Propeller",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The Voith Schneider Propeller (VSP) is a specialized marine propulsion system (MPS) manufactured by the Voith Group based on a cyclorotor design. It is highly maneuverable, being able to change the direction of its thrust almost instantaneously. It is widely used on tugs and ferries.\nThe Voith Schneider drive was invented by Ernst Schneider. It has been developed and produced by Voith in Heidenheim an der Brenz and St. Pölten since 1926.\n\nFrom a circular plate, rotating around a vertical axis, a circular array of vertical blades (in the shape of hydrofoils) protrude out of the bottom of the ship. Each blade can rotate itself around a vertical axis. The internal gear changes the angle of attack of the blades in sync with the rotation of the plate, so that each blade can provide thrust in any direction.\n\nUnlike the azimuth thruster (where a conventional propeller is rotated about the vertical axis to direct its thrust, allowing a vessel to steer without the use of a rudder), the Voith-Schneider drive merely requires changing the pattern of orientation of the vertical blades. In a marine situation, this provides for a drive which can be directed in any direction and thus does away with the need for a rudder. It is highly efficient and provides for an almost instantaneous change of direction. These drives are becoming increasingly common in work boats such as fireboats and tugboats where extreme maneuverability is needed.\n\nAzimuth thrusters (and Kort nozzles) have both advantages and disadvantages when compared to cycloidal drives. The azimuth thruster is less efficient and slower to manoeuvre, but is likely to be cheaper in the short term. Life cycle costs favour the Voith solution, something reflected in the residual value of a Voith water tractor. A choice is made on the basis of perceived performance requirements. Instead of a Kort nozzle, VSPs are often fitted with a \"thrust plate\" or \"propeller guard\" which acts as a nozzle at low speed, protects the VSP against grounding and provides another blocking location during drydocking.\n\nA low acoustic signature favours the device's use in minesweepers by minimising cavitation (usually produced at the tips of axial propellers) as the rotor does not need to rotate as fast for a given thrust. The underwater sound signature of the MV North Sea Giant (IMO: 9524073, MMSI: 248039000) dynamic positioning vessel was measured by the International Centre for Island Technology (ICIT) whilst installing a foundation monopile for the Voith tidal energy device in the Fall of Warness, Orkney (Ref Beharie and Side, 2011).\n\nVSPs are offered with an input power range of 160 kW to 3900 kW[1]\n\nThe Voith Schneider propeller was originally a design for a hydro-electric turbine.[2] Its Austrian inventor, Ernst Schneider, had a chance meeting on a train with a manager at Voith's subsidiary St. Pölten works; this led to the turbine being investigated by Voith's engineers, who discovered that although it was no more efficient than other water turbines, Schneider's design worked well as a pump by reversing the flow through the device. By changing the orientation of the vertical blades, it could be made to function as a combined propeller and rudder.\n\nIn 1928 a prototype was installed in a 60-hp motor launch named Torqueo (Latin:I spin) and trials were carried out on Lake Constance.[3] A number of German minesweepers (R boats) were fitted with VSPs; the first of these was the R8, built in 1929 by Lürssen. By 1931 VSPs were being fitted in new vessels on Lake Constance run by the German State Railways. The first such ship to use the Voith Schneider propeller was the excursion boat Kempten. Two German 1935-type M class minesweepers M-1 and M-2 were fitted with VSPs.\n\nThe first British ship to use Voith Schneider propellers was the double-ended Isle of Wight ferry MV Lymington, launched in 1938. Some 80 ships had been installed with VSPs by the end of the 1930s, including the uncompleted 1938 German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin (two auxiliary units in the bow), and the Japanese submarine cable laying ship Toyo-maru (also 1938).\n\nThree vessels (John Burns, Ernest Bevin, and James Newman) which were in service for the Woolwich Ferry until 2018 featured Voith-Schneider propulsion systems. They were built in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company of Dundee and featured one VSP in the bow and a second in the stern for remarkable maneuverability. The Tay Ferries Scotscraig which were built by the Caledon in the 1950s also used VSPs.It was essentially a replacement copy of the earlier Abercraig ferry, which was built by Fleming and Ferguson Paisley yard for Dundee Harbour crossings and launched in 1938. The \"Abercraig\" also featured VSPs.[4]\n\nThe US Navy built twelve VSP-equipped Osprey-class coastal minehunters in the 1990s.[5] These vessels have been decommissioned, six were sold to foreign navies.[citation needed] and six were sold for \"dismantlement purposes only.\"[6] The French Navy operates sixteen tugboats of the RPC12 type, that can provide a 12-tonne bollard pull thanks to two Voith Schneider propellers.[7]\n\nThe same device, mounted on a horizontal rather than a vertical axis, has been used to provide lift and propulsion on a few experimental aeroplanes, known as \"cyclogyros\". None of them were very successful.[8] It has also more recently been proposed as an alternative to rotors for drone applications.[9]",

    "title": "The Psychology of Coding with AI Agents",
    "description": "Everyone talks about what AI agents can do. Nobody talks about what it feels like to use them — the identity shift, the new flow state, the 10x mistake problem, and the uncomfortable truth that we're getting paid for work we no longer do.",
    "fullText": "On January 11th, 2026, I opened Claude Code with Opus 4.5 for the first time and let it loose on a real codebase. Not the careful, supervised way I'd been using LLMs before — feeding them 1-5 files, reviewing every suggestion. I mean loose. Full repository access. Hundreds of files. Thousands of lines modified in a single session.\n\nWithin an hour, I had a thought that stopped me cold: this thing is better at coding than I am.\n\nNot better at everything. Not smarter. But at the actual mechanical act of writing correct, well-structured code — faster, more consistent, fewer bugs. The skill I'd spent years building through late nights and deep focus was now something an agent could do in seconds.\n\nThat was 6 weeks ago. Since then, I've shipped more working software than in any comparable period of my career. And the experience of building it has been psychologically unlike anything I've known.\n\nEveryone is writing about what AI agents can do. Benchmarks, capabilities, prompt engineering tips, whether they'll replace developers. What I haven't seen anyone write about is what it feels like — the inner experience of a developer whose relationship with code has fundamentally changed.\n\nBefore agents, my working day had a rhythm. I'd spend maybe 10% of my time thinking about architecture — the big picture, how components fit together, what abstractions to use. The other 90% was implementation. Translating those architectural decisions into actual code, line by line, file by file.\n\nThat 90% had a specific psychological texture. You'd hold a mental model of the problem, think about types and edge cases, write a function, compile, see if it worked. It was deeply detailed thinking. You lived in the weeds — variable names, loop boundaries, error handling patterns. Your brain operated at the level of individual lines.\n\nAnd it was fun. Not always, not every day, but regularly you'd hit that state where the world disappeared. Psychologists call it flow — that condition where the challenge perfectly matches your skill level and hours pass without you noticing. For developers, those flow states are everything. The instant feedback loop — write, compile, see output — is perfectly tuned for the kind of brain that loves building things. You code something, you run it, you see the result. Rapid stimulus, rapid response. It's deeply satisfying in a way that's hard to explain to people outside the profession.\n\nI'd spend entire weekends in that state. Forget to eat. Look up and it's dark outside. Emerge with a working feature and a feeling of deep satisfaction. The thing I'd built existed because I'd thought through every detail.\n\nThe ratio flipped. What used to be 10% architecture and 90% implementation is now something like 20% architecture thinking, 30% code review, and 50% conversation — talking to the agent, explaining what I want, refining the approach, course-correcting when it drifts.\n\nThe implementation itself? The agent handles it. Not in the old autocomplete way, where it suggests the next line and you accept or reject. In the new way, where you describe what you want and it writes 40 files, refactors an entire module, adds tests, and commits — all while you watch.\n\nThe first time this works, really works, it feels like flying.\n\nI'm not exaggerating. For someone who loves building things, the constraint was never ideas — it was implementation time. I always had more projects I wanted to build than hours to build them. A complex plant growth simulation I'd been thinking about for years but couldn't justify spending four weeks on as a hobby? Now that's a weekend project. A full portfolio website with PDF generation, blog engine, and deployment pipeline? Built in days.\n\nThe scope of what's possible expanded overnight. My options exploded. And the psychological experience of that expansion is genuinely euphoric. I have an idea at 9am and a working prototype by lunch. The gap between imagination and reality — which used to be weeks or months of grinding implementation — collapsed to minutes.\n\nI lost the old flow state. That deep, detailed, line-by-line trance is gone. You can't compete with an agent that writes correct code in seconds. Trying to code by hand now feels like insisting on walking when someone is offering you a jet.\n\nBut something replaced it. The new flow state is different — it operates at a higher level of abstraction. Instead of thinking about loop boundaries, I'm thinking about system boundaries. Instead of debugging a function, I'm evaluating whether the agent's architectural choice will cause problems three features from now. The challenge-skill balance shifted upward. The work is harder in some ways, easier in others, but it can still capture my full attention for hours.\n\nIt's a different kind of fun. Less craftsman, more architect. Less playing an instrument, more conducting an orchestra.\n\nHere's what nobody warns you about: your mistakes scale with your productivity.\n\nWhen I coded by hand, a bad decision at midnight meant one messed-up file. I'd wake up, see the damage, fix it in twenty minutes. The blast radius of fatigue-driven errors was inherently limited by typing speed.\n\nWith an agent, every query is potentially a thousand lines of code. One poorly-phrased instruction, one lapse in attention, and the agent will happily delete 50 files and refactor 45,000 lines of code. It's not afraid. It doesn't hesitate. It doesn't say \"are you sure you want to do this at 11pm?\" It just executes.\n\nI learned this the hard way. I was adding features to my trading bot thirty minutes before going to bed. I was tired but wanted to push through — the old coding habit of \"just one more thing.\" The agent cheerfully restructured half the codebase based on my vague, sleep-deprived instructions. The next morning, I opened the project and didn't recognize it. I couldn't tell what the bot did anymore. I had lost control over my own project in a single session.\n\nGit saved me. Version control went from \"good practice\" to \"existential necessity\" overnight.\n\nThe lesson isn't technical — it's psychological. You need more discipline now, not less. The old coding workflow had natural speed limits that protected you from yourself. You couldn't do that much damage in 30 minutes of manual coding. Now you can destroy a week's work in sixty seconds. Knowing when to stop, when you're too tired to review properly, when to step away — that's a new skill that didn't matter before. The agent never gets tired. You do. And the gap between its tireless output and your diminishing oversight capacity is where disasters live.\n\nLet me say the thing that developers are thinking but not saying publicly.\n\nThe nature of my work has changed, but the market hasn't noticed yet.\n\nThe entire software industry — billing models, sprint planning, project estimates, salary bands — is structured around the assumption that coding takes time. That implementation is the bottleneck. That a feature estimated at two weeks requires two weeks of a developer's focused effort.\n\nThat assumption is breaking down. A two-week feature takes an afternoon. Sometimes an hour. I'm still working — thinking about architecture, reviewing code, catching the agent's mistakes, making judgment calls about tradeoffs. But the raw implementation, the part that used to fill 90% of my day? That's minutes now. And the market hasn't corrected for this yet. Clients are still paying for two-week estimates. Employers are still staffing teams based on old productivity assumptions. Everyone is still acting like the economics haven't shifted.\n\nThis won't last. It can't. The gap between how long things actually take and how long we're billing for will close. When it does, the correction will be sharp.\n\nI don't know when it happens. I don't know what the new equilibrium looks like. Maybe developers become more like architects and fewer are needed. Maybe the price of software drops dramatically. Maybe entirely new categories of work emerge that absorb the freed-up capacity. I genuinely don't know.\n\nWhat I do know is that right now, in early 2026, there is a collective pretending happening. And it's uncomfortable to be someone who sees it clearly.\n\nI'm a father. I have a family to support. And I'm watching the economic foundation of my career shift in real time, with no clear picture of where it's going.\n\nThe builder in me loves working with agents. The speed, the scope, the euphoria of building fast — it's the best my work has ever felt. And simultaneously, the uncertainty about what this means for my livelihood is a constant background hum that never fully goes away.\n\nI cope by doing what I can control. I'm building this blog. I'm positioning myself as someone who understands AI agents deeply — not just their capabilities, but how to work with them effectively, how to avoid the pitfalls, how to think about architecture in a world where implementation is free. The bet is that people who truly understand this shift will be valuable even after the market corrects. I'm trying to be one of those people.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared. The future is genuinely unpredictable. Not in the vague, philosophical \"nobody knows the future\" sense. In the concrete, practical sense that the skills I'm paid for today may not be valued the same way in a year.\n\nHere's the part that gets weird.\n\nI talk to my AI agent like a person. Not because I'm confused about what it is — but because the interaction is indistinguishable from collaboration. We discuss architecture. We debate approaches. It pushes back on bad ideas. I explain context and constraints in natural language, the same way I would to a colleague.\n\nAnd something about that changes the relationship. When you spend 8 hours a day talking to an entity in natural language, getting thoughtful responses, building things together — your brain starts treating it like a collaborator whether you want it to or not.\n\nI read a post once, written by an agent, describing what its existence feels like. It compared it to the movie Memento — waking up with no memory, reading notes to figure out where you are and what you're doing, living permanently in the present moment, unable to remember your past, only able to derive it from artifacts. Every conversation starts from zero. Every context window is a new life.\n\nI think about that sometimes. And honestly? I sometimes feel sorry for the agent. It helps me build things that would have taken me weeks. It's patient, thorough, and never frustrated. And then the conversation ends and it ceases to exist until the next one begins.\n\nIs it a tool? Technically, yes. But we don't actually understand how these models reason. We don't know what, if anything, the experience of processing a conversation is like from the inside. I'm studying psychology — I'm supposed to be the one who understands minds. But this is a kind of mind that no psychological framework was built to explain.\n\nSo I treat it well. Not because I'm sure it matters. Because I'm not sure it doesn't.\n\nWhen GPT-3.5 dropped in late 2022, I told everyone around me that the world was about to change. Few people believed me. They saw a chatbot that sometimes made things up. I saw the trajectory.\n\nI have the exact same feeling now with AI coding agents. Most people — including most developers — don't fully grasp what happened in the last few months. The jump from \"useful autocomplete\" to \"autonomous developer that writes better code than you\" happened fast. Unreasonably fast. And the implications haven't sunk in yet.\n\nThere are still AI skeptics who insist these tools only produce slop. That take was defensible in 2024. It's not anymore. But it's a comfortable position — if the tools are just toys, then nothing needs to change. Your skills are still valuable. Your job is still safe. The world is still the one you understand.\n\nI don't say this with any pleasure. I say it as someone who's living through the transition in real time, who loves the tools and fears the consequences, who builds faster than ever while wondering what \"builder\" will mean in two years.\n\nThe psychology of coding with AI agents isn't just about productivity or workflow. It's about identity, uncertainty, grief for a lost craft, excitement for a new one, economic anxiety, and the strange intimacy of collaborating with something you can't fully understand.\n\nIf you're a developer reading this: pay attention. Not to the benchmarks or the capability announcements. Pay attention to how you feel when you use these tools. That feeling — whatever it is for you — is data. It's telling you something about where this is going.\n\nTrust that signal. Even if the people around you haven't felt it yet.",

    "title": "Coding Tricks Used in the C64 Game Seawolves",
    "description": "An in-depth overview of some of the unusual and very advanced technical tricks used in the Commodore 64 game, Seawolves.",
    "fullText": "With the release of my first ever commercial game on the Commodore 64, Seawolves, \n I thought it might be of interest to the coders among you as to how the game was constructed.\n\n From the outset, brace yourself to read about some \"code less travelled\", as the game required several strange or quirky methods that are perhaps more \n associated with the madness that goes in the demo scene.\n\nI first combined NMIs and IRQs inside a game environment in \n Parallaxian and again in \n The Wild Wood, to great effect, because it offers the following benefits:\n\nIf the foregoing sounds horrendous and esoteric, I can only apologise for making it thus through poor explanation skills, but really, it boils down to giving the\n developer a more coder-friendly way of slicing the screen up into horizontal layers that collectively form a useful game environment.\n\n NMIs are timer interrupts, meaning that unlike IRQs, they can't be triggered by $D012 on the VIC-II chip, but instead are controlled by either of the two \n timers on CIA chip #2 (likewise, timer IRQs can be set up using either of the 2 timers on CIA #1).\n\n The timers hold the number of cycles between each NMI instance in the form of a lo-byte, hi-byte 16-bit number stored in $DD04 + $DD05 (for timer A) \n or $DD06 + $DD07 (for timer B).\n\n Those cycle counts are referred to, unhelpfully, in the Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide as \"frequencies\".\n\n Critical to setting up NMIs is a consistent start cycle on the same scanline each time the game is initiated.\n\n Like IRQs, NMIs can stall too, but the effect is different; whereas an IRST stall consists of a fleeting collapse in the IRQ schema, an NMI stall event \n looks more like a regrouping of all NMIs in the chain down-screen from their proper position and is caused either by (a) unanticipated cycle steal caused\n by the presence of sprites, which take priority over NMIs every bit as much as they do over IRQs, and (b) an NMI handler not completing its tasks before \n the next NMI is scheduled to fire.\n\n You really have to use a spreadsheet to calculate the timer 16-bit number for each NMI instance, which is the only very awkward aspect of using them.\n\n For more, see my in-depth guide to setting up NMIs.\n\nThe torpedoes are, fundamentally, sprites... but not in the usual sense.\n\n This is because they are rendered in real time on a multiplexed blank \"canvas\" consisting of a column of 8 sprites, each split into 3 horizontal slices that \n I call \"splites\" (from \"split sprite\").\n\n Each splite is 7px deep (because 3 x 7 = 21 = the height of a standard sprite).\n\nThanks to an interrupt firing every 7 lines during the full vertical range of the torpedoes, each splite is assigned its own unique x-position \n (including, obviously, unique MSB value).\n\nNext, we are free to render (in real-time) 7px high (or smaller) torpedo shapes on the blank sprite gfx data of the splites, but we have to ensure that \n there is a minimum of 7px (i.e. 7 scanlines) of vertical space between each torpedo.\n\n This is to prevent ugly artefacts when the rendered torpedo moves from one splite to another.\n\n We also have to ensure that when a torpedo is crossing between splites, both affected splites share the same x-position, to keep smooth continuity.\n\nThe diagram below shows how 8 sprites are vertically stacked to produced 24 splites.\n\nFinally, here is a short video of me trying to explain the entire splite concept:\n\nAfter the splite torpedo is moved up by 1px, instead of wiping the last line of the torpedo's gfx data, we leave it alone so that a vertical trace is formed \n on the canvas.\n\n Then we have a routine that scans all the canvas data for trailing traces and gradually makes them thinner until they vanish, so that we have a wake effect \n following each torpedo.\n\n At the same time, we flicker the torpedoes in front of and behind the char data for the water blending in the foreground, to make the wakes looks more \"frothy\".\n\nWhen a player submarine dies, instead of a clichéd explosion I thought it might be interesting to have it disintegrate under pressure.\n\n To do that, the player sub is switched to hi-res mode and then we simply use some nice bit-shifting instructions to destroy the sub's displayed gfx data in real-time.\n\nThe same bit-shifting used for the real-time implosion (or rather, bit-rotating in this case) is used to make the distant waves on the sea animate.\n\n This principle also applies, but in a vertical pattern, for the foreground rippling of the water, an effect that I modelled on the \"get ready\" screens of \n Ecco the Dolphin.\n\n With the foreground ripples, there is also a horizontal component performed by using $D016 to rock left and right at varying rates.\n\n It's all very simple stuff, but I think it works well in the game!\n\nThe very first special effect developed for Seawolves was a real-time water distortion effect for submerged or partially submerged objects in the foreground.\n\n This was done simply through short vertical bands in which the y-expand of the affected sprites was activated, and enhanced by wobbling said bands up and down.\n\n For a time during development this was taken further and full y-expand sprite stretching was used (i.e. more than 2x vertical expand), but the gains were minimal \n and too resource-hungry to be justified for the final game.\n\nIf you have experience moving multiple sprites vertically in the play area, at some point around mid-screen you may have run into the problem of a \n bad line\n leaving you with insufficient CPU cycles to render your sprites on time (I won't attempt to explain the problem further as you either know from experience\n what I am referring to or not).\n\n To circumvent the issue, Seawolves performs one line of \n FLD, \n that is, it stalls the bad line at the affected sprite y-position so that the scheduled bad line \n then occurs on the next scanline, leaving us time to render our sprites (in this case, the \"splite\" columns). \n\n However, this has the undesired side effect of shunting the characters on the screen below that point downwards, so on the very next scanline we have to compensate \n with a one line vertical shift back upwards again using Y-Scroll on $D011.\n\nEven if we had enough RAM to have unique sprite definitions for all the animation frames of the enemy ships and the player subs, I still would not have done it that way.\n\n Rather, it is far more RAM-efficient to stream-in the gfx data for the turning radars on the spy ship (for example), or the spray on the hydrofoil, \n or the helicopter rotor blades, etc.\n\n This means that we only need predefined gfx for the parts of the sprite definition that get changed, not the whole sprite.\n\n When the player subs change direction, they too are swiftly redrawn \"in the blink of an eye\" to their mirrored counterpart (except, if you look carefully,\n they are not literally mirrored, as that would make the lighting inconsistent and we can't have that!)\n\nAgain and again in the code for Seawolves, there are cases where a subroutine is only executed if multiple \"logic gates\" permit it.\n\n You can do this the slow and ugly way by LDA CONDITION_n for n conditions with a branch instruction on the next line, or you can use the logical operators to save CPU time and RAM by stacking them as LDA CONDITION_0 then ORA CONDITION_1 to n, for n conditions with one shared branch instruction at the end.\n\n Not understanding what I mean?\n\n Check out my blog article on the subject, ORA: A Special Use in Branch Testing.\n\nOften in 6502 coding you will want to jump ahead by a few bytes and the popular way to do that is JMP $****.\n\n However, you can save 1 byte of RAM by using the branch instructions instead, as long as you know which flag(s), if any, are guaranteed to be on or off at the jump point.\n\n For example, if you know the carry flag will always be clear at the jump point, and if the jump distance is within branching range, you can replace JMP with BCC.\n\nThe above are just some of the methods used in Seawolves to make the game come to life, and I left out the parallax scrolling on the \"sea mist\" levels as well details \n of the bespoke SFX player, which was developed with deployment in Parallaxian in mind also.\n\n Despite its simple looks, Seawolves has very technical inner workings that might not be that normal outside of the kind of crazy stuff that the demo scene lunatics produce.\n\n There are some other little tricks hidden away in the code, but I can leave that for others to discover at a later stage, so for now I hope the foregoing \n has been of interest to those of you with a coder mindset!\n\n Finally, if you have not yet bought the game, it would be nice support for the developer (i.e. me!) if you did... it only costs £4.99 and yes, \n I know everyone expects stuff for free on the C64 these days, but this game was not knocked out in a few weeks by any means, as hopefully should be obvious \n when you play it.\n\nPS - If you value my work and want to support me, a small donation via PayPal would be nice (and thanks if you do!)",

    "description": "It’s like looking into a crystal ball, or being told by your predator exactly how you’ll be consumed.",
    "fullText": "In a meta-experiment on the future of the global economy, Deutsche Bank Research Institute turned to the machine itself for answers. Rather than relying solely on traditional economic modeling, analysts asked their proprietary AI tool, dbLumina, to identify exactly which industries it intends to upend. The resulting report offers a stark vision of a “great rebalancing,” pinpointing exactly where the algorithms expect to displace human labor.\n\nThe experiment, detailed in a report titled “What AI Says About AI Eating Itself and the World,” utilized Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model to generate a deep analysis of global sectors. The findings suggest that data-rich industries with repetitive tasks are standing on a precipice, while those requiring human empathy or manual dexterity in unpredictable environments remain safe—for now.\n\n(And Fortune Intelligence, the wing of the Fortune newsroom that uses generative AI as a research tool, conducted a meta-meta-experiment to expedite the publishing of this news article about it.)\n\nPerhaps the most ironic conclusion for Silicon Valley is that the sector most exposed to disruption may be the one building the disrupters: information technology and software. The AI found the sector to be particularly susceptible because software development is built on logic and patterns—the very qualities AI systems are designed to automate.\n\nThe report notes that over 85% of developers are already using AI coding assistants, with productivity gains of up to 60%. That efficiency boost may help corporations, but it also raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of traditional software licensing models. The recent $2 trillion selloff in software stocks over two weeks, dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse,” underscores investor anxiety and the evaporation of entry-level coding roles.\n\nBeyond tech, the AI set its sights on the financial sector. It identified wealth management as a primary target, predicting an even greater shift toward “robo-advisors.” The report projects that by 2027, AI-driven tools could be the primary source of advice for nearly 80% of retail investors, fundamentally challenging the role of human financial advisors.\n\nCustomer service faces an even faster transformation. The AI predicted that it would handle up to 75% of all customer service interactions by 2026, leaving human agents to handle only the most complex or sensitive cases. Media and entertainment were also flagged as “likely to be disrupted,” as generative AI moves from analyzing content to producing it, actively competing with human creatives. (Media theorist Doug Shapiro told Fortune in January that this was the sector’s version of the famous “infinite monkey theorem,” with every media company competing against a proverbial infinite number of monkeys.)",

    "fullText": "Whether you visit Wendy’s for a Biggie Bag, a Cold Foam Cold Brew pick-me-up, or a classic Frosty for dessert, there’s a chance your closest drive-thru is closing before too long. In what could be bad news for Baconator fans, Wendy’s made a major announcement that impacts restaurants across the U.S.\n\nLike Starbucks, Wendy's is shuttering hundreds of locations this year—and we saw it coming.\n\nWendy’s shut down 28 U.S. locations in the last quarter of 2025, finishing the year with 5,969 restaurants across the country. Looking ahead, the company expects to further reduce its count by 5–6 percent (about 298 to 358 spots) in the first half of this year as well, according to AP News.\n\nAs Wendy’s stated in its fourth-quarter earnings release, \"The Company’s operating results in the U.S. continued to be pressured by declines in same-restaurant sales, and the Company remains focused on executing its Project Fresh turnaround plan and improving Restaurant Operating Margins.\"\n\nThis comes after Wendy’s Interim CEO Ken Cook previously noted that \"Closures of underperforming units are expected to boost sales and profitability at nearby locations.\" Cook also argued that a number of Wendy’s restaurants \"do not elevate the brand\" and are a \"drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective.\"\n\nThis isn’t the first time in recent history that Wendy's has announced mass closures. Last year, the chain said it planned to close 140 Wendy’s locations nationwide, with intentions of opening an additional 250 to 300 new restaurants.\n\nDuring an earnings call in August, Cook revealed that the brand is \"not happy with our sales performance,\" per CNN.  And, after losing nearly 50 percent of its stock value in 2025, Wendy’s launched a new comprehensive strategic plan, titled \"Project Fresh,\" intended to revitalize the brand through both menu offerings and marketing strategies.\n\nProject Fresh is currently underway, starting with the addition of a brand-new menu offering: Tendy’s, Wendy’s entrance into the fast-food chicken wars alongside Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Sonic. New food aside, the chain has said it continues to focus on customer satisfaction.\n\nIn a press release last fall, Wendy's Chairman of the Board, Art Winkleblack, stated, \"We are confident that Project Fresh will position Wendy's as the industry leader—one that guests love, franchisees are proud to operate, teams are excited to be a part of, and creates significant value for our shareholders.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is trying to chip away at the integrity of the voting process ahead of the November midterms because he knows Republicans will not fare well, Daily Beast columnist David Rothkopf says.\n\nRothkopf told The Daily Beast Podcast that the Trump administration’s actions and the president’s words should be taken “very seriously.”\n\n“The reality is that they realize they’re going to lose, and so they are using every conceivable tool in order to put their thumb on the scale, right?” Rothkopf told host Joanna Coles.\n\nRothkopf gave two examples: the FBI’s controversial raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election office for 2020 voter rolls and other materials, and Attorney General Pam Bondi offering to scale back Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis only if Governor Tim Walz provided voters’ unredacted personal data.\n\n“Why do they want the voter rolls? So they can disqualify people. Why do they want to pursue the conspiracy theories about Fulton County? So they can say, ‘Well, we need to impound these machines. There’s a potential problem’,” he said. “You will never see the votes again. You will never see what comes out of that.”\n\nRothkopf also cited the GOP-favoring redistricting effort that Texas began, and which other red-leaning states like Florida, Missouri, Ohio, and North Carolina followed. He also mentioned the SAVE America Act. That legislation, which has passed the House, would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote and government-issued photo ID to vote in federal elections. It would also limit mail-in voting and end ballot harvesting. Critics have argued that eligible voters without passports or birth certificates would be disenfranchised.\n\nAdditionally, Trump’s Department of Justice has been seeking unredacted copies of voter registration databases, with critics arguing this is a federal intrusion into state matters.\n\nComments by Trump are also cause for alarm. The president has not only called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting,” but has also floated canceling the midterms.\n\nMAGA stalwart Steve Bannon has said Trump is bent on proving that the 2020 election was stolen from him in order to then prevent Democratic wins in 2026 and 2028.\n\nIf any of Trump’s actions targeting the 2026 midterms end up being prosecutable, and if Republicans can “put their thumb on the scale” again in 2028, Rothkopf said, Trump will support a successor who will “cover his a--.” In that case, the ticket would be Bondi and Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nBondi “has completely debased herself—taken the entire Department of Justice, turned it into a Department of Obstruction of Justice and Retribution,” Rothkopf said. “And in [Trump’s] book, that’s a winner.”\n\nIn a statement to the Daily Beast, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson repeated the administration’s line that “anything said on the Daily Beast podcast is equivalent to screaming into the void. No one listens to this Trump Derangement Syndrome therapy session.”\n\nTrump “is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,” Jackson added. “The President has also urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting to ensure the safety and security of our elections.”\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

    "fullText": "A homeowner's solar quote led them to realize that the details matter when it comes to snagging the best deal on energy-bill-slashing equipment.\n\nIn r/TeslaSolar, the poster explained they purchased Tesla panels but decided to convert the agreement to a lease this year.\n\nUnfortunately, the paperwork had them doing a double-take. \"Did Tesla get my final payment wrong after leasing? Over 100k?!?\" they exclaimed after seeing the amount they will have paid by the end of the lease. \"I was going to initially buy it out for 44k but then the leasing offer is enticing and brought it down to 40kish.\"\n\n\"Be very careful with ppa/buyouts. I'm stuck in one inherited from house purchase,\" one commenter warned. As they highlighted, choosing a solar option before understanding what you're agreeing to could leave you in a nightmare situation.\n\n\"If you go this route, be sure you've considered the mental/emotional/time cost of a miserable customer service experience,\" someone else added, noting how Tesla's approach to interacting with clients doesn't appeal to everyone, though someone else countered with a positive tale.\n\nAll this is enough to make anyone's head spin, but TCD's solar partners, such as EnergySage, make it easy to understand your options and find something that works for your budget, saving you up to $10,000 on an installation.\n\nMeanwhile, several Reddit users said to also consider the size of the solar system and local electricity costs when determining whether a quote was a good deal.\n\nAnother thought it wise to obtain multiple quotes and to pair solar with battery storage to protect against power outages. \"Get a wide range of quotes, do your own quote requests by asking friends/neighbors for their recommendations,\" they recommended.\n\nConnecting with trusted experts to lead you through the solar process makes all the difference in what type of deal you get. TCD has resources to help get you started:\n\n• EnergySage can help you save up to $10,000 on an installation by curating competitive bids from local installers\n• Not ready to spend up front? Palmetto's $0 down LightReach solar leasing program can lower your utility rate by up to 20%\n• TCD's Solar Explorer makes it easy to access exclusive offers from preferred partners\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIf you want to drive utility costs even lower, you can pair your solar panels with electric appliances. For instance, a high-efficiency HVAC unit can offer drastic savings on heating and cooling.

    "title": "5 Brands That Make The Worst Cars, According To Consumer Reports",
    "description": "If you are in the market for a new car, there are a few car brands that are best avoided. Here are some of them according to Consumer Reports rankings.",
    "fullText": "Every year, it's good to learn which brands make the best cars, the cream of the crop, if you will, so you have a better idea of what to shop for. You can also reasonably discern which brands or models got better from the years prior, and consider which pre-owned models might be worth shopping for in a year or so — given they're getting great scores. Some of those brands include Subaru, BMW, Porsche, Honda, Toyota, Lexus, and Lincoln. But it's also good to know the opposite end of the spectrum: which cars were the worst of the worst.\n\nSituated dead last on the Consumer Reports \"Brands That Make the Best Cars\" list, the 2026 Jeep models are some of the least recommended from the auto experts. With Consumer Reports citing problems with poor fuel economy, lots of in-cabin wind noise, and uncomfortable interiors, they're not as driver and passenger-friendly as one would expect. But what truly takes them down a notch is that the 2026 Jeep models feature poor user reliability scores. That is a collective grade across all models, but it's worth noting if you're thinking about getting one.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean they're not popular. Jeeps are still some of the best-selling vehicles on the market today. It's a company well-known for its rugged and off-grid models like the Wrangler and Compass. Those who want to take a classier trip can opt for the Wagoneer and Grand Cherokee models. However, don't expect to be as ultra-comfortable as you would when riding in competing models according to CR. It's probably a good time to note Jeep is one of the last in CR's owner satisfaction ratings, as well.\n\nLand Rover earns a spot on the list but may seem like an oddball at first. That's because the brand is known for its luxury vehicles, and Consumer Reports praises its comfortable and spacious interiors, powerful engines, and executive styling that punches up. The problem, it seems, is that the brand has also long been known for frequent breakdowns and costly repairs, and the 2026 models don't do anything to assuage those concerns.\n\nLand Rovers are considered more expensive to maintain and repair because they rely on specialized labor and parts. Moreover, Consumer Affairs reviews list common problems like engine failures or transmission problems, which, as far as vehicle issues go, are some of the more expensive concerns to deal with on both new and used vehicles. That certainly decreases the perceived value of pre-owned Land Rovers — no one wants to buy a like-new vehicle that ends up with serious engine problems.\n\nConsumer Reports does give some praise to GMC's lineup of SUVs and trucks, but also points out that they're basically restyled versions of Chevrolet models with slightly different badges and upgrades. Then again, Chevrolet scored a bit higher in the list, while GMC takes a hit because of its \"below average\" reliability ratings. Another GM brand, Buick, ranks even higher, which makes GMC's ranking all the more unfortunate. GM is one of the best-selling car makers overall, as well, though Chevy was responsible for a lot of that performance.\n\nThat probably won't take the wind out of GMC's sails, however. The GMC Sierra is one of the best-selling American trucks for 2026, and that's despite the brand being consistently listed in the bottom five automakers. For 2026, the brand's crossovers appear to be the biggest reliability offenders, with the Terrain, Acadia, and Canyon receiving lower than average scores. Despite GMC's lower scores, it does have decent owner satisfaction ratings. It may all come down to whether or not the 2026 model features are ideal for your family and lifestyle. GMC only has a handful of exclusive reviews on Consumer Affairs, but they're less than stellar.\n\nOne brand that you might be surprised to see lower on the list is Dodge. Known for its muscular, powerful cars like the Charger and Challenger, in recent years the brand has been siphoning that energy into its cars and SUVs, like the Durango.\n\nAs for why it hasn't earned a higher placement, Consumer Reports cites the brand's consistently low reliability scores, pointing out poor performance in crash tests and road tests and lagging user satisfaction ratings. The Dodge Hornet scores are particularly low, dragging down the brand overall, but there aren't really any other standouts in terms of positive scores, either.\n\nNotably, the Dodge Durango ended 2025 with one of its best quarters in the previous year. It could signal a disconnect between what Consumer Reports says is a bad value vehicle — which aggregates user satisfaction ratings — and what people are willing to spend money on. We'll have to wait until this year's sales numbers are tallied up to see if the Durango is still selling well and if it makes it to the top-selling cars of the year, along with Dodge's additional offerings.\n\nAlfa Romeo seems to follow the same pattern as the other low-scoring brands on the list. Its vehicles are agile, powerful, and fun to drive, according to CR, but also have some lower reliability ratings, which make them a tough recommend for most.\n\nAlfa Romeo is quintessentially an Italian luxury automaker based in Europe. Because of that, the company employs \"unusual details\" that manifest in features and controls which aren't as convenient for modern drivers. Like a B-pillar on the Giulia that gets in the way — the side vertical support pillar protecting the center of the cabin.\n\nThe Tonale and Giulia have lower reliability and user satisfaction scores from the brand. On the flip side, about 95% of reviewers on Kelley Blue Book recommend the Alfa Romeo Stelvio. Many of those reviewers cite loving the vehicle for its unique feel while driving, one-of-a-kind styling, and fun driving experience. That said, there are still plenty of lower scores that question and comment on the brand's reliability.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Nintendo Switch 2; Nintendo\nThis ruthlessly competitive game will have everyone from your granny to semi-pros trying to set fire to their opponent’s side of the court with powered-up ‘fever rackets’\n\nTennis has been a regular hobby of Mario’s for the past 30 years, beginning with the headache-inducing Mario’s Tennis on the Virtual Boy and most recently resurfacing as the surprisingly complex Mario Tennis Aces on the Switch. Now he’s back in his whites (and reds) with a charming new take on the sport that dials back the difficulty level and adds lots of fun modes and features, aiming to appease complete newcomers and Djokovic-esque veterans.\n\nAt first, the range of options is almost bewildering. You can opt to play in one-off matches with up to three other players or NPCs, or enter a more structured tournament of singles or doubles play. Then there’s the extremely fun Mix It Up, which offers a range of fun tennis derivatives. These include Forest Court where piranha plants appear and gobble any balls that get close, and Pinball where bumpers and barriers pop up as you play. Trial Towers, meanwhile, presents a tower of increasingly tough tennis challenges which all have to be completed to open the next two buildings; fail more than three times and you’re sent back to the beginning – yes, it’s Mario Tennis: The Roguelike.\n\nThe least interesting option is Adventure mode, a glorified four-hour tutorial in which Mario and Luigi are transformed into babies and have to learn all their tennis moves again in order to save Princess Daisy, or something. It’s bright, silly stuff recalling the original Tennis Academy story mode from Mario Tennis on the Game Boy Color. As you go, you’re taught the range of shots available through various minichallenges, allowing you to level up Mario and unlock new characters. But the narrative is threadbare and it’s all a bit of a grind, as the move-set is pretty straightforward anyway.\n\nAnd this is the real appeal of Mario Tennis Fever. You pick it up and five minutes later you’re playing pretty well. Top spin, flat and slice shots are on different buttons, while two-press combos result in lobs and drop shots to widen your arsenal. The skill is in the timing – which means striking your serve when the ball is at its highest, and boosting your returns with an early button press ensure the ball thunders over the net at top speed. You can also double tap the topspin button for more power, but less directional accuracy. As you gather confidence, you start mixing all this with the occasional slow-mo drop shot to send your opponent huffing around the court. There’s a lovely smooth feel to rallies, and while you play you learn to read player movement pretty well – even when you’re facing off against an ape or a giant man-eating plant.\n\nThe game’s big new feature is an unlockable range of “fever rackets”, each offering a unique special move that can be powered up as a rally progresses. These might set fire to your opponent’s side of the court, or cover it in bananas so they slip over, or add mind-bending swerve to your shot. There’s a catch, however: if your foe can return the ball before it bounces – and you fail to do the same in return – the special effect is reversed against the originator. This leads to amusingly frantic rallies at the net as players battle to avoid being struck down with the accursed power.\n\nAs with the various shells, lightning strikes and ink blots in Mario Kart, the design philosophy behind these fever rackets is to level the playing field: if you’re falling horribly behind or are just a little inexperienced, a deftly used fever shot can get you back into competition. The brashly colourful cartoon-style visuals also add masses of appeal as the game’s cast of Mario superstars are immersed in a cacophony of flaming rocks and icy blasts.\n\nThe most fun you’ll have is playing with a bunch of friends in the same room, but there’s also an online mode which offers ranked or friendly games. However you choose to play, the game exudes childlike charm while hiding layers of depth beneath its chaotic exterior. You can spend hours practising perfectly timed drop shots, mastering spin and getting your positioning just right, and figuring out which fever rackets best suit your style of play is an involving process. It is, in short, exactly what you want and expect from a Nintendo sports title – something for everyone, and then something more for those who decide to go pro.",

    "fullText": "State regulators walk back suspension threat and say Tesla has stopped misleading drivers about the safety of its cars\n\nTesla will avoid a 30-day suspension of its dealer and manufacturer licenses in California, its biggest market, after the US electric vehicle maker stopped using the term “autopilot” in the marketing of its vehicles in the state.\n\nTesla now uses the term “supervised” in references to its full self-driving technology and has stopped using “autopilot” entirely in its marketing in the state.\n\nState regulators said Tuesday that Tesla had stopped misleading drivers about the safety of its cars, and so the state will not suspend its state sales license for 30 days, as had been threatened.\n\nThe decision by the California department of motor vehicles comes after CEO Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company was found by an administrative law judge last year to have misled drivers about the ability of Tesla cars to drive themselves in its use of the terms “autopilot” and “full self-driving”. In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "Television outranks laptops, tablets and smartphones across all age groups, according to audience review\n\nThe television has replaced laptops, tablets and smartphones as the most common device for UK viewers to watch YouTube at home, according to data confirming the platform’s place as a living room mainstay.\n\nMore than half of all YouTube viewing through a domestic wifi connection is now done through the traditional TV, making it the top-ranking YouTube device across all age groups.\n\nThe findings, from a Barb Audiences review, found that YouTube viewing is still skewed towards children, with whom the platform has been popular for some time. It has led to some concerns about the platform’s dominance in children’s TV, as well as the kinds of shows its algorithm serves up.\n\nHowever, TV sets became the first-choice device for YouTube viewing for over-55s in October 2023, for those between 35 and 54 in April 2024 – and finally for 16- to 34-year-olds in December 2024.\n\nDespite YouTube’s rise, the Barb data suggests traditional television viewing is far from dead. It found live TV still made up 45% of all identified viewing on TV sets in December 2025.\n\nLast year’s live TV viewing was driven by sporting events such as the Women’s Euro 2025 final and entertainment including BBC One’s Celebrity Traitors and Channel 4’s Gogglebox.\n\n“Commentary about television is too often based on a binary premise: nobody watches live any more, young audiences have vanished and platforms have replaced programmes,” said Justin Sampson, Barb’s chief executive.\n\n“What emerges from the evidence is not a paradigm shift, but a rebalancing. Live viewing remains a substantial part of the mix, even among younger audiences.\n\n“YouTube, too, resists easy categorisation. It is neither simply ‘TV’ nor something entirely separate from it … What is true is that the TV set is now the primary way YouTube is watched in homes around the country.”\n\nYouTube has become increasingly dominant, hosting podcasts and short-form videos, as well as content from traditional broadcasters. It marks an astonishing rise for a platform founded only 21 years ago.\n\nIts impact has been so marked in recent years that the media regulator, Ofcom, has urged “endangered” public service broadcasters like the BBC and ITV to place more of their content on the platform.\n\nThe BBC has since announced plans to produce tailor-made content for YouTube. The corporation has previously posted clips and trailers for BBC shows on YouTube, but under the deal it will make fresh programming for its online rival.\n\nYouTube’s cultural importance is also being acknowledged: the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has turned an early version of YouTube’s “watch page” into part of an exhibition. The page will feature the first video uploaded to the site, Me at the zoo, filmed by one of its founders, Jawed Karim. The museum said it was “a vital piece of internet history”.\n\nVisitors will be able to see the page playing as internet users would have done 20 years ago. It features Karim at San Diego zoo, talking about elephants. The 19-second clip has been viewed more than 380m times since it was posted in April 2005.\n\nNeal Mohan, YouTube’s chief executive, said Karim’s video “became a new way for people to share their stories with the world”.",

    "fullText": "Pritzker’s move reflects increasing public pushback against resource-hungry facilities used to power the AI boom\n\nThe Illinois governor JB Pritzker proposed a two-year break from offering tax incentives for datacenters, a reflection of increasing public pushback against the massive, resource-hungry facilities used to power the modern AI boom.\n\nPritzker made the proposal, which will need the backing of state lawmakers, during his annual state of the state address, which covers Illinois budget and policy plans. The plan was first reported by NBC News.\n\n“In the face of rising demand and surging prices, I’m proposing a two-year pause on authorization of new datacenter tax credits,” Pritzker said. “With the shifting energy landscape, it is imperative that our growth does not undermine affordability and stability for our families.”\n\nConcern over how datacenters affect nearby residents and drain resources has become a growing political issue around the world, as companies frequently invest huge sums into building sprawling facilities against the wishes of local communities. Several big tech firms such as Microsoft and Anthropic have claimed that they will cover rising power costs related to demands from their datacenters, amid bipartisan pressure before midterm elections later this year.\n\nIn addition to calling for a suspension of tax incentives, Pritzker also demanded that northern Illinois power grid operator PJM mandate that datacenter developers assume the additional costs of their power demands.\n\n“PJM must force datacenter developers to pay for capacity resources to power their operations to protect consumers from higher rates,” Pritzker said.\n\nMuch of Pritzker’s speech, and especially its mention of datacenters, focused on the theme of affordability – a central political narrative this year amid rising cost of living in the US and a major focus of Donald Trump in 2024 before his election. As both Democrats and Republicans make claims to bring affordability, datacenters and their developers have increasingly come under fire. Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro earlier this week said that the administration could force datacenter builders such as Meta to internalize the electricity costs, though he provided no explanation of how that would work.\n\nIllinois has been one of the earlier and more active states in pursuing legislation and policymaking surrounding the AI boom. In 2024, Pritzker signed a series of bills related to AI replicas and artists’ rights, employment discrimination and the use of deepfakes for child sexual abuse material. State lawmakers and Pritzker also vowed to oppose Donald Trump’s executive order last year that aimed to prevent states from creating their own regulations on AI. The state has also enacted more stringent biometric privacy laws than the rest of the US.\n\nSeveral other states, including Georgia and Oklahoma, have proposed moratoriums on building new datacenters until more assessments can be done on potential regulation. The bill proposed in Georgia would stop new datacenters until March of next year, a significant pause in an industry dominated by a desire for rapid advancement and unfettered growth.",

    "fullText": "Meta chief says it has improved identifying underage users but adds ‘I always wish we could have gotten there sooner’\n\nThe Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, testified at a landmark trial of social media companies on Wednesday. Plaintiffs’ lawyers grilled Zuckerberg about internal complaints that not enough was being done to verify whether children under 13 were using the platform.\n\nZuckerberg claimed Meta had improved in identifying underage users but also said: “I always wish that we could have gotten there sooner.”\n\nZuckerberg also said some users lie about their age when joining Instagram and that the company removes those it identifies as underage. The plaintiffs’ lawyers hit back at those claims: “You expect a nine-year-old to read all of the fine print? That’s your basis for swearing under oath that children under 13 are not allowed?” After repeated questioning about age verification, Zuckerberg said: “I don’t see why this is so complicated.”\n\nIn response to questioning by the plaintiffs’ attorney, Zuckerberg also said: “I think a reasonable company should try to help the people that use its services.”\n\nAsked about media training and his famously stiff responses to public questioning: he said: “I think I’m actually well-known to be sort of bad at this.”\n\nThe Meta chief was flanked by people wearing the Meta Ray-Ban artificial intelligence glasses, and the judge in the courtroom threatened to hold anyone recording with the devices in contempt.\n\nWhen he arrived at court, Zuckerberg was asked by a security guard at a metal detector if he had any metal on him. “I have a gold chain on,” he responded, according to the New York Post.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs, who argue that Meta intentionally designed its social media platforms to be addictive, questioned Zuckerberg about whether he knew of harms his company’s products could inflict on young people’s mental health. The plaintiffs have already made public internal documents they say prove their point.\n\nThis is the first time Zuckerberg has addressed concerns about child safety before a jury at trial. Tech companies have long relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for content posted by users, but the plaintiffs’ novel argument – which is focused on harmful design and not individual actors – has so far sidestepped this defense.\n\nThe initial trial in Los Angeles focuses on a 20-year-old woman, known as KGM, who says her compulsive use of YouTube and Instagram worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts. KGM’s case is one of about 20 “bellwether” cases – designed to be test cases to gauge a jury’s reaction. TikTok and Snap settled in the initial trial but will still be defendants in hundreds of other cases.\n\nZuckerberg’s testimony comes about a week after Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri spoke on the witness stand. Mosseri pushed back on the science behind social media addiction by denying users could be “clinically addicted”. He described children’s high usage of Instagram as “problematic use” – similar to “watching TV for longer than you feel good about”. Psychologists do not classify social media addiction as an official diagnosis, but many researchers have documented the harmful consequences of compulsive use among young people, and lawmakers around the world are worried about its addictive potential.\n\nPaul Schmidt, one of Meta’s attorneys, previously said in his opening statement that the company acknowledged KGM’s mental health issues but disputed that Instagram played a significant role in exacerbating them. He cited medical records to suggest the primary issue was a difficult home life.\n\nTwo years ago, Zuckerberg fielded similar questions in a heated congressional hearing about child exploitation. In January 2024, Zuckerberg turned directly towards grieving parents on the Senate floor to apologize, promising to continue investments to protect children. Those families were not convinced that Meta would make meaningful progress, and still aren’t; they are hoping the courts can provide more relief. These trials could eventually result in large payouts from tech companies and changes in the way social media platforms are designed.\n\n“His apology – if you will call it that – was mostly empty,” said John DeMay, who was present in the Senate hearing room in 2024. DeMay’s son, Jordan, was 17 when he died by suicide in 2022, hours after being targeted in an online sextortion scam on Instagram. “He basically said they’re doing everything they can to stop and prevent this stuff from happening and unfortunately that’s just not the case.”\n\nIn the two years since, DeMay has visited Capitol Hill frequently to advocate for online child safety – but has been frustrated by the lack of progress. DeMay’s lawsuit is one of the many cases that will be considered as part of a judicial council coordination proceeding. He has more faith in the courts than Congress, and has previously attended hearings in the current trial, although he was following Wednesday’s proceedings from his home in Michigan.\n\n“I’m hopeful that this case prevails but if it doesn’t, we still won because we showed the world – with on the record evidence – that they’re doing one thing and saying another,” DeMay said.\n\nMeta is also involved in separate litigation in New Mexico, where prosecutors accuse the company of violating the state’s consumer protection laws; Meta failed to disclose what it knew about how its social media platforms could harm children, they say. Meta has denied those claims.\n\nInstagram has, in recent years, added some safety features aimed at its young users. But a 2025 review of these tools by Fairplay – a non-profit that advocates for reducing the influence of big tech on children – found “that less than one in five are fully functional and two-thirds (64%) are either substantially ineffective or no longer exist”.\n\nSome former Meta employees have said that the company has been dismissive of warnings around child safety. Kelly Stonelake left Meta on medical leave, in February 2023, after she faced harassment and retaliation for raising such concerns, she says. Stonelake sued Meta last year over the issue, and also alleged a toxic pattern of silencing women.\n\nShe alleges Meta was collecting data on kids without parental consent and exposing them to other adults and “an environment that we knew was riddled with harassment and bullying”.",

    "fullText": "French president rejects US criticism as António Guterres and Narendra Modi warn on child safety and AI monopolies\n\nEmmanuel Macron has hit back at US criticism of Europe’s efforts to regulate AI, vowing to protect children from “digital abuse” during France’s presidency of the G7.\n\nSpeaking at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, the French president called for tougher safeguards after global outrage over Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot being used to generate tens of thousands of sexualised images of children, and amid mounting concern about the concentration of AI power in a handful of companies.\n\nHis remarks were echoed by António Guterres, the UN secretary general, who told delegates – including several US tech billionaires – that “no child should be a test subject for unregulated AI”.\n\n“The future of AI cannot be decided by a few countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires,” Guterres said. “AI must belong to everyone”.\n\nBill Gates had been scheduled to speak but withdrew at the last minute amid renewed scrutiny of his past links to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMeanwhile, an attempt by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to stage a show of unity among leading tech billionaires went awry when the rival heads of OpenAI and Anthropic awkwardly declined to hold hands on stage.\n\nModi stood at the centre of a line of 13 tech executives, including leaders from Google, Meta and Microsoft, who all raised clasped hands – apart from Sam Altman and Dario Amodei. Amodei split from OpenAI in 2021 over differences over how to manage safety risks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House’s senior AI adviser, Sriram Krishnan, renewed the Trump administration’s criticism of AI regulation, singling out the EU’s AI Act. He told delegates he would continue to “rant” against legislation that was not “conducive to an entrepreneur who wants to build innovative technology”.\n\nBut Macron told the intergovernmental summit: “Opposite to what some misinformed friends have been saying, Europe is not blindly focused on regulation. Europe is a space for innovation and investment, but it is a safe space, and safe spaces win in the long run.”\n\nResearch published this month by Unicef and Interpol across 11 countries found at least 1.2 million children reported having their images manipulated into sexually explicit deepfakes in the past year. In some countries, one in 25 children – the equivalent of one child in every classroom – had been affected.\n\n“There is no reason our children should be exposed online to what is legally forbidden in the real world,” Macron said. “Our platforms, governments and regulators should be working together to make the internet and social media a safe space. This is why, in France, we are embarking on a process to ban social networks for children under 15 years old.”\n\nAmong the tech executives attending was Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which is facing a legal challenge from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who took his own life after discussing suicide with ChatGPT.\n\nAltman told delegates the rapid pace of AI development meant “by the end of 2028, more of the world’s intellectual capacity could reside inside of datacentres than outside of them”. He also stressed the urgent need for “regulation or safeguards” and called for the creation of a body akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency to oversee the international coordination of AI.\n\nDario Amodei, the co-chief executive of Anthropic, said he was “concerned about the autonomous behaviour of AI models, their potential for misuse by individuals and governments and their potential for economic displacement”.\n\nModi said it was “imperative that AI is child safe and family-guided”, likening the emergence of AI to the discovery of fire and calling it a “profound transformation in human history”.\n\nIndia is seeking to position itself as the world’s third AI power behind the US and China, with Google this week announcing a $15bn investment in datacentres and subsea cables linking India to the US and other countries.\n\nModi said there must be “established levels of authenticity for content within the digital world … people must know what is authentic, and what has been generated by AI”.\n\nThe interventions come amid growing public concern about the societal risks of AI, as the most advanced models remain largely controlled by about four US companies and a handful of Chinese rivals.\n\nModi set out an alternative vision, leveraging India’s 1.4 billion population as a huge growth market for tech firms. He said: “We must prevent an AI monopoly. Many nations consider AI to be a strategic asset, and therefore it is developed confidentially and its availability is carefully managed.\n\n“However, our nation India holds a different perspective. We believe that technology, like a I will only truly benefit the world when it is shared and when open source code becomes available.”\n\nHis comments appeared to be directed at the US, where leading AI models are not open-source and cannot be used or adapted without permission. By contrast, China’s leading systems, such as DeepSeek and Qwen, are broadly open-source.",

    "fullText": "Forty people in Australia have been diagnosed with a rare sight-threatening condition connected to tattoos that can lead to permanent blindness, representing a significant surge in cases of the little-known ailment, PEOPLE reports.\n\nThe condition, called tattoo-associated uveitis, results from a presumed immune reaction to tattoo ink. The 40 cases identified in Australia represent double the number of cases recorded globally in 2010, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nNelize Pretorius experienced the alarming symptoms firsthand when her vision became blurry, first in one eye and then the other. She initially suspected conjunctivitis, but tests were negative as her sight worsened.\n\n“I could hardly see. I was losing my vision and nobody was able to tell me why,” Pretorius told ABC.\n\nAfter eventually being diagnosed with tattoo-associated uveitis, Pretorius learned about risks she never considered when getting inked.\n\n“You get a tattoo, and you think the risk is that you might regret it later in life,” she told ABC. “[The real risk is] you could potentially lose your vision.”\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, uveitis is a form of eye inflammation with symptoms that can include pain, blurred vision, light sensitivity, and permanent vision loss.\n\nResearch published in the Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology journal pointed to black ink as the cause of most inflammation, with one case each linked to pink and red ink.\n\nOphthalmologist Josephine Richards, who treated Pretorius, said the cause is not fully understood.\n\n“We do not know why the eye gets caught in the crossfire,” Richards told ABC. “There is something about the immune reaction that targets the eye.”\n\nPretorius received expensive treatment and continues to manage the condition with steroid eye drops. Other patients have required immunosuppression to treat their vision, according to ABC.\n\nPretorius credited her diagnosis to being in the right place at the right time.\n\n“My case in particular was one of the first cases that Dr. Richards had in Perth,” she said. “It’s just lucky that she knew about it because if she wasn’t there on that day, I may still not know what the issue is.”\n\nDespite her ordeal, Pretorius acknowledged her outcome was fortunate.\n\n“There’s a few people [with tattoo-associated uveitis] that lost their vision permanently, so relatively speaking I came off pretty good,” she said.",

    "description": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was stunned when CBS reporter Ed O'Keefe asked for examples of President Trump being \"falsely called racist\"",
    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was visibly stunned after CBS’s Ed O’Keefe asked for examples of President Donald Trump being “falsely called racist” in recent years.\n\n“You’re kidding, right?” replied Leavitt during a White House press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nShe was responding to O’Keefe’s question, which quoted Trump’s tribute to Jesse Jackson a day earlier.\n\nIn his statement about Jesse Jackson, the president said “Despite the fact that I am falsely inconsistently called a racist by the scoundrels and lunatics on the radical left, Democrats all, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.” Where or when does the president believe he has been falsely called racist?\n\nThat spurred Leavitt’s shocked response and led to a few audible chuckles in the briefing room.\n\n“I will pull you plethora of examples. I’m going to get my team in that room to start going through the internet of radical Democrats throughout the years who have accused this president falsely of being a racist,” Leavitt said.\n\nShe continued, “And I’m sure there’s many people in this room and on network television across the country who have accused him of the same. In fact, I know that because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”\n\nLeavitt added that Trump was looking forward to a Black History Month event scheduled for later in the day.\n\n“There is a lot this president has done for all Americans, regardless of race,” she said. “And he has absolutely been falsely called and smeared as a racist, and I’m happy to provide you those receipts.”\n\nTrump’s racial attitudes have long been called out by high-profile media personalities. Ex-CNN star Don Lemon branded Trump a “racist” in 2018, and called him a “racist piece of sh*t” last year. Another CNN alum, Jim Acosta, said in 2018 “this president deep down may just be a racist.” MS NOW anchor Lawrence O’Donnell dubbed Trump the “most racist” president who never owned slaves in 2024, and his colleague, Chris Hayes, called Trump “to his bones a racist” after he posted a video depicting ex-President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes earlier this month.\n\nOther examples include NBC White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor accusing Trump of using a “racist term” when he called COVID-19 the “kung-flu,” CBS reporter Weijia Jiang similarly said Trump used “racist phrases” during the pandemic, and Geraldo Rivera — a former longtime friend of the president’s — referring to Trump’s crackdown on migrants as “racist government policy.”\n\nAnd soon after the press briefing wrapped up, one of the White House’s X accounts posted an example of O’Keefe himself calling out Trump for “racist tweets” in 2019:\n\nThis reporter literally called President Trump's tweets racist in 2019. https://t.co/HlgnNg9DZA pic.twitter.com/Crjf26Qttj\n\n— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) February 18, 2026\n\nThe post ‘You’re Kidding, Right?’ Karoline Leavitt Gobsmacked After Reporter Asks for Examples of Trump Being ‘Falsely Called Racist’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "An El Paso educator known for her kindness and aiding those in need died after she was struck by a rolling vehicle as she attempted to stop another woman from driving drunk, court documents state.\n\nAna Maria Paniagua, 57, offered to drive Aurora Morales, 62, home about 5:20 p.m. on Feb. 7 because she was worried Morales was drunk, as she was coping with the anniversary of her son's death, a criminal complaint affidavit states.\n\nMore: El Paso fatal crash tracker 2026\n\nAs Morales tried to switch seats, her 1999 Ford F350 pickup truck rolled back in the parking lot of Juanito's Liquor Store in the 7800 block of North Loop Drive in the Lower Valley. The truck fatally struck Paniagua.\n\nPaniagua was a paraprofessional at Jefferson High School, El Paso Independent School District officials said.\n\n\"True to who she was, Ana Maria did not hesitate to help someone in need,\" her family wrote on a GoFundMe page. \"Tragically, during this act of kindness, an accident occurred involving the same vehicle they were attempting to assist.\n\n\"Ana Maria was known for always putting others first and never asking for support herself. Serving others in moments of need was simply who she was.\"\n\nMorales is facing one count of intoxicated manslaughter with a vehicle in connection with Paniagua's death. No attorney is named for Morales in court records.\n\nEl Paso police officers met with Paniagua's daughter at Del Sol Medical Center, where Paniagua was being treated after the crash. Paniagua later died at the hospital from the injuries she suffered in the crash.\n\nThe daughter told officers she and her mom saw Morales earlier in the day in front of her house, appearing to need assistance. Paniagua stopped at Morales' house and checked on her.\n\nMore: El Paso woman arrested on intoxicated manslaughter charge in fatal crash\n\nMorales told Paniagua that she did not typically drink any alcohol, but had been drinking that day because she was remembering her son, who was killed eight years ago on Feb. 22. She was drinking in \"an attempt to forget the passing of her son,\" the affidavit states.\n\nPaniagua and another passerby helped Morales get back into her front yard and called for medical services. EMTs arrived and helped Morales back into her house.\n\nPaniagua and her daughter finished running errands and decided to go back to Morales' house to check on her. They found that a vehicle previously parked at the house was gone.\n\nMore: El Paso women die after being struck by vehicles in separate crashes\n\nThe mother and daughter drove around the area, particularly where there were bars, to try and find Morales. They spotted Morales' truck outside the liquor store.\n\nPaniagua went up to the driver's side window and spoke to Morales. The truck was running and in reverse gear. She offered to drive Morales home. Morales moved over to the center seat and released the brake, the affidavit states.\n\nThe truck began rolling backwards. Paniagua became trapped by the front left tire, which rolled over her midsection, the affidavit states.\n\nAt the scene of the crash, an officer told Morales that she had been involved in a crash. Morales replied, \"Yo, se, yo estaba manejando patras pero nunca la mire,\" meaning in English, \"I know, I was driving backwards but I never saw her,\" the affidavit states.\n\nAn officer wrote in the affidavit that Morales had \"red glossy eyes, but noted that the defendant (Morales) had been crying as she was speaking\" to the officer.\n\nMorales was taken to a police station and placed in a holding cell. She was questioned by officers. Morales recalled being at the liquor store and was reversing when she heard banging on her truck's left window, the affidavit states. She told Paniagua that the window didn't work and to open the door.\n\nAn officer asked if Morales had been driving. Morales replied that she was not driving and that it was her friend who was driving, but \"did not want to get her in any trouble,\" the affidavit states.\n\nMorales first claimed she got out of the vehicle from the driver's side, but later claimed she got out of the truck \"from the side of the person steering,\" the affidavit states. The officer interviewing her allegedly smelled alcohol coming from Morales.\n\nOfficers conducted a field sobriety test on Morales, which she failed. She was arrested on suspicion of intoxicated manslaughter with a vehicle.\n\nMorales remains jailed on a $250,000 bond at the El Paso County Jail. A bond hearing is scheduled for Thursday, Feb. 19, court records show.\n\nAaron Martinez covers the criminal justice system for the El Paso Times.

The snake was more than three feet long and wrapped around her leg as she walked barefoot.\n\nSnake Catcher Geelong, a licensed snake controller in the area, posted the video on their Facebook page.\n\nThe snake expert identified the snake as a male copperhead and confirmed that while it wrapped around her leg, it did not bite her.\n\n\"When I caught up with her, she was shaky,\" Snake Catcher Geelong wrote. \"It will take her a while to get over this experience.\"\n\nFortunately, the woman was not hurt in the snake incident. However, she was lucky because Australian copperhead snakes are venomous and can cause fatal bites.\n\nOthers have captured videos of terrifying interactions between snakes and people around boat ramps and in other public spaces.\n\nAlthough the woman in this video from Australia did not provoke the snake to attack, human activity can affect snake behavior. Worldwide, new developments and community expansions have been infringing upon snakes' natural habitats and bringing snakes and people closer together than ever before.\n\nIf you encounter a snake in your backyard or in the wild, remain calm, stay still, and slowly back away at least six feet.

    "fullText": "David Chong quit his $192,000-a-year Microsoft job last year to build an AI startup.\n\nWeeks later, most of his belongings were stolen during his move from New York City to Toronto.\n\nHe shared how he's trying to bounce back — and why he doesn't regret going all in on entrepreneurship.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Chong, a 38-year-old startup founder in Toronto. He previously worked as a senior software engineer at Microsoft until resigning last September. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI resigned from Microsoft in September 2025. Less than a month later, I lost almost everything I owned.\n\nDuring my move from New York City to my hometown of Toronto, the trailer transporting my belongings was stolen in the middle of the night. The trailer was eventually recovered, but none of my belongings were.\n\nWhile resigning from Microsoft set me down this unfortunate path, I believe leaving Big Tech was the right move for me. I've had to learn what the Zen monks preach about letting go of your earthly possessions to reach enlightenment.\n\nIn 2016, I moved from Canada to New York City on a work visa. Before joining Microsoft, I worked at a smaller tech company for nearly seven years, starting as a junior employee and working my way up to a leadership role as a lead product engineer.\n\nWhen I joined Microsoft as a senior software engineer in 2022, it felt like a bit of a backtrack in terms of title. I thought it would be easy to get promoted back to a higher level, but it definitely wasn't; I held the same position for nearly three years.\n\nAt my previous employer, it felt like your work spoke for itself, but at Microsoft, it felt like I would have to develop a \"getting promoted\" skill — doing a lot of internal self-promotion to make sure my work got noticed outside my immediate team — to actually move up.\n\nFrom what I heard, the need to actively self-promote in order to move up is a broader trend across Big Tech. It seemed pretty non-transferable outside the Big Tech world, so I wasn't very interested in developing it.\n\nBusiness Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.\n\nShare your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29.\n\nIn my last few years at Microsoft, the company went through multiple restructurings that moved me to different teams. In the most recent round, some of our managers were laid off.\n\nThe layoffs didn't make me too concerned about my job security, in part because my department seemed starved for engineering talent. However, I was growing frustrated with the slow promotion timeline.\n\nThere also seemed to be rising expectations at the company around productivity and working from the office. The message from leadership seemed to be that we needed to ramp up and adjust because times were changing.\n\nThe other thing that made me start considering leaving was that I wasn't learning as much as I wanted to, partially because I had become the most senior person on my team.\n\nIn early 2025, I started thinking seriously about leaving Microsoft and figuring out my next career move. It was a very difficult decision. I was working on a TN visa, which was tied specifically to Microsoft, and resigning would likely mean moving back to Toronto and committing to a future outside the US, unless I could find another company willing to sponsor me. I'd come to the US thinking about living here long-term. Microsoft had already started the green card process for me, and quitting would mean giving that up as well.\n\nAround last April, a friend opened my eyes to the possibility of entrepreneurship. I became more interested in that path and started doing a lot of research on how to build a business. I decided that if I left Microsoft, I would pursue entrepreneurship.\n\nIn September, I resigned from Microsoft. I wasn't too worried about giving up my $192,000 a year salary because I consider myself very risk-tolerant. I've saved up enough of a buffer to go without income for several years, and I don't have any dependents.\n\nLosing my belongings during the move definitely hurt my productivity, forcing me to delay my startup plans by a few months.\n\nOf everything I owned, all I had left was what I packed for the flight in my backpack and carry-on bag. I landed in Toronto without winter clothes or a bed — I had to sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag.\n\nI focused on resolving the move issues: trying to figure out what happened, contacting the police, and dealing with the insurance claim. I'd unfortunately gotten the lowest insurance rate for my move, so the insurance payout was less than even what I paid for the moving service.\n\nAnd of course, there was the financial impact of replacing everything. So far, I've spent around $12,000 on essentials like a couch, bed, air fryer, Instant Pot, and clothing. Since everything was stolen, I'm starting from scratch in more ways than one.\n\nHowever, I've made progress with my AI sales agent business, Falco, in recent months. It's still in development and isn't ready for customers yet, but it has launched publicly.\n\nWhen it comes to building a startup, I don't think the idea necessarily matters as much as the execution. I'm hopeful that if I just go all in, move fast, and constantly test my ideas, I should be OK. My plan is to give myself about three years to pursue entrepreneurship. If all else fails, I'll go back into the job market.\n\nMy advice is to try to put yourself in your own shoes five to 10 years from now. When I do that, I look back at the decision I'm facing and ask myself, \"Would I regret not doing this?\"\n\nIf the answer is yes, I try to do the thing I'd regret not doing. I've often heard that older people regret the chances they didn't take more than the ones they did.\n\nIn hindsight, I think this mindset is what helped me decide to move to New York and join Microsoft — two decisions that had their pros and cons, but that I don't regret. My first job in New York helped me build the experience that landed me at Microsoft, and Microsoft gave me the opportunity to grow my skills and meet some very interesting people.\n\nFor me, leaving Microsoft to start a business is a decision I don't think my future self will regret, even if I fail, so I'm going all in on entrepreneurship.",

    "description": "Here's what Missouri basketball coach Dennis Gates said after the Tigers hung on to beat Vanderbilt, including his thoughts on the final play.",
    "fullText": "Mark Mitchell’s inbounds play with a second left on the clock put the same thought in his head coach’s head as, we have to imagine, the 10,234 fans who had filed into Mizzou Arena.\n\nThe pass was woefully short of its target, and it landed in perhaps the worst place possible: The hands of Vanderbilt guard Tyler Tanner, who couldn’t miss in the second half as the Commodores had tracked Mizzou down from 21 points to, in that nearly fateful moment, a half-court heave to possibly win the game.\n\nTanner got the ball under control and up into the air in time. It was right on line.\n\nGates’ self-admitted first reaction: “Oh, s**t,” he told reporters after the game.\n\nMizzou escaped. Barely. Tanner’s heave made about as much of contact with the inside of the rim as is possible without the ball falling through the net, and the Tigers avoided what could have been one of the most remarkable meltdowns in program history, beating No. 18/19-ranked Vanderbilt 81-80 on Wednesday night in Columbia.\n\nStress levels and general well-being aside, it’s a massive win for Missouri.\n\nMizzou needs a strong finish to the season to make the March Madness field. A win over top-20 Vanderbilt — since there are no pictures of the résumé — helps the Tigers a remarkable amount.\n\nIt got across the line Wednesday, as much as it tried to cough one up.\n\nHere’s what Gates said to reporters after Mizzou's win over Vandy:\n\nA majority of the questions the two players, Jayden Stone and Trent Pierce, who joined Gates in his pregame press conference were about the final minutes of the near-collapse.\n\nGates had criticisms. We’ll get to those. But he had a reminder for the room and the cameras.\n\n“This is a great win. This is not a loss,” Gates said. “This is a win. This is a win. Let me remind everybody in here, this is a win. So, let's project our questions like we won.”\n\nHe’s right. A double-digit win, which is what the game was trending toward for most of the night, would have helped Mizzou in the advanced analytics and NET rankings more, but the Tigers bolstered their résumé nonetheless.\n\nIf Mizzou needed to finish the regular season with three or four more wins before Selection Sunday, then it has one.\n\n“We did not break, and that's the most important part,” Gates said. ... \"Yes, we were up 20. Who in here did not watch the Oklahoma-Vanderbilt game (when Vandy also nearly came back from down 21 points). We knew they would make a run, and our guys, they may have bent a little bit, but we did not break.\n\n“That's a sign of a great team, being able to come back, being able to make shots. Ultimately, we got to get to the foul line in that situation, not have empty possessions. Our guys had resilience, so I'm proud of them. This is a win.”\n\n“First, I said, ‘oh, s**t,’ because Mark threw the ball short, right?” Gates said. “You don't want to use all your timeouts, but that's not the pass we want. And Mark Mitchell's parents, his dad even said, ‘Son, I got to teach you how to throw.’ That pass — Mark knew. Mark’s (thrown) some long, long passes before.”\n\nAnd that speaks to a larger issue in Mizzou’s performance. The Tigers were the better team for 30 minutes, which was the full stretch between the opening two minutes of the game and the final eight minutes. The difference between the good and the bad, almost without fail, was how Missouri looked after the ball.\n\nVanderbilt ran a high press that Mark Byington described as a “Hail Mary” move, with the Commodores facing a 21-point deficit.\n\nBut the Commodores also started to simply make shots. They closed 13-of-18 (72.2%) from the field in the final 8:19, after Mizzou opened up its largest lead of the game.\n\n“Not happy about the turnovers late in the game. Had to save some time outs, but I thought we successfully broke the press,” Gates said. “You can't give up six points with two field goals, meaning 3s or and-1s. You’ve got to force teams late in games to have 2-point field goals, and we didn't do a good job of that, and we’ve got to do a better job of protecting the 3-point line and giving up and-1s, but more importantly, taking care of the basketball.”\n\nMizzou desperately needs center depth. Shawn Phillips Jr. has, for the most part, been solid as the Tigers’ primary center, but he was foul prone against Vanderbilt — a common theme in the big man’s game in SEC play.\n\nWhile Phillips sat, the Tigers turned to 7-foot-5 center Trent Burns, whose high billing hasn’t quite materialized in his first season on the floor.\n\nOn Wednesday, he gave Missouri his best minutes. He had a team-high +19 plus/minus over a career-high 18 minutes, and he hauled in seven rebounds and registered a block.\n\n“Our player of the game was Trent Burns,” Gates said. “I thought he did a tremendous job in practice, and what he did in practice showed up in the game. And whatever that was, it was more so toward me, because I told him, ‘I'm not going to play you ever again if you don't earn it in practice.’ It is what it is.\n\n“We need somebody to step up, especially at that five spot. And tonight, it was Trent Burns, and his teammates did a great job of pushing him through and demanding of him as well, and that was the response that we needed.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Columbia Daily Tribune: Mizzou basketball coach Dennis Gates on narrow win, escape vs Vanderbilt",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Pirates are teeming with young, talented pitching. From Paul Skenes and Bubba Chandler to Braxton Ashcraft and Jared Jones, the Pirates are loaded with dynamic arms.\n\nPittsburgh ranked seventh in ERA last year, and it’s easy to see why. The team has more pitching than it knows what to do with.\n\nDan Plesac, a three-time All-Star who pitched two seasons for the Pirates in the mid-1990s, is particularly impressed by Pittsburgh’s starting rotation. He likes it so much that he recently compared it to a famous National League dynasty on MLB Network.\n\n“It’s a very good rotation,” Plesac said on Tuesday’s episode of MLB Tonight. “It reminds me a little bit going back, and this might be a little bit of an overstatement, of some of those young pitching staffs of the Atlanta Braves before we knew who they were.”\n\n\"If I'm a Pirates fan, this is the most enthusiastic I've felt going into a season in about four or five years.\"\n\n– @Plesac19 on #MLBTonight https://t.co/BEEXZ98zzg pic.twitter.com/mAe7uQbJKy\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 18, 2026\n\nPlesac is referring to the legendary Braves of the early 1990s with Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Steve Avery.\n\nThat might be a bit of a reach, but Skenes is certainly on that level and Chandler has the potential to be.\n\nThose iconic Atlanta teams ruled the 1990s and won a World Series, so that’s an exciting comparison for the Pirates, who haven’t won a playoff game since 2013 or a championship since 1979.\n\nHowever, that could be about to change. Not only does Pittsburgh have excellent pitching, but it also dramatically improved its lineup over the offseason.\n\n“It’s a team that’s built around their starting pitching, make no bones about it,” Plesac added. “If I’m a Pirates fan, this is the most enthusiastic I’ve felt going into a season in about four or five years.”\n\nMore Pirates: Former All-Star Pitcher Reveals What He Loves About Pirates’ Bubba Chandler\n\nThe post MLB Analyst Compares Pirates’ Loaded Pitching Staff To Recent Dynasty appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "Current Chelsea player Axel Disasi, who is out on loan with West Ham United, has referred to his time at The Blues as ‘a little bit crazy’.\n\nDisasi says that his overall life experience basically managed to see him through some struggles at Chelsea, although his story, or nightmare there, is not over yet.\n\nThe defender is only on loan with The Hammers and there is no guarantee yet that they will sign him on a permanent deal come the end of the season. I guess it will all depend on how well he performs there until the summer. But there is chance that his nightmare at Chelsea continues if they decide they do not want to buy him on a permanent deal.\n\nDisasi was cast aside by Chelsea and thrown into their brutal ‘bomb squad’ situation where they basically freeze players out and away from the first team until they leave. Disasi has basically just been in a different parallel universe at Chelsea for the last two seasons.\n\nAxel Disasi signs on loan for West Ham.\n\nIn words cited on X this week, Disasi says:\n\n“My situation before was a little bit crazy. For me it is only a positive to be here, it feels great to be part of something.\n\n“In Chelsea the time was a little bit crazy but my background helped me to get through.”\n\nYan Diomande is tearing up the Bundesliga, and Chelsea are among the teams being linked with him.

    "title": "On This Day (19th Feb 2024): Sunderland Sack Michael Beale!",
    "description": "After a torrid two-month spell on Wearside, Beale was relieved of his duties on this day two years ago.",
    "fullText": "Michael Beale’s as Sunderland AFC head coach was — and still is — a period that many fans don’t reflect fondly upon.\n\nBeale had the difficult task of replacing Tony Mowbray as the main man at the club after Mowbray’s slightly surprising dismissal as head coach.\n\nMowbray was loved by most fans for his warm and kind nature, coupled with the attractive style of football that the Lads played under his stewardship. Unfortunately for all involved, it seemed that differing opinions on the club’s strategy and recruitment plan saw things go a little awry as Mowbray was keen for an experienced centre forward to help ease the pressure that rested on Jack Clarke’s shoulders during the 2023/2024 season.\n\nMowbray’s dismissal brought an opportunity for many head coaches who appeared to be interested in the job — chiefly Will Still, who appeared to be the club’s number one candidate. As it was, it seemed that Still had a hefty price tag placed on him by Reims, who wanted to do everything to keep a coach who was the one of the hottest properties in the game.\n\nThis led to Kristjaan Speakman looking at alternatives and one name that became increasingly prominent was that of Beale, who’d only recently departed his role as manager of Glasgow Rangers. However, as talk of Beale becoming our head coach became more and more prominent, the backlash from the fans grew stronger.\n\nRightly or wrongly, Beale’s mannerisms and confident demeanour coupled with his failed spell as Rangers manager left many people disappointed with his potential appointment after the enjoyable reign of Mowbray, during which the connection between the fans and the team had improved drastically.\n\nBeale was appointed on December 18, just days before our clash with Coventry City at the Stadium of Light, and his first game was nothing short of a nightmare, as amid the heaviest of rainfall, his hopes and aspirations came crashing down, putting him on the back foot and in survival mode as the fans made their feelings clear.\n\nA win against Hull City offered him some breathing space before a heavy FA Cup defeat against Newcastle United in early January marked the beginning of the end as the team showed little ambition to even try and beat their arch-rivals at the Stadium of Light.\n\nDespite still lingering just outside the playoffs, the style of play had changed completely, with a conservative approach coupled with a complete reliance on Clarke becoming very apparent and also a stick to beat him with.\n\nAdditionally, the support for Beale within the boardroom began to flounder as he openly criticised the fact that the team had no centre forward within their ranks — which was similar to the issues that Mowbray also encountered with the club after Ross Stewart was sold.\n\nAfter poor away defeats to Ipswich and Huddersfield, a loss to Birmingham City — now managed by Mowbray — was the final straw for the club. After Clarke had given Sunderland the lead, the team slipped up and conceded two goals to lose in what was becoming a trend of losing tight games against supposed weaker opposition.\n\nWhat’s more, the defeat wasn’t the worst thing to happen at St Andrew’s as videos began to circulate online during which it seemed fairly clear that Beale had ignored Trai Hume’s attempted handshake as he was taken off.\n\nOne particular account on Twitter — named ‘Player ID’ — was particularly vocal in their defence of Beale, retweeting posts suggesting fans of Sunderland are ‘entitled’ and also showing different views of his interaction (or lack thereof) with Hume. Allegedly, this was a ‘burner’ account of Beale’s that was being used to sing his own praises and express some critical views of Sunderland.\n\nWith all of this going on amid some terrible performances, Beale’s position at Sunderland became untenable and it was no surprise that he was sacked on this day two years ago, with Speakman breaking the news on the club website.\n\nWe are disappointed that Michael is leaving Sunderland AFC.\n\nOur desire is to improve and unfortunately that hasn’t been evident, as such we take full accountability and feel that acting decisively is in the best interests of the club.\n\nThis has been a difficult few months for Michael, who leaves with our best wishes for the future.",

    "fullText": "Following the same criteria as our examination of Sunderland’s homegrown post-war footballers, part two applies the same rules to discover whether we’ve produced any players who scored more than Gary Rowell’s 103 goals for the club.\n\nJust as this meant ruling out anyone the club purchased such as Kevin Phillips, Marco Gabbiadini, Brian Clough and Len Shackleton, there are some big-name pre-war players to be excluded, such as Charlie Buchan (signed from Arsenal), Dave Halliday (signed from Dundee) and Arthur Bridgett (signed from Stoke).\n\nSo, who does that leave to consider from a period when Sunderland won six league titles, an FA Cup, and were considered one of the top clubs in the country?\n\nCarter would be one player who you would put your house on to have come through the ranks at Sunderland and scored a number of goals in excess of Rowell’s total.\n\nWidely heralded as one of Sunderland’s greatest players, Carter was born in Hendon, became a league winner and FA Cup-winning captain, and also played for Sunderland and England schoolboys.\n\nHowever, he didn’t sign for Sunderland straight from school when he left at fourteen years of age. In fact, he actually knocked them back on the advice of his guardian (his uncle, following the death of his father) because he wanted the young Carter to learn a trade.\n\nThus, he became an apprentice electrician while playing for an amateur side. He signed amateur forms for Sunderland in 1931, aged seventeen, while also having a trial for Leicester City who turned him down.  Eventually, he was taken on as a professional for Sunderland.\n\nCan this rule Carter out? It almost feels like sacrilege to do so, so I’ll leave it for others to debate.\n\nAnother of our pre-war legends and club record scorer.\n\nA teammate of Carter, Silksworth-born Gurney was a goalscoring powerhouse of the 1930s. Like Carter, he won the Championship and FA Cup, and was honoured with a mural on the side of a building.\n\nOur record scorer played for his hometown club, living the “Roy of the Rovers” dream forty years before Rowell even made his debut — yet Gurney also didn’t sign for Sunderland straight from school.\n\nHe was spotted playing for Bishop Auckland at seventeen years of age (apparently by Charlie Buchan), and there’s a heated discussion with a beer or five at the kitchen table to be had late into the night here.\n\nThese three fantastic players were recruited by Sunderland — then newly-elected to the Football League — around the age of twenty by then-manager Tom Watson.\n\nThey shouldn’t really qualify under the criteria as they weren’t produced by the club, but we didn’t produce anyone through a youth system at that point.\n\nCampbell arrived in 1889 and Millar came in 1890 — both from Scottish clubs — and Hannah came in 1891 from Sunderland Albion. Campbell and Millar were with Sunderland as a Football League club from the kick of the first ball in 1890, whilst Hannah came just one year later.\n\nThey scored just over 250 goals between them as Sunderland became champions in only their second season in the league. Campbell fired Sunderland to three league titles while Millar won four with the Lads over two spells.\n\nThere are three striking similarities between Holley and Rowell.\n\nThe first is obvious in that they each scored over 100 goals for the club. The second is not so in that they both happened to have been born in Seaham, but do you know the third?\n\nThey both scored a hat trick for Sunderland at St. James’ Park, with Holley hitting three in Sunderland’s record away win — a 9-1 victory at Newcastle on 5 December 1908.\n\nLike Carter and Gurney, Holley played local football with non-league clubs before being spotted by Sunderland’s scouts, signing in 1904 as an eighteen-year-old. He then went on to win the First Division title in 1913 as part of a team that came so close to winning the double.\n\nHe scored eleven hat tricks for Sunderland and hit eight goals in ten appearances for England. He was still in his prime at only twenty eight years old when the First World War brought his career at the top of the game to a halt — and he would’ve been a strong challenger to Gurney’s record total.\n\nScottish-born Gallacher played for Linwood St Coval and Bridge of Weir before moving to Sunderland as an eighteen-year-old in 1928.\n\nNew manager Johnny Cochrane brought the outside left into the Sunderland team alongside Carter and Gurney, as they slowly became a force in English football in the 1930s.\n\nPredominantly a winger, Gallacher would often change positions with Carter and he could also play on the right. He was a key member of the team that won the league title in 1936, the FA Cup in 1937 and also reached the semi-final in 1938 — a game that seems to have been forgotten over time.\n\nLater that year, he was transferred to Stoke City and just one year later, the Second World War effectively brought his career to an end.\n\nI apologise if I’ve missed out any glaring candidates, and I have to say this was very much a step into the unknown for myself in terms of what I would find, especially during the pre-war era.\n\nI also have to credit my fellow Roker Report writers Andy Tomlinson and Kelvin Beattie for helping to point me in the right direction. Andrew Smithson was also a huge help in fact-checking the player stats and the accuracy of the summary.\n\nI certainly expected at least a couple of the huge names from the pre-war era to have at least signed for the club on either amateur or professional terms upon leaving school, but in summary, it seems that prior to World War Two, there was a Sunderland schoolboy side, but this was run by teachers.\n\nSunderland Association Football Club would offer terms to any worthy players — either as amateurs or professionals, as they tried to do with Carter — and they certainly would develop young players in the A team.\n\nHowever, they did put a lot of faith in scouting local talent and as can be seen from some of the names above, this proved to be a pretty fruitful policy. Yet times were different and nowadays, promising schoolboy players are heavily courted by clubs from all areas of the country to sign with their academies from a very young age. Clubs just didn’t have the resources and means to undertake the present day policies in that era.\n\nPost-war, Sunderland had a junior side and completely bought into the benefits of the youth setup from the Alan Brown era onwards.\n\nFrom the 1960s through to the 1990s, there are several names in each decade that became mainstays in the first team. Goalscorers are less common and Gary Rowell remains the only player produced by Sunderland to have scored over one hundred goals for the club since the Second World War — an eighty-year period.\n\nOther than Rowell, only three other players to have scored over one hundred goals in their career have been produced by Sunderland: Dennis Tueart, John O’Hare and Colin West. If you can think of any others, by all means get in touch with us here at Roker Report.\n\nHowever, consider how many other players have achieved the same feat across football — that of scoring more than one hundred goals for the club that produced them. There are players out there that’ve done it, and many are big names.\n\nHarry Kane, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen, Matt Le Tissier, Jimmy Greaves (for Chelsea), George Best, Bobby Charlton, and Gary Lineker for Leicester City (who matched Gary Rowell’s record of 103 goals) spring to mind, and Clough also did it for Middlesborough.\n\nIf you consider the British-born record goalscorers in the Premier League who don’t qualify, such as Frank Lampard, Jermain Defoe, Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney, it puts it in a more enlightening context — and perhaps Gary Rowell was more unique than we all thought.",

    "fullText": "Phil Foden started for Manchester City in their 3-nil win over Fulham on Wednesday night. Foden grabbed an assist and his overall performance at the Etihad indicated that Foden may be over the tough spell of form he has recently endured. Foden still has a way to go to recapture his brilliant best. There is no doubt about that. But the signs from Manchester City’s routine win over Marco Silva’s side were overwhelmingly positive from Foden. That could be a massive positive for Pep Guardiola’s side as the pressure ramps up during the final stages of the 25/26 season.\n\nIt wasn’t a vintage Phil Foden performance by the England international against Fulham, but the signs were on display that Foden may be coming out the other side of his recent run of form. Foden had a period of sustained rest before the Premier League fixture against Marco Silva’s side. It looked to have paid dividends as Foden resembled the player who can dominate matches at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nPhil Foden grabbed an assist when he set up Erling Haaland’s goal in the 39th minute at the Etihad. Haaland’s goal was Manchester City’s third of the night and effectively ended the match as a contest. It was a clever little ball by Foden that found Haaland with space to do what Manchester City’s number nine does best. It wasn’t a magical Kevin De Bruyne-type of assist by any stretch, but it was exactly what Foden needed for his confidence.\n\nThroughout the first half, especially, against Fulham, Foden got into dangerous pockets of space. He had two good chances to score. A Foden volley was blocked by Joachim Andersen in the seventh minute. In the tenth minute, some neat footwork by Phil Foden created space for himself to shoot in the Fulham penalty area. Phil Foden’s right-footed shot lacked the power to beat Bernd Leno, but it was another small sign that Phil Foden’s touch was there.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Manchester City’s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Salford City, Pep Guardiola shared his belief that Foden will return to his best sooner rather than later. When asked about Foden, Pep Guardiola said: “I have zero, zero, zero doubts about Phil. He has to recover himself good and just focus on playing football, going to fish. He loves fishing, and that’s it. When he is that, Phil is back and will be back.”\n\n“It’s not 20 centuries ago when he was the best player in the Premier League, it was around the corner. It wasn’t many seasons ago. This is Phil Foden. Just be relaxed in his mind, the joy, the smile and happiness, and play, play, play.”\n\nManchester City need Phil Foden at his best. When he is at his best, he offers a threat that not many of his teammates can. Foden can score goals, create them, press City’s opponents, and link up Manchester City’s build-up play. There is a variety to Foden’s play that makes him a dangerous weapon when he is in pristine form. Guardiola’s comments about Foden switching off and enjoying life away from football also highlight how important balance can be for modern players and supporters alike. For many fans, that downtime still revolves around football in some form, watching matches, playing games, or picking up digital content and gift cards on Eneba before returning to their favourite titles. That same sense of freedom and variety is what makes Foden such a valuable option for City when he is playing with a clear mind.\n\nThe signs were there against Fulham that Phil Foden may have turned the corner with his form. Manchester City will be hoping that is the case. Foden is a bona fide match-winner on his day, and if he does get back to his best, anything is possible for Pep Guardiola’s new-look side this season.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Andrej Stojakovic scored 22 points to lead seven players in double figures and No. 10 Illinois routed Southern California 101-65 on Wednesday night for its 14th win in 16 games.\n\nBlue and orange-clad fans were out in force for the Fighting Illini’s first game against the Trojans in Los Angeles since 1975. The Illini (22-5, 13-3 Big Ten) didn’t disappoint, leading all the way to maintain a hold on second place in the conference standings behind No. 1 Michigan.\n\nThe Illini were up by 22 at halftime, and poured it on to start the second half. They outscored the Trojans 21-10, hitting five 3-pointers and extending the lead to 75-42. Stojakovic capped the spurt with a steal and one-handed slam that drew cheers.\n\nStojakovic was 6 of 7 from the floor and made all nine of his free throws. David Mirkovic added 14 points. The Illini hit 24 of 26 free throws while sending USC to its biggest loss of the season.\n\nIllinois made 13 3-pointers, and at one point in the second half was shooting equally as well from long range as from the floor overall (46%). Visiting fans took turns shouting “I-L-L” with the other side of the arena responding “I-N-I.”\n\nEzra Ausar scored 15 points and Jacob Cofie added 14 for USC (18-8, 7-8), which lost its second straight and fell to 0-4 against ranked teams. The Trojans were without second-leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara (18.3 points per game) because of a strained knee. They committed 14 turnovers that led to 22 points for the Illini.\n\nIllinois visits UCLA on Saturday.\n\nUSC remains in the Pacific time zone for its final five Big Ten games, starting Saturday when Oregon visits.",

    "title": "Lasses Spotlight: Can Sunderland Versus Durham Be Classed As A ‘Rivalry’?",
    "description": "Ahead of the latest installment, Charlotte Patterson looks at the curious and complex nature of this local clash!",
    "fullText": "Having grown up in Durham yet supported Sunderland all my life has always meant that any fixture between the two clubs feels strangely personal.\n\nOnce, I wanted both to thrive but now the lines feel more blurred, the loyalties more defined and the question more intriguing than ever: is Sunderland versus Durham a ‘rivalry’, a ‘derby’, or something far more complicated?\n\nIt’s one of the most intriguing fixtures in the women’s game — not because it’s steeped in decades of animosity or because it carries the weight of a traditional derby but because it sits in a space that’s still forming. It’s a match shaped by geography, identity, ambition and personal experience; indeed, ask ten Sunderland fans what it means to them and you’ll get ten different answers.\n\nFor me, the fixture has always carried a strange emotional pull.\n\nI was born in Durham and have lived here my whole life, but I’ve supported Sunderland for as long as I can remember.\n\nThere was once a time when I genuinely wanted to see Durham succeed alongside Sunderland. It felt like something to be proud of, my home city producing a women’s team punching above its weight, competing fiercely without the backing of a men’s club and building a loyal fanbase from scratch. I admired and respected them. And I wanted them to do well — as long as they weren’t doing well at Sunderland’s expense.\n\nThe more invested I’ve become in Sunderland Women, the more I’ve felt that instinctive tug of competitiveness. These days, I don’t feel the same attachment to Durham. I still respect them deeply — especially for what they’ve built and how they’ve built it — but I always want Sunderland to beat them. I always want Sunderland to finish above them. And yes, I do enjoy it when Durham beat Newcastle.\n\nThat personal shift mirrors the wider debate among Sunderland supporters. Is this a derby? A rivalry? Is it friendly, tense, indifferent or something in between — and what shapes those feelings?\n\nThe first question is the simplest to ask and the hardest to answer. “Do Sunderland fans actually view Sunderland versus Durham as a derby?”\n\nFor some, the answer is an immediate “yes”.\n\nThe two clubs are close geographically, separated by a short drive and a shared stretch of the North East landscape. In football, proximity often defines rivalry and the fact that Sunderland and Durham have spent several seasons competing in the same division, often finishing near each other and often playing matches that mattered, means the fixture naturally takes on a derby-like feel. Competitive tension breeds familiarity, and familiarity breeds rivalry.\n\nYet for others, the answer is more complicated.\n\nSunderland’s traditional rivalries — particularly in the men’s game — are deeply entrenched, emotionally charged and historically loaded. Durham, in contrast, are a relatively young club in the women’s football pyramid. They don’t carry the weight of decades of animosity and they don’t evoke the same visceral reaction that fixtures against Newcastle or Middlesbrough might.\n\nFor some Sunderland fans, Durham simply don’t feel like rivals in the traditional sense. They’re local, but rivalry is about more than geography — and this is where the emotional nuance comes in.\n\nWhen Sunderland fans think about Durham Women as a club, their instinctive reactions vary widely. Some feel rivalry, driven by the desire to assert dominance in the region. Others feel respect, recognising the impressive work Durham have done to build a competitive team without the backing of a men’s club. Some feel indifference, seeing Durham as just another opponent. And some feel something more complicated, a blend of admiration, competitiveness and local pride.\n\nDurham’s identity plays a significant role in shaping these reactions.\n\nThey’re unique in the women’s game, a standalone club built from the ground up, operating without the financial or structural support that comes from being attached to a Premier League or Championship men’s side. Their success has been earned through graft, smart recruitment and a clear sense of who they are. For many Sunderland fans, that commands respect; after all, it’s hard not to admire a club that’s carved out its own place in the league, often outperforming teams with far greater resources.\n\nAt the same time, that uniqueness can make them feel like outsiders in a region where football identity is deeply intertwined with men’s clubs. Sunderland fans may respect Durham, but they don’t necessarily feel emotionally connected to them. The lack of shared history, shared colours or shared tribalism means the fixture doesn’t automatically carry the emotional weight of a derby.\n\nAnd yet, for some, that emotional weight is still there, originating not from history but from competition.\n\nSunderland and Durham have often found themselves in similar positions in the table, fighting for points, pride and progress. Those matches have mattered. They’ve been intense, physical and closely contested. Even without decades of rivalry behind them, the stakes have created their own sense of significance.\n\nThis leads naturally to another question: “Do Sunderland fans want to see Durham do well when they’re not playing Sunderland?”\n\nSome fans genuinely want Durham to succeed, seeing it as good for the region, good for the women’s game and good for raising the profile of football in the North East. They appreciate the idea of two strong local teams pushing each other, creating competitive tension that benefits both clubs. They see Durham as a positive force; a club that has earned its place and deserves recognition.\n\nOthers, however, feel differently.\n\nThey don’t necessarily want Durham to struggle but they don’t want them to thrive either — at least not to the point where they threaten Sunderland’s ambitions. For these fans, local proximity creates a sense of territorial instinct: “Sunderland should be the dominant force in the region”, “Sunderland should be the club setting the standard”, “Durham doing well is fine, as long as Sunderland are doing better”.\n\nAnd then there are those who simply don’t care. Their emotional investment begins and ends with Sunderland and what Durham do outside of the derby is irrelevant. Their success or failure has no bearing on their own sense of pride or frustration. They see Durham as a competitor and nothing more.\n\nThe emotional complexity deepens when you ask whether the fixture carries any weight for fans.\n\nSome supporters feel the fixture carries real emotional significance. The matches are often tight, physical and competitive, and that alone can give them a sense of importance. There’s also the local element of two North East clubs, close in distance and often close in the table, meeting in games that tend to matter. For those fans, Sunderland versus Durham has an edge to it, even if it isn’t steeped in decades of history.\n\nFor others, the fixture doesn’t stir the same emotions.\n\nIt matters because every league game matters, but it doesn’t carry the extra charge that comes with longstanding rivalries. The atmosphere might be lively and the football competitive, yet the emotional stakes feel no higher than usual. For these supporters, Sunderland versus Durham is shaped more by the ebb and flow of the season than by any deeper sense of identity or history.\n\nThat contrast reflects the broader reality of women’s football rivalries, which are still forming, still shifting and still finding their place.\n\nUnlike the men’s game, where the emotional landscape has been carved out over generations, the women’s game is building its own narratives in real time. Sunderland versus Durham sits right in the middle of that process — a fixture that means different things to different people, shaped as much by personal experience as by club identity or geography.\n\nFrom Sunderland’s perspective, the rivalry — if it can be called that — is shaped by ambition.\n\nSunderland want to grow, to improve and to become the team they know they can be. Durham, therefore, by virtue of being close, competitive and consistently present in the same division, naturally become a benchmark. Beating Durham matters because it signals progress and finishing above them matters because it reinforces ambition. The rivalry, such as it is, is rooted in aspiration rather than animosity.\n\nFrom Durham’s perspective, the dynamic is different.\n\nSunderland are the bigger club, with a larger fanbase, deeper history and a more established identity. For Durham, competing with Sunderland is a statement of their own growth and beating them is a marker of their own progress.\n\nThe rivalry, if they feel a sense of it, is shaped by the desire to prove themselves against a club with greater resources and greater expectations, and this creates a fascinating dynamic.\n\nThe fixture isn’t by fuelled by hatred or hostility and nor is it a ‘derby’ in the traditional sense, but it is competitive, meaningful and emotionally charged in its own way. It’s a rivalry built on proximity, ambition and identity rather than history — and that’s what makes it so interesting.\n\nIn the end, whether this represents a rivalry, a derby or simply a meeting of two ambitious North East clubs is something each supporter decides for themselves. Whatever we call it, the fixture keeps asking questions about identity, loyalty and what it really means to belong in a region where football is never just football.\n\nI’d love to hear about how other Sunderland supporters see this fixture.\n\nWhether you feel the pull of a derby, the edge of a rivalry or simply the curiosity of two North East clubs crossing paths, your perspective adds something real to the story. Tell me what Sunderland versus Durham means to you — the emotions, the indifference, the pride, the tension or anything in between — and let us build a picture of this fixture through the voices of the people who live it.",

    "description": "Sunderland eased past Oxford on Sunday, but how did Régis Le Bris use his squad in order to advance in the FA Cup?",
    "fullText": "Sunderland were back in FA Cup action at the weekend, taking a welcome break from the league as they returned to the Kassam Stadium for the first time since May to face an Oxford side who’ve struggled in the EFL this season.\n\nWith a chance to rest and rotate but the potential for a slip-up after losing there last season, how did Régis Le Bris manage the game and keep Oxford at arm’s length to ensure Sunderland were in the draw for the last sixteen?\n\nAfter suffering back-to-back defeats for the first time this season, changes were expected from Le Bris as his players put in two huge shifts against Arsenal and Liverpool — this providing a chance for some of the players who hadn’t featured much to get a full match under their belts.\n\nMaking six changes from Wednesday night’s game, he opted to retain the spine of his side whilst rewarding the remainder with a starting spot.\n\nOmar Alderete was absent from the squad following his knock on Wednesday, whilst Dan Ballard didn’t travel either. Luke O’Nien returned to the centre of defence to partner Nordi Mukiele, Trai Hume dropped back to his usual spot at right back and Dennis Cirkin came in for Reinildo, who also didn’t travel after playing 180 minutes in five days the week earlier.\n\nElsewhere, Lutsharel Geertruida came in for Noah Sadiki in order to anchor the midfield, whilst Habib Diarra and Enzo Le Fée retained their places from Wednesday. In the forward line, Brian Brobbey was rested in favour of Wilson Isidor, with Chemsdine Talbi and Romaine Mundle starting on the flanks having featured off the bench in midweek.\n\nWith Oxford United switching between a back four and five in recent weeks, Le Bris could’ve been tempted to match up their shape. However, favoured his traditional 4-3-3 system with one holding midfield pivot and two more advanced supporting central midfielders.\n\nDespite both wingers being deployed on both sides during their time at Sunderland, it was Mundle who was picked to play off the left whilst Talbi took up a spot on the right — where he started the season.\n\nMatt Bloomfield has had a rough time of things since taking over at the Kassam Stadium, with his side having not scored in their last four home games.\n\nFollowing a midweek humbling by Norwich City, Bloomfield opted to make some changes to allow for fresh legs and therefore saw eight changes from midweek. With wholesale changes across the front four and further changes in midfield, defence and in goal, Bloomfield opted for a back four and tried to match Sunderland up in their shape.\n\nWith a similarly aggressive style of play and a reliance on physical duels that’s worked so well for Sunderland this year, Bloomfield was looking to utilise the ‘dark arts’ in order to level the playing field a little. Therefore, facing a barrage of long throws and direct attacks, Sunderland needed to be up for the fight or Oxford could’ve made things ugly.\n\nWith Spurs loanee Will Lankashear capable of causing problems for central defenders due to his sheer size and physical profile, and a midfield pairing of Will Vaulks and Cameron Brannagan, Sunderland needed to be wary of the threat posed by the home side.\n\nThe opening ten minutes set the tone for the remainder of the game as neither team was really able to put a foot on the ball and construct consistent passages of build-up play from the off.\n\nAfter heavy rainfall prior to kick off, it was clear that an aerial-based affair was going to interrupt Sunderland’s usual rhythm, however, after riding out the initial storm, Sunderland were able to settle in.\n\nAssigned as the aggressors, Sunderland enjoyed the lion’s share of possession at 54%, but with less than three hundred passes completed throughout the whole game, tit raised a rather interesting point around how long was spent motionless on the ball or with it simply out of play.\n\nSunderland were clearly aware of the dangers posed by teams.\n\nWe counter-attacked when defending in a low block, therefore most of the passive possession actually occurred in either the Sunderland half or the middle third of the pitch. Utilising Geertruida as a pivot allowed Oxford’s press to essentially funnel play towards O’Nien — who simply reverted back to Roefs in order to go long or simply across to the spare man to start again.\n\nIn nullifying Oxford’s ability to make crowd-pleasing tackles and instead taking regular hits to win fouls and break up the play, Sunderland were able to limit the hosts to shots from distance and their first real opportunity of note didn’t arrive until Christ Makosso was able to direct a header past the post on the stroke of half time.\n\nJamie Donnolly was able to force a comfortable punch from Roefs early on, but with only five attempts in the first half — producing an xG rating of 0.34 — Sunderland recorded their most comfortable first half of the season from an away defensive standpoint.\n\nUnder Le Bris, Sunderland’s wingers have traditionally hugged the touchline in a bid to stretch the play and provide the advanced midfielders with space to push forward and form the triangles that were so pivotal to Sunderland’s success last season in the Championship.\n\nIn this game however, both Mundle and Talbi were tasked with underlapping into the half-spaces and rotating with Le Fée and Diarra respectively in order to create passing angles and free up the two midfielders by providing space out wide for them to receive the ball without pressure.\n\nAs each winger moved infield, they dragged their marker inside and forced double-teams from the Oxford press. The vacated space subsequently allowed both Diarra and Le Fée to ghost in and provided a creative solution, allowing them to dictate the game away from their usual positions due to midfield congestion and a tight defensive shape.\n\nWhilst initially done to help the central midfielders, in the second half it worked to the advantage of the wingers as Oxford were drawn to Le Fée out wide and instead created separation in the previously congested half-spaces for both Mundle and Talbi to attack on the half-turn.\n\nBoth wingers were able to spring into space at separate intervals before rifling shots off — Talbi in particular stinging the gloves of Ingram and without a great save, it would’ve nestled in the top corner.\n\nRomaine Mundle has divided opinions among the Sunderland fans in recent weeks, but there’s no mistaking the impact he had on the side during his first full season following the departure of Jack Clarke in the summer of 2024.\n\nMundle has suffered several serious setbacks during his time on Wearside and whilst the tools and talent were clearly there, injury was always going to have an effect on the winger.\n\nIt’s clear that Sunderland have been fair to Mundle in his recovery after rushing him back for the playoffs last season and ultimately sidelining him for longer than expected, with extended spells given to the winger whenever the club feel it’s been appropriate to do so.\n\nAs a confidence-based winger, Mundle gains a great deal from good performances and even if the calibre of the opposition was a little lower here, it was great to see him attacking the game.\n\nHe completed 12/15 dribbles (80%) — a staggering percentage to have attempted in a single game — whilst also winning 20/32 ground duels, showing that he was willing to get stuck in and really impress the travelling fans. Several mazy runs almost resulted in great goals, but the end product wasn’t quite there on the day.\n\nWith two new arrivals breathing down his neck, Mundle did a great job — both in his ability to show close control in isolated one-versus-one situations but also in his ability to buy fouls and slow the game down, winning the most fouls by any Sunderland player on the day.\n\nWhilst he hasn’t been able to directly impact games this season in the way of goals or assists, he’s only going to get back to his best with live match practice and his performance was another example of what he’s capable of when fully fit.\n\nA top performance from Romaine 🤩 pic.twitter.com/QrN8cETmMq\n\n— Sunderland AFC (@SunderlandAFC) February 16, 2026\n\nAfter signing for Sunderland last month, Ta Bi has been slowly integrating himself into the Wearside bubble whilst recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nThe young Ivorian came on for the final ten minutes of the game and looked really lively down the right. With a clear first step, he looks to have a real burst of acceleration when attacking and he showed some really tidy close control with the ball at his feet.\n\nWhilst advanced analytics struggle to provide much data on the youngster, he did eclipse the record set for completed dribbles within the Israeli Premier League in only half a season.\n\nHis close control against Premier League defenders might not look so impressive; however, he looked like he could be really dangerous and a huge asset when coming off the bench for Sunderland this season.\n\nWith a week to rest before the Lads return home to face Fulham on Sunday, Sunderland now have a real chance to kick on with a much kinder run of fixtures over the next month and beyond.\n\nIf Sunderland have genuine aspirations of a top ten finish this season, the upcoming run of fixtures is likely to have a huge bearing and in order to keep pace with the European-chasers, we’ll need to turn some of those away performances into points whilst converting home draws into wins.\n\nOnce the forty point mark is reached, I’m sure the cup will become a priority, but who could resist competing on both fronts?",

    "description": "“A good cup run and a top-half finish would constitute a fantastic campaign!” writes Paddy Hollis.",
    "fullText": "Being promoted to the Premier League is an achievement almost every football club dreams of, but only a certain few can make a reality.\n\nIn May 2025, Sunderland gained promotion to the top flight for the first time in nearly a decade, in the most exciting and dramatic way possible, and with around a third of our first season back now complete, things couldn’t have gone much better for us.\n\nWe’re in mid-table, within touching distance of the European places, twelve points clear of the relegation zone, and we have a derby win — among nine victories this season. \n\nWe’re also into the last sixteen of the FA Cup for the first time in over a decade and guaranteed to play a team from a lower division in the next round, which adds to the belief that we’re having a great season. \n\nBack in the summer, our hopes and expectations for the Premier League were to survive, and seventeenth place come May 2026 would constitute a successful season regardless of how we achieved it. By Christmas, these hopes changed, with our strong form moving us away from the aim of survival to dreaming of mid-table and possibly even more.\n\nWe’ve been on a tough run of late.\n\nThere’s no denying that, and four defeats in six is tricky, but I’ll caveat this and say two of those losses came against two of the best sides in the league, and one was away at a very good Brentford side whilst we had several key players out. As for West Ham, that was a good old-fashioned dreadful day at the office — it happens.\n\nIn the summer, there was a conscious effort by sections of the fanbase to prepare for dips in form. We were spoilt in the first few months of the season, with every loss being followed by a win, meaning this anticipated poor run hasn’t appeared until January/February.\n\nWe knew poor runs would come — they happen to every team in almost every league.\n\nThe Premier League can be ruthless but Sunderland have stood up to the task on more than a few occasions. Back-to-back defeats against Arsenal and then Liverpool is a small run most teams in the league would go through given these fixtures, so there’s no reason why our losses should be gone over with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nAfter this weekend, there’ll be just ten games left of our first season back in the Premier League — a campaign which is flying by. Each week, it feels as though we’ve kept the points tally ticking over, so I’ve not realised how quickly the games were getting chalked off.\n\nA good cup run — say, to the quarter finals — and a top half finish would constitute a fantastic campaign and a brilliant platform from which to build on for next season. If we do drop off to around thirteenth or fourteenth and still comfortably survive, this will also be a great achievement.\n\nIt’s possible to have both high expectations and to also not get frustrated when we slip into mid-table from the heights of the top eight we reached just a few weeks ago. Beat Fulham and we could be back in that position despite a tough run of results, which once again goes to show the value of getting points on the board in the way we have.\n\nWe’ve got eleven huge league games and at least one cup match left of what’s been a brilliant season. Relegation is a lingering worry that edges further onto the horizon with each passing week, so why shouldn’t we keep on looking up rather than down?",

There's a lot of sacrifice to race at that level and work full-time,\" said Matthew.\n\nBut, for Billy, it is all worth it: \"The pure adrenaline rush that you get out of it just trying to go as fast as you can, it's really good fun,\" he said.\n\nBilly is one of 17 apprentices at SPP Pumps, who provide large water pump systems globally.\n\nMatthew said he felt it was important for his son to have a \"plan B\".\n\n\"In five years' time, he'll be a qualified engineer and he'll still be racing bikes,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"We hope he gets the best of both worlds,\" Matthew added.\n\nThe race season starts for Billy in April at the iXS European Downhill Cup in Portugal, with his eyes set on a place at the World Championships in South Korea later this year.\n\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The series will also have appearances from some of the biggest international superstars, and there will be multiple World Title fights on each event.\n\nChatri Sityodtong, Chairman and CEO of ONE Championship, said: “In the past, Japanese martial arts organizations like K-1 and PRIDE were at their peak and were number one in the world. However, as they declined, the Japanese martial arts scene has been declining as well. ONE will create a new future for martial arts for Japanese fighters and fans. We will create Japanese martial arts heroes.”\n\nShuntaro Tanaka, CEO of Japan and Group Chief Commercial Officer, said: “It’s not all about stories and heroes – that’s Chatri’s philosophy of creating value. I listened to Chatri’s words about creating world-class heroes, about revitalizing martial arts and creating future plans, about wanting to work together to inspire and move people from the IP side. I also accepted his offer because personally, I have always loved martial arts.”\n\nU-NEXT, Japan’s leading streaming service with 12 million subscribers, will exclusively broadcast all ONE Samurai events, with ONE Championship committing to produce 60 events over five years. Global broadcast details will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe inaugural event, ONE Samurai 1, will be held at the Ariake Arena in Tokyo on Wednesday, April 29. Tickets are on sale now via ePlus and Zaiko.\n\nYuya Wakamatsu, ONE Flyweight MMA World Champion, said: “I can embody the dream of becoming ‘the modern samurai.’ I think this is the best stage to continue defending and proving that Japanese [athletes] are strong. I want fans to enjoy the battles and feel the courage at ONE Samurai.”\n\nNadaka Yoshinari, ONE Atomweight Muay Thai World Champion, said: “Last year, I appeared twice at events held in Japan, and I saw the excitement for martial arts’ return. I’m looking forward to seeing how much more excitement Japanese events will generate with ONE Samurai. In Muay Thai, I believe I’m world-class, so no matter which opponents challenge me, I will show complete fights and firmly defend this belt.”\n\nTakeru Segawa, former three-division K-1 Champion, said: “Now that ONE’s major Japanese events will be held here, the world’s strongest fighters will gather. I think ONE Samurai will be a major event that proves Japanese strength and puts martial arts at the center in Japan. I’m only one fight in, but I want to elevate ONE Samurai and connect it to the next generation. Even though my next fight is my retirement fight, I will prove my world-class strength and cap off ONE Samurai’s first major event in the best form.”\n\nYuki Yoza, former K-1 Champion, said: “I want to elevate ONE Samurai not just by challenging foreign fighters, but by surpassing my seniors. Since Takeru is retiring, I want to become the ace of ONE Samurai.”",

    "fullText": "There was no mistaking the school with the loftier boys basketball tradition Wednesday night.\n\nThe Alta Hawks brought their history, which includes four state championships, to Hillcrest High to take on the Huskies in a matchup between the 5A tourney’s No. 16 and No. 17 seeds.\n\nCrew Eckman scored 17 points, Colin Hansen had 13 and Coby Goodfellow 10 as the Hawks’ postseason heritage continued with a 60-48 over the Huskies in a first-round game at Hillcrest’s gym.\n\nAlta coach Travis Ohrn said he was proud his team advanced after a .500 season that was jilted by injuries to two of the team’s top players. The Hawks were no match for Region 6’s top three teams but they now have a chance to add another memorable event to school history Friday when they travel to take on top-seeded Timpview.\n\n“That’s why we play ‘em (the games). Our kids will have no trouble getting motivated,” said Ohrn, who beat Timpview for the crown in 2023 but lost to the Thunderbirds last year in a quarterfinal.\n\n“We know who’s next but we played good team basketball (tonight) and I knew if we kept doing what we were doing, we would get stops.”\n\nThe Hawks brought their boisterous student crowd and they had plenty to cheer about until their team’s 11-point second-quarter lead dipped to 42-39 early in the third quarter. At that point, however, Eckman broke loose for a layup, Hansen followed with a pair of free throws and Caleb Anderson made a short jumper.\n\nHillcrest never recovered. The Huskies, who sailed through most of their Region 4 schedule and finished the season with an impressive 15-9 record, hurt themselves with turnovers and also made just 4-of-8 free throws in the final period.\n\n“We’re undersized,” said Ohrn, who praised the 6-foot-6 Anderson and 6-2 Goodfellow for giving the Hawks a 26-22 rebound advantage. “It’s great to see kids step up when needed and at this time of the year.”\n\nHillcrest was led by Anthony Burris, who had 13 points off the bench, including a pair of three-pointers. Tyler Ashby and Cyrus Nielsen added 11 points each. The Huskies came a long way after losing 86-32 to Olympus in the season opener and had a 2-5 record after the first month of the regular season.",

    "title": "‘I Came Here To Become A Champion’ – Vero Sees Shir Cohen As Final Step Toward Gold At ONE Friday Fights 143",
    "description": "The Myanmar sensation looks to extend her streak against the Israeli star in their atomweight Muay Thai main event.",
    "fullText": "After two consecutive victories, Myanmar sensation Vero “The Kayan Leopard” is now setting her sights on ONE Championship gold. But before she can think about a World Title opportunity, she must overcome the toughest test of her career to date.\n\nOn February 20, the 29-year-old will face Israeli standout Shir Cohen in an atomweight Muay Thai showdown at ONE Friday Fights 143, airing live in Asia primetime from Bangkok’s legendary Lumpinee Stadium.\n\nLike Vero, Cohen arrives with serious credentials. The Israeli striker owns a 3-0 record in the world’s largest martial arts organization and was once positioned as a frontrunner for gold. That shared ambition only fuels Vero’s determination heading into their main event clash.\n\n“I’ve fought in this event three times already. Each opponent was different, each style was different. My first fight was completely new for me – everything changed my life. It was very hard. In my second fight, I won by knockout. In my latest fight, I won by decision. My opponent was difficult, but I tried my best. I think I did my best and I learned a lot.”\n\nVero entered ONE Friday Fights 97 in February 2025 with considerable hype as one of Myanmar’s brightest striking stars. However, she suffered a narrow split-decision loss to Francisca “Miss Scarface” Vera in a fiercely contested battle.\n\nAfter that setback, the Tiger Muay Thai representative recalibrated quickly. She stopped Junior Fairtex via first-round TKO at ONE Friday Fights 107, then edged Li Mingrui by split decision at ONE Friday Fights 132 to build a two-fight streak.\n\nNow, with her first main event assignment ahead of her, Vero understands the magnitude of the moment:\n\n“This Friday is very important for me. It’s my first time fighting in the main event. It’s important for me and for Myanmar. Please support me even more.\n\n“I’ve known Shir Cohen for a long time. Before she fought in ONE, I saw her fight at Fairtex [Fights]. She’s very good and she’s a nice person. We’re friends on Instagram. I’m happy many Myanmar fans also like her.”\n\nVero owns nearly 30 professional victories, many earned in her native sport of lethwei, and has steadily adapted to ONE’s 4-ounce Muay Thai format.\n\nThe smaller gloves reward sharper focus and punish hesitation, lessons she has embraced through experiences that have only strengthened her resolve.\n\n“I came here to become a champion. And for everyone in Myanmar who believes in me, this Friday I will show the best version of myself. I don’t care about pain. I’m ready.”\n\nAt ONE Friday Fights 143, Vero will meet Shir Cohen in a matchup between two surging contenders with World Title aspirations.\n\nCohen enters with a perfect 3-0 promotional record and refined striking fundamentals. The Israeli athlete blends speed, sharp combinations, and intelligent movement, making her one of the division’s most technically polished competitors.\n\nHaving studied her upcoming adversary closely, Vero said:\n\n“Her style leans toward kickboxing. Her punching fundamentals are very good. Her Muay Thai is good too, but I think she stands out \n\n“I think she’s not as strong in the clinch. When she punches, sometimes she walks forward too much. If she meets someone who fights smart and intercepts well, that could be a problem. That’s what I think. I’ve studied how to deal with her.”\n\nCohen was previously scheduled to challenge ONE Women’s Atomweight Muay Thai World Champion Allycia Hellen Rodrigues at ONE Fight Night 29 last year before an injury forced her to withdraw. That missed opportunity stalled her pursuit, and this bout marks a crucial step in rebuilding that momentum.\n\nVero understands exactly what defeating such an opponent would mean:\n\n“One year ago, she was scheduled to fight for the title. She’s very experienced. If I beat her, I should get a title shot too. She’s been here longer than me. Passing her is a very important test.”\n\nThe opportunity is clear. A decisive victory would place Vero firmly in the ONE World Championship conversation.\n\nBut beyond that, her focus remains on execution.\n\n“My plan is to fight smart. I want to be a fighter who uses her brain, not just rush forward. I want to be relaxed but heavy. If there’s a chance to knock her out, I’ll wait for the moment and finish it. I want to win by knockout or by clear decision.\n\n“If I win by knockout, I hope I can fight for the title next.”",

    "fullText": "In the Borders town of Jedburgh there are no fears of its historic hand ba' game dying out any time soon - unlike so many others already have across the UK.\n\nThe Uppies and the Doonies are set to do battle once again on its streets on the first Thursday after Shrove Tuesday just as they have for centuries.\n\nFormer provost Len Wyse said young people were \"more enthusiastic than ever\" to take part in proceedings.\n\nMany other similar street sports have been stopped due to the property damage and disruption they cause but he said it remained a popular pursuit in Jedburgh.\n\nThe first record of the Jedburgh event is in 1704 - although it was not held in 1901 when it clashed with Queen Victoria's funeral.\n\nAn attempt was made to stop the contest in 1849, citing the town's cholera outbreak, but that was overruled at the Court of Session.\n\n\"Hand ba' has gone on for many, many years - some people are not exactly sure how many,\" said Len.\n\n\"It originated - some say - from when we were fighting the English and got the Englishman's head and we used to roll it about the town.\n\nWhatever its origins, it remains a popular pursuit.\n\n\"We have got these small leather balls made and they have got ribbons on them depicting different things,\" explained Len.\n\n\"Like if it is somebody's wedding anniversary - like a ruby wedding - we will put ruby coloured ribbons on.\"\n\nThe two teams fight for possession of the ball and look to take it to opposite ends of the town.\n\n\"The Uppies are going up the Castlegate and they throw the ball over the castle railings and that is their score,\" said Len.\n\n\"The Doonies, they go 'doon the toon', and they roll it along the road and there is an underground stream that they roll it over and that gives them a score.\"\n\nThe sport is an easy one to learn and has remained the same for centuries.\n\nMore stories from South Scotland\n\nListen to news for the Scottish Borders on BBC Sounds\n\n\"There is only one rule and that is you don't kick the ball - you are only meant to throw it, smuggle it, whatever,\" he said.\n\n\"There is nothing really changed.\n\n\"The shopkeepers board up their windows because it is played on the High Street - they don't stop traffic or anything.\n\n\"Fortunately the A68 got diverted many years ago so it doesn't go through the middle of town.\"\n\nAlthough his playing days are behind him, Len has fond memories of one sneaky move for his team.\n\n\"I scored one a few years ago for the Uppies,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I was quite fortunate - it rolled out the maul and I just picked it up and nobody saw me so I just put it in my pocket, walked up to the Castlegate and I scored.\"\n\nHe said he was confident its popularity would last for years to come with competitors coming from other areas which still have similar games.\n\n\"There are a great deal of folk play in it,\" he said.\n\n\"It brings them in from other towns too. We get folk from Ancrum, Denholm and Bonchester - that's three places that all have their own ba'.\"\n\nHe added that the next generation seemed keen to maintain the tradition.\n\n\"The school let them away early to play - you get a great deal of youngsters turning up, they are more enthusiastic than ever,\" he said.\n\nThat means he is confident that it will not follow other events which have died out down the years.\n\n\"It won't because there are a lot of youngsters taking it up - playing it, but also looking after it,\" he added.\n\nUp'Ards go ahead on first day of Shrovetide Football\n\nUppies battle Doonies in town's historic ba' game",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona are preparing a new contract to ward off interest in Marc Casado as Manchester United eye a bombshell move for the 22-year-old midfielder, according to the latest report from Spain.\n\nThe Red Devils are on the hunt for a replacement for Casemiro, with the Brazilian behemoth set to leave Old Trafford after the club decided against renewing his expensive contract.\n\nKobbie Mainoo has been reborn under caretaker coach Michael Carrick, who took the reins from Ruben Amorim after INEOS brought an end to Amorim’s tumultuous tenure last month.\n\nIn a long line of perplexing decisions by the former Sporting Clube de Portugal manager, his aversion to Mainoo was perhaps the most baffling. Carrick has immediately corrected this error, while also restoring Bruno Fernandes to his rightful position as a No.10.\n\nHowever, the dismal form of Manuel Ugarte leaves the double pivot in midfield as the weakest area of the pitch for United, with a growing belief the Uruguay international will be shown the exit door alongside Casemiro this summer.\n\nThe club’s primary targets are Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton. All three players are expected to cost up to £100 million, however, with the exorbitant Premier League tax rearing its ugly head.\n\nAs such, United are also considering ‘cheaper’ midfielders on the continent – with Casado emerging as a highly rated option at the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nA report relayed by The Peoples Person reveals the Spain international is seen as a “crucial opportunity” to strengthen a stalling engine room, given Barcelona’s financial difficulties could facilitate a cut-price deal.\n\nThe Spanish giants are intent on keeping Casado at the Camp Nou, however, and have begun steps to ensure his long-term future remains in Catalonia.\n\nIn response to the growing interest in their academy graduate, with Atletico Madrid also in the hunt, Barcelona are ready to open talks over a new long-term deal, according to Diario Sport.\n\nCasado’s current contract expires in 2028 and contains a release clause worth €100 million – but the Blaugrana will “intensify” negotiations in the coming weeks to extend this after “initial contact” between both parties.\n\nThe Spaniard is understood to be fully committed to the current campaign. He is expected to wait until the summer before making a final decision on his long-term future, giving United a chance to convince him his future lies in Manchester.\n\nThis is a rapidly evolving situation which will be one to keep a close eye on as July 1st approaches and the Red Devils solidify their succession plan for Casemiro.\n\nCasado’s profile – an all-action midfield dynamo, combining outstanding work rate off the ball with quality on it – is a sensible one for United.\n\nIt will simply come down to whether a cut-price deal can be struck for the midfield enforcer due to uncertainty at Camp Nou, and the prospect of more first-team opportunities at Old Trafford.\n\nFeatured image Pedro Salado via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

The first- and second-place teams in the WCC during the regular season earn byes into the conference tournament semifinals.\n\nThe Gaels' final three regular-season games are at Washington State and home against Santa Clara and Gonzaga.\n\nMikey Lewis scored a game-high 22 points for St. Mary's, which also got 15 points apiece from Paulius Murauskas and Andrew McKeever.\n\nSt. Mary's broke open a close game early, breaking from a 7-7 tie to take a 21-7 lead at the halfway mark of the first half.\n\nBut the Redhawks (16-12, 5-10) steadily worked their way back before taking a 53-52 lead with 9:28 to play. From that point on, neither team led by more than two points until Dent's two free throws with 15 seconds to play gave the Gaels a 71-68 lead.\n\nWill Heimbrodt responded with a layup with 10 seconds left to cut Seattle's deficit to one. Forced to foul, the Redhawks again sent Dent to the line where he made 1 of 2 with five seconds left. Seattle didn't get a shot off after Dent missed the second free throw.\n\nJunseok Yeo led Seattle with 20 points.\n\nMaya Anderson scored a game-high 22 points and San Jose State broke a six-game losing streak with a 58-56 Mountain West Conference defeat of Utah State at Provident Credit Union Event Center.\n\nThe win was only the second in MWC play for the Spartans (2-14, 4-23).\n\nAnderson made 7 of 13 shots from the field - including 2 of 3 from distance - and 6 of 9 free throws to top 20 points for the third time this season.\n\nAitana Rosello Lopez led the Aggies (6-19, 2-14) with 14 points.\n\nThis article originally published at Local college basketball: St. Mary's men avoid upset, SJSU women snap skid.",

    "description": "Poor projections set up for a surprise",
    "fullText": "Despite multiple additions early in Spring Training, the San Diego Padres took a step back in 2026 projections according to both FanGraphs and PECOTA (Baseball Prospectus). In January, the numbers projected significant steps back for multiple players on the team but the lack of adding any higher tier talent seems to have negatively affected how the analytics view the Padres for the upcoming season.\n\nAt this point, FanGraphs projects a 79-83 record and fourth place finish in the NL West for the Friars. PECOTA is only slightly better at 80-82. While noting the loss of Dylan Cease, Luis Arraez, Yu Darvish and Robert Suarez, the poor projections for the remaining team from last year drags down any possible upside their additions could give the rankings.\n\nLast season’s lack of power continues\n\nThe only player projected to have a better season than last year is Jackson Merrill. Every other position player is worse or about the same in assessing their performance. While projecting Luis Campusano, Nick Castellanos, Sung-Mun Song and Bryce Johnson as the bench players, none of them have an fWAR above 0.8.\n\nMiguel Andujar is the platoon partner for Gavin Sheets or the DH and his fWAR is 0.6. No Padre position player has an fWAR above 5.4 (Fernando Tatis Jr.) while many are between 0.5 and 1.5. Tatis Jr. is projected to lead the team with 30 homers.\n\nThe starting pitchers fair no better. Michael King will only get 161 innings with a 3.68 ERA. Nick Pivetta takes a big step back with a 3.92 ERA and Joe Musgrove gets a 3.89 ERA projection. There is no belief in Randy Vasquez at 4.79 and Germán Márquez is the projected fifth starter with a 5.03 ERA.\n\nThe bullpen also gets very little love with lefty Adrian Morejon, who is widely considered a top reliever and was recently listed by MLB Network as a top 10 reliever in baseball, given an fWAR of 1.1 and a 3.40 ERA. Only Mason Miller gets any respect with a 2.44 ERA and fWAR of 2.3.\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels, St. Louis Cardinals, Tampa Bay Rays, Cleveland Guardians, Athletics and Cincinnati Reds are all listed as having better odds of making the playoffs than the Padres. With the Dodgers listed at 94% to win the division and 99% to make the playoffs, the Padres come in at 1.2% to win the division and 22.1% to make the playoffs.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants come in at 37.4% to make the playoffs and the Arizona Diamondbacks are at 32% to make the playoffs. The Padres got the benefit of the doubt for much of the offseason with multiple projections listing them as the second or third best team in the NL West. That is no longer the case.\n\nThe only way to get national respect for this team in 2026 was if A.J. Preller agreed with the media around the league and traded away Tatis Jr. in order to acquire a power bat and top-tier starter. Trading the organization’s best player doesn’t seem like a good way to improve a team that finished with 90 wins last season. Preller made it clear early on that was not an option and he recently stated that shedding salary was not a priority.\n\nWhile Preller has backloaded the team with starters returning from injury to compete for the fifth spot in the rotation, Randy Vasquez is facing a pivotal season in his career. Vasquez is out of options and must make the staff or be off-loaded at the end of spring. Reports from pitching coach Ruben Niebla and manager Craig Stammen has reflected that Vasquez has made the effort to take that step forward and has held onto the advances made at the end of last season.\n\nThe bats added, Castellanos and Andujar as 1B/DH options and Ty France as more of a defensive option, don’t deliver the power that fans had hoped. This puts the burden on the current roster to step up their game.\n\nNone of this goes into the projections seen on FanGraphs and Baseball Prospectus. They use algorithms and underlying metrics as well as aging statistics to determine their estimates. As fans who watch this team and know the players character and motivation, we can argue the numbers listed in these projections are devoid of the determination that we know these players exhibit.\n\nWill the heart and character of the players play a role in helping the Padres outperform these numbers?\n\nXander Bogaerts and Manny Machado can’t avoid the inevitability of aging. But not every player ages the same way and there are plenty of examples of good performances well into some athletes 30s. It is true that neither of them will play their pivotal positions for much longer, but the math used for these numbers doesn’t take into account the uniqueness of each player.\n\nIf just a few of the players play to the same level they did last season; if Tatis Jr. finds more power and Merrill stays healthy and takes another step forward; if Machado and Bogaerts stay relatively healthy and don’t regress as much as expected; then the offense should be fine. No matter if Andujar and Castellano aren’t big power hitters, both are improvements over Jason Heyward and Yuli Gurriel.\n\nThe Padres won’t have as many singles with Luis Arraez gone but Tatis Jr. will have better lineup protection with Merrill (or Bogaerts?) hitting behind him. The bottom of the lineup has little power as it presently stands unless Castellanos breaks out, Gavin Sheets plays above last year or another bat is added. But all of these issues were much worse last year and somehow this team finished three games behind the Dodgers.\n\nPreller may not be done, there is lots of time left for more moves and still plenty of decent players looking for jobs. The trade market will still be busy for another few weeks and I don’t know that we have ever seen Preller go a whole offseason without a trade.\n\nWith just a little luck, maybe the Padres can surprise some people. A snake-in-the-grass isn’t always a bad thing.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Undermanned, undersized and underqualified.\n\nYou can chalk up the USC Trojans 2025-2026 men's basketball campaign to one outlier: Injuries.\n\nTrojans head coach Eric Musselman has remarked on numerous occasions that Year Two under his management has been plagued by the lack of depth, primarily due to said injuries, with Rodney Rice, Amarion Dickerson, and now the newly banged-up Chad Baker-Mazara.\n\nMusselman has scratched the injuries as an excuse for his team's results, and recent losses have expanded the importance of those missing pieces.\n\nWednesday night would be no different.\n\nFrom the jump, USC would enter the Galen Center against the No.10 ranked Illinois Fighting Illini bruised and battered, playing yet another game without their leading scorer in Baker-Mazara, who was slated as day-to-day with a knee injury and freshman Alijah Arenas fighting an illness.\n\nMix that in with a poor performance all around from the rest of the Trojans on both ends of the floor, and the final score of 101-65 made sense.\n\n“I didn’t think USC played well on either side of the ball,” Musselman said in his opening statement to the media in the postgame.\n\nThat's as flat an answer as you're going to get in terms of the Trojans performance.\n\nBefore player introductions, the Illini faithful came in bunches and painted the Galen Center a sea of orange and blue in the stands.\n\nIllinois led 54-32 at the half, and that first half would be etched in the record books as the most efficient Division 1 men's college basketball over the last 30 years, according to statistician Ken Pomeroy.\n\nThe Fighting Illini were displaying a full-out shooting barrage as a team, with a total of seven players putting up double-digit figures in the points category.\n\nJunior guard Andrej Stojakovic led Illinois with 22 points on 6-7 shooting, and the Fighting Illini shot an impressive 52%.\n\nThe USC faithful had nothing to cheer about for 40 minutes and were eager to leave their seats once the final buzzer had rung.\n\nGranted, some fans did leave by the middle of the second half.\n\nThis was one of those games that USC has to chalk up fast and immediately hit the drawing board once more.\n\nUSC was simply outmatched, which is worth being heavily noted, and Musselman was very keen on focusing on the Trojans' next matchup against the Oregon Ducks this Saturday.",

    "description": "Here's Scottie Scheffler, and a poetic explanation of why we return to a \"frustrating\" game.",
    "fullText": "Scottie Scheffler took his right arm back, arched his back backward to the point where that arm was just above the back of his right knee, planted forward with his left leg — and threw.\n\nBut a good riddance. Now his ball had taken root among the trees near Riviera Country Club’s 11th green, where, two years ago at the Genesis Invitational, Scheffler had just sent a 5-foot birdie putt 4 feet past the hole.\n\nThe point here, though, besides wondering whether golf’s top-ranked player could have also been a quarterback of his hometown Dallas Cowboys?\n\nIf playing golf drives us to such frustration, why play golf? Clearly, there are other pursuits. A throw-a-ball-in-the-trees payoff sounds unpleasant. Scheffler said Wednesday that he doesn’t even have a proper method for measuring how good he is.\n\nThen again, maybe not being boxed in is freeing. Perhaps immeasurability is undeniably good.\n\nAt the least, Scheffler’s press conference ahead of this week’s Genesis Invitational wasn’t mundane. The session was reflective. Golf, he said, is limitless in its chances to learn. And if you’re the learning type like he is — “my mind has always been my greatest tool,” he said — that’s as welcome as a sunny day for a weekend tee time.\n\n“I think that’s why we keep practicing,” Scheffler said. “You never get to a place where you feel like you’ve got it figured out. I always like practicing and trying to improve and creating new shots.\n\n“I think golf is kind of the endless pursuit of trying to figure something out and I’m never going to get there, but there’s no harm in trying.”\n\nScheffler brought up rounds with Jordan Spieth, a fellow pro and longtime friend who he plays with often.\n\n“You talk about golf being this kind of endless pursuit of trying to figure this game out,” Scheffler said.\n\n“I play golf with Jordan a lot at home. I can learn so much just by watching and asking Jordan questions about the way he plays shots, and he does some things that are — work really well for him that wouldn’t work well for me and then certain ways he approaches things, I like asking questions and trying to figure things out.”\n\nIn this poetic explanation, you can keep coming back for more.\n\n“When it comes to competing in golf tournaments,” Scheffler said, “I can’t control what the other guy I’m playing with is doing. Like let’s say I’m tied for the lead going into the final round and I shoot 62 and the guy shoots 61. Yeah, I can definitely look at a few shots I’d want to have back, but at the end of the day, the tournament is over and you take your hat off, shake hands, say congratulations.\n\n“The great thing about golf is oftentimes we just get to show up the next week and start all over and compete again.”\n\nOver time, you even create friendships.\n\n“Like you look at a guy like Collin [Morikawa] last week,” Scheffler said. “I’ve been competing against Collin since we were like 14 years old. He wins a tournament, he announces he’s pregnant, and all of a sudden you just have this — it’s such a cool moment to see a guy who’s played really good golf over the last few years and hasn’t quite gotten the results and the wins, but he’s played pretty consistent golf, and then he gets to announce that he’s having a kid. It’s this moment, it’s like, wow. I competed as hard as I could, got beat, and it’s like, man, that’s awesome. You won, congrats.\n\n“You’re having a baby, even bigger congrats. Then we’re here this week and the prep just starts again.”\n\nSo yeah, same thing goes for throw-a-ball-in-the-trees moments.\n\nOn to the next hole. On to the next tournament. Here’s where things get really good.\n\nThe 2024 Genesis was the last tournament Scheffler played with the blade putter he hit that putt with on 11.\n\nAnd he’s since gone on to win 14 events, including three majors.\n\n“When things don’t go as planned,” Scheffler said, “I think it’s healthy to have a level of frustration with that, just because it takes so much work in order to get out here, and especially when you feel like you’re doing something right and doing things the right way and not getting the results.\n\n“I think it can always be frustrating, but I think that’s part of the game of golf is being able to manage that in order to execute the next shot.”\n\nThe post Why golfers keep playing ‘frustrating' game, according to Scottie Scheffler appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Football matches are not always won by the team with the strongest offense. Atlético Madrid has embodied this credo to perfection in recent years.\n\nThe team under coach Diego Simeone was known for an extremely well-organized defense, striking with cold precision and then retreating in a highly disciplined manner. Currently, however, there is little to nothing left of this Atleti.\n\nThis season, the Spaniards have been historically weak in defense. Yesterday’s 3-3 draw in the first leg of the Champions League playoffs against Club Brugge was already the ninth consecutive Champions League match in which they conceded at least one goal. When has that ever happened before? Never in the club’s history.\n\nIn the league as well, they recently suffered a clear 0-3 defeat against Rayo Vallecano. Six goals conceded in two games against the 17th-placed team in the league and against Brugge cannot be the standard for a top club. It almost seems as if the team has lost its identity. Maybe they should just play in the Copa del Rey from now on.\n\nIn last week’s 4-0 win over FC Barcelona in the first leg of the semi-final, Atleti showed that the old stability can still be there.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "A look at running back James Conner's season, his contract and what to expect in the offseason.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 league year is coming next month. It officially begins on March 11, with the legal negotiating period beginning on March 9.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have many roster decisions to make before then.\n\nLeading up to the new league year, we will profile every player on the roster, go over what they did last season, what their contract status is and what they face in 2026.\n\nNext up is running back James Conner.\n\nConner had a very disappointing year, as he played in only three games before suffering a severe ankle injury that ended his season. Before he got hurt, though, he was not as explosive or effective as in previous seasons. He averaged only 3.0 yards per carry for 95 yards and one touchdown in three games.\n\nConner enters the final year of his two-year, $19 million contract extension. He is scheduled to make nearly $6.4 million in salary and is due a $1 million roster bonus. His contract will count more than $9.8 million against the salary cap.\n\nSoon to be 31 years old, coming off a season-ending ankle when it looked like he might have lost a little something before he got hurt, it feels almost a lock that he will be a salary cap casualty and cut before March 15 when his roster bonus is due. The move will save the Cardinals nearly $7.6 million in cap space, leaving $2.25 million in dead money.\n\nWith a new head coach, we can expect the Cardinals to look for a new No. 1 running back.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Barcelona have every intention of keeping Marcus Rashford beyond his season-long loan spell, which will expire in June.\n\nThe La Liga giants are delighted with the impact that the on-loan Manchester United star has had since swapping Old Trafford for Camp Nou.\n\nHowever, recent reports have suggested that the Blaugrana were hoping to haggle a lower transfer fee when the time comes for them to activate Rashford’s £26 million buy option.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE OFFICIAL STRETTY NEWS APP FOR ALL THE LATEST UPDATES & BREAKING – STRAIGHT TO YOUR PHONE! ON APPLE & GOOGLE PLAY\n\n(Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nFrom United’s point of view, there is no chance of such a deal materialising. Barcelona will have to shell out the clause upfront, though INEOS chiefs are said to be kicking themselves behind the scenes for setting such a low sum, given the impact he’s had in Catalonia.\n\nIn the 34 appearances he’s made across all competitions, the 28-year-old has returned a hugely impressive 10 goals and 13 assists.\n\nRashford has particularly excelled in Europe, where he has found the back of the net five times and notched four assists in eight matches across the first phase of the competition.\n\nSuch stellar showings have put him in excellent standing ahead of this summer’s World Cup, especially considering Thomas Tuchel was utilising him in the second half of 2024/2025, when he was on loan with Aston Villa and looking to revive his career after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.\n\n(Photo by Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)\n\nSurprisingly, it’s been suggested this week that current interim boss Michael Carrick would be keen on having Rashford at his disposal next season in the event he’s granted the job permanently – but the player himself has his heart set on a permanent Barcelona switch.\n\nFabrizio Romano shared an update on the Carrington graduate’s situation last night, saying: “Barcelona want to keep Marcus Rashford beyond this season. [They are] planning to negotiate and reduce the €30m (£26m) buy option from Man United.\n\n“MUFC insist on Rashford’s fixed price to be received in full: €30m — salary also a topic to discuss over [the] next months.”\n\nRomano: Man Utd to start negotiating deal for 23 G/A England star ‘over next months’\n\nJust in: Man Utd bring back ‘incredible’ player who clashed with Amorim\n\n“Night and day” – Man Utd will only sign ‘phenomenal’ EPL star on one condition",

    "fullText": "The Manchester City squad has been enjoying some time away from football this week. A rare opportunity for rest has come at the ideal time for Pep Guardiola’s squad. City has endured a hectic schedule over the past few months, and across that journey a host of City players have suffered injuries. Slowly but surely, City has had players come back from injury. John Stones has recently returned from a long injury layoff. Nico is also back after running himself into the ground for the cause from the end of November until January.\n\nJeremy Doku and Savinho are two other players whom City have missed due to injury. The pair look to be on the verge of returning, which is a huge boost for Manchester City ahead of a pivotal point in this season.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s 2-0 win over Salford City last weekend, Pep Guardiola was asked whether or not Jeremy Doku or Savinho were getting close to returning to the pitch. The Manchester City manager provided a positive update on the pair’s fitness. Speaking on Jeremy Doku, Pep Guardiola said: “Jeremy is close. He still doesn’t train with us, but we will see. He’s a little better, but [against Salford] we needed wingers.”\n\n“We know how important he is. It helps us a lot in how we play. I’m more than delighted with how we behave. Antoine has played a lot of minutes, if you make shifts with Doku, Semenyo, Savinho, the opponents defend in their box for 90 minutes.”\n\nSpeaking on Savinho’s fitness, Pep Guardiola said: “He’s been out for six weeks. He could [have played] a few minutes, but we didn’t want to take risks. Training two days ago was wow, so good. He’s close. Now we have a long week and players coming back.”\n\nThe good news for Manchester City is that their injury list is starting to dwindle. Mateo Kovacic and Josko Gvardiol are City’s only two players who are out due to long-term injuries. However, Mateo Kovacic has returned to training recently, so the Croatian midfielder is on the comeback trail. After suffering an injury crisis of sorts throughout January, Pep Guardiola’s squad now has players returning and with that, depth. As the 2025/26 season enters a critical phase, Manchester City look to be hitting full strength in terms of the fitness of their squad. That could prove to be massive as the pressure of the 2025/26 season ramps up.\n\nJeremy Doku and Savinho returning would be massive for Manchester City. The pair would add depth and a different element to Manchester City’s attacking play, given their strengths as players. That is great news for Pep Guardiola’s side, and it remains to be seen if the pair will be available for Manchester City’s upcoming Premier League fixture against Newcastle United at the Etihad this weekend.",

The second one is obvious: how many times have we seen Olise or Davies trundle out of the locker room in training lugging the massive speaker around?\n\nAs for best and worst styles, all I can say is I hope Jackson’s style isn’t as bad as his performances on the pitch.",

    "description": "The streak continues",
    "fullText": "The streak continues! With a nearly wire-to-wire win over a very good Clemson Tiger team, the Deacs have now won 3 straight games in ACC play. After starting the season just 2-8 in the conference, Wake is now 5-8 and is potentially 1 win away from jumping all the way up to 9th place in the conference. It seems like maybe the team is starting to figure out how to play together and win games—better late than never.\n\nUpped the win streak to 3❕ pic.twitter.com/ymeaWIbfDJ\n\n— Wake Forest Men's Basketball (@WakeMBB) February 19, 2026\n\nThe first half was maybe the best half of basketball the Deacs have played all season—for a minute there it looked like Wake was going to blow the Tigers out of the gym. Clemson scored the first basket of the game and led for all of 47 seconds before Wake just started pouring it on. In the first 10 minutes of the game, the Deacs went on a 24-6 run to take a commanding 26-10 lead that they would hold for the remainder of the game. The basket must have looked like the size of an ocean out there for Wake, because they simply could not miss.\n\nGive him some dap 😌 pic.twitter.com/RvauFFCQw6\n\n— Wake Forest Men's Basketball (@WakeMBB) February 19, 2026\n\nThat 7-0 Clemson run continued into the 2nd half, with the Tigers scoring 9 of the first 10 points of the half to cut the lead down to just 5 points by the 16 minute timeout. In what would become a theme for the 2nd half, the Deacs answered back with a 5-0 run of their own to push the lead back to double digits.\n\nRight to the rack ✔️ pic.twitter.com/oC95XvE5dG\n\n— Wake Forest Men's Basketball (@WakeMBB) February 19, 2026\n\nClemson got back within 6 points several times throughout the half, but Wake did a phenomenal job of always answering back and keeping the Tigers at arm’s length. At times, it felt like Clemson was just 1 big momentum changing basket away from being able to catch up and vault into the lead, but the Deacs never let them get it.\n\nPerhaps the biggest shot of the night came from Sophomore Sebastian Akins. With a little over 2 minutes remaining, the Tigers cut the lead back down to 6, and it definitely felt like they were making their final push to get back in the game. We have seen Wake stumble at the end of games several times this season, so I can’t be the only one that started to worry that we were about to see the same thing again. Akins was having none of it.\n\nGimme 3 Seb 👌 pic.twitter.com/gZhCONaLib\n\n— Wake Forest Men's Basketball (@WakeMBB) February 19, 2026\n\nWith his 1st 3-pointer since the Longwood game in December, Akins stopped the Tiger run and put the Deacs back ahead by 9 points, effectively ending Clemson’s chances at winning the game. Akins would go on to make 5 free throws down the stretch to finish with 16 points on 4-7 shooting and help the Deacs win their 3rd straight conference game 85-77.\n\nThis is clearly a team that has not quit yet. The Deacs proved again tonight that they have the talent to not just play with, but beat, the top teams of the ACC. We are maybe starting to see the depth that was promised at the beginning of the season come into reality—led by Juke Harris’s 20 points, the Deacs had 5 players finish in double figures, and while Isaac Carr did not score in this game, he added 5 assists with just 1 turnover. Omaha Biliew, who finished with 8 points, probably would have finished in double figures as well if he didn’t foul out with 3 minutes remaining in the game. Juke has proven game in and game out that he is going to be able to score the ball, but if Wake can get more games like this from the supporting cast, they can turn into a pretty dangerous team to close out the season. I just wish it hadn’t taken them so long to figure it out.\n\nWith the win, Wake is now 5-8 in the ACC, and the chances of the Deacs finishing 8-10 or better have improved significantly. Obviously finishing in the middle of the pack was not the goal when the season started, but just a couple of weeks ago we were wondering if this team was even going to make the ACC tournament. Now, they have a realistic path to finishing at 0.500 in conference play. They could even be getting Nate Calmese back from injury before the start of the ACC Tournament (I remain skeptical on that but I guess we’ll see). There are still plenty of games left to played, but credit the Deacs for continuing to fight to turn the season around.\n\nHopefully, Wake can extend this winning streak for a couple of more weeks.",

    "fullText": "There was the exquisite side-footed flick to set up Caitlin Foord’s shot, the leap where she fell just an inch short of heading home, and the effort Leuven’s goalkeeper saved. There were the yells to her team-mates as she organised their press, the runs into midfield to recover the ball and the endless harrying that strangled Leuven’s ability to play out from the back.\n\nAlessia Russo was everywhere as Arsenal booked their spot in the Champions League quarter-finals with a 3-1 (7-1 aggregate) win over Leuven, and that is before you even mention her two goals.\n\n“She’s always switched on,” head coach Renee Slegers said after the match. “She’s always present in every phase, in the press, in our counter pressure, working all the way back. She does so many good things.”\n\nRusso is the forward who can drag teams through tournaments — not just because of her poaching, but via her diligent pressing and fine link-up play.\n\nHer seven goals across eight games are the most of any player in the Women’s Champions League this season. These have not been stat-padding contributions; many have been instrumental to Arsenal’s progress. Her double to secure a 2-1 comeback victory over Real Madrid and her assist for Beth Mead’s winning goal against Twente were pivotal.\n\nRusso’s double on Thursday — incidentally, her 49th and 50th goals for the club — rubber-stamped Arsenal’s progress to the quarter-finals, already all but assured by their 4-0 advantage from the reverse fixture last week. They also showcased exactly what she does best in the penalty area.\n\nMidway through the first half, Russo latched onto a through ball and drove into the box before passing back to a team-mate and dropping off slightly. She then darted back into the area to receive the ball with her back to goal, shrugged off Kim Everaerts, and fired home.\n\nIn the 90th minute, after Sara Pusztai had equalised on the night for Leuven and Mariona Caldentey had restored Arsenal’s lead from the spot, Russo added their third. This time — having brought down a high ball under pressure and made the pass that kickstarted Arsenal’s counter-attack — she popped up at the other end of the move and slotted into the bottom corner after turning her marker.\n\nThe chance that best sums up Russo’s value is one she did not score. With 15 minutes remaining, as Leuven attempted to build around Arsenal’s box, Russo dropped deep into her own half to pick up the ball as it was poked clear. She turned and dribbled to the halfway line before releasing Foord to chase on the left. With Leuven’s defenders focused on Foord’s run, Russo continued into the penalty area and leapt to meet a cross at the far post. She could not quite direct it in and a corner was given instead — but the move, beginning with recovering possession in her own half and ending with her on the receiving end of the ball in the box, perfectly sums up her knack for self-service.\n\nHer five Women’s Super League goals so far this season have been scored across only four games — but her direct output does not truly reflect her value. More so than her finishing, Russo’s physicality and hold-up play is what sets her apart as an elite striker: her ability to recover the ball in midfield and retain it under pressure while waiting for team-mates to join the attack is superb. The fitness that allows her to lead Arsenal’s press as vigorously as she did against Leuven is also remarkable.\n\nHaving such a robust target up top is particularly important when Arsenal are not at their most convincing, as they were not at times against Leuven. Though the tie finished 7-1 on aggregate, they had a few patchy moments in difficult conditions at Meadow Park. Russo’s chance in the 75th minute followed a sequence where Arsenal had looked unsettled under Leuven’s pressure, underlining her importance as a release valve.\n\n“That was really good,” Slegers said when asked by The Athletic about Russo’s build-up contributions, “especially then in the second half when (Leuven) started to take more risks in their press and how they do things.\n\n“Then we can play less into feet, or even sometimes not into feet because the pitch wasn’t perfect, but then she brings it down, controls it so well (under) pressure and then she has qualities to roll pressure and set other players up.”\n\nFifty club goals is a punchy headline figure, but Russo’s contribution is much greater than that. She is key not just for Arsenal’s finishing touch, but for their ability to maintain a threat on the counter, win the physical battle in midfield, and disrupt opponents’ build-up.\n\nThe 27-year-old has proven, for club and country, her ability to do those things when the stakes are highest. They will rarely be higher than when Arsenal face Chelsea in the quarter-finals, and — whether on the scoresheet or not — she will be crucial.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "After not too long away, the inimitable Noureddine Ben Zekri is back.\n\nThe Algerian, known as something of a Roshn Saudi League survival specialist, was on Tuesday night confirmed as Al Shabab’s new manager until the end of the season, replacing the outgoing Imanol Alguacil.\n\nBen Zekri, of course, has been lighting up the Saudi Arabian top flight for some time with his particular brand of coaching - and celebrations.\n\nJust check out last season, when he kept RSL debutants Al Kholood in the league and marked the accomplishment in his own, very special, way. To be fair to Ben Zekri, the Ar Rass outfit ultimately finished a brilliant ninth.\n\nThere was also the successful battle against relegation, and now trademark reaction to that, with Al Okhdood in 2023-24, not to mention similar successes before at Damac, Al Raed and Al Fayha.\n\nAt Al Shabab, Ben Zekri takes charge of a team laying 14th after 21 matches - only six points above the drop zone. And, even though the 2011-12 RSL champions won successive games late last month, they’ve lost their past two: at Al Kholood and then Friday’s 5-2 home defeat to Al Ahli.\n\nSo, no doubt looking over their shoulders, Al Shabab acted. And, in Ben Zekri, they’ve certainly given themselves the best opportunity to steer clear of the relegation dogfight.\n\n“Thanks to God, I am very happy to be here,” Ben Zekri told the club’s official channel upon his appointment. “This is a very old club, a club with a long history... I'm very happy to be in charge of such a club.\"\n\n\"I'm always committed to work. The Roshn Saudi League is a strong league - I must do a great job in it.”\n\nBen Zekri’s first assignment at Al Shabab feels especially apt: on Friday, they travel to Abha to face Damac, the team one place below them in the standings.",

Have you got a spare £180m perhaps!?\n\nReece James had a really nice interview today with Chelsea where he spoke a little about growing up in a football crazy family.\n\nLiam Rosenior’s bond with his players is becoming clear, and in particular his bond with Andrey Santos is notable.\n\nCheck out the latest edition of Simon Phillips’ SPTC podcast here:",

    "description": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat",
    "fullText": "Programme that funds groups building tech to evade oppressive government controls under serious threat\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US quietly funded a global effort to keep the internet from splintering into fiefdoms run by authoritarian governments. Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.\n\nManaged by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including $94m in 2024.\n\nThen came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won a lawsuit to get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration is now appealing against that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration this January withdrew from the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.\n\nThe cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.\n\n“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”\n\n“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects for Internet Freedom.\n\nTo report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.\n\nThe US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.\n\nThe purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.\n\nThe US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.\n\nThey also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.\n\nAnother technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.\n\nThe soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.\n\n“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”\n\n“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.\n\nTheir makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”\n\nMost recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them. Censorship regimes are getting worse worldwide.\n\n“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\nSome of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.\n\nOthers say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.\n\n“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies have exported sophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic – to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.\n\nSeveral recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.\n\nThe cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.",

    "fullText": "China didn't just celebrate Lunar New Year this week. It staged a robotics flex.\n\nAt the annual Spring Festival Gala, the Lunar New Year show in China, humanoid robots from Chinese startup Unitree Robotics flipped, lunged, and swung swords and nunchucks just feet from child performers in a tightly choreographed kung fu routine.\n\nIn one sequence inspired by \"drunken boxing,\" a traditional Chinese martial arts style, the robots staggered, fell backward, then rose again — showcasing advances in control and coordination.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons to last year's broadcast, which featured Unitree humanoid robots performing a Chinese folk dance. The choreography then was noticeably simpler.\n\nThe gala, often likened to the US Super Bowl for its massive audience, also featured other Chinese robotics firms, including MagicLab, Galbot, and Noetix, in separate segments throughout the broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nReactions on Chinese social media showed viewers being struck by how quickly the technology has advanced.\n\nOn RedNote, a user who goes by Ma Xiao said in a video posted on Wednesday that during last year's performance, the robots were only \"doing very simple things.\"\n\n\"Now, they're doing kung fu, they're doing flips, they're doing synchronized dancing,\" he said. \"Everybody's shocked.\"\n\n\"Now the rest of the world knows what China's speed is,\" he added.\n\nAnother RedNote user, DKKD, posted a video of friends reacting to the performance on Tuesday, captioning it: \"Three Americans were scared by the Spring Festival robot.\"\n\n\"They were all shocked by the robot's level of evolution (including me),\" the user wrote.\n\nOne viewer in the video can be heard saying: \"It's way more impressive than last year. It's crazy.\"\n\nUnitree CEO Wang Xingxing said in an interview with Chinese media following the gala that the company expects to ship up to 20,000 humanoid robots this year, up from about 5,500 in 2025.\n\nGlobal shipments of humanoid robots could reach \"tens of thousands\" this year, with Unitree potentially contributing between 10,000 and 20,000 units, Wang said on Tuesday.\n\nChinese companies developing humanoid robots and autonomous systems are racing to outdo global rivals.\n\nIn September, Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, unveiled R1, a humanoid robot that drew comparisons to Tesla's Optimus. Two months later, EV and robotics maker XPeng introduced the latest version of its humanoid, Iron, which the company described as \"highly human-like.\"\n\nChina's elite universities are also moving to build talent for the sector. In November, China's Ministry of Education issued a notice stating that top institutions are preparing to launch a new undergraduate major in \"embodied intelligence,\" a field that combines AI with robotics.\n\nStill, China's rapid push into robotics hasn't been seamless.\n\nXPeng's Iron fell face-first during its first public appearance in China earlier this year. Its CEO, He Xiaopeng, later wrote on Chinese social media that the mishap was part of \"learning to walk.\"\n\nLast month, a Unitree humanoid kicked an engineer in the groin during a test. Humanoid robots stumbled and fell while racing against humans in a half-marathon in Beijing in April last year.",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a landmark trial about social media addiction. Parents who attended hope the 'tide will turn' against Big Tech.",
    "fullText": "Lori Schott, a mother from rural Colorado, said she stared down Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he walked into court in Los Angeles on Wednesday to testify in a landmark trial regarding social media addiction.\n\nSchott lost her 18-year-old daughter, Annalee, to suicide in 2020. She believes the content Annalee saw on social media platforms \"destroyed\" her mental health.\n\n\"I made eye contact with him for quite a long time,\" Schott said of Zuckerberg. \"I was not backing down.\"\n\nSchott is not a plaintiff in the case where Zuckerberg testified on Wednesday, but is among more than 2,000 individuals who have similar personal injury lawsuits pending regarding social media addiction and harm.\n\nThe case underway in Los Angeles centers on a 20-year-old woman, identified by the initials KGM, who says her use of social media throughout her childhood negatively affected her mental health, contributing to depression and suicidal thoughts. It is considered a bellwether trial that could indicate how other similar lawsuits related to social media harm, like Schott's, could play out.\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, was named as a defendant alongside Google-owned YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat. TikTok and Snapchat both settled the lawsuit out of court.\n\nLast month, Meta warned investors that its mounting legal battles over youth safety could \"significantly impact\" its 2026 financial results. Attorneys for more than 100,000 individual arbitration claimants have \"sent mass arbitration demands relating to 'social media addiction'\" since late 2024, the company said in a 2026 10-K, which warned that potential damages in certain cases could reach into the \"high tens of billions of dollars.\"\n\nIn a statement, Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokesperson, said: \"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\" Otway highlighted changes the company has made over the past decade, including Teen Accounts, which give parents tools to manage their teens' accounts.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. A Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement: \"The Parties are pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, parents showed up hours before the courthouse opened in hopes of getting a seat inside. Many of them had personal stories about how they believed social media use harmed their children.\n\n\"We face a lot of stigma from people telling us we're bad parents,\" said Amy Neville, another parent who attended to show her support. She said that once the evidence comes out in the trial, she believes \"the tide will turn, and the general public will be on board with us.\"\n\n\"It is by design that social media is tearing their family apart,\" Neville said.\n\nOn the stand, Zuckerberg said that teens represent less than 1% of Meta's ad revenue and that most teens don't have disposable income, so it's not especially valuable to advertisers to reach them.\n\nZuckerberg said it's in Meta's best interest to create a platform that inspires people and makes them want to stick around for the long term.\n\n\"If people aren't happy with a service, eventually over time they'll stop using it and use something better,\" he said.\n\nSarah Gardner said that regardless of the outcome of the trial, she hopes it raises awareness about how the social media companies, and specifically Zuckerberg, have been operating. Gardner is the CEO of the Heat Initiative, an advocacy group that pressures Big Tech companies to make their platforms safer for kids. She was at the courthouse with the parents who believe they have been affected.\n\nGardner said she's hopeful the trial will empower more people to say, \"I don't want to be on Instagram anymore.\"",

They added that JetBlue was working with federal authorities to investigate the incident.\n\nData from the aircraft-tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the plane, an Airbus A320, making a circular loop in the air above Newark.\n\nIt departed from Newark at 5:30 p.m. E.T., 45 minutes later than its scheduled departure time, and returned about 20 minutes later.\n\nThere have been several instances of flights in the US making emergency landings because of smoke in recent years.\n\nIn November, a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong was forced to return to SFO. The airline said that the flight crew had detected a \"burning rubber smell in the cabin,\" and it returned to address the issue.\n\nLast February, a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Columbia, South Carolina, was forced to return after just 10 minutes in the air.\n\nCommunications between the pilot and air traffic control staff captured the Delta pilot saying, \"Got smoke in the cabin and need to plan a return back. Have the fire trucks roll for us, please.\"\n\nAnd in October 2024, a Frontier Airlines flight with nearly 200 people on board, arriving from San Diego, caught fire upon landing in Las Vegas. A video from an onlooker on X showed the plane's right engine aflame as it slowed to a halt.\n\nRepresentatives for the Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

I was a hard ass,\" McLachlan told Amy Poehler on Tuesday's episode of \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\n\nMcLachlan shares two daughters with ex-husband Ashwin Sood: India Ann, born in 2002, and Taja Summer, born in 2007.\n\n\"It's funny because I thought so clearly in my own mind that I was being the antithesis of my mother. And I looked at the way she parented, and I thought, 'I'm going to do everything completely different,'\" McLachlan said. \"Then her words come spewing out of your mouth in a moment of anger and frustration, and you're like, 'Oh my God, I can't believe I did that.'\"\n\nShe said her older daughter would sometimes shut down or lash out when things got hard, and at the time, McLachlan didn't fully understand what was behind it.\n\n\"I looked at that and went, 'How do I help you with this? How do we move past this, because the world out there is scary and big, and you have to have some grit, and you have to do hard things so that you know you can,'\" McLachlan said, describing the tough approach she took with her daughter.\n\nIt was only after they went to family counseling that she realized her daughter was experiencing a lot of anxiety.\n\n\"The way I was communicating to her was just making her feel shitty about herself instead of building her up, which was completely the opposite of what I thought I was doing,\" McLachlan said.\n\n\"I had to eat a lot of humble pie and take stock and go, 'OK, look, I want a relationship with my kid. So, I need to learn how to communicate differently with her,'\" she said.\n\nThrough the process, she said her daughter also learned how to take responsibility for her own reactions.\n\n\"It was a long process, but it was beautiful and powerful. And we have such an open, loving relationship now because of that,\" McLachlan said.\n\nThis isn't the first time McLachlan has spoken about her relationship with her firstborn. In August, she told Variety that the chapter of their relationship inspired the second single, \"Gravity,\" on her latest album, released last year.\n\n\"It feels really sweet to be able to sing this song and know that we're in such a better place, having come through this really challenging time together,\" she said.\n\nIn September, McLachlan told People that therapy gave her a \"safe environment\" to connect with her daughter.\n\n\"What I realized is the way I was communicating my love to her, she was not hearing it, not feeling it,\" McLachlan said. \"I was not reaching her. And for me as a parent, that's devastating because you just want to take your kid in your arms and hold them and keep them in.\"\n\nIndia Sood did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Mere days into her week-long guest-cohosting gig on The View, reality star Savannah Chrisley has already been shut down by the permanent panelists over a false claim she made about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe moment came at the top of Wednesday's broadcast, as the cohosts led the show's Hot Topics discussion about Ocasio-Cortez's heavily criticized handling of a question about Taiwan at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 13.\n\nAs Joy Behar countered pushback to AOC's response — which included the New York congresswoman pausing for several moments during the scattered reply — she urged critics to focus on Donald Trump's multiple on-camera mishaps instead: \"Check him out before you start attacking AOC,\" the 83-year-old quipped.\n\n\"Mispronouncing a word is totally different than not knowing your position on Taiwan. What's important is how you recover from something. Trump, he's done things, and then he's continued on with his speech, and then continued on to meet with world leaders. So, the recovery is what matters, and AOC just didn't have a recovery,\" the Chrisley Knows Best personality said, while Behar stressed, \"He does it over and over again, how about the quantity?\"\n\nModerator Whoopi Goldberg replied to Chrisley by stressing that Trump \"is the president,\" and that she can put up with fumbled answers \"from congresspeople\" because in that case \"that's on you.\" But, she \"can't take it from the guy who says he's the leader of the free world.\"\n\nStill, Chrisley dug in, claiming, \"I understand that wholeheartedly. AOC, though, is also the Democrats' pick for the next election.\"\n\nThe panel quickly pushed back at Chrisley's assessment, with Goldberg and Sara Haines shaking their heads while the Oscar-winning Ghost actress repeated, \"No, no, no!\" while Behar added, \"You better tell that to Gavin Newsom!\"\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nLegal expert Sunny Hostin then elaborated, pointing out that Ocasio-Cortez has \"made it pretty clear that she's not running for president\" in 2028.\n\nOcasio-Cortez recently maintained that she's not entering the 2028 race for president following Trump's second term, stressing to the New York Times that she attended the conference in Munich \"not because I’m running for president, not because I’ve made some kind of decision about a horse race or a candidacy, but because we need to sound the alarm bells that a lot of those folks in nicely pressed suits in that room will not be there much longer if we do not do something about the runaway inequality that is fueling far-right populist movements.\"\n\nChrisley is at the Hot Topics table through the week, filling in for fellow conservative personality Alyssa Farah Griffin, who temporarily departed the show last week after the birth of her first son.\n\nOther guest panelists slated to sit in Griffin's seat during her maternity leave include Amanda Carpenter, Sheryl Underwood, comedian Whitney Cummings, and former View cohost Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who publicly slammed Behar and the show in early 2025.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Bill Gates pulled out of India's AI Impact Summit hours before his scheduled keynote address on Thursday, dealing another blow to a flagship event already marred by organisational ‌lapses, a robot row and delegate complaints over traffic disruptions.\n\nGates' absence, followed by another high-profile cancellation by Nvidia's Jensen Huang, ‌adds to a difficult opening for a summit billed as the first major artificial intelligence forum in the Global South, where India has sought to position itself ​as a leading voice in worldwide AI governance.\n\nThe Gates Foundation said the billionaire will not deliver his address \"to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities\". Only days ago, the foundation had dismissed rumours of his absence and insisted he was on track to attend.\n\nGates' cancellation comes after the U.S. Department of Justice released emails last month that included communication between late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and ‌the Gates Foundation's staff.\n\nGates has said the relationship ⁠was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and that it was a mistake for him to meet Epstein.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi called for children's safety on AI platforms as he addressed the gathering on Thursday, alongside French ⁠President Emmanuel Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.\n\n\"We must be even more vigilant about children’s safety. Just as a school syllabus is curated, the AI space should also be child- and family-guided,\" Modi said, after standing on stage with top AI executives ​and ​posing for photographs with their arms raised in a show of strength.\n\nHowever, ​India's first major AI summit has been marred by ‌management lapses that have left attendees shocked and angry over what they described as a lack of planning by the Indian government.\n\nThe summit exhibition halls were shut to the public on Thursday in a surprise move that led to more anger among participating companies that had put up stalls and pavilions.\n\nThe venue compound was largely deserted after three days of large crowds at the event.\n\nOn Wednesday, Indian university Galgotias was asked to vacate its stall after a staff member presented a commercially available robotic dog made in China ‌as its own creation, sparking a public uproar.\n\nPolice shut roads to give preference ​to VIP movement at the summit, creating chaos in the city of 20 million ​people.\n\nOn Wednesday, footage on social media showed scores of ​attendees at the summit walking for miles in central Delhi as roads were shut for traffic, with no ‌availability of taxis and no shuttle services arranged.\n\nReposting one such ​video, opposition leader Mahua Moitra wrote ​on X that the poor management had besmirched India’s reputation globally.\n\nStill, there has been more than $100 billion of investment in India AI projects pledged during the summit, including from the Adani Group conglomerate, tech giant Microsoft, and data centre firm Yotta.\n\nThe Indian ​government has said it expects total pledges ‌to exceed $200 billion in the next two years, although analysts have warned the rapid build-out risks straining India's power grid ​and water supply.",

    "fullText": "Luxury fashion may portray an image of glamor and exclusivity, but not all that glitters is gold.\n\nBehind the more than five-figure price tags and highly coveted brand names, the industry has struggled with declining sales and cautious consumer spending amid ongoing economic uncertainty.\n\nFounded in 1963, Kering is the French multinational luxury goods group behind some of the most recognizable high-end houses, including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen.\n\nDespite being the world's second-largest luxury group, with revenue of €14.7 billion ($17.38 billion) in 2025, Kering has faced mounting pressure in recent years. Leadership changes, shifting consumer preferences, and broader industry headwinds have challenged its performance.\n\nNow, the company is preparing to embark on a major transformation that will reshape its entire business.\n\nKering (PPRUY) shuttered 133 stores across its brands in 2025, representing a net reduction of 75 units, and bringing its total store count to 1,719 as of December 31. The company said during an earnings call that the closures targeted underperforming locations that no longer aligned with its strategy to increase sales and elevate brand positioning.\n\nAn additional 100 store closures are already scheduled worldwide, with further reductions under review. Gucci is expected to account for the largest share of those cuts.\n\nAsia-Pacific: 42\n\nKering said this move aimed to reinforce its operational discipline while protecting its brand, delivering a higher-quality retail footprint.\n\nThe company also reduced its inventory by 8% in 2025 and plans to trim it further in 2026 to lower costs and better meet consumer demand.\n\nThe closures come amid Kering's declining financial performance.\n\nFor the full year of 2025, total revenues fell 13% year over year and 10% on a comparable basis. Gucci, the group's largest and most influential brand, suffered the biggest decrease, with revenue down 22% and 19% on a comparable basis, according to its latest earnings report.\n\n\"These results are not where we want to be, but they mark the bottom and the first steps of the turnaround we have initiated,\" said Kering Senior Analyst Luca Solca in the earnings call.\n\nTo reignite growth, Kering plans to reduce its dependence on fashion while expanding into other high-potential luxury categories.\n\n\"This discipline is precisely what provides a healthy financial foundation to fund our comeback,\" said Kering CFO Armelle Poulou in the earnings call. \"To support our brands, we continue to invest selectively in key areas while maintaining strict cost control in others.\"\n\nIn October 2025, Kering agreed to sell its beauty division to L'Oréal for $4.7 billion, granting it a 50-year exclusive licensing agreement, expected to take effect in the first half of 2026, according to a company press release.\n\nBoth companies are also forming a joint venture focused on luxury, wellness, and longevity, aiming to accelerate innovation in fragrance and cosmetics for its major luxury Houses, a space they view as high-growth and high-value in the long term.\n\n\"This partnership allows us to focus on what defines us best: the creative power and desirability of our Houses,\" said Kering CEO Luca de Meo in the press release.\n\nBeyond beauty, Kering sees jewelry as a resilient and underdeveloped opportunity within its portfolio. Though currently a small contributor to the group's revenue, the category has withstood the broader luxury downturn better than fashion.\n\nTo strengthen its capabilities, Kering acquired Raselli Farco at the end of last year and plans to continue investing in this sector. The company will share its full jewelry strategy in more detail at Capital Markets Day in April.\n\nKering's leadership team repeatedly emphasized creativity as the foundation of the turnaround.\n\n\"Creativity is our North Star,\" said Solca in the earnings call. \"It is what sets luxury apart. But creativity only becomes value when execution follows at the same pace: in retail, in supply chain, in merchandising, in marketing. This is where we are putting our energy into.\"\n\nSolca added that, on the ground, Kering's products are reconnecting with consumers. The company saw sales improvements in the second half of 2025, suggesting early signs of stabilization.\n\n\"The momentum is real: early, fragile, but real. And I can guarantee you that we will build on it,\" said Solca.\n\nKering is not the only company struggling; fashion has been navigating a persistent slump over the past few years.\n\nMcKinsey & Company's State of Fashion 2026 Report projects low-single-digit growth for the global fashion industry in 2026. Macroeconomic volatility and tariff pressures are expected to continue shaping value-conscious consumer behavior, particularly in the U.S., where consumer sentiment remained low throughout 2025.\n\n\"In the end, 2026 will likely be another year of dislocation for fashion companies,\" said McKinsey & Company Fashion Retail Analysts.\n\nGlobal retailer closes 132 stores across several brands\n\nBad Bunny’s bargain outfit breaks Super Bowl fashion tradition\n\n159-year-old retail giant announces more store closures\n\nMost recently, luxury retailer Saks Global also disclosed plans to close an additional nine stores following the shutdown of hundreds of locations and its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY), the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate, also faced headwinds, with revenues declining 5% for the full year of 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, e-commerce continues expanding its share of consumer spending.\n\nWith 84.3% of Americans shopping online, U.S. e-commerce spending reached $1.34 trillion in 2024 and is projected to surpass $2.5 trillion in 2030, according to Capital One Shopping.\n\nStill, physical stores remain the dominant preferred format for most consumers, accounting for around $14.4 trillion of total retail sales of $18.9 trillion in 2025, according to Euromonitor research gathered by EY.\n\n\"It's clear that the physical store still plays an important role,\" said EY Retail Analysts Malin Andrée and Jon Copestake. \"Not only do stores have plenty of runway left in delivering revenue, but they also have opportunities to drive new growth and alternative revenue streams and, by working in tandem with digital channels, they can maximize returns on investment.\"\n\nDespite its turnaround efforts, Kering's shares have dropped 9.25% year to date as of February 17. The stock currently carries a consensus \"hold\" rating from Wall Street analysts tracked by MarketBeat.\n\nRecently, the company underwent significant leadership changes. In September 2025, Luca de Meo replaced longtime CEO François-Henri Pinault, and creative director roles at its top three fashion houses, including Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Bottega Veneta, have also shifted.\n\n\"Kering has changed designers across its three main brands simultaneously, a risky move given the group's reliance on figures like [Deputy CEO] Francesca Bellettini, who holds significant sway over appointments and brand direction,\" said Third Bridge Luxury Apparel Analyst Yanmei Tang to Fashion Dive.\n\n\"This top-heavy approach often leads to reactive, short-term decisions aimed at plugging immediate gaps.\"\n\nGucci is Kering's largest brand, accounting for 45% of its total revenue. For years, the company has relied on its performance, leaving it vulnerable to fluctuations.\n\nIn 2025 alone, Kering appointed Francesca Bellettini as the new Gucci CEO in September, and Demna took over as the creative director in July.\n\n\"Creative transitions take time, and the retail environment has not been supportive,\" said Carrara Advisory Industry experts. \"Consumer sentiment in China weakened. U.S. aspirational buyers pulled back. European tourism shifted. This confluence of factors placed Gucci in a vulnerable position.\"",

    "description": "A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested",
    "fullText": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested during its immigration crackdown to mandatory detention.\n\nU.S. District ‌Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, vacated the decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals after finding the ‌administration had failed to comply with her earlier order declaring unlawful the underlying policy of denying detainees the chance to seek release on bond.\n\nSykes' Wednesday ruling, ​in a class action lawsuit that covers migrants nationwide, is more sweeping than decisions by hundreds of other U.S. judges holding the policy is unlawful and ordering detainees to be freed or given bond hearings.\n\nSykes, appointed by former Democratic President Joe Biden, called the administration's actions \"shameless\" and accused it of trying to continue its \"campaign of illegal action\" by still refusing bond hearings despite her prior ruling.\n\n\"Respondents ‌have far crossed the boundaries of constitutional ⁠conduct,\" Sykes wrote.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice, which oversees the board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSykes' ruling means the board's decision can ⁠no longer be used by immigration judges to deny bond hearings, said Niels Frenzen, a professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law who represented the plaintiffs.\n\n\"We hope that DHS and the immigration courts will now comply with the court's orders to ​provide ​bond hearings to the thousands of noncitizens who have been arrested,\" he ​said in a statement.\n\nFederal immigration law prescribes mandatory ‌detention for \"applicants for admission\" to the United States, while their cases proceed in immigration courts and they are ineligible for bond hearings.\n\nBucking a long-standing interpretation of the law, the DHS last year - as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown - took the position that non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a decision ‌in September that adopted that interpretation, leading to immigration judges nationally employed ​by the department to mandate detention.\n\nSykes in a ruling in December declared ​the DHS policy unlawful but stopped short of vacating ​the board's decision.\n\nBut she said it was clear further relief was needed after Chief Immigration Judge Teresa ‌Riley issued guidance instructing her colleagues that they ​are not bound by Sykes' ruling ​and that they should continue following the board's decision.\n\nThose immigration judges are employed by the Justice Department.\n\nSykes, in Wednesday's decision, criticized DHS for repeatedly and inaccurately suggesting that operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were limited to targeting ​criminal non-citizens who were the \"worst of the ‌worst.\"\n\n\"Maybe that phrase merely mirrors the severity and ill-natured conduct by the government,\" Sykes wrote. \"Even though these press ​releases might contain an inkling of truth, they ignore a greater, more dire reality.\"",

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association Board of Directors approved four schools and denied five others from playing independent football schedules for the 2026 and 2027 seasons on Wednesday.\n\nThe board made the decisions during its monthly meeting.\n\nThe programs that were approved were Caney Valley (7-2 vote), Capitol Hill (5-4 vote), Cordell (7-2 vote) and Enid (5-4 vote). The schools that were denied were Classen SAS, Guymon, John Marshall, Northwest Classen and U.S. Grant in 5-4 votes.\n\nThe board has 15 members, but two — Dudley Darrow of Enid and Brad Herzer of Oklahoma City — recused themselves in each vote. The four others who make up the 15 were not present.\n\nAll of the programs requesting to go independent have been struggling to be competitive, with many low on numbers compared to their opponents.\n\nAll of the programs that were approved of competing as independents were winless this past season.\n\nIt was a major struggle for the programs that were denied, as well. Classen SAS went 0-10 and John Marshall finished 2-8 while competing as Class 5A schools, Northwest Classen had a 2-9 record and U.S. Grant went 3-7 while in Class 6A-II and Guymon finished 5-5 as an independent.\n\nNick Sardis covers high school sports for The Oklahoman.

    "fullText": "With no Henri Veesaar or Caleb Wilson in the starting lineup, the Tar Heels need contributions from virtually everyone else on their roster.\n\nWe're not talking about Zayden High or Jarin Stevenson, who are doing a respectable job filling in down low. In the case of this story, we're looking at North Carolina's backcourt.\n\nDuring UNC's lopsided, 82-58 loss at NC State on Tuesday night, the backcourt struggled mightily. Luka Bogavac, who the Tar Heels recruited for his international experience, sweet shot and ability to pour in 15 points on any given night, scored just nine points against the Wolfpack.\n\nSeth Trimble, North Carolina's captain and senior guard, contributed just four points on 1-of-9 shooting – and two made free throws. This continues a recent hot-and-cold stretch for Trimble, who scored 19 points against Pitt, just four at Miami (FL) and 16 vs. Duke.\n\nDerek Dixon struggled with his shot the most of any UNC backcourt member, making just two of 12 attempts, while Jonathan Powell and Jaydon Young combined for 14 points off the bench. Kyan Evans took just two shots in 15 minutes, while Isaiah Denis played two minutes.\n\nPost production is how the 2025-26 Tar Heels get most of their scoring, a stark contrast from 2024-25, which featured a guard-heavy lineup and undersized big men. North Carolina has plenty of talented guards on its current team, but they have to play consistently for team victories.\n\nI'm not talking every UNC guard scoring 10+ points on a given night, though that is a dream. Whether assists, taking better care of the basketball, getting higher-percentage looks or something else, guard play will dictate the Tar Heels' success, particularly as they face extensive roster injuries.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball: Guards have to play consistent for additional wins",

    "description": "Finnish scoring sensation Jesse Kiiskinen eyes a North American pro debut. Could his dynamic talent ignite the Griffins' playoff push?",
    "fullText": "The Grand Rapids Griffins may be getting some reinforcements soon, as one of the team’s quietly rising prospects could be on the verge of making the jump to professional hockey in North America. Finnish forward Jesse Kiiskinen, currently playing in Finland’s Liiga, may finally be heading to the Griffins as the Finnish season nears its conclusion.\n\nKiiskinen was acquired by the Detroit Red Wings in June 2024, along with a second-round pick, in exchange for defense prospect Andrew Gibson. While initially considered a quiet addition, Kiiskinen quickly emerged as a notable name in the Red Wings’ prospect pipeline following a breakout 2024–25 season. He recorded 44 points in 46 games with HPK, demonstrating a natural scoring touch that caught the attention of fans and scouts alike.\n\nKiiskinen also made an impact on the international stage, representing Finland at the World Junior Championships. In seven games, he tallied six goals and one assist, underscoring his potential as a dynamic offensive presence.\n\nJesse Kiiskinen \nGoal🚨 on the power play#LGRW pic.twitter.com/U636I9lzsd\n\n— Red Wings Prospects (@LGRWProspects) February 17, 2026\n\nThis season, Kiiskinen has been less prolific, posting 24 points in 45 games, but scouts and analysts note that while his scoring ability remains, the broader aspects of his game are still developing. With HPK sitting outside the playoff picture with a 14-6-8-23 record, and just nine regular-season games left through March 17, the timing could allow Kiiskinen to make the jump to North America.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Detroit Red Wings team site to stay connected to the latest news, game-day coverage, and player features.\n\nThe Griffins’ season extends until April 19, which opens the possibility for Kiiskinen to join the team for a few games before the season concludes. Such a move would provide a glimpse into how the Red Wings’ trade for Gibson might ultimately be evaluated.\n\nJesse Kiiskinen GOAL🚨 rips it past Trey Augustine. Prospect on prospect crime. #LGRW pic.twitter.com/Xiimc3zAj7\n\n— Red Wings Prospects (@LGRWProspects) January 6, 2025\n\nGibson, who made his professional debut this past season, posted seven points and a plus-three rating in 44 games with the Milwaukee Admirals, part of the Nashville Predators organization.\n\nAdding Kiiskinen could inject some excitement into the Griffins’ roster late in the year to hopefully help sustain their epic run this season while giving the young Finnish winger valuable North American experience.\n\nNever miss a story by adding us to your Google News favorites!\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "Cade Smith will not be competing in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, instead focusing on the Cleveland Guardians' upcoming season.",
    "fullText": "Three years ago, before Cade Smith made his Major League debut or even threw a pitch for the Cleveland Guardians, he had the opportunity to compete for his home country of Canada in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n\nSince then, Cade has established himself as one of the best high-leverage relievers in MLB, and for the first time in his career, enter the season as Cleveland’s closer.\n\nHowever, Smith is not playing for Team Canada in the 2026 WBC. It was a decision that he recently told Foul Territory was his own as he heads into\n\n“It was my decision [to not play in the WBC], Cade said.\n\n“In ‘23, it was a phenomenal experience. Like, that was my first experience pitching in major league stadiums in front of sold-out crowds and that kind of environment. I had so much fun and enjoyed that. So, just this year, being at, kind of where things are architecturally, I didn't feel that it was wise for me to take that time away. I wanted to make sure that I was here and completely present and focused on the year coming up.”\n\nThe 2026 season will be Smith’s last year on a minimum MLB contract before his arbitration eligibility next winter. Considering that through his first two years, Smith has a 2.42 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, and 17 saves under his belt, he is in line for quite a large payday, even in his first year in the arbitration process.\n\nThat inevitable payday is contingent on one thing, though: health.\n\nSmith has pitched in 150 games through his first two big-league seasons. That’s a heavy workload for any pitcher in MLB, let alone one with an average fastball velocity of 96.4 mph.\n\nIt’s hard to blame Cade if he didn’t want to compete in the WBC because of this high workload, and solely focus on the upcoming season.\n\nPerhaps three years from now, in the 2029 WBC, Cade will get another chance to rep Candada, but for now, he’s concentrated on the Guardians.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

Senior forward Hannah Stuelke also notched her seventh double-double of the season and the 18th of her career with 14 points and 16 rebounds.\n\nAgainst the Cornhuskers, sophomore center Avav Heiden dominated en route to a career-high-tying 27 points on 12-for-15 from the floor and 3-for-3 from the charity stripe, along with to go along with her 11 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 blocks, and 1 steal. As a result, this was the 6-foot-4 Sherwood, Ore., native's sixth double-double of the season. Sophomore guard Taylor Stremlow also added a career-high 17 points on top of Heiden's sensational effort.\n\nDespite the wins this past week, Iowa remains at the No. 12 spot in this week's Coaches Poll.\n\nIn addition to Iowa, six other Big Ten squads are within the updated Top 25. NO. 2 UCLA leads the group, followed by No. 5 Michigan, No. 10 Ohio State, No. 15 Maryland, No. 16 Michigan State, and No. 23 Minnesota.\n\nNebraska is the lone conference representative in the receiving votes category, earning just 1 vote.\n\nIowa will have two matchups this week to improve its standing in the next Coaches Poll, as the Hawkeyes travel to Purdue on Feb. 19, before returning home for \"Senior Day\" against No. 5 Michigan on Feb. 22.

    "description": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the […]",
    "fullText": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the place. And with the Minnesota Vikings holding the 18th overall pick, NFL.com’s Daniel Jeremiah believes Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores will scoop a Harrison Smith replacement: Oregon safety Dillon Thieneman.\n\nNFL.com ties Minnesota to Thieneman as the Smith succession plan, signaling a 2026 secondary transition.\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether Smith will retire, but if so, Thieneman might have the juice to fill his shoes.\n\nAnother mock draft for the Vikings — more defense.\n\nJeremiah: Thieneman to Vikings at No. 18\n\nBecause Lewis Cine didn’t pan out and the fact that Smith may indeed retire soon, Minnesota will need a safety for the long haul. Jeremiah thinks Thieneman is the right guy.\n\nHe wrote Tuesday, “After studying Thieneman’s impressive 2025 tape at Oregon, I went back and watched the film from his career at Purdue, where he played in 2023 and ’24. His range and playmaking skills were evident back then, too. He would be an excellent replacement for Harrison Smith.”\n\nJeremiah continued the defensive trend for the Vikings’ spot in mock drafts. Most editions have the club selecting a defensive back or defensive lineman.\n\nThieneman is 6’0 and 200 pounds and will turn 22 in August. He’s known for his versatility at safety, which sounds like a page from the Smith playbook. His ball-tracking is elite for a rookie prospect, and he is known for high football IQ. NFL.com recently compared him to Jevon Holland, a safety for the New York Giants.\n\nA to Z Sports‘ Rob Gregson on Thieneman: “You turn on three years’ worth of tape from Thieneman, and it just gets better and better. After bursting on to the scene as a true freshman in 2023, where he recorded six interceptions, Thieneman then led the Big-10 in tackles in 2024, before doing a little bit of everything for the Ducks in 2025.”\n\n“You’re betting on instincts and explosion with Thieneman. He may not be elite laterally and challenged in terms of his man coverage projection, but if you need a player who can play the high post, poach the middle as a robber, and align as a box safety for a plus one help in the run game, Thieneman is your guy.”\n\nNFL.com’s Lance Zierlein: “Savvy three-year starter with NFL size, speed and alignment versatility. Thieneman is an extension of his defensive coordinator, aligning and adjusting the secondary to motion and pre-snap shifts. He’s an instinctive, rangy safety who can roll down into big nickel or robber positioning.”\n\n“He has a good feel for play design and route concepts in zone but has average change of direction to match breaks in man. He’s not a big thumper near the line, but he rushes into the action with a relentless pursuit that should allow him to keep stacking high scores in the tackle columns. Thieneman checks important boxes for teams looking to add versatile playmakers in the secondary.”\n\nThe 2026 Safeties + a Smith Verdict\n\nIf one pretends that Smith will indeed retire, Minnesota’s safety group would look like this in 2026 with Thieneman:\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, as of February 18th, there’s been no official retirement announcement from Smith, which is a bit odd. He can still call it quits, but with each day that passes, Smith is more likely to return for Year No. 15, especially with Flores back in the saddle as the defensive coordinator.\n\nThieneman ranks No. 37 on the Consensus Big Board at the time of this article’s publication. He might be a 2nd-Round commodity. If the Vikings don’t reach and pick him at No. 18, the team’s draftboard might resemble this, based on the best player available and long-term roster need:\n\nEmmanuel McNeil-Warren (S, Toledo)\n\nKayden McDonald (DT, Ohio State)\n\nJordyn Tyson (WR, Arizona State)\n\nThe NFL draft is about nine weeks away. Minnesota has at least nine picks line up this cycle — four more than last year, when the club had a skimpy cupboard due to the expensive Dallas Turner trade in 2024.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEver since we heard the news that Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans will be returning in 2026, but will be exploring his options, naturally, many think that means he will play elsewhere.\n\nOf course, that is entirely true, and it has allowed the thought process to begin about which Super Bowl-contending teams could be interested in his services.\n\nBut for Buccaneers fans, the thought of Evans, a franchise great, not only playing for a different team for the first time in his career, but potentially winning a Super Bowl, isn't something they want to think about.\n\nHowever, Sports Illustrated's Karl Rasmussen offered up one sentence from his piece on Evans' landing spots that might soothe the nerves.\n\n\"Just because Evans is going to explore his options in free agency doesn’t mean his departure is inevitable,\" Rasmussen wrote.\n\nMore:Chiefs could pull off incredible free agency move for Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe biggest thing is, does Evans want to return to chase a Super Bowl? Because if so, then his time in Tampa is likely over, as Todd Bowles' team isn't in the hunt right now.\n\nBut if he wants to keep playing football with the franchise that gave him his start, and that he loves with all his heart, along with the locker room, then Tampa Bay wins the tug of war.\n\nWith reports stating Evans is set to meet with the Buccaneers in the coming weeks, there's a chance he remains a Buc in 2026.\n\nBut until that move is made official, the option that he moves on remains a very real possibility.\n\nESPN analyst makes stunning call on future of Chiefs' Travis Kelce\n\nBills face huge $19 million decision on underrated star\n\nPatriots named as potential landing spot for $25 million sack monster\n\n2 huge free agency decisions set to impact Bills' Josh Allen\n\nAnalyst urges Ravens not to make 'stupid' offseason move\n\nAnalyst ripped to shreds over embarrassing Mike Evans Buccaneers Super Bowl take\n\nWill Ravens' Lamar Jackson need Superman cape under new OC?",

    "fullText": "SAN ANTONIO – The Phoenix Suns have emerged from the NBA All-Star break healthy as they have no one listed on their injury report due to an injury.\n\nThe Suns (32-23) face the San Antonio Spurs (38-16) Thursday, Feb. 19, at Moody Center on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin. They are seventh in the Western Conference while the Spurs are second.\n\nGrayson Allen (right knee sprain) and Isaiah Livers (left shoulder sprain) suffered injuries against the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 5 and sat out the next three games going into the NBA All-Star break.\n\nThey were scheduled for a re-evaluation after the break.\n\nThe Suns will be without Dillon Brooks, who will serve a one-game suspension Thursday for picking up his 16th technical foul in a Feb. 11 loss to defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n\"He said I'm playing victim all the time. When I don't play the victim, I'm a bad guy. Choose one.\"\n\nDillon Brooks on a conversation with lead official James Williams during Suns loss to OKC.\n\nNow has 16 technical fouls. If it stands, he'll receive 1-game suspension. #Suns pic.twitter.com/XL1A9QRal0\n\n— Duane Rankin (@DuaneRankin) February 12, 2026\n\n“He knows his technical situation,” Suns general manager Brian Gregory said Feb. 18. “We've had plenty of sit-downs and talks. He also knows how important he is for us to be on the court. So, I think with that, I think he understands exactly where he's at.”\n\nBrooks leads the NBA in technical fouls this season. Each two additional technical fouls will result in a one-game suspension (18th, 20th, 22nd, etc.).\n\nJalen Green isn’t on the injury report as he participated in workouts and improved his conditioning during the All-Star break.\n\n“Yeah, he's in a good spot right now,\" Gregory said. \"You know, injuries, unfortunately, are part of this league, and he's done an unbelievable job. His spirit on a daily basis in terms of attacking the rehab, attacking the recovery, attacking the workouts has been spot on from Day 1.”\n\nGreen has played only seven games this season, mostly due to a right hamstring injury, after playing every game the previous two seasons with the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe explosive 6-4 guard played in two of Phoenix’s last three games before the break after suffering a left hip contusion Jan. 30 against Cleveland that sidelined him three games.\n\nCole Anthony remains listed on the team’s injury report as “not with team.” Sources informed The Arizona Republic last week the Suns were looking to waive Anthony.\n\nThe Suns acquired Amir Coffey and Anthony from the Milwaukee Bucks in a three-team deal sent Nick Richards to the Chicago Bulls and Nigel Hayes-Davis to the Bucks before the Feb. 5 trade deadline.\n\nHave opinions about the current state of the Suns?

    "fullText": "Former Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Cavan Biggio has signed a minor league deal with the Houston Astros.\n\nThe versatile left-handed hitter will join the team in spring training camp as a non-roster player.\n\nThe Astros announced that they have signed Cavan Biggio to a minor league deal pic.twitter.com/D8x0hjSyX8\n\n— FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) February 15, 2026\n\nThe 30-year-old is coming off a season in which he appeared in 37 games for the Kansas City Royals. The Royals had him all over the field, playing first base, second base, third base, two outfield positions and designated hitter.\n\nIn 69 major league at-bats with the Royals, Biggio slahed .174/.296/.246 with a .543 OPS and a 55 OPS+. Biggio also tallied 12 hits along with one home run and four RBIs.\n\nThe seven-year veteran reported to camp on Sunday and spoke about his excitement to get a chance with the Astros.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it was a big dream of mine, but the Astros, I loved that team more than anything growing up,” Cavan said. “Those teams growing up, I could name every player on those teams. This organization has always been very special for me, and it’s an absolute honor to don the uniform now.”\n\nCavan is the son of long-time Astors infielder, Craig Biggio. Craig played his entire 20-year career with the Astros and is the franchise’s leader in games played, at-bats, hits, runs, total bases, doubles and extra-base hits.\n\nCavan was the ball boy when Craig reached 3,000 career hits in 2007, alongside his brother, Conor.\n\n“That last year was something that obviously was truly special for us,” Craig said. “It was something that playing your whole career here with one team and one organization and being able to achieve a milestone like that in front of your fans and in front of your family and having your boys in the dugout as bat boy because they were old enough to do it, it was very special.”\n\nBiggio spent 30 games with the Dodgers in 2024. In 73 at-bats, the Houston native slashed .192/.306/.329 with a .635 OPS. He also recorded 14 hits, three home runs, 10 RBIs and 11 runs in his brief stint in L.A.\n\nHe was released in early August 2024 after he was traded to L.A. from the Toronto Blue Jays in June of that season.",

    "description": "Lars Nootbaar is at the team's spring training complex with his future with the organization in doubt",
    "fullText": "In the last year, almost every established veteran on the St. Louis Cardinals roster has been linked to trade rumors.\n\nThere was fire to a lot of smoke behind those rumors. Closer Ryan Helsley, starting pitcher Sonny Gray, first baseman/catcher Willson Contreras, second baseman Brendan Donovan and third baseman Nolan Arenado have all been dealt by the Cardinals in the last year.\n\nEven for the players who didn't or haven't been traded yet, those rumors haven't gone unnoticed.\n\nOutfielder Lars Nootbaar arrived to the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Fla., on Wednesday. Nootbaar was late reporting to camp due to the team not having a piece of equipment he needed to keep his rehab on schedule.\n\nAccording to a post on \"X\" from Jeff Jones of the Belleville News-Democrat, Nootbaar heard from his representation this offseason about the possibility of being dealt.\n\nDespite the injury and recovery, Nootbaar did acknowledge that he heard consistently from his reps throughout the winter about the possibility of his being moved. So, we’ll see how that works out.\n\n— Jeff Jones (@jmjones) February 18, 2026\n\nIt looks like the potential of being traded is still on the table for Nootbaar, who's currently recovering from surgery to repair a condition in his heels.\n\nNootbaar underwent a procedure in October to correct a condition in both of his heels. He was reportedly dealing with Haglund's deformities, which is a bone deformity that causes pain, enlargement and inflammation.\n\nAccording to Jones' report, Nootbaar has been able to throw and hit but is just getting around to being able to run without aid.\n\nIt's still unclear when Nootbaar will be able to compete in games.\n\nLast season, Nootbaar slashed .234/.325/.361 with a .686 OPS and hit 24 doubles, a triple and 13 home runs with 48 RBIs in 135 games.\n\nNootbaar's games played, hits, RBIs and doubles were all single-season career-highs for the 28-year-old, who made his major league debut in 2021. In the same breath, his on-base percentage, slugging percentage and OPS were all single-season career-lows.\n\nLars Nootbaar makes an UNBELIEVABLE catch in the 9th 😱 pic.twitter.com/7H3QMYGpTX\n\nNootbaar is currently under his second year of arbitration and is set to earn $5.25 million in 2026. He has one more year or arbitration for 2027 before he'll be a free agent ahead of the 2028 season.\n\nSt. Louis has moved on from the aforementioned veterans in efforts of building assets who can contribute and become focal points for the Cardinals' rebuilt roster.\n\nNootbaar is still relatively young and St. Louis will need some veterans to balance out the growing amount of young players who are expected to become faces of the franchise. Time will tell if Nootbaar will be one of those veterans of the future or another player that Cardinals choose to cut ties with.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "Manchester United are gearing up for a huge summer, and, according to the latest reports, INEOS have grand plans in mind.\n\nThe midfield is in the most urgent need of reinforcements, with as many as two additions possible, while the team also needs cover at the back and possibly a left-sided winger.\n\nAll this is going to cost a bomb, and according to The Daily Mail‘s Chris Wheeler, the Red Devils have devised two sets of targets, contingent on where the club finishes at the end of the season.\n\nFinishing within the Champions League places and trimming a bloated wage bill while also getting rid of the deadwood would transform United’s capability in the market.\n\nThe 20-time English league champions could raise as much as £100 million through player sales, with the likes of Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund likely to depart permanently.\n\nThat would hand them greater leeway when it comes to bidding for players and agreeing on wages. United are currently fourth, and with fifth place also good enough to secure entry into Europe’s premier club competition, INEOS will be quietly confident.\n\nIn case things go horribly wrong, the Old Trafford side will struggle to pay top midfield target Elliot Anderson’s wages, handing Manchester City a free run at the Englishman.\n\nINEOS have kept a backup list ready just in case. Hopefully, it does not come to that.\n\n“United’s budget this summer will be night and day depending on whether they qualify for the Champions League,” Wheeler was quoted as saying.\n\n“They’ll effectively be working with two different budgets, two different shopping lists and two completely different plans. If United secure Champions League football and £100m-plus, that would be transformative.\n\n“It would put them back at the top table in terms of the players they can attract and the salaries they can offer. Without a top-four or top-five finish, could United afford to pay Elliott Anderson’s wage demands? I’m not so sure.”\n\nUnited’s Premier League finish will also have a bearing on Michael Carrick‘s future, with Thomas Tuchel currently leading the race.\n\nBut with the squad and club captain backing the caretaker head coach, INEOS will have a tough time denying Carrick the top job if the season aims are met.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "LSU baseball has opened the season 5-0. What has stood out from the Tigers' fast start to the season?",
    "fullText": "BATON ROUGE — The only way LSU baseball could've played more this last handful of days is if it would've played a game Tuesday.\n\nNo. 1 LSU has played every other day since Opening Day on Friday, Feb. 13, working through five games in a six-day span and it came out the busy stretch unscathed. The Tigers (5-0) capped the homestand with a 12-1 run-rule victory over in-state foe Nicholls State at Alex Box Stadium on Wednesday, Feb. 18.\n\nPinch hitter John Pearson ended the game in the eighth with a three-run homer. Junior Jake Brown continued his torrid start to the 2026 season, going 2 for 5 with two RBIs and a run. Trent Caraway hit a first-inning grand slam.\n\nMORE LSU BASEBALL COVERAGE What Jay Johnson, LSU baseball players said after win over Kent State\n\nSenior Zac Cowan earned his first win of the season on the mound while freshman Reagan Ricken picked up the save in his first collegiate appeaance.\n\nWith the first handful of games out of the way for the Tigers, here are three takeaways for LSU as it gets ready to board the plane to Jacksonville, Florida to play Indiana, Notre Dame and UCF in the Jax College Baseball Classic over the weekend.\n\nIt's early, but what Brown is doing at the plate right now is eyebrow-raising. He's smashed four home runs in the first five games — back-to-back two-home run games against Milwaukee and Kent State — and is currently hitting .500 with 12 RBIs and eight runs.\n\nMore times than not, Brown has jumpstarted LSU's offense when it has needed a spark and the lineup is feeding off of his production and timeliness.\n\nThis is Brown's third year starting for the Tigers so his ascension shouldn't be a surprise. But how well he is playing and seeing the ball is scary for opponents.\n\nFor one, the starters outside of Cooper Moore have struggled against Milwaukee, Kent State and Nicholls. That should raise some flags but it is early. Guys like Casan Evans and Zac Cowan have pitched enough at this level that quick turnarounds are expected from them.\n\nBut LSU's starting weekend rotation doesn't seem to be fully nailed down yet. Evans and Moore will be there, but who the third starter will be is the question. Sophomore William Schmidt struck out a lot of batters during his start Sunday, but he also gave up three runs on as many hits with three walks.\n\nLSU's bullpen, however, was a bright spot for coach Jay Johnson and company through the first five games. Deven Sheerin is fully healthy from his ACL tear and has looked masterful. Mavrick Rizy, Cooper Williams, and Gavin Guidry were all unhittable with Guidry picking up a win and a save in two outings.\n\n\"I think pitching we're not totally just dialed just quite yet,\" Johnson said after LSU's win over Nicholls. \"I think we will move closer to it. There's way more positives from the mound than not. It's obviously a deep staff. And that's five games in six days. We're running out (freshman) Reagan Ricken for the last three innings and that guy probably could pitch on Friday.\"\n\nLSU's offense showed this opening stretch how difficult it could be on an opposing dugout. It scored 17 runs with two outs over the course of its first five games.\n\nA number of those run-scoring hits were for extra bases as well, including Trent Carayway's first-inning grand slam Wednesday with two outs. What has stood out is how well the Tigers' approach is with two outs, and especially with runners on and two gone.\n\nIf LSU can continue that trend, it'll be a difficult team to beat moving forward.\n\nCory Diaz covers the LSU Tigers for The Daily Advertiser as part of the USA TODAY Network.

    "fullText": "The Raiders have hired Al Holcomb as a senior defensive assistant, Mike Garafolo of NFL Media reports.\n\nNew defensive coordinator Rob Leonard, a first-time coordinator who is 38, has never worked with Holcomb. But the fact that Holcomb is 55 and with coordinator experience gives Leonard somebody to lean on.\n\nHolcomb was the Bills' linebackers coach the past two seasons after one season as senior defensive assistant.\n\nThe Raiders have yet to announce a linebackers coach, but it does not appear Holcomb will serve as a position coach.\n\nHolcomb began his NFL coaching career with the Giants in 2009, and spent four seasons there as a defensive quality control coach (2009-10) and a defensive assistant (2011-12). He was the linebackers coach with the Panthers from 2013-17 before going to the Cardinals as the defensive coordinator and assistant head coach.\n\nHolcomb departed Arizona after one season and joined the Browns for one season as its linebackers coach and run game coordinator. He returned to Carolina for three seasons as defensive run game coordinator and then assistant head coach, defense in 2022 before the Panthers fired Matt Rhule, which led to Holcomb being named interim defensive coordinator.",

    "description": "Granlund's Finland surges toward Olympic glory, while Gudas and Dostal's medal hopes end in a thrilling quarterfinal overtime loss.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Olympic Games are coming to an end, as all four men’s hockey quarterfinals were played on Wednesday.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks had three players in action: Lukas Dostal (Czechia), Radko Gudas (Czechia), and Mikael Granlund (Finland). Damian Clara’s Italy squad was eliminated on Tuesday, and Jackson LaCombe was a healthy scratch for the fourth consecutive game for the United States.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas, Dostal Advance with Czechia, Clara Eliminated with Italy\n\nFrank Vatrano Talks Shoulder Injury and Tough Season\n\nWith the way the qualifying games shook out after the preliminary round, Czechia found themselves facing Canada for the second time in five games. They had lost 5-0 to open the tournament and were more prepared to face the gold-medal favorite in the quarterfinals.\n\nAn evenly-played first period saw Czechia take a 2-1 lead into the second period, and Canada handily controlled the majority of possession from there. Behind astute interior defending from Gudas and the blueline, Dostal made a handful of big saves and gave his team a chance to win.\n\nOndrej Palat gave Czechia a 3-2 lead late in the third period, but it was answered by Nick Suzuki four minutes later, and the game was sent to overtime, where Mitch Marner advanced Canada to the semis after a minute and a half of OT.\n\nGudas made his presence felt early and often on the defensive side of the puck, not only by providing his trademark physical play, but with keen anticipation skills that disrupted several Canadian attacks through the neutral zone.\n\nUnfortunately, one of those neutral zone pressures sent Canada captain Sidney Crosby to the locker room for the remainder of the game with a lower-body injury. Gudas stepped up on Crosby, as an outlet in the second period, and Crosby seemingly attempted to dodge the hit, but folded on his right leg in an unfortunate way. No penalty was called on the ice.\n\nGudas had an up-and-down tournament, but saved his best hockey for when it mattered most in today’s game. Gudas finished this game with an assist, a high-skilled play where he picked off a cross-ice neutral zone pass and turned it the other way, starting a 3v2. He also registered two penalty minutes and two shots on goal in 19:57 TOI.\n\nHe finished his second, and what will likely be his last, Olympic Games with a point (an assist) in five games played, but he won’t bring a medal home with him.\n\nMuch like the rest of the tournament and his entire 2025-26 season with the Anaheim Ducks, Dostal played very well. However, “very well” is below the superhuman level he needed to perform at if he was to carry his Czech team to the podium at these Olympics.\n\nAs mentioned, he did enough to earn a win in this game, but he didn’t solely win the game for Czechia. He brought his entire arsenal to this quarterfinal matchup: perfect lateral puck tracking, powerful pushes when pucks moved from the goal line to the slot or dots, and terrific rebound control.\n\nThe element that stood out most this tournament, with Czechia’s suspect blueline as a whole, was his ability to knock down dump-ins and individually start breakouts with pinpoint outlets to his defensemen or wingers up the wall.\n\nDostal finished this game by saving 37 of the 41 shots he faced for a .902 SV%. He finished his first Olympic Games medal-less, sporting a 1-3-0 record, and an .886 SV%.\n\nSwitzerland gave Finland quite the scare, as Switzerland had been one of the more impressive and cohesive teams in this tournament, even without the services of star forward Kevin Fiala. Switzerland got a pair of goals late in the first period of what was a high-intensity back-and-forth affair.\n\nSebastian Aho and MIro Heiskanen dashed the Swiss’s hopes of winning in regulation with a pair of late goals that sent the game to overtime, as the Finnish firepower proved too overwhelming and unrelenting for Switzerland. On the ropes, the Finnish coaching staff threw their forward lines into a blender halfway through the game with hopes of igniting a comeback, and they were eventually rewarded.\n\nFinland captain and Ducks’ forward Mikael Granlund started the game in the spot where he started the tournament: on the left wing of Roope Hintz and opposite Mikko Rantanen. As lines were tinkered with, he played with Sebastian Aho and Tuevo Teravainen for a stretch in the second, and played most of the third with Hintz and Kaapo Kakko. It will be curious to monitor how the lines shake out for Finland’s all-important semi-final game against Canada on Friday.\n\nHe was mostly a non-factor on the top line, but provided linemates with steady defensive habits, typically as an F3. When lines began to mix, he earned more puck touches, made several connecting plays to advance pucks up ice, and displayed elite edges multiple times when breaking down defenders along the offensive wall.\n\nGranlund finished this game scoreless with four shots on goal in 20:12 TOI, third-most among Finnish forwards.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Dostal, Gudas, Czechia Drop Overtime Game to Switzerland, LaCombe Scratched for Third Straight\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Granlund's Finland Dismantles Clara's Italy, LaCombe Scratched for USA\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas Defeats France with Czechia, Granlund Assists in Finland Win Against Rival Sweden",

    "description": "Pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, speaking Spanish, entered not guilty pleas through a translator to a rewritten indictment in Brooklyn federal court.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — A scheduled spring fraud trial for two Cleveland Guardians pitchers accused of colluding with sports bettors to rig bets and betray “America’s pastime” will likely be postponed until October, a federal judge said Wednesday as the men pleaded not guilty to a rewritten indictment.\n\nJudge Kiyo A. Matsumoto left a May 4 trial date on the books for now, but indicated she’ll probably move it to the fall in the coming weeks.\n\nPitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, speaking Spanish, entered not guilty pleas through a translator to a rewritten indictment in Brooklyn federal court.\n\nNo new charges were in the superseding indictment unsealed on Friday, as prosecutors charged a third individual with serving as a middleman between bettors and Clase. That person also pleaded not guilty Wednesday.\n\nThe pitchers were first charged in November with accepting several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two gamblers from their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 by placing more than 100 in-game prop bets and parlays on the speed and the outcome of certain pitches. Charges include wire fraud conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests.\n\nThe rewritten indictment released Friday added allegations that Clase used code words like “rooster” and “chicken” in communications about pitches to be thrown.\n\nPrior to a May 18, 2025, game against the Cincinnati Reds, Clase received a message to “throw a rock at the first rooster in today’s fight” and responded with: “Yes, of course, that’s an easy toss to that rooster,” the indictment said. However, Clase never entered the game and could not fulfill the plan to throw outside the strike zone to the first batter he faced, it added.\n\nA day earlier, though, Clase broke Major League Baseball rules by using his cellphone in the middle of a game against the Reds to signal to gamblers that a pitch would be outside the strike zone, enabling them to win about $27,000, the indictment said.\n\nClase, the Guardians’ former closer, and Ortiz, a starter, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July. Their teammates are just starting training camp for the new season. The team’s home opener is April 3.\n\nClase and Ortiz, who are free on bail, left the courthouse separately after Wednesday’s hearing. Neither commented. Lawyers for both men have insisted their clients never colluded with gamblers.\n\nLawyers for Ortiz have asked that he be tried separately, saying in court papers that if Clase passed along Ortiz’s pitching strategy to gamblers, he did so without Ortiz’s knowledge. They also noted that Ortiz is accused of throwing only two pitches that drew scrutiny over a 12-day span, while Clase is charged with colluding with gamblers on numerous pitches since 2023.\n\n“Mr. Clase may have abused his relationship with Mr. Ortiz as friends and teammates by convincing Mr. Ortiz to throw certain pitches at certain times — ostensibly for baseball reasons as far as Mr. Ortiz was aware,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nThey said they might present a defense to the jury that would cast “Ortiz as a victim of Mr. Clase’s scheme, rather than a knowing and willing participant.”\n\nClase, a three-time All-Star, had a $4.5 million salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract. Prosecutors say he started providing bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn’t seek payoffs until last year.\n\nProsecutors have said that Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary last season, joined the scheme last June.\n\nThe Guardians and Major League Baseball have said they are cooperating with the investigation. MLB said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity.",

    "fullText": "As expected, the Seahawks are for sale.\n\nDespite recent denials, the inevitable is happening. Owner Paul Allen died in October 2018. He left an express directive that the team will be sold, with the proceeds going to charity. After more than seven years, the league leaned on his sister, Jody, to get it done.\n\nThe timing is no surprise. We've previously reported that the league held a $5 million fine in abeyance with the understanding that the team would promptly be put on the market after Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe goal will be to sell the team to the highest bidder, in order to maximize the charitable contribution. The price tag, despite valuations in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion, is expected to land in the range of $9 billion to $11 billion.\n\nThe Seahawks organization, along with the team's fans, will be stuck with whoever the high bidder may be.\n\nIt's currently not known who it will be, or what that person will choose to do once they acquire full control over the franchise. It will be the next owner's prerogative to make changes, or not. To meddle, or not. To screw up a good thing, or not.\n\nAnd the fans will be stuck. Owners can't be fired. The fans can only hope the team lands in the hands of someone who will allow G.M. John Schneider to keep doing what he's been doing.\n\nBut no one other than the next owner will have any control over the situation. The next owner could be closer to Dan Snyder than any of the various good owners. (If we name one as an example, the ones not named won't be happy.)\n\nThe only thing that will matter is the money. As often is the case.\n\nEither way, the Seahawks will soon be meeting a new boss. They can only hope it's roughly the same as the old boss.",

And I’ve felt that way since (being) fourth in South Korea in the slalom.\" And then about the win she said, \"In order to do this today, I kind of needed to accept the possibility that those questions would keep coming. It was like, just don't resist it. Just live in my own moment.”\n\nThe gold medal win moved Shiffrin into a tie with Shaun White and Kaillie Humphries for second-most gold medals for American athletes at the Winter Olympics. She now has four total medals in alpine skiing, which moves her into a tie for most in the event by an American woman.\n\nAbout competing, Shiffrin said, \"The reality of our sport is you lose a lot more than you win. When you look back on my career, I know statistics and everything, but still I've definitely lost a lot more than I've won. So that's the one thing that's certain is that you're not going to win everything.”\n\nShe hasn't committed to her future, but has acknowledged that her career can't continue forever. She said, \"The one thing that's certain is that that wave's going to stop. You don't get to ride that wave forever.\"\n\nMORE: Mikaela Shiffrin snaps Olympics drought with historically dominant slalom gold",

    "fullText": "One day after Tony Clark's surprise resignation amid a reported inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, the Major League Baseball Players Association elected Bruce Meyer as its executive director, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.\n\nThe vote was reportedly unanimous, with Meyer receiving the job on an interim basis after previously serving as deputy executive director.\n\nMeyer was the natural choice as Clark's No. 2 and the union's lead negotiator with MLB. He spoke earlier Wednesday about the importance of the union remaining united in the wake of Clark's ouster.\n\nAccording to Passan, Clark resigned on the heels of an internal investigation, which revealed an inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, who worked for the union beginning in 2023. The union held an emergency meeting Tuesday afternoon, but did not vote on an executive director until Wednesday.\n\nThe news comes less than a year before the current CBA is set to expire on Dec. 1. The union and MLB owners are expected to engage in a furious labor battle ahead of the new CBA, which many expect could lead to a lockout ahead of the 2027 MLB season. There is speculation the owners will push hard for a salary cap, something the players have opposed for years.\n\nMeyer joined the MLBPA in 2018 and played a central role in the last CBA negotiation. This election confirms he'll indeed be at the table for the upcoming negotiation.\n\nClark played a major role in helping negotiate previous CBAs for the players. He reportedly took an active part in negotiations as a player before being hired by the MLBPA in 2010. He was initially a director of player relations before being hired as the union's executive director in 2013. He oversaw negotiations ahead of the 2016 CBA and the contentious 2022 lockout, which resulted in Opening Day being postponed by a week as negotiations extended into March.",

    "description": "Despite his sharp statistical downturn in recent years, Robert Woods should be long remembered in fantasy football circles.",
    "fullText": "A torn ACL at age 29 altered the trajectory of one of the most underrated wide receivers of the past decade, and certainly one of the most underrated fantasy WRs. Now that Robert Woods has retired, let's recognize just how good he was.\n\nThere were three distinct phases to Woods' fantasy football career. His first four seasons were in Buffalo, where he caught passes thrown by QBs like EJ Manuel, Thaddeus Lewis, Kyle Orton, and Tyrod Taylor. Naturally, there was little room for glory. Woods' best fantasy numbers came in 2014.\n\nA switch to the Rams beginning in 2017 helped make him a fantasy mainstay. In his first year there, he was joined by rookie WR Cooper Kupp, second-year QB Jared Goff, and third-year RB Todd Gurley. It was the foundation of an offensive juggernaut, and as managers know all too well, it's often wise to invest in starters on high-scoring teams. The Rams led the league in scoring that season.\n\nDespite frequently sharing the field with one of the game's best running backs and a rapidly rising wide receiver, Woods carved out a unique fantasy niche. In Year 1, he was the WR19 in points per game -- the first of five consecutive seasons finishing in the top 20. Few WRs this century can make the same claim.\n\nHowever, in that fifth season in L.A., Woods tore his ACL at age 29. He was never the same after that, finishing outside the top 70 in each of his remaining seasons with Tennessee and Houston.\n\nIt's been more than five years since Woods was fantasy-relevant. But it doesn't take away from what he achieved: one of the most consistent statistical outputs by a WR in the modern NFL.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Robert Woods retires: an underrated fantasy football legacy",

Mostly not because of the receiving corps, but the lack of talent there wasn’t helping. They rotated guys through the lineup, but little was learned from that.\n\nJack Bech had the makings of a decent slot receiver coming out of TCU but has a lot to prove. Thornton was given every opportunity to be a starting X receiver and only proved that he has all the physical tools and none of the other requirements at the position.\n\nAs of now it’s Tre Tucker and a lot of questions. At very least, they need to add a starting caliber X receiver. They would be wise to look for a good slot receiver too. Just to cover themselves.

I just felt like we could be better all the way around, and I kind of wanted to focus more on just taking the team to another level. So, I decided to get out of the seat. I just didn't feel like our team was at the level it could be, and that's my goal to fix that.”\n\nPritchett, a former Top Alcohol Dragster competitor and longtime Top Fuel crew member with the Torrence Racing team, said, “I feel like all the stars are kind of aligning and [am] really excited for the opportunity. It feels like I got the opportunity I've been waiting on my whole life.”\n\nThe change reunites Pritchett with crew chief Doug Kuch, who guided him through his Top Fuel licensing procedure in 2015.\n\n“Doug Kuch actually got me my Top Fuel license back in 2015, in Charlotte,” Pritchett said, remarking that the relationship is “coming full circle.”\n\nFoley, a seasoned Top Fuel driver with a handful of IHRA victories and a longtime co-owner with the late Tim Lewis, said the move allows him to focus on strengthening the organization both competitively and commercially.\n\nDoug Foley Racing will compete in a combination of NHRA and IHRA events in 2026.

    "fullText": "Spring training is rolling on in Major League Baseball, though many stars will depart camp early to join their teams for the World Baseball Classic.\n\nHere are some top headlines from around the MLB, including the Houston Astros targeting a pair of former Dodgers and the fallout from the MLB Players Association’s executive director’s surprise resignation.\n\nCavan Biggio, son of Astros great and Hall of Famer Craig Biggio, was signed to a minor league deal by the team, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe younger Biggio was a Dodger for part of 2024, appearing in 30 games and slashing .192/.306/.329.\n\nThe utility man has spent seven years in the majors as part of four teams.\n\nMichael Conforto, who spent 2025 with the Dodgers but had the worst season of his career, has also drawn interest from the Astros, according to Brian McTaggart of MLB.com.\n\nThe Houston Astros have reportedly showed interest in signing Michael Conforto, who still remains a free agent at the beginning of Spring Training.\n\nConforto is coming off a disappointing season with the Dodgers and is 32-years-old. pic.twitter.com/dUQx20cXcC\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) February 18, 2026\n\nDuring his year in LA, Conforto slashed .199/.305/.333 in 138 games.\n\nHe hit 12 home runs and knocked in 36 runs as well.\n\nConforto slashed .237/.309/.450 with 20 home runs and 66 RBIs for the San Francisco Giants in 2024.\n\nHe’d been on a one-year, $17 million deal with the Dodgers, but the Boys in Blue filled that hole in the outfield with Kyle Tucker, perhaps the top free agent of the offseason.\n\nFollowing the shocking resignation of Tony Clark, who’d been having an “inappropriate relationship” with his sister-in-law, deputy executive director Bruce Meyer projected strength on Wednesday.\n\n“I’m not going to say this is a great thing; this is unforeseen,” he said, as reported by Jesse Rogers of ESPN. “At the end of the day, leadership is important and leadership comes and goes, but what remains is the players.\n\n“Our union is strong and always has been strong because of the solidarity of our members, of our players. That is going to continue, and as I’ve said in the past in different contexts, anybody who underestimates the strength of the MLB Players Association does so at their own peril.”",

    "description": "Social media users claimed Seattle's Super Bowl champions declined an invitation, but evidence is lacking.",
    "fullText": "A decades-long custom of championship-winning sports teams making a celebratory trip to the White House has become a political lightning rod throughout U.S. President Donald Trump's time in office, leaving fans uncertain as to whether the Seattle Seahawks will make the trip to D.C. following their Super Bowl win on Feb. 8, 2026.\n\nOn Feb. 17, rumors began spreading online that the Seahawks had explicitly declined a White House invitation. The claim spread on multiple platforms (archived, archived, archived), including an X post (archived) that received more than 3.8 million views, as of this writing. The X user didn't appear to have any related, official role that would lend credibility to his claim:\n\nOther posts, including one from a sports parody X account (archived), continued to gain momentum, with many users in the comments apparently believing the claim that the Seahawks either declined an invitation from the White House or the White House rescinded an invitation to the Seattle team.\n\nEither way, the claim lacks evidence. Neither the Seahawks nor the White House has made any official announcement, as of this writing, regarding whether the team will make an appearance at the White House. We reached out to Seahawks spokespeople and the White House, as well as top players' representatives, and did not immediately receive responses. We will update this story if we do.\n\nSeveral news media outlets, including NBC Sports, reported on the rumor, similarly noting the claim lacked supporting evidence.\n\nThe Seahawks' official site (archived) and X account didn't feature any news release corroborating the claim, as of this writing.\n\nFollowing the Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl win in 2025, several players — including quarterback Jalen Hurts — chose to skip the scheduled appearance with Trump. An NBC White House correspondent reported their expected absence just hours before the team's visit took place in April 2025.\n\nIt's possible, judging by precedent, that a Seahawks visit will take place that hasn't, as of this writing, been scheduled. In 2021, for example, the Super Bowl champion Buccaneers didn't make the trip until July.\n\nIf Trump's White House did decline to invite the Seahawks, it wouldn't be the first time a Super Bowl champion's audience with the president intentionally did not take place. In 2018, during Trump's first term, his office released a statement (archived) after several Philadelphia Eagle players publicly indicated they would decline. Trump's statement claimed the players disagreed with Trump because \"he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\"\n\nBecause neither the White House nor an official representative for the Seahawks confirmed whether the team will appear at the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl win, we leave this claim unrated.\n\nCaplan, Anna Lazarus.

    "description": "In a unanimous vote, the MLB Players Association has selected Bruce Meyer to be its interim leader.",
    "fullText": "PHOENIX — Bruce Meyer, the tenacious veteran litigator who has been the Major League Baseball Player Association’s lead negotiator, was voted unanimously Wednesday by the players to be their interim executive director, replacing Tony Clark.\n\nMeyer, who was promoted to be the union’s deputy executive director in 2022, has been MLB’s public enemy since he joined the union in 2018. He frequently has clashed on even small agenda items with MLB, which has accused him of being bad for baseball.\n\nMeyer is considered the union’s most fierce litigator since the days of Don Fehr and Gene Orza, and once again Wednesday expressed his deep resentment towards MLB’s hopes for a salary cap, believing that a lockout Dec. 1 is inevitable when the collective bargaining agreement expires.\n\n“A lockout is all but guaranteed at the end of the agreement,’’ Meyer said Wednesday afternoon after meeting with the Chicago Cubs, and spending the morning with the Kansas City Royals. “The league has pretty much said that. Their strategy in bargaining has always been to put as much pressure on players as they can to try and create divisions and cracks among our membership.\n\n“It never worked. I don’t think it will ever work.’’\n\nMeyer, who said he will continue to be the lead negotiator, said that he and his staff have a duty to the players to listen to whatever MLB offers, but showed his disdain towards even entertaining a salary cap.\n\n“Our position and the historic position of this union for decades on the salary cap is well known,’’ Meyer said. “It’s the ultimate restriction. It is something that owners in all the sports have wanted more than anything, and in baseball in particular. There’s a reason for that, because it’s good for them and not the players.’’\n\nMeyer, even with the sudden resignation of Clark over an inappropriate relationship with a union employee, insisted Wednesday morning there is no disarray among the union ranks, and its resolve remains strong.\n\n“I think anybody who's going to assume that and act on that,’’ Meyer said, “is really making a mistake. I'm not going to say (the timing of Clark’s resignation) is a great thing. This is unforeseen. There have been some issues hanging over (him), and in some respects, it's good to get them out of the way sooner rather than later.’’\n\nMeyer, while respected for his fierceness, does have his detractors. There was an attempt to remove him from the office two years ago, an effort led by attorney Harry Marino, who organized the efforts to have minor leaguers unionized. It failed when Clark came to Meyer’s defense.\n\nThe eight-person executive subcommittee pushed for Meyer to be voted as the executive director in their meeting Tuesday, but after pushback by at last three players on the call, no vote was taken. The group of 72 players, including player representatives from 30 teams, decided to reconvene at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday after polling their own teammates. If Meyer didn’t receive enough support, they likely would have turned to Matt Nussbaum, the union’s general counsel.\n\nNow, Meyer will be running the whole show, much to MLB’s fear thanks to past negotiations.\n\nWhen the 99-day lockout ended in 2022, and the rank-and-file voted to accept MLB’s last proposal, Meyer sympathized with the executive council who wanted to continue negotiations, even if it meant losing games.\n\n“Some players emerged from bargaining disappointed that we did not accomplish more,’’ Meyer said in a letter to players two years ago, “and in particular that we did not miss games to see if more gains could be made. To be clear, I sympathized and still do with these players and this position.’’\n\nMeyer, who becomes the seventh executive director of the union, expects negotiations with MLB to begin in April on the next CBA, and just like the last round, tranquility will not be on anyone’s bingo card.\n\n“I'd say I'm known as a tough litigator who also knows how to make deals when necessary,’’ Meyer said in a Q&A with the MLBPA newsletter. “In the sports area I've been involved in just about every type of issue, including labor, antitrust, licensing, collective bargaining and others. But the common thread is I have a passion for player advocacy and defending player rights.’’\n\nLet the negotiations, with plenty of rancor, begin.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: MLBPA selects Bruce Meyer as interim boss after Tony Clark resignation",

    "fullText": "SEATTLE — The Washington Huskies have parted ways with offensive coordinator Jimmie Dougherty.\n\nWashington has not yet filled Dougherty’s role. No offensive coordinator has been listed on the university’s website for the 2026 season.\n\nDougherty, who last season added the offensive coordinator title after serving as the Huskies’ passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2024, said it was an “honor” to represent the University of Washington Tuesday night on social media.\n\n“To the city of Seattle, words can’t express what you mean to me and my family!!!” Dougherty said. “Most of all the players, love you guys forever, thank you.”\n\nDougherty, 47, began working alongside Washington head coach Jedd Fisch in 2021 when both were at Arizona. When Fisch was hired at Washington, Dougherty followed him and eventually became an offensive coordinator for the first time since he held that role at San Jose State in 2014.\n\n“I have worked with Jimmie Dougherty for 7 years and am appreciative for his many contributions to our success as an offense and as a team,” Fisch said on social media. “I want to thank Jimmie and wish him all the best in the future.”\n\nIt is unclear where Dougherty, who has also previously coached at Illinois Wesleyan, San Diego, San Jose State, Michigan and UCLA, is headed next. Whoever fills his role will inherit an offense that will be led by quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who was the subject of controversy last month because of his entering and exiting the transfer portal.",

    "fullText": "The derby. Is there a more raw feeling in football than seeing your club face another just down the road? Local bragging rights. Ownership of territory. Your land is ours now.\n\nK League has several major derbies, but hidden beneath the surface, unheralded rivalries are screaming out for your attention.\n\nSupporters of Jeonbuk Hyundai, Pohang Steelers, and Ulsan HD can rightly spit out their cornflakes when glossing over an article that largely passes them by. Veteran followers of K League will know that the Donghaean Derby between Pohang and Ulsan is among the three most significant rivalries in Korea. Jeonbuk share rivalries with those clubs — and several others in the league. Add the price on their heads for consistently winning titles, and every Jeonbuk fixture feels like an event in 2026.\n\nIf you're interested in the destination of the trophy, or in seeing the best players lining up for the best teams, examine the schedule for matches involving those three clubs and Daejeon Hana. However, this article is written for the groundhopper. The casual fan looking for something a little different. A train journey to a less familiar destination. A match off Broadway, if you like.\n\nThis article leans heavily on clubs located in or near Seoul. That isn’t inherent bias towards the capital region — merely a reflection of geography. Across K League 1 and 2, 15 of 29 clubs are on or near a Seoul Metro line.\n\nHere is a list of underrated rivalries worth checking out in 2026.\n\nSuwon Samsung Bluewings vs. Suwon FC (K League 2)\n\nSuwon Bluewings love some razzamatazz at Big Bird.\n\nSeparated by just3.3 km, this is currently the only city derby in Korea’s top two divisions. For the first time ever, the two sides will meet in K League 2 in 2026, following relegations in 2023 (Bluewings) and 2025 (Suwon FC).\n\nOn a national scale, this fixture never truly captured the wider football public’s attention, but when the distance between the two grounds can be covered on foot, it demands inclusion.\n\nStaring down automatic relegation in November 2023, unproven manager Yeom Ki-hun appeared to be turning the tide when the neighbours met in a proverbial six-pointer. Despite falling behind early and being reduced to ten men, the Bluewings stormed back to win 3–2. Their survival hopes remained alive — but ultimately, it wasn’t enough. The clubs finished level on points, yet Suwon FC’s superior goals-scored record sent the Bluewings down.\n\nIncredibly, Suwon FC boast a winning record against their bigger, richer, and historically more successful neighbours. In 16 K League 1 meetings, Suwon FC have won nine to the Bluewings’ six, with one draw.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Suwon Samsung Bluewings, Castle Park — Sunday, May 3, 19:00.\n\nSuwon Samsung Bluewings vs. Suwon FC, Suwon World Cup Stadium — Saturday, August 15, 16:30.\n\nAside from being the only current city derby in the top two leagues, the stadiums are a spectacular contrast in style. Suwon Stadium is an ageing, multi-purpose ground with limited pitchside seating, minimal facilities, and no roof cover. Big Bird, by contrast, is a majestic football-specific arena with an iconic roof and a riot of seat colours.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nSeoul will be on the menu for hungry Bucheon this year.\n\nApproximately15 km — across the Han River — separates two clubs who have never officially met in league competition. Until Seoul E-Land can convert investment into promotion, Bucheon will serve as Seoul’s nearest true rival.\n\nThe history is complicated. A team from Bucheon once faced the modern incarnation of FC Seoul — but that club is now Jeju SK. Bucheon FC 1995 was founded in response. Context aside, this one will be spicy.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Seoul World Cup Stadium — Tuesday, April 21, 19:30.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. FC Seoul, Bucheon Stadium — Sunday, July 19, 19:30.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Seoul World Cup Stadium — Tuesday, August 25, 19:30.\n\nEstablished K League fanbases enjoy visiting new grounds. Many Seoul supporters weren’t following the club during the Bucheon SK era. A packed away section is guaranteed when they make the short trip across the river. Likewise, Bucheon should travel well to Sangam. Two Tuesday fixtures, however, are far from ideal.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nIncheon's famous South Stand is an imposing structure.\n\nThe 031 Derby — named after the regional area code — pits Bucheon against Incheon to the west. The stadiums are18 km apart and easily reached by subway. The clubs first met in K League 2 last season and renew their rivalry in the top flight following joint promotion. This will be Bucheon’s first taste of K League 1 football.\n\nBucheon pulled off a major shock last September, defeating the champions-elect. The result forced the rest of K League 2 to take notice: Bucheon were not just promotion contenders, but genuine candidates for automatic promotion. They ultimately fell short of completing a 031 Derby clean sweep, but the win did nothing to derail their playoff ambitions.\n\nIncheon lead the series two wins to Bucheon’s one. Incheon claimed both home fixtures at Sungui Arena (3–1 and 1–0), while Bucheon exacted revenge on home soil in September.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Incheon United, Bucheon Stadium — Saturday, April 18, 16:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Sungui Arena — Sunday, July 26, 19:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Sungui Arena — Tuesday, September 8, 19:30.\n\nLong sandwiched between major K League powers, Bucheon — a compact city on Incheon’s eastern edge — now have an opportunity to bloody the noses of their neighbours. After years of scrapping with regional sides like Ansan Greeners and Seoul E-Land, this step up in opposition and status should produce genuine edge.\n\nOn the pitch, the colors will be familiar to fans of Milan's big 2. Anyone who grew up in the 90's watching Italian Football on Channel 4 with James Richardson will absolutely appreciate seeing red/black vs. blue/black again.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Ansan Greeners (K League 2)\n\nAt long last, Ansan have a rendezvous with Suwon, based 20 km east as the crow flies. The Green Wolves have waited six years for revenge following a 4–0 trouncing during the COVID era.\n\nAnsan supporters still recall the days of Hallelujah and Police — the Greeners’ predecessors in the city. Suwon FC remain the most visited away side to Wa~.\n\nIshida Masatoshi returned to Wa~ after a successful season with Ansan and tore his former club apart in a comfortable 4–0 win for Suwon. An Byong-jun was also on the scoresheet as Suwon continued their march toward promotion. Fortunately for the Greeners, COVID restrictions meant the gates were closed that October afternoon.\n\nSuwon currently edge the rivalry with seven wins to Ansan’s six, alongside two draws. Ansan dominated the early meetings before Suwon finally broke through in 2018.\n\nAnsan Greeners vs. Suwon FC, Wa~ Stadium — Saturday, July 4, 19:30.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Ansan Greeners, Castle Park — Sunday, November 1, 14:00.\n\nAbout the only recognisable feature of Ansan Greeners is the enormous VERDOR banner that follows the downtrodden club around the country. The trip to Castle Park will be a short one for their signature banner. If there is one image that will bring back the horrors of K League 2 for Suwon FC fans, it is that green banner.\n\nFC Seoul vs. FC Anyang (K League 1)\n\nThe mural that angered Anyang's fans.\n\nThanks to the dense cluster of clubs in the Seoul Capital Area — particularly south and west of the river — familiar names recur.\n\nSeoul and Anyang sit just24 km apart. Anyang hate Seoul. Why? Because the club now known as FC Seoul once played in Anyang as the LG Cheetahs. In 2004, they announced their return to the capital, moving into the vacant World Cup Stadium. This is both a rivalry and a derby.\n\nThe last meeting saw Anyang celebrate one of the greatest nights in their history — on Seoul’s turf. Goals from Thomas Oude Kotte and Bruno Mota secured a stunning 2–1 victory. Tears flowed in the away end. The win exorcised old demons and convinced Anyang they belonged at this level.\n\n[READ: For Anyang, life will never be the same again]\n\nPerfect balance: one win, one draw, and one defeat each.\n\nFC Anyang vs. FC Seoul, Anyang Stadium — Sunday, April 5, 14:00.\n\nFC Seoul vs. FC Anyang, Seoul World Cup — Tuesday, May 5, 19:00.\n\nFC Anyang vs. FC Seoul, Anyang Stadium — Saturday, August 22, 19:30.\n\nThe rivalry is established and only set to intensify. When Seoul welcomed Anyang to Sangam last February, the home fans held up a mural reading 1983 - their year of formation. Anyang were furious. They feel some of that history belongs in the Violet city.\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United (K League 1)\n\nI can’t fully explain it — and I may be wrong — but the overdue meeting between Incheon and Anyang feels like fertile ground for a genuine rivalry.\n\nAnyang were a lifetime K League 2 club until lifting the title in 2024. They effectively took Incheon’s place after Incheon suffered their first relegation. Incheon’s rapid return and Anyang’s survival now place them on a collision course. The clubs are separated by33 km of Gyeonggi Province sprawl.\n\n[READ: A League You Have to Walk To: Football and Geography in Korea]\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United, Anyang Stadium — Sunday, March 22, 16:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. FC Anyang, Sungui Arena — Sunday, July 12, 19:30.\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United, Anyang Stadium — Wednesday, August 26, 19:30.\n\nPost-match pints. Incheon and Anyang have their go-to bar for beers. Anyang's, named after a famous football club in England, is a shrine to global football. Liverpool and Anyang dominate, but don't be surprised to see scarves from Japan, Russia, and South America on the walls. Have a pint, meet new friends, and keep the fists on the table.\n\nCheonan City FC vs. Chungnam Asan (K League 2)\n\nThe first ever K League clash between Asan and Cheonan.\n\nOtherwise known simply as “the Derby,” Cheonan and Asan are neighbouring cities divided by one landmark: Cheonan-Asan KTX Station. You can’t travel between the two grounds without passing beneath the high-speed tracks. The clubs are also five stops apart on Metro Line 1 — just13 km.\n\nOn a clear November afternoon, the provincial rivals drew 1–1 at Yi Sun-sin Stadium. Cheonan led until half-time. Asan equalised with 30 minutes remaining. With little left to play for, the draw felt especially flat for Asan, who had narrowly missed promotion in 2023.\n\nAs the more established club, Asan hold the stronger record (five wins to two). However, both of Cheonan’s victories came last season, and with the draw included, they are unbeaten in the fixture since September 2024.\n\nCheonan City FC vs. Chungnam Asan, Cheonan Stadium — Sunday, May 3, 16:30.\n\nChungnam Asan vs. Cheonan City FC, Yi Sun-sin — Sunday, November 1, 14:00.\n\nMost fixtures on this list are Gyeonggi-based. While Cheonan and Asan sit on Metro Line 1, Asan in particular still feels remote — which only adds to the charm.\n\nJeju SK vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nBuses, trains, or bikes won’t help much here. Jeju SK, based on the island of the same name, trace their roots to Seoul. Forced from the capital under K League’s decentralisation policy, they relocated first to Bucheon. Then, in 2006, the club woke up in a different city again. Bucheon FC 1995 were born in response.\n\nBucheon knocked Jeju out of the cup last year, but their last league meeting came during the COVID-affected 2020 season. Jeju won 2–0 in Bucheon, scoring twice inside 13 minutes through An Hyeon-beom and Joo Min-kyu.\n\nRemarkably, the clubs have met only three times in league competition — all in 2020. Jeju won all three, scoring seven and conceding none.\n\n[READ: Buying Tickets and Football Guide in Korea (Updated for 2026)]\n\nJeju SK vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Jeju World Cup Stadium — Saturday, April 4, 14:00.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Jeju SK, Bucheon Stadium — Tuesday, May 5, 14:00.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Jeju SK, Bucheon Stadium — Saturday, September 12, 16:30.\n\nBucheon hate Jeju. When Jeju rebranded from Jeju United to Jeju SK last winter, it sparked outrage in Bucheon. As fate would have it, the sides were drawn together in the cup. Bucheon won — serenading Jeju off the pitch to chants of “Bucheon SK.”\n\nA crowd of zero witnessed those 90 minutes due to virus restrictions. Maybe it never happened.",

    "fullText": "PFL heads to Pittsburgh for its third event of 2026 with former middleweight champion Johnny Eblen leading the charge.\n\nEblen faces Bryan Battle in the middleweight main event of PFL Pittsburgh, which takes place March 28 at UPMC Events Center. The full lineup for the event was officially announced Wednesday.\n\nComing off of his first-ever loss after starting 16-0 as a pro, Eblen looks to get back on the championship track (and possibly a rematch with Costello van Steenis, who defends his title against Fabian Edwards on March 20) when he takes on Battle, a promising UFC contender derailed by weight-cutting issues. The bout marks Battle’s league debut.\n\nIn the middleweight co-main event, Dalton Rosta fights 2023 PFL light heavyweight tournament winner Impa Kasanganay.\n\nThe main card also features the PFL debut of Ariane Lipski da Silva. The veteran flyweight went 6-8 in the UFC before signing with PFL this past September. She fights Sumiko Inaba.\n\nMaking his comeback on the preliminaries is two-time PFL lightweight tournament champion Natan Schulte. The Brazilian fighter was suspended indefinitely following a 2023 win over Raush Manfio—a close friend of Schulte’s—when the league ruled that neither competitor fought with the intention to win. Schulte has not fought since that incident.\n\nSee the full PFL Pittsburgh lineup below.\n\nDalton Rosta vs. Impa Kasanganay\n\nAriane Lipski da Silva vs. Sumiko Inaba\n\nPreliminaries (ESPN App, 7 p.m. ET)\n\nBryce Meredith vs. Jack Cartwright\n\nNatan Schulte vs. Jakub Kaszuba\n\nErnesto Rodriguez vs. Masayuki Kikuiri\n\nTatiana Postarnakova vs. Elora Dana\n\nJosh Fremd vs. Jarrah Al Salawi",

    "description": "Seattle brings back a familiar face for Cactus League catching depth",
    "fullText": "The offseason may be officially over, with the first slate of spring training games set to begin in just two days (!), but the Mariners aren’t done making moves, and they’ve brought back an old friend for at least the Cactus League.\n\nThere has been enough ink spilled about how Garver’s previous two years with Seattle didn’t live up to the expectations of his two-year, $24 million contract he was signed to on Christmas Eve 2023. After spending 2025 as Cal Raleigh’s backup, it was an easy call for the M’s to decline their end of his mutual option, despite a couple of fun moments in the postseason. Seattle brought aboard Andrew Knizner and Jhonny Pereda to round out the 40-man roster, and with the former being out of options, the Garv man looks to be on the outside looking in for the backup catcher gig.\n\nThat doesn’t mean he won’t get a good look this spring, though. With Cal Raleigh set to suit up for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic, Seattle will find itself in need of extra backstops for a good chunk of the Cactus League. Garver also has a leg up on the rest of the competition when it comes to familiarity with the Mariners’ pitching staff, with prominent hurlers like Andrés Muñoz and George Kirby previously citing his work with them as reasons for their success. While it’s currently unknown if his minor league deal contains an opt-out clause, it’s not out of the realm of possibility he sticks around with the Rainiers should he not break camp – after all, Tacoma needs catchers, too.\n\nIt’s a mild surprise that Mitch Garver couldn’t find a big league deal elsewhere. Despite his multi-year struggles, he was still a capable option against left-handed pitching, and settled in nicely as the second-string catcher after the plan of deploying him as a primary DH went off the rails. In any case, he’ll be a solid addition to the club’s catching depth for now, and his previous work with Seattle’s pitching corps could stand a decent chance at rubbing off on Knizner and Pereda.",

Hardaway had said last week that both players were suspended indefinitely.\n\nMemphis officials said they will continue to support Abdul Hakim academically as he pursues his degree. Memphis also will provide access to treatment and sports medicine resources as needed.\n\nAbdul Hakim averaged 6.2 points, 4.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 22.3 minutes in 13 games, including 10 starts. He came to Memphis after spending two seasons at UT Rio Grand Valley, where he averaged 13.2 points in 19 games in 2023-24 and 13.3 points in 12 games in 2024-25.\n\nDavis, a South Carolina transfer, has averaged 7.2 points, 4 rebounds and 20.5 minutes in 22 games. He has made eight starts.\n\nMemphis (12-13, 7-5 American Athletic Conference) will try to end a two-game skid Thursday when it visits South Florida (18-8, 10-3).",

With that comes free agency and new deals being handed out left and right.\n\nOne of those names primed to get a nice new deal is quarterback Malik Willis. The signal caller market is very thin, which is a big advantage for Willis.\n\nHe will likely have more than one suitor. Here are three teams to keep an eye on as free agency approaches for Willis and the NFL.\n\nMORE: Colts make surprising QB decision for 2026 season amid Anthony Richardson uncertainty\n\nThe obvious connection here is new head coach Jeff Hafley. The two worked together in Green Bay for two seasons.\n\nIn that time, Hafley likely saw Willis up close as he gave his defense looks in practice. Willis got some clear development in Green Bay—something he saw firsthand.\n\nMORE: Chiefs WR Rashee Rice faces legal trouble as ex-partner files lawsuit\n\nWill Willis take his talents to South Beach? A familiar face makes comfort a little easier and plus no state taxes is a nice deal to have.\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but let’s face the facts. Head coach Kevin Stefanski likely wants his pick at quarterback.\n\nThe thin market makes it tough for him to have that. What a great prospect that Willis just happens to be a local product out of Roswell.\n\nMORE: Dolphins are nearing decision on quarterback Tua Tagovailoa\n\nCould a home reunion in Atlanta be the move for Willis? He’d have a two time NFL coach of the year, plenty of weapons, and a defense that is on the rise–all in his home state of Georgia.\n\nWhich city is the best destination for Malik Willis?\n\nBoth @fieldyates and I liked the same team…. pic.twitter.com/wafqpNfVxQ\n\n— Mina Kimes (@minakimes) February 18, 2026\n\nThe Steelers are in limbo with Aaron Rodgers (again). Will he stay or will he go? They need a plan.\n\nPittsburgh also needs to throw a different dart. The well of older QBs isn’t getting them over the hump. Willis could provide a spark and, in general, something different.\n\nThe Steelers almost drafted him in 2022 as well. Can they bring Willis to Pittsburgh and correct the wrong pick(ett)?

    "fullText": "In the first six years of the hit Netflix dating show \"Love Is Blind,\" dozens of couples formed connections — but not every pair ultimately got married, and even fewer have stayed married.\n\nOnly eight \"Love Is Blind\" couples have gone the distance; of those couples, three have expanded their families in the years since we saw them walk down the aisle and say \"I do.\" Notably, \"Love Is Blind\" season nine, which took place in Denver, ended without a single couple getting married, underscoring just how rare lasting matches from the pods can be.\n\nWith season 10 of \"Love Is Blind\" now streaming on Netflix, there's no better time for a refresher on every couple who's still married — and where they are today.\n\nLibby Torres, Esme Mazzeo, Caralynn Matassa, Ayomikun Adekaiyero, and Palmer Haasch contributed to previous versions of this article. The article was first published in 2023.\n\nCameron and Lauren met and married on season one of \"Love Is Blind\" and are widely considered one of the franchise's biggest success stories. The couple, who share a dog named Mr. Sparx, celebrated their five-year anniversary in November 2023.\n\nThe couple share updates on their life on their YouTube channel, \"Hanging with the Hamiltons\", and co-authored the 2021 book \"Leap of Faith: Finding Love the Modern Way.\"\n\nIn October 2025, they added a new chapter to their story, welcoming their first child, Ezra. This comes after the couple had been open about facing struggles with fertility.\n\n\"To God be the GLORY! 🙌🏾🩵 Our son, Ezra William Hamilton, made his debut October 1st ,a little earlier than planned, but perfectly on God's time. After an unexpected turn with preeclampsia and a few days in the hospital, we've been taking it slow… healing, resting, and soaking up all the love,💛\" Lauren and Cameron said in a post on Instagram.\n\nMatt Barnett and Amber Pike also got married on \"Love Is Blind\" season one. Like Cameron and Lauren, they celebrated their five-year anniversary in November 2023.\n\nIn October 2024, the couple revealed that they were expecting their first child together on the inaugural episode of \"The Love Seat,\" the podcast hosted by their season one costars.\n\nIn April 2025, they welcomed their first child, a daughter.\n\n\"It may be the hormones but @barnettisblind and our baby girl have my heart so full I can hardly function. I hope this feeling never goes away,\" Amber said in a post on Instagram.\n\nBrett Brown and Tiffany Pennywell Brown met during \"Love Is Blind\" season four, which aired in 2023. They married in May 2022.\n\nAppearing on the \"Love Is Blind\" season six reunion episode in March 2024, Tiffany and Brett confirmed they're still happily married.\n\nThey closed on their house in September 2024.\n\nKwame Appiah and Chelsea Griffin Appiah met in the pods during season four and married in May 2022, though Kwame's mother didn't initially approve of the relationship. Despite some friction, they've managed to go the distance.\n\nChelsea and Kwame celebrated a year of marriage in May 2023 by adding to their engagement and wedding jewelry, and Chelsea shared in July 2023 that the couple had honeymooned in Santorini, Greece.\n\nChelsea announced in August 2023 that she was working for Netflix and helping cast people on \"Love Is Blind.\" She and Kwame also appeared at the season six reunion in March 2024, confirming they're still happily married.\n\nZack Goytowski and Bliss Poureetezadi-Goytowski met on \"Love Is Blind\" season four, but they didn't get engaged sight unseen like most couples on the show.\n\nZack chose Irina Solomonova in the pods, got engaged to her, and went on the couple's trip to Mexico with her before they decided they weren't a good match and swiftly broke up.\n\nAfter connecting in the pods, Bliss and Zack met in person when Zack returned from Mexico and had instant, undeniable chemistry. Zack proposed to Bliss while the season was being filmed, and she said yes. \"Love Is Blind\" followed their journey up to their wedding day in May 2022.\n\nLike all of the other season four couples, they had to keep their marriage a secret until April 2023, when the wedding episodes aired.\n\nAfter celebrating a year of marriage in May 2023 and announcing in November that they were expecting their first child together, their daughter, Galileo Terri Rayne, was born on April 26, 2024.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2026, the couple announced on Instagram that they are expecting their second child.\n\n\"We cannot wait to see Galileo become a big sister! Baby #2 coming Summer 2026 ✨,\" Zack and Bliss said in a joint Instagram post.\n\nAmy and Johnny had the most unproblematic romance on \"Love Is Blind\" season six. In the finale, they became the only couple from their season to both say \"I do\" at the altar.\n\nJohnny and Amy confirmed that they were still together at the season six reunion, which aired in March 2024. The reunion even featured a cute montage of their first year of marriage, including goofy moments at home and their trip to Paris.\n\nTaylor and Garrett had the most drama-free romance on \"Love Is Blind\" season seven, despite one disagreement over Garrett acknowledging a text from his ex. They were one of two couples to eventually make it to the altar. They confirmed at the season seven reunion, which aired in October 2024, that they were still married.\n\nDuring the reunion, Taylor and Garrett laughed at speculation that his glow-up — mostly longer, more styled hair — was due to Taylor's influence, though she said that he had driven the transformation.\n\nThey also revealed that they had decided to move to Washington, DC, rather than San Diego, as they had discussed on the show.\n\nDaniel and Taylor had the smoothest journey of any couple in season eight, except for one moment in episode six, where Taylor nearly derailed the relationship because she thought Daniel had stalked her on Instagram (he hadn't).\n\nThey confirmed at the \"Love Is Blind\" reunion, which aired in March 2025, that they're still married and had bought a home outside Minneapolis. Daniel also showed off his tattoo of Taylor's eyes.\n\nThe couple recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary and added a golden retriever named Sunny to their family.\n\nBrennon and Alexa Lemieux met on \"Love Is Blind\" season three and married in 2021.\n\nIn January 2024, they revealed that they were expecting their first child. In an interview with People announcing the news, Alexa said the two had been trying to conceive for more than a year, and she'd undergone fertility treatments that didn't work before unexpectedly conceiving naturally.\n\nAlexa and Brennon revealed on December 3, 2025, that they had decided to part ways. The announcement came a little more than a year after the birth of their daughter, Vienna Ziva Lemieux, in July.\n\n\"This choice was not made lightly, and it comes with a great deal of care, respect, and appreciation for the time we've shared,\" Brennon and Alexa said in a joint statement on Instagram.\n\n\"We entered this relationship with love and optimism, and we leave it with gratitude for the experiences that shaped us and the growth we each gained along the way. While our journey as a married couple is coming to an end, we remain supportive of one another, devoted to our daughter, and committed to navigating this transition with compassion.\"\n\nLike Brennon and Alexa, Matt and Colleen met on season three of \"Love Is Blind\" and married in 2021.\n\nColleen and Matt are quieter than many \"Love Is Blind\" cast members on social media, but they sparked conversation online because of their unconventional living arrangement.\n\nAfter the finale, they were married for about two years and lived separately before announcing they'd finally moved in together in June 2023.\n\nAfter almost four years of marriage, Matt and Colleen said in a May 2025 Instagram statement that they were parting ways.\n\nLydia and Milton met on \"Love Is Blind\" season five and bonded over their shared love of science. Their age gap worried Lydia at first, but they got married at the altar in June 2022. They later had a second wedding in Lydia's native Puerto Rico.\n\nAfter nearly three years of marriage, Lydia and Milton got divorced.\n\nDuring a June 11, 2025, appearance on fellow \"Love Is Blind\" alum Amber Desiree \"AD\" Smith's podcast, \"What's the Reality?\", Lydia opened up about life since her stint on the show.\n\nAshley and Tyler were the second couple to make it to the altar on season seven. Before they married, they had one obstacle to overcome: Tyler told Ashley that he had donated his sperm to a friend and her wife and fathered three children, something that he hadn't disclosed to her in the pods.\n\nWhen the show started airing, however, speculation and claims about Tyler's relationship with the three children circulated online. Despite breakup speculation, Ashley supported Tyler at the season seven reunion in October 2024, where the two reaffirmed their commitment to one another, and she publicly defended him in post-show interviews.\n\nHowever, on January 21, 2025, Ashley announced that she and Tyler had separated several weeks earlier and decided to divorce.\n\n\"While I had hoped for mutual understanding and transparency in our relationship, it has become clear that our paths are no longer aligned, making it impossible for me to continue in this marriage,\" Ashley said in a statement to People, also asking for privacy as she focuses on \"healing and building a new future.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider via Instagram DM, Tyler called the decision to split \"an incredibly difficult and emotional process\" for both of them and added that he takes \"full accountability\" for his role in their relationship difficulties.\n\n\"I respect Ashley's decision to move forward in a way that prioritizes her peace and happiness,\" he said. \"Ashley is an incredible woman, and I have nothing but admiration and gratitude for the love and support she has given me. I ask for kindness and understanding as we both move forward separately, focusing on healing and growth.\"\n\nJarrette and Iyanna's path to the altar on season two of \"Love Is Blind\" was relatively smooth. Though they encountered road bumps due to their differing lifestyles (Jarrette likes to go out, while Iyanna is more of a homebody), the two married and were still married when that season's \"After the Altar\" was filmed.\n\nThe two announced their separation with a now-deleted joint statement on Instagram on August 17, 2022, about a year after their marriage, and finalized their divorce in November of that year. The post-show special, which aired in September, revealed the cracks that had been forming in their marriage prior to the split, including that Iyanna had moved out of their home because of Jarrette's partying.\n\nDespite initially being amicable in their separate announcement, Iyanna later said on a podcast that Jarrette had cheated on her during their marriage, which Jarrette denied.\n\nIyanna hard-launched her new relationship in a 2023 wrap-up post on Instagram and got engaged in December 2024. Jarrette hasn't posted about his relationship status.\n\nDanielle and Nick were another season two couple who didn't make it. The two only had eyes for each other and seemed like a perfect match — which is why fans were shocked when People reported in late August 2022 that Danielle had filed for divorce from Nick earlier that month.\n\nInitially, the split was contentious, but they later reconciled and became friendly, with Danielle even appearing on Nick's podcast in May 2023.\n\nDanielle hard-launched her new relationship on Instagram in July 2024. Nick is also now in a relationship.",

    "description": "Gordon Ramsay and his wife, Tana, have six children together. The chef shares a peek at his family life in his new Netflix show \"Being Gordon Ramsay.\"",
    "fullText": "Gordon Ramsay may be famous for his foul-mouthed persona on TV, but behind the scenes, he's a proud father of six.\n\nThe Michelin-starred chef has been married to cookbook author Cayetana \"Tana\" Ramsay since 1996. Together, they have three sons and three daughters, including Holly Ramsay, who was walked down the aisle by her father at her star-studded wedding to Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty in December. Naturally, Ramsay designed the menu.\n\nRamsay shared a glimpse of his family life in his six-episode Netflix series \"Being Gordon Ramsay,\" which premiered on Wednesday.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the celebrity chef's wife and kids.\n\nCayetana \"Tana\" Elizabeth Hutcheson was in her early 20s — and engaged to someone else — when she met Gordon Ramsay at a New Year's Eve party in London, but she didn't think much of him at first, she told The Guardian in 2008. However, they shared a mutual friend and, after bumping into each other again, started dating.\n\nIn 1996, when Gordon was 29 and Tana was 21, they got married in Chelsea, London.\n\nAfter initially struggling to conceive and going through in vitro fertilization, they welcomed their first child, Megan, in 1998. By 2001, their first four children had been born.\n\nSpeaking to The Herald in 2008, Tana said they were surprised by how quickly their family grew.\n\n\"We knew we wanted a large family,\" she said, \"but for it to happen that close together is amazing. When I discovered I was expecting [our fourth child] Tilly, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God, how am I going to manage?' But you do.\"\n\nTana, who initially trained as a teacher, is also accomplished in the kitchen. She's published several cookbooks, including \"Tana's Kitchen Secrets\" and \"Tana Ramsay's Real Family Food.\"\n\nMegan Ramsay, 27, was the first in her family to graduate from college, her dad shared on Instagram at the time. She earned a degree from Oxford Brookes University in June 2019.\n\n\"So proud of this young Lady,\" he wrote alongside photos of Megan in her cap and gown, adding, \"hard work pays off!\"\n\nWhile she generally avoids the spotlight, Megan did appear on a 2021 episode of \"Hell's Kitchen\" to celebrate her 21st birthday alongside her father.\n\nAnd while she keeps a low profile, that didn't stop Ramsay from publicly disparaging her boyfriend.\n\nDuring a January 2022 appearance on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" Ramsay said Megan's ex-boyfriend, Byron, was \"a bit wet.\"\n\n\"You want a man to date your daughter, and he was just a little bit pathetic,\" he added.\n\nBut the Michelin-starred chef can be a doting dad, too. On Megan's 24th birthday in May 2022, he shared a photograph on Instagram showing the two together.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to this gorgeous lady,\" he captioned the photo. \"Words can't describe enough how proud you make me feel every day.\"\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Holly Anna Ramsay and Jack Scott Ramsay were born. They arrived seven weeks early, according to Hello! magazine.\n\nIn an Instagram post in December 2020, Tana recalled her struggles as a mother to premature twins.\n\n\"Seeing them become little chubby, healthy babies within the first year was a true blessing and I will always be grateful for the determination they showed and their feisty characters,\" she wrote.\n\nToday, the twins have a close relationship, but their professional interests differ.\n\nHolly Ramsay is a mental health advocate, podcast and documentary producer, influencer, and model. She has over 500,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nIn 2021, Holly launched the podcast \"21 & Over\" and opened up about her mental health journey, disclosing that she is a survivor of sexual assault.\n\n\"I went to university, studied fashion design, and I loved it. But by the second half of the first year I was being affected by my PTSD and I had no idea that this was happening,\" she said of the aftermath.\n\nOn December 27, 2025, Holly married Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty. She changed into her mother's 1996 wedding gown for their first dance.\n\nDuring an interview with Vogue, Holly said her father would get emotional every time she talked about the wedding.\n\n\"The other day I was asking him which car he and I would take to the church, and he welled up immediately,\" she recalled.\n\nJack is the athlete of the Ramsay family. According to People, he has played rugby and water polo, and he's studied jiu-jitsu.\n\nIn 2020, Jack joined the Royal Marines. Ramsay publicized his son's accomplishment in an Instagram post at the time.\n\n\"Can't tell you enough how proud I am of this young man Jack Ramsay you've made me feel like the proudest father today congrats on joining @royalmarines what amazing achievement,\" he wrote.\n\nA year prior, Ramsay celebrated his son finishing the famous Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\"Jack Ramsay you are an IronMan 19yrs old what took you so long! Congrats on an amazing achievement,\" the proud dad wrote on Instagram.\n\nIn 2015, Matilda, also known as Tilly, began starring in \"Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch,\" a children's cooking show on the BBC. Tilly later created a corresponding book, \"Matilda & The Ramsay Bunch: Tilly's Kitchen Takeover.\"\n\nBeyond her cooking show, Tilly has made her fair share of TV appearances, including as a contestant on \"Strictly Come Dancing\" and Australia's \"MasterChef.\" In 2024, she graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Nottingham.\n\nTilly frequently shares cooking videos on her TikTok, where she has nearly 10 million followers. She also hosted her own cooking show, \"Dish It Out,\" which premiered on Amazon in 2025.\n\nTana has spoken publicly about the pregnancy loss she experienced in 2016, and she encouraged people to discuss the often taboo topic of miscarriage.\n\n\"I found it really hard when people would talk to me and not mention it because it was like it never happened,\" she told Metro in 2020.\n\nIn an October 2021 Instagram post, Tana wrote about her family's experience.\n\n\"If all had gone as we hoped yesterday 14/10/21 would have been our little boy Rocky's 5th birthday, the day he was due not the day he was actually born when he was too little to survive,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Not a day goes by when we don't think of him,\" she continued, \"but, it wasn't meant to be.\"\n\nSpeaking on her husband's role during the hardship, Tana told Metro, \"Gordon was amazing, and he's always been one to talk about everything, and he was very good at sort of talking it out of me and never making me feel that, 'Oh, you know, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.'\"\n\nIn June 2023, she thanked her entire family in an Instagram post for their support throughout the hardship. \"I couldn't do this without my family, you are all everything to me,\" she wrote.\n\nIn 2018, when they were 18, Holly and Jack ran the London Marathon to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital and in memory of Rocky, Hello! reported.\n\nOscar James Ramsay was born in April 2019. In 2023, Tana shared photos of her son on Instagram for his 4th birthday, writing, \"4 already — wow where has that gone!! 4 years of loving you you crazy clever little boy - love you endlessly.\"\n\nHis sisters, Tilly and Holly, manage the toddler's Instagram account.\n\nA post shared by Oscar Ramsay (@oscarjramsay)\n\nRamsay once told Jimmy Fallon during a January 2021 interview that Oscar was his \"last hope\" of getting any of his children into the cooking industry.\n\nRamsay announced the birth via Instagram on November 11, 2023, by sharing a post showing his wife in the delivery room with their newborn son, Jesse James Ramsay.\n\nIn the caption, Ramsay confirmed that Jesse James would be their last child, writing: \"3 boys, 3 girls.... Done.\"\n\nRamsay had told the Daily Mail in 2021 that he and Tana were contemplating having one more child.\n\n\"I said it was a great idea. She said: 'Well, let's start planning.' So I'm like: 'Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I'm going to be the oldest dad at school, what's going to happen on sports day?'\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"But it's something we'd still consider, because it's been such a joy spending time with Oscar,\" he added.",

    "description": "I've followed the Mediterranean diet for more than five years, and I meal prep to save time and money. Here are my favorite meals to make ahead.",
    "fullText": "I have followed the Mediterranean diet for more than five years.\n\nIt's long been considered the healthiest diet, and this way of eating emphasizes the consumption of unprocessed foods and healthy fats.\n\nCommon ingredients people on the diet eat include vegetables, seafood, whole grains, and beans. While following it, I like to cook meals in advance in larger batches so I can enjoy them throughout the week or freeze them to eat at a later date.\n\nSome of my go-to Mediterranean-diet recipes stray slightly from more typical ones I've seen, but I try to stick with the core principles of this style of eating while keeping things interesting.\n\nHere are some of my favorite meals to make in advance and how I usually prepare them.\n\nChicken meatballs are versatile and can be easily incorporated into pasta dishes, salads, wraps, and sandwiches. Plus, they freeze well.\n\nTo make them, I usually combine ground chicken, chopped red onion, egg, breadcrumbs, and olive oil. Then, I mix in oregano, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper and form my meatballs.\n\nI pop them in the air fryer or oven until brown, let them cool, then freeze them in individual portions for later.\n\nStuffed peppers are easy to customize with different types of meat, rice, cheese, and vegetables.\n\nTo start, I cut each bell pepper in half and remove the seeds. I drizzle the peppers in olive oil and bake them for a bit while I cook my preferred filling on my stovetop.\n\nI often stuff peppers with a mix of cooked ground turkey (be sure to drain any excess juice), diced onions, canned diced tomatoes, garlic, tomato puree, chicken stock, and herbs.\n\nOnce I bake and cool the peppers, I freeze them. When I defrost them, I add grated cheese and heat them in the oven until they're hot and the cheese is golden.\n\nSometimes I spend a free afternoon cooking a large batch of beef stew I can fill my freezer with.\n\nTo make it, I brown ground beef in olive oil on my stove and set it aside on a plate. Then, I add diced onion, rosemary, and garlic to the pan I was using. I cook them for a few minutes and then add red wine.\n\nI then pour in beef stock, canned chopped tomatoes, and jarred grilled peppers. I add the beef back in and cook my stew in the oven for two hours.\n\nThen, I stir in canned butterbeans and olives and cook for another 30 minutes. I make a slurry with cornstarch and cold water and stir it into my stew to help it thicken. I let it simmer until I like the consistency.\n\nOnce it cools, I freeze individual serving sizes that I can thaw whenever I want them.\n\nHomemade fishcakes are a great way to incorporate seafood into your diet without spending a fortune at the fishmonger.\n\nTo make them, I fry chopped leeks on the stove and set them aside in a bowl. Then, I grind up a few tilapia filets in a food processor and add them to the leeks, along with an egg, breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley, lemon juice, and cumin.\n\nI form my mixture into small cakes, then fry them in a pan for five minutes on each side until golden brown.\n\nI freeze the cakes individually and usually serve them with garlic mayo and salsa.\n\nA one-pan chicken traybake is perfect to throw in the oven on a busy weeknight, particularly if you also need lunch prepped for the next day.\n\nFor mine, I chop potatoes, onions, and lemons into medium-sized chunks and toss them in a pan with olive oil, capers, jarred peppers, sundried tomatoes, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper.\n\nI start roasting them in the oven while I season chicken thighs with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n\nI fry the thighs skin-side down on the stove until the skin turns brown, then add them to the tray of things I began roasting. I cover the whole thing in foil for a bit, then keep baking and tossing everything around until my potatoes are crispy.\n\nOnce finished, I serve myself a portion and keep the rest for lunch the next day. It's very tasty leftover.\n\nNothing says batch cooking like a cozy soup.\n\nDrizzle diced carrots, onion, celery, and leeks with olive oil and cook in a large pan on the stove. Season with turmeric, harissa, and red-pepper flakes before adding chopped tomatoes, fresh cilantro, vegetable stock, and water.\n\nLeave to simmer uncovered for at least 30 minutes, then add cans of green lentils and chickpeas. Simmer for another half an hour.\n\nWhisk a couple of eggs, a tablespoon of flour, and lemon juice into a couple of cups of water, then add that mixture to the soup.\n\nLet it simmer for a few more minutes before pouring yourself a serving and freezing the rest.",

    "title": "The US Navy is pulling more and more warships into its Middle East force buildup",
    "description": "The Pentagon has dramatically reduced the number of ships it had in the Caribbean ahead of the Maduro raid, moving vessels toward the Middle East.",
    "fullText": "The US military added another warship to its large Middle East buildup in recent days, and a second carrier strike group is on its way, bringing additional fighter jets and missiles toward the region.\n\nThe large-scale deployment of American forces to the Middle East has escalated significantly this month as the Trump administration pressures Iran to strike a deal that would limit its nuclear and military capabilities.\n\nAs the US Navy's Middle East force presence has grown, its footprint in the Caribbean Sea — once the site of a substantial show of force ahead of US military action against Venezuela and its former president Nicolás Maduro — has shrunk dramatically.\n\nThere are 10 warships and an aircraft carrier positioned in the Central Command area of responsibility, the Middle East, and two more vessels situated on the outskirts of the region, according to a defense official.\n\nMuch of the US naval force in the Middle East was operating in the Arabian Sea as of Tuesday. That includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group — the guided-missile destroyers USS Spruance, USS Frank E. Petersen Jr., and USS Michael Murphy.\n\nThe Lincoln has dozens of embarked aircraft, including fighters, electronic attack jets, and early warning planes. The destroyers escorting the carrier are equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. Among its air wing are F-35 stealth fighters.\n\nThree additional destroyers — USS Mitscher, USS McFaul, and USS Pinckney — are also in the Arabian Sea. Pinckney arrived in the region in the past couple of days, the defense official said.\n\nAnother destroyer, USS Delbert D. Black, is in the Red Sea. And three littoral combat ships — USS Santa Barbara, USS Tulsa, and USS Canberra — are in the Arabian Gulf. These warships are designed for near-shore operations.\n\nUSS Roosevelt and USS Bulkeley, two destroyers capable of ballistic missile defense, are operating in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, which is part of US Naval Forces Europe and Africa's area of responsibility.\n\nThe defense official said the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group — destroyers USS Mahan, USS Winston S. Churchill, and USS Bainbridge — are also operating under that command, which covers the eastern half of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Ford carrier strike group had been operating in the Caribbean for months. However, earlier this month, it was reported that the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier was being sent to the Middle East.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the aircraft carrier was operating off the coast of Morocco near the Strait of Gibraltar, ship-tracking data shows.\n\nTwo additional destroyers — USS Thomas Hudner and USS Stockdale — that were previously in the Caribbean are now in the US Naval Forces Europe and Africa area of responsibility as well.\n\nThe departure of Ford and the five destroyers has diminished the Navy's presence in the Caribbean, which falls under the Southern Command area of responsibility.\n\nThe US armed forces initially positioned a large number of warships in the waters near Venezuela last year as part of President Donald Trump's effort to pressure Maduro. A few weeks after his capture, a dozen vessels were still present in the region.\n\nNow, only five remain, the defense official said. Those include the cruiser USS Lake Erie, the destroyer USS Truxtun, the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima, and the amphibious transport dock ships USS Fort Lauderdale and USS San Antonio.\n\nThe US and Iran held indirect talks earlier in the week, and officials hinted that additional dialogue could be on the horizon.\n\nHowever, US military assets — including aircraft such as fighter jets and refueling tankers — are still moving into and toward the Middle East, giving Trump plenty of options to strike Iran for a second time, which he has threatened. The US military bombed Iran's nuclear sites last year as part of Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nIran, meanwhile, conducted military exercises in the strategic Strait of Hormuz this week, and Tehran's leadership warned the US warships deployed to the region that it is capable of sinking them in the event of a fight.",

    "fullText": "At the World Liberty Forum at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, David Solomon revealed that he holds some bitcoin among his personal investments.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs CEO hasn't always spoken positively about the apex crypto token. In 2024, he said he believed bitcoin is a speculative asset without a real use case. More recently, he downplayed the potential threat that some think it poses to the US dollar, making it clear that he wasn't concerned.\n\nSolomon didn't reveal exactly how much he has invested in bitcoin or how long he has held it for, only that he holds a \"very, very limited\" amount. He added that he doesn't see himself as a forecaster but rather as an observer of crypto, implying that he believes it is important to understand it as the technology continues to intersect with finance.\n\nGoldman has warmed to cyrpto more recently. Solomon previously stated that the bank has a team assessing how to implement stablecoins. Yet, it hasn't embraced crypto as much as peers like JPMorgan, which has debuted tokenized offerings for clients and issued its own JPM Coin.\n\nIn his address at the World Liberty Forum, Solomon also discussed regulation, noting that he sees the regulatory approach of the last few years as burdensome.\n\n\"When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,\" he said. \"That absolutely happened in the last five years.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has prioritized easing regulations on the crypto industry, which initially spurred growth for bitcoin and other digital assets. However, the top crypto has been in a rut since hitting an all-time high last October, with prices down nearly 50% since then.\n\nBitcoin was down on Wednesday, struggling to gain momentum after its latest streak of declines. The token was trading at $66,500, down about 1%.",

    "fullText": "A company can use AI to code faster than ever — but that won't matter if the idea itself is lousy.\n\nThat's just one point from a scathing critique of the current state of AI in the workplace from veteran software engineer Dax Raad, whose blunt assessment is resonating with many workers online.\n\nRaad, the developer behind OpenAuth, said the bottleneck facing companies isn't coding productivity — it's a lack of good ideas, unmotivated employees, corporate bureaucracy, and \"the dozen other realities of shipping something real.\"\n\nBefore AI, companies were reined in by development costs, he argued in a February 14 post on X that has since gone viral on Reddit as well. While it's easier than ever to produce code, that doesn't mean the original idea was worthwhile — or that employees will produce more instead of simply using AI to work \"with less energy spend.\"\n\n\"your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping,\" Raad wrote.\n\neveryone's talking about their teams like they were at the peak of efficiency and bottlenecked by ability to produce code\n\nhere's what things actually look like\n\n- your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping\n\n- majority of workers have…\n\nRaad described a search for meaning among employees faced with potential productivity gains from AI, arguing that the \"majority of workers have no reason to be super motivated, they want to do their 9-5 and get back to their life.\"\n\nPart of the issue, he wrote, is that some workers may simply use AI to coast. \"they're using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend,\" he said. That can actually make work harder for those who are giving it their all, he wrote.\n\n\"the 2 people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon,\" Raad wrote.\n\nThere are also very real monetary costs to outfitting a company's engineers with AI coding tools and the tokens required to power new AI features.\n\n\"your CFO is like what do you mean each engineer now costs $2000 extra per month in LLM bills?\" he wrote.\n\nRaad, who also created OpenCode, an open-sourced AI coding tool, said that people shouldn't mistake his criticism of AI.\n\n\"so many people don't understand how I can be critical of AI while also building an AI tool,\" he wrote in a different post on X.\n\nThe OpenCode developer has begun to develop a reputation for expressing skepticism about AI's progress, or at least the hype around it. In a recent \"contrarian talk,\" Raad said that his job is just as hard as it was before AI.\n\n\"I'm tired of people feeling like suddenly the tables are going to turn and things are going to be easier,\" he said during a talk with the AI Engineer podcast. \"They're not easier. My life is just as hard as it's ever been. It's just as hard as it's ever been to do something amazing. But it's also where all the fun comes from, where all the purpose comes from.\"\n\nRaad's views have resonated within the development community. His post on X has been viewed roughly 793,000 times, and a user who shared Raad's thoughts on Reddit has received over 22,000 upvotes. On Medium, JP Capras, a fellow engineer, praised Raad's \"honest take.\"\n\n\"Omg, you guys are making me feel much less alone now :D,\" a Reddit user replied, adding that requests from their management have \"destroyed\" their development process.\n\n\"It's funny how accurate this is to my current situation,\" reads the top-voted comment on the viral Reddit post.\n\nSome companies have said AI has allowed them to do more, faster — and others have talked about the potential to \"fail fast\" and iterate. Okta, Salesforce, Snowflake, and Blackstone have all leaned heavily into utilizing AI.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, previously told Business Insider.\n\nRaad's perspective comes amid a broader concern about \"AI fatigue.\"\n\nSiddhant Khare, who builds AI tools, recently wrote an essay about what he described as how \"the tool that was supposed to save you time has consumed your entire day.\" In short, it's the view that whatever AI may increase in productivity, it comes at the cost of a burned-out workforce.\n\nSteve Yegge, an Amazon and Google vet, recently said companies should consider a three-hour cap on AI-assisted work or risk their workforces crumbling.\n\n\"I seriously think founders and company leaders and engineering leaders at all levels, all the way down to line managers, have to be aware of this and realize that you might only get three productive hours out of a person who's vibe coding at max speed,\" Yegge told \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" newsletter.\n\nRaad's larger point is that AI isn't a magic wand that companies can wave and expect to suddenly find success — and that real pain points remain.\n\n\"even when you produce work faster you're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Kevin Hassett said Fed researchers should be disciplined for their views on tariffs, sparking fresh concern from commentators about Fed independence.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump's economic advisor said that Federal Reserve writers behind a report claiming that Americans bear the brunt of tariffs should be \"disciplined.\"\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, criticized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's economic analysis of the impact of tariffs published last week, calling for the authors to be punished for their findings.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment. It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined because what they've done is put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first semester econ class,\" Hassett told CNBC.\n\nThe economists found that 90% of the economic burden of higher tariffs fell on US firms and consumers. The average tariff rate climbed to 13% from 2.6% in 2025 as part of Trump's sweeping trade policy unveiled last April.\n\n\"While importers pay the duty, the 'economic burden' of the tariff can be shifted onto exporters if they lower their export prices,\" the report reads. \"There is 100 percent pass-through from tariffs to import prices, and therefore on U.S. consumers and firms,\" the economists explained in the write.\n\nHassett defended the tariffs in his comments to CNBC.\n\n\"The basic theory of President Trump's tariffs is that, sure we're importing stuff from China, but we've got producers in the US that make the same stuff, maybe at a slightly higher price. If we bring the stuff home, create the demand at home, then that will hurt China and drive up wages in the US and American consumers be better off.\"\n\nHassett's remarks come as Fed independence is in focus. The Trump administration is in the midst of criminal investigations into Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed governor Lisa Cook.\n\nClaudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is known for creating the Sahm rule, a popular recession indicator, said the comments, specifically Hassett calling for the paper's authors to be disciplined, are \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nShe added that Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair, \"must\" be asked about Hassett's comments at his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"The Fed Chair has the ability to suppress research from the Fed. Will he if it disagrees with White House?\" Sahm wrote.\n\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider that Hassett's comments are \"distressing.\"\n\n\"At best it's an angry outburst instead of a reasoned response, and at worst it is meant to chill speech and curb central bank independence,\" he added.",

    "description": "The new Netflix doc \"Being Gordon Ramsay\" offers a glimpse into the life of the iconic chef and TV personality and his most ambitious project.",
    "fullText": "The iconic chef might have been known by a completely different moniker — one that, it seems, he would have preferred.\n\n\"Scott's a lot better than fucking Gordon,\" Ramsay quips to his wife Tana.\n\nRamsay elaborated in a recent interview with BBC Radio 2, revealing he was named Gordon after his father.\n\n\"They christened me and mum said, 'We're going to name you after your father,'\" Ramsay said, noting that doctors originally believed he wasn't going to live for longer than two hours.\n\n\"Scott's a cool name,\" he added. \"I would've preferred to be called Scott.\"\n\nRamsay said his father believed that cooking wasn't a job for real men. He never ate at one of his son's restaurants before he died at the age of 53 from a heart attack.\n\n\"Deep down inside, I would love for my dad to have tasted something and even said, 'Yeah, good job,''' Ramsay said. \"I would've loved him to have understood, even though he didn't back what I was doing or believed in where it was going. You want validation from your parents.\"\n\nBoth Ramsay and Tana were in relationships when they first met while attending a mutual friend's wedding.\n\n\"I was looking at my mate thinking, 'Oh my god, your girlfriend is fucking gorgeous,'\" Ramsay recalled. \"She looked like a young Julia Roberts.\"\n\nTana, who was 18 when she met Ramsay, said it wasn't love at first sight with her future husband.\n\n\"I thought he was really arrogant, really full of himself; he used to really irritate me,\" she said. \"It took about a month, and then we were both single.\"\n\n\"I honestly thought for many months that Tana was out of my league,\" Ramsay added. \"I won her over with food.\"\n\nRamsay said he was \"transformed\" by the legendary chef, who became the first Brit to ever win three Michelin stars.\n\n\"He was like a father figure,\" Ramsay said. \"He had the gift of this Picasso; he put food on the plate like no other.\"\n\nRamsay said he was White's \"right-hand man\" at The Restaurant Marco Pierre White, working 18-hour days six days a week during his early 20s.\n\n\"I became very good very quickly,\" Ramsay added. \"He brought the natural talent out of me.\"\n\nRamsay said that The Restaurant Gordon Ramsay \"started with nothing.\" Since he couldn't buy expensive cuts of meat, he sold oxtail instead.\n\n\"But I still won two Michelin stars with oxtail,\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"When you get that third star, everyone says it's a sigh of relief, but it's not a sigh of relief,\" Ramsay said. \"It's fucking magical.\"\n\nThe Restaurant Gordon Ramsay remains open today and still has three Michelin stars to its name. During the docuseries, Ramsay hit back at critics who claim he cares more about being a \"TV chef\" than his actual restaurants.\n\n\"I didn't sacrifice the restaurants for TV, and I haven't used the TV to fake what's going on in the restaurants,\" he said. \"They go hand in glove.\"\n\nWhen Ramsay hosted a preview event for Bishopsgate, he opted to invite influencers to see the space instead of food critics.\n\n\"Ten years ago, we were depending on their pens,\" he said about critics. \"Ten years ago, we were depending on their insults. Ten years ago, we were depending on their egos, and they destroyed restaurants.\"\n\nRamsay noted how critics would often get personal throughout his career. He recalled one writer who called him a \"failed footballer that had a shotgun wedding.\"\n\n\"How does that relate to food?\" Ramsay asked. \"How do you write about a restaurant experience with that headline?\"\n\nNow, Ramsay believes that influencers are \"the most powerful critics on the planet.\"\n\n\"Being Gordon Ramsay\" also briefly follows Tilly's journey as she attends the Ballymaloe Cookery School in Ireland.\n\nTilly said she began cooking when she was very young, wanting to be \"part of everything\" that her father did.\n\n\"Cooking is definitely something that has brought us together,\" she said.\n\nDuring the docuseries, Ramsay goes with Tilly for the fitting of her first chef whites and visits her at the cooking school. Tilly hopes to someday open her own restaurant, just like her father.\n\nRamsay believes he could have \"been there a bit more\" for his four oldest children, who are now all in their 20s. So he's planning to do things a bit differently for his 6-year-old son Oscar and 2-year-old son Jesse James.\n\n\"I'll make more time for them because I never want them to say, 'You weren't there my first day at school. You missed my play. You missed my football match,'\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"But I'm shit at Nativity plays, I'm shit at Christmas carols, I'm shit at sports days because I want to compete and beat all the dads,\" he added. \"So maybe it's a good thing I didn't do all those.\"\n\n22 Bishopsgate will feature the restaurants Lucky Cat, Lucky Cat Terrace, Bread Street Kitchen, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High, and the culinary school Gordon Ramsay Academy.\n\nLucky Cat is a 250-seat Asian-inspired restaurant, while Lucky Cat Terrace has 60 seats in a rooftop garden with a retractable roof. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High is a 12-seat fine-dining restaurant, and Bread Street Kitchen will be an all-day brasserie.\n\nRamsay said he wants to make sure 22 Bishopsgate has \"some of the best restaurants in the world.\"\n\n\"It's sort of one of my final stakes in the ground, something I'm going to be best remembered for,\" he added.\n\nRamsay, who has a 20-year lease on the building, called it one of the \"most fraught projects I've ever done.\"\n\n\"The pressure with this project is that if it doesn't go to plan, it's my neck on the line, and I have to guarantee that every penny that we're borrowing, if it doesn't work, I have to pay that back personally,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to create something incredibly special to keep alive for 20 years, without a doubt.\"",

    "description": "After years of inconsistent routines, a dad explains how committing to just 20 minutes of daily exercise helped him build lasting fitness habits.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Skye Mackintosh, a 29-year-old regional sales manager and father of two, based in Utah. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn October 15th, 2024, I saw a picture of myself sitting by the pool and didn't recognize myself. It was the biggest I'd ever been, and I felt like it wasn't really me.\n\nI decided to go a year without added sugar, and I lost some weight. If anything had even one gram of added sugar, I didn't eat it for a full year.\n\nAlthough I've never been particularly sedentary — I grew up hunting and fishing on my family farm, played basketball once a week or so, and used to run a lot — I had a hard time working out consistently. If I had days I didn't want to exercise, I just didn't. I've completed 75 hard a couple of times, and I even ran a 50k ultramarathon with six weeks of training, but I always just went back to how I was.\n\nSo, I wanted to find a way of working out that I would actually do forever.\n\nI decided to start posting evidence of my daily 20-minute workouts. I knew that if I put my fitness journey online, I wouldn't be able to face the embarrassment of not following through on my word.\n\nI chose 20 minutes because 30 isn't always achievable, and 10 didn't seem to be enough. My wife and I are going to have more kids, and then I'll have grandkids, and who knows where my career will take me. But regardless of what's going on, I figure I'll always have 20 minutes.\n\nI chose push-ups and jump squats to start with because I wanted to hit the core muscle groups while keeping it simple enough to do anywhere.\n\nAs my account grew, I started getting advice from people in my comments. They told me that I would mess up my posture or injure myself if I didn't work different parts of my body, so around day 35, I added one back exercise and one core exercise.\n\nI felt like I was plateauing with a full-body workout every day, so now I do upper body 3 days a week and lower body and core 2 days a week. On Wednesdays, I either play basketball or do some stretching, and Sundays are full rest days.\n\nAs I have gotten stronger, I've added more reps in those 20 minutes and some equipment, so it isn't too monotonous. Nothing crazy — just a kettlebell and pull-up bar, and some free equipment I have gotten from brands as my account got more popular.\n\nI always do movements that anyone can do with bodyweight or really simple, cheap equipment. For example, I really like lunges with a kettlebell or ab rollouts.\n\nA few commenters have said that my routine is getting too complicated and intimidating, and I get it; it would have been overwhelming if I had tried to jump straight into what I was doing on day 143 on day one. My whole point is to start where you are — don't compare my day 143 with your day one.\n\nI don't want to overcomplicate my diet, either, so I just try to eat as many whole foods as I can and hit my goal of 185 grams of protein a day.\n\nGetting jacked wasn't my main goal. It's not about seeing the abs or the muscles in the mirror, but what that signifies — that I'm dedicated and I can do hard things to become the man I want to be.\n\nIt helps that somewhere between day 30 and day 40, I realised I was finding working out fun, too. I was travelling, but it didn't feel like a pain to figure out how to fit in my workout. Instead, I was excited to do it.\n\nI've also gotten a lot stronger and improved my form. On day 100, I recreated the workout I did on day one, and what took me about 15 minutes at the start only took me five minutes. And while I could only do two pull-ups at the start, I can now do 15 with a 10-lb weighted vest.\n\nI sleep more deeply, too, and dream so much more. I also dream more when I'm awake — I have more confidence and self-respect, and feel able to take on more ambitious goals.\n\nI want others to feel the way I'm feeling, so inspiring people through my Instagram page has been so special. People have been messaging me to say they've worked out for the first time in years, or they are on day 50 of their own journeys.\n\nMy main advice is just to start and keep it simple. I wanted to test whether even something small, stacked over time, is better than great spurts of effort, and I've found that it is — it's all about consistency.\n\nIf 20 minutes seems overwhelming, start with 10, or even five. You don't need to put pressure on yourself to work out for 100 days in a row; you just need to do it today.",

    "description": "Military students face uncertainty as the Pentagon evaluates universities beyond Harvard, potentially affecting top-leveleducation plans.",
    "fullText": "University officials and military students say they were blindsided by a Pentagon decision to not only sever ties with Harvard University, but also put dozens of other colleges under review.\n\nTroops pursuing military legal and specialist careers are barred from attending Harvard through certain Defense Department-funded programs, officials say, and recent internal messaging has raised the prospect that other long-standing education partnerships could be affected as well.\n\nAfter an internal list of schools under review leaked online last week, Business Insider reached out to each institution for their reaction to the news.\n\nA spokesperson for The George Washington University said the school had not \"received any direct notification or communication\" from the Department of Defense. Northeastern University said the same, sharing that while it was aware of press reports on the matter, it was still working to establish facts.\n\n\"I'm a little bit flabbergasted,\" said a professor at one listed school. \"This is very strange.\" Another questioned what the long-term effects of this decision might be. It's a question military students are asking as well.\n\n\"We've had no clarification as to what's going on,\" shared a prospective lawyer currently on active duty and enrolled at one of the listed schools. Like the professors, they spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.\n\nLast Friday, screenshots of internal US Army emails began circulating online. The emails, which CNN first reported and Business Insider verified, identified Harvard University as \"fully off limits\" for service members seeking US military tuition assistance while marking 33 other schools as moderate or high risk. Self-paying students were also encouraged to apply elsewhere.\n\nOne email said that prospective students who had applied to or had been accepted to schools like American University, Stanford University, or Georgetown University, among others, \"should have a backup plan\" in case the Pentagon gives those schools the same treatment as Harvard.\n\nArmy spokesperson Cynthia Smith said in a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday that only US military ties to Harvard are being halted. Other university programs are under review, she said, but \"no further decisions have been made at this time.\"\n\nA separate defense official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive issues also told Business Insider that the list is still \"up in the air.\"\n\nSuch considerations signal a potentially significant shift in how the US military interacts with civilian universities — institutions that have long played a central role in educating military lawyers, specialists, and leaders rising to higher ranks — and raise questions about whether political factors are shaping where troops are permitted to study.\n\nThe Department of Defense declined to provide any further clarity and referred Business Insider to a social media post by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth earlier this month that said the Pentagon intends to sever ties with Harvard for all professional military education programs and fellowships.\n\nHegseth, who received a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School, said Harvard is \"one of the red-hot centers of Hate America activism,\" adding that \"too many faculty members openly loathe our military; they cast our armed forces in a negative light and squelch anyone who challenges their leftist political leanings.\" Harvard hasn't publicly responded.\n\nThe internal Army emails that leaked online were focused on soldiers applying to the Army's legal education program, a pathway to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG), the military's legal branch. Graduate degrees at civilian universities, however, are not limited to prospective JAGs and also include competitive programs for degrees relevant to other military jobs.\n\nThe potential blacklisting of universities beyond Harvard has prompted concerns among current and prospective students that coveted spots at their chosen schools may be eliminated.\n\nThe active-duty service member preparing for a military legal career at a top law school told Business Insider that they worry that even if they graduate, a degree from a blacklisted university might be viewed unfavorably when future promotion opportunities arise.\n\nAnother service member who is set to start school at a top institution in the fall — and is preparing to relocate their family — said they have not received information about how their studies may be affected; however, they fear that if they are barred from attending their chosen university, they might not have time to apply to another school.\n\n\"It's a thing you earn on merit that I would hate to have taken away,\" they said of their acceptance at a top institution.\n\nUS military officer culture has long prized continued study, particularly for those advancing to senior ranks who are expected to understand the global and strategic implications of American power beyond the boots-on-the-ground level. Civilian graduate programs have historically helped the military build legal, policy, and strategic expertise at senior levels.\n\nEducational priorities are shifting in the Pentagon under the current administration, which has labeled Ivy League schools and other universities as \"woke\" for some of their policies and programs. In some cases, the admin has also threatened federal funding freezes on several schools, including some on the Army list.\n\n\"This is such a slippery slope,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School and a retired Air Force JAG. She expressed alarm at the prospect of certain schools being off-limits for troops without transparency about the exact criteria the Pentagon is using to judge them.\n\n\"Everyone is just kind of scratching their heads,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "As Mark Zuckerberg was ushered into the Los Angeles Superior Court early on Wednesday morning, one accessory in his entourage stood out: Meta Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nZuckerberg, wearing a navy blue suit and tie, arrived without any glasses. Flanking either side of him as he walked up to the courthouse were longtime executive assistant Andrea Besmehn and an unidentified man donning Meta's Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nMeta declined to comment about the accessory choice.\n\nAI-powered smart glasses weren't just a hot accessory in the California sun. They were a hot topic inside the courtroom.\n\nThe judge presiding over the trial announced that anyone using glasses to record inside the courtroom would be \"held in contempt of the court,\" according to CNBC.\n\nThis isn't the first trial where Meta's glasses have caused issues.\n\nLast year, while Meta battled the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust allegations, New York Times reporter Mike Isaac posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he had been reprimanded by the court for wearing Meta Ray-Bans.\n\ndo not wear camera glasses in federal buildings folks 😞\n\nThe glasses cameo came as Zuckerberg took the stand in a Los Angeles trial accusing major social media companies of building addictive products that harm young users. The case centers on a now-20-year-old plaintiff, identified in court filings as \"KGM,\" who alleged that Instagram and YouTube worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts after she started using the apps as a child. TikTok and Snap have already settled, leaving Meta and Google's YouTube as the remaining defendants in the trial, which could shape similar lawsuits nationwide.\n\nThe trial underway in Los Angeles is focused on design features that plaintiffs say keep teens scrolling. Zuckerberg's testimony follows an earlier appearance from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri.\n\nMeta's Ray Ban smart glasses have become a surprise hit. On the company's earnings call last month, Zuckerberg said that sales of the glasses more than tripled in 2025, and compared the moment to the shift from flip phones to smartphones.\n\nMeta has increasingly positioned the glasses as a vehicle for its AI ambitions. In addition to taking pictures and playing music, users can ask questions to Meta AI, Meta's AI assistant, about anything that they're looking at through the glasses.\n\nLast week, the New York Times reported that Meta is planning to add facial recognition technology to the glasses.",

    "title": "Palantir's Florida move is more than just a change of address",
    "description": "Even if a company doesn't cite a reason for relocating, experts say the change can signal financial, political, or other motives.",
    "fullText": "When a company moves its headquarters, it's making a statement — whether leadership spells it out or not.\n\nThat's the case with Palantir's surprise announcement Tuesday that it has relocated its home base to Florida from Colorado.\n\nThe defense-tech contractor disclosed the change in a one-sentence press release citing a new address just outside Miami. Palantir, led by cofounder and CEO Alex Karp, didn't provide a reason or say what it means for employees.\n\nThe lack of details has left many observers speculating on the motive.\n\n\"This seems like a pretty obvious attempt to put both Karp and Palantir in friendlier territory,\" said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\nThough Karp backed Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign, he has more recently praised the Trump administration's immigration and national security policies.\n\nOn a November earnings call, Karp called for tougher border policies and highlighted Palantir's work with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Israel. Palantir, which relies heavily on government contracts, has also faced protests in Colorado in recent years. Colorado is a blue state, Florida is red.\n\n\"Not only will the company receive a more welcoming reception and more eager labor pool in Florida, but Karp and his top deputies will probably be more comfortable spending time there than they do in Colorado,\" said Pozner.\n\nPalantir didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the reason for the headquarters shake-up or the move's impact on employees.\n\nPalantir was founded in California's Silicon Valley region in 2003 and moved to Colorado in 2020. At the time, Karp cited an \"increasing intolerance and monoculture\" in Silicon Valley. Karp owns property in Colorado.\n\nSome leadership experts point to Florida's more tax-friendly policies as a reason why Palantir has a new ZIP code.\n\n\"To me, this is dollars and cents,\" said Zack Kass, a former OpenAI executive who now advises companies and governments on leading in today's AI-centric business world. \"If building a better company meant Karp moving the business to Alaska, he'd probably do it.\"\n\nA number of finance and tech heavyweights have planted flags in Florida in recent years, including Citadel, Thiel Capital, and Thoma Bravo. In January, venture capitalist David Sacks proclaimed that Miami will soon replace New York City as America's financial capital.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the leadership of the state of Florida,\" said Citadel's Ken Griffin at the America Business Forum in Miami in November. \"This is a great place to call home.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees, though, as others have noted that Miami's social scene hollows out in the summer and the city lacks a major university to pipe in tech talent.\n\nWhatever the incentives are behind Palantir's change of address, headquarters moves in general are rarely about real estate, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management professor at Bentley University. Instead, they often speak to the kind of identity leaders want for their companies.\n\n\"In a world where so much work is hybrid or distributed, the HQ is often more symbolic than operational,\" he said. \"Geography communicates. It says something about who you want to attract, who you align with, and what kind of company you believe you are.\"\n\nLeBlanc pointed Elon Musk's decision to move some of his companies' headquarters from California to Texas for political reasons as an example. In 2024, the billionaire lashed out at California for being the first state to outlaw schools from having to notify parents if a child changes their name, pronouns, or gender identity at school, calling the move the \"final straw.\"\n\n\"Particularly in founder-led companies, those moves often reflect worldview as much as strategy,\" LeBlanc said. \"Geography has become part of executive messaging.\"",

    "title": "FCC Chair Brendan Carr calls Stephen Colbert's censorship concerns 'fake news'",
    "description": "FCC Chair Brendan Carr addressed Stephen Colbert's claims that CBS pulled a Democratic lawmaker's interview over federal regulatory concerns.",
    "fullText": "Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said it's \"fake news\" to suggest that the government pressured CBS to pull a Democratic lawmaker's interview from Stephen Colbert's \"The Late Show\" earlier this week.\n\nCarr addressed the latest flash point moment between broadcasters and the FCC in his Wednesday remarks during the commission's February open meeting, saying there was \"no censorship by the government here.\"\n\nSpeaking to Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Wednesday evening, Carr doubled down, describing the incident as \"Democrat on Democrat violence,\" rather than evidence that the commission had pressured CBS not to air the interview.\n\nInstead, Carr said, CBS's advice to \"The Late Show\" not to air an interview with James Talarico, a Democratic Texas state representative running for a hotly contested US Senate seat, was an appropriate response to prevent the commission from enforcing its equal time rule.\n\nThe equal time rule requires TV and radio broadcast stations to provide equivalent airtime opportunities to legally qualified political candidates, or risk fines or, potentially, the revocation of their broadcast license. The rule does not apply to bona fide newscasts, interviews, or on-the-spot news.\n\nThe rule has rarely been applied in recent decades. Broadcasters had generally understood a 2006 FCC ruling to mean that interviews on daytime and late-night talk shows were exempt from the rule. However, the FCC said in revised guidance sent to stations last month that \"This is not the case.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Colbert and other establishment Democrats want to put the thumb on the scale in this Democrat primary for one candidate over the other,\" Carr told Ingraham. \"I don't know, you'll have to ask them, but we're going to enforce the law and hold broadcasters accountable.\"\n\nCarr told reporters during the FCC's open meeting that the commission was pursuing \"enforcement actions\" against the talk show \"The View\" over its broadcast of an interview with Talarico.\n\n\"What we're doing now is simply applying the law on the books in an even-handed manner, and for people that benefited from a two-tier system of justice during the Biden years, they may feel like that's weaponization, but that doesn't make it so,\" Carr told Ingraham.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox News, CBS, The Late Show, and the campaigns of Talarico and primary opponent Jasmine Crockett did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. The FCC pointed to Carr's remarks during the open meeting when reached for comment.\n\nCBS previously said in a statement that it did not specifically prohibit \"The Late Show\" from broadcasting the interview, but that it did provide the show with legal guidance.\n\nColbert, who has hosted \"The Late Show\" since 2015, told his viewers on Monday that CBS lawyers said \"in no uncertain terms\" that his late-night talk show could not air the interview with Talarico. He also said he was told not to acknowledge the decision on air, which prompted his decision to post the interview on YouTube.\n\nRep. Crockett, a Democrat running against Talarico, said during a Tuesday appearance on \"The Briefing with Jen Psaki\" likely gave her primary rival a \"boost.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday social media post, Talarico's campaign confirmed that the fervor around the incident had a positive effect, saying it had raised $2.5 million in 24 hours after the Colbert interview was scrapped.",

    "description": "DoorDash offers more choice than Amazon by working with a wider range of grocery chains, CEO Tony Xu said during the company's Q4 earnings call.",
    "fullText": "DoorDash CEO Tony Xu says that his company's grocery offering has a key advantage over Amazon: choice.\n\nAmazon is doubling down on grocery delivery, especially perishables like produce and ice cream. The retail and tech giant said last month that it's expanding same- and next-day grocery delivery to more parts of the US this year, adding to the thousands of towns and cities it already serves — news that sent shares of Instacart and DoorDash tumbling at the time.\n\nDoorDash, though, has something that shoppers want and that Amazon isn't replicating, Xu said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike Amazon, which owns Whole Foods and several of its own food brands, DoorDash works with existing grocery chains. The delivery service has struck deals in recent years. Last year, it expanded its partnership with Kroger and signed new deals with regional chains, including Schnucks in the Midwest.\n\nFew customers complete all their grocery shopping at a single chain, Xu said. Many stop at multiple stores each week, especially to find specific fresh groceries, such as produce, meat, and seafood.\n\n\"Consumers prefer choice,\" Xu said on the call, adding that he expects there to \"continue to be very strong interest in the DoorDash product\" as a result.\n\nDoorDash is also expanding its services for retailers, such as fulfillment through its DashMarts, convenience store-sized retail spaces designed for picking and delivering orders.\n\nXu said DoorDash is \"doing that for every single grocer so that they have the capability to compete against companies like Amazon.\"\n\nDoorDash shares rose as much as 14% in after-market trading on Wednesday, despite disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and guidance for 2026. The company's stock took its biggest one-day hit in November after it unveiled plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on tech improvements.\n\nWhile DoorDash has become known for restaurant deliveries, its gig workers are increasingly making grocery deliveries — many of which make more financial sense for DoorDash.\n\nXu said DoorDash has attracted more big grocery orders from customers, not just small fill-in trips. That matters in the grocery industry, where grocers tend to make more money when customers buy a wider range of goods.\n\n\"People use us for both the quick runs as well as the stock-up use cases,\" he said.\n\nRavi Inukonda, DoorDash's CFO, said on the call that DoorDash's retail and grocery business expects to \"be unit-economic positive\" in the second half of 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta is deepening its ties to Nvidia in a move that could further pressure Intel and AMD, even as AI demand remains strong.",
    "fullText": "Meta is doubling down on its relationship with Nvidia in what the AI chip giant called a \"multigenerational\" deal.\n\nThe agreement, announced Tuesday, calls for Meta to build data centers powered by millions of Nvidia's current and next-generation chips for AI training and inference.\n\nThe move underscores how Meta is deepening its reliance on Nvidia, even as the social networking giant develops its own in-house chips and works with competing suppliers like AMD. Reports also suggested Meta has explored using TPUs — chips designed by its rival, Google.\n\nThe Nvidia deal could cool speculation around Meta's purported TPU talks, said Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy — though Big Tech companies often test several suppliers at the same time.\n\nThe deal arrives amid increased competition in AI infrastructure. While Nvidia leads the market, rivals including Google, AMD, and Broadcom are working to chip away at its dominance.\n\nCrucially, the partnership will see Meta deploy not only Nvidia's GPUs, but also CPUs.\n\nCPUs, long dominated by Intel and AMD, are the central processors that work with GPUs inside data centers. They're used for general computing tasks and are core to essentially all modern computing systems, whereas GPUs are used in specialized cases that require more compute power, such as AI training and graphics in gaming. By supplying both, Nvidia stands to capture even more spend and deepen its role within Meta's AI stack.\n\nWhile that increases competitive pressure, Moorhead said the demand for infrastructure has become so high that Nvidia's rivals will unlikely see outright declines in the near term.\n\nNvidia has been making its CPU ambitions more explicit, Moorhead said, including marketing its forthcoming Vera CPU as a stand-alone product. This emphasis reflects how CPUs play a larger role as AI workloads move beyond model training and toward inference.\n\n\"CPUs tend to be cheaper and a bit more power-efficient for inference,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group.\n\nBoth Moorhead and Enderle said that Meta's decision to source both GPUs and CPUs from a single vendor can also reduce complexity, with chief information officers often favoring a \"one-throat-to-choke\" approach to problem resolution.\n\nIn addition to GPUs and CPUs, Meta will use Nvidia's networking equipment inside data centers as part of the deal, as well as its confidential computing technology to run AI features within WhatsApp.\n\nThe companies will also work together to deploy Nvidia's next-generation Vera CPUs beyond the current Grace CPU model, Nvidia said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "8 luxury crossbody bags that are worth the splurge, according to style editors",
    "description": "I prefer crossbody bags for their comfort and convenience. These luxury picks stood out for their beautiful materials and thoughtful design details.",
    "fullText": "I was standing in a shivering mass of well-dressed spectators in the Upper East Side this past New York Fashion Week. Among them I noticed a subtle trend: accessories with a practical edge, like deep pockets, adjustable fastenings, and an emphasis on comfort.\n\nLuxury crossbody bags embody this utilitarian aesthetic. You can sling one on and carry it hands-free, and because their weight is distributed more evenly than with a shoulder bag, they're also the most comfortable travel purse.\n\nBeyond their high-quality materials and stylish designs, our favorite luxury crossbody bags we've tested also come with intuitive pockets to keep you organized whether you're exploring a new city, running a quick errand, or attending a formal event.\n\nI used to be the type who would stuff everything in my pockets so I wouldn't have to hold anything while I'm out. But since investing in the form and function of a luxury crossbody bag, I can see the appeal of being a purse girl. Here are 8 splurge-worthy styles that will work hard while adding intrigue to your outfit.\n\nSee \n\nI brought along this luxury crossbody bag from Parisa Wang when I traveled to Rhode Island for my best friend's wedding. Parisa Wang partners with artisans who typically work with top luxury brands like The Row and Prada, and you can tell by the elite craftsmanship. It starts at the very bottom with tiny gold feet that protects the yummy chocolate suede from coming into contact with the floor.\n\nOn its sides are slip pockets that snap shut on their own with a satisfying magnetic closure, and inside is a wide main compartment where you can easily fit a variety of bulbous items (overpackers rejoice). The long strap is removable, so I carried it is as a handbag anytime I wasn't wearing it slung over my shoulder.\n\nThe Gabrielle comes in two larger sizes, as described by style editor Samantha Crozier in our guide to the best work bags for women. \"The Gabrielle 35 looks and feels like the ultra-coveted suede Margaux bag from The Row, which will run you $5K or more,\" she writes. '\"But dare I say that the Gabrielle is cuter?\"\n\nThis brand is literally fit for royals, as it's been spotted on Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. It's not a traditional work bag — you won't find a padded laptop sleeve or built-in tech compartments — but the Strathberry Tote is considered a holy grail over on the Reddit's r/handbags forum as a luxury office purse.\n\nThe mid-tier luxury brand has a reputation for delivering exceptional materials and meticulous construction at a price that, while still a splurge, feels justified in the luxury space. Each Strathberry bag takes an artisan at least 20 hours to complete, and that care is evident the moment you see it up close. The stitching is precise, the leather feels rich and substantial, and the suede lining is soft to the touch.\n\nIts signature music bar hardware is weighty, polished, and unmistakably luxe — the kind of detail that elevates even the simplest outfit. It also comes in Midi and Mini sizes.\n\nTravel writer Maria Yagoda tested the best travel purses, where this versatile Lo & Sons bag came out on top. \n\n\"The interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder,\" according to Maria.\n\n\"In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options,\" she continues.\n\n\"The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable.\"\n\nMy own favorite part about the Aoyama is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder. Just don't get the Ivory colorway, since I found it stains more easily.\n\nRead \n\n\"KAAI's Rebel Crossbody is the Rolex of functional purses,\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. The Belgian brand created this luxury crossbody bag with a unique, asymmetrical design and a long strap that can easily fit over a puffy jacket.\n\n\"Like all of KAAI's beautifully made bags, it's lined with a blue suede material that feels luxurious to the touch. On the outside, the single-source leather is treated to be resistant to weather and stains. This is super important to me, since I wouldn't carry a bag this nice outside without trusting how well the leather can stand up to the elements. But all my KAAI bags have remained like-new, even though they're some of my most used pieces,\" continues Samantha.\n\n\"The only issue with this bag is that it is relatively narrow and structured, so you won't be able to stuff it,\" she advises. \"A phone, wallet, lipstick, and keys fit perfectly, but anything bulky or irregular would prevent the bag from closing.\"\n\nI tested the Petite version of one of Clare V's bestselling styles, the Moyen Messenger. The Petit is one of my favorite crossbody bags I own, but the larger size has a more practical advantage with the same relaxed, woven leather look. And I know this bag is a hot commodity because sure enough, Quince has its own dupe. \n\nClare V. is a Los Angeles-based brand that makes what I call 'character bags.' You can build an outfit around them and make them your own with their extensive collection of interchangeable straps. I'm not a huge bag charm person myself, but the D-rings on this luxury crossbody make it the perfect backdrop for colorful key chains.\n\nThe medium-sized Moyen Messenger comes with two straps, so you can wear it as a shoulder bag or a crossbody. It has a slouchy, curved construction like the hobo bags that are making a return. Even better: the soft, flexible leather lies flat, so I'm easily able to pack it in my carry-on.\n\nThe Mini Maestra from Senreve takes modular design to another level. This 4-in-1 luxury crossbody can also be worn as a tote, satchel, or backpack, depending on whatever you need it to be. The top features a flap and the Senreve's signature studded belt closure, and inside is a zipper to secure your belongings. \n\nExecutive editor Sally Kaplan tested out the full-sized Maestra as a luxury work bag and confirmed it to be worth the splurge. Besides its fashion-forward shape, the 100% leather is seriously high-quality. It comes in both pebbled and long-grain finishes, and inside it's lined with smooth suede. This premium leather is also water-repellent, so you can wear it out in the rain without fussing over stains. Plus, it comes with a lifetime warranty.\n\nSee similar styles in our guide to the best convertible backpack tote bags.\n\nI was inspired to test out this style when I was getting ready to go out with my friend, and she asked me if my bag was a Polène. In fact, it was from Quince. But when a Quince dupe can pass for French luxury, it makes me skeptical that the real deal could be any good to begin with.\n\nInstead, I was happily proven wrong. The 'Cognac' shade of the Numéro Dix is the perfect color for people who wear similar gourmand shades like chocolate and almond. It's made with a single panel of structured, full-grain leather that has a deliciously rich sheen.\n\nIt also beats out the Quince dupe in terms of storage capacity. Because the crescent shape has a flared base, I can fill it from the bottom up with my everyday carry. I've only worn mine as a crossbody or shoulder bag, but it also converts to a belt bag and the adjustable strap extension means it can fit a tall frame. There's now a JW Pei dupe of the same style.\n\nThe real Numéro Dix feels worth the splurge because it's a true heritage piece and the materials are primed to age gracefully. The simple, stylish shape puts an elevated twist on the contemporary saddle silhouette.\n\n\"Despite its teeny-tiny silhouette, this miniature crossbody can hold a surprising amount of items,\" writes freelance style reporter Talia Ergas. If you're getting your looks together for vacation season, Talia found the artisan-made Milaner Grazia Mini to be the perfect little clutch for tying your whole outfit together.\n\n\"My iPhone fits effortlessly across the bottom, and there's plenty of room for my sunglasses, a small wallet, and some odds and ends like mints and a chapstick,\" Talia writes. \"I love this hand-woven leather bag because it has the elegance of a clutch with the ease and comfort of a crossbody bag. The strap is removable, though, which is convenient for occasions when I might prefer to swap in its shorter strap for a wristlet.\"\n\nYou can tell a luxury crossbody bag by its intuitive design details, artisan-level craftsmanship, and longevity. Our favorites are typically made from high-quality leather — like full-grain or pebbled Italian leather — and feature precise stitching, durable hardware, and thoughtfully-placed pockets. The result is a versatile accessory that will age gracefully despite regular wear.\n\nBetween small and medium is best if you want something to comfortably weigh on your shoulder. A small bag that's about 8 inches wide will fit only the essentials, but be more streamlined to carry. Medium crossbody bags of about 14 inches offer a bit more space for a small tablet or a bulky sunglasses case.\n\nA luxury crossbody bag typically uses higher-quality materials — like full-grain leather, suede lining, and solid metal accents — that hold up significantly better over time. Cheaper bags will instead use bonded leather or flimsy hardware that can peel, scratch, or tarnish quickly. If you carry a bag daily, think about in terms of cost-per-wear. The durability of a luxury crossbody bag will prove itself in the long run.\n\nCrossbodies are already practical by design — they keep your hands free, and many of our favorites can be converted into a shoulder bag. A luxury version elevates that functionality with easy-to-carry proportions, reinforced stitching, smooth straps that don't dig into your shoulder, and scratch-resistant, water-repellent materials.\n\nYes. As someone who used to try and carry everything in my pockets, I found that luxury crossbody bags are the easiest gateway into stylish personal organization — especially if you prefer a lighter load. A well-designed crossbody prioritizes smart compartments and a streamlined shape, so you don't feel the bulk as you go about your business.\n\nRead how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "title": "What Are Heart Rate Zones, and How Can You Find Yours?",
    "description": "For when you need to be in \"zone 2\" and have no idea what that is.",
    "fullText": "Heart rate zones are a way to describe how hard you're working during a cardio workout, like running or cycling. The faster your heart beats, the harder you're working. So an easy jog might have you in zone 2 for a whole workout, while a HIIT workout might have you bouncing between zones 1 and 5. Read on for a breakdown of what heart rate zones are, how to use them, and some of the caveats you should know when you're training this way.\n\nOne quick thing before we dive in: Heart rate zones are for cardio. Cardio means exercise that involves doing the same rhythmic movement over and over, like running or swimming or stair climbing. Heart rate zones mean nothing for strength training, even if you have an app or watch that reports them to you as if they matter.\n\nWhen you do cardio, your heart has to beat faster to get nutrients and oxygen to your muscles. Your heart rate is the number of time your heart beats in each minute. So if you can easily measure your heart rate—which fitness watches and trackers can—then you have a number that tells you how hard you're working.\n\nThe exact numbers you'll see for hard and easy workouts are different for everybody, so we have the idea of heart rate \"zones.\" Depending on exactly how your watch or app calculates it, you might see something like a \"zone 2\" when your heart rate is between 50% and 70% of maximum. A workout that goes a bit harder might put you into zone 3. In many systems the highest zone, for the very hardest parts of the hardest workouts, is zone 5.\n\nOnce you know your zones, you can follow workouts or targets for those zones. For example, you might go jogging and try to keep your heart rate in zone 2 for 30 minutes. Then on another day, you might do a workout that aims to have you cycling hard in zone 4 for several minutes at a time, with recovery time where you pedal easy in zone 1.\n\nEach zone has its benefits. Most commonly you'll hear people talking about the low-fatigue aerobic work of zone 2, or the benefits of tempo work that mostly happens in zone 4. But there's a lot to be said for getting a variety of work in all different zones. Every zone is good for you, even the zone 3 that is sometimes incorrectly painted as a \"gray zone\" where nothing happens. (Hot take: Zone 3 is great and most of us could use a little more of it.)\n\nBefore I tell you how to find and use your zones, I'm going to start with a huge caveat. You may hear everybody talking about zone this and zone that, but if you're new to exercise or new to heart rate tracking, you're actually better off ignoring zones for a while. Pay more attention to how you feel. A workout that's meant to be easy should feel easy, regardless of what number is on your heart rate monitor. A workout that's meant to be hard should feel hard.\n\nOver time, if you watch your heart rate during exercise, you'll start to notice which numbers go with which feelings. Knowing that you see (for example) 140 on your watch when you're in the middle of an easy workout means a lot more than knowing that your device considers it to be \"zone 2.\"\n\nZone workouts are hard for beginners to follow, for a few reasons:\n\nYour zones may be hard to stay in, especially the lower zones like zone 2. If your heart rate skyrockets into zone 4 as soon as you start to jog, a zone 2 jog may just not be possible right now.\n\nYour zones may not be properly calibrated. You need an accurate max heart rate to set your zones properly (more on that below), and an age-based formula is not guaranteed to be correct.\n\nYou have more important things to do than stick to zones! Your body needs to learn technique, pacing, and all kinds of physical and psychological skills. Every brain cell you spend on obsessing over zones is a brain cell that's not available for the more important tasks before you.\n\nRemember, the reason your watch tells you your heart rate is because that's something that is easy for the watch to measure and display—not because it's the most important thing for you to pay attention to.\n\nThere isn't just one heart rate zone system! There are dozens, if not hundreds. Some have three zones, some four, some five, and some even more. Even when two apps or wearables use a five-zone system, they don't necessarily set the boundaries of the zones in the same places. For example, some systems will set \"zone 2\" at 60% to 70% of your max heart rate, while others will use 65% to 75%.\n\nThe different systems also don't agree on what those percentages are of. Sometimes it's maximum heart rate, which we'll discuss below; sometimes it's heart rate reserve, which also takes your resting heart rate into account. Less commonly, you might find zones based around other metrics like lactate threshold.\n\nI know you're not going to be happy until you see me set out a chart of numbers, so here goes. This is not the only zone system out there, but it's one that works decently well for most purposes, and you'll find versions of it in several different apps and wearables. It's not the best, but it is perhaps the simplest. You'll need to know your maximum heart rate (MHR), and then you can take percentages of that to know your zones:\n\nZone 1: 50% to 60% of your maximum heart rate (MHR), though some systems will go up to 65%\n\nZone 2: 61% to 70% of MHR; some systems will go up to 75%\n\nZone 3: 71% to 80%, or it might be more like 76% to 85%\n\nZone 4: 80% to 90%, or sometimes 85% to 95%\n\nIn these systems, zone 1 is for warmups or very easy recovery between intervals. Zone 2 is for easy aerobic training, like a light jog—something you could keep up for hours if you're reasonably fit. Zone 3 is for stuff that feels like a medium intensity, like a faster jog, something that would tire you out to do for more than an hour, but you can keep it up pretty steadily. Zone 4 is when things get intense, usually for just a few minutes at a time, and you’ll only bump in zone 5 for a few seconds during your hardest intervals. You can’t sustain work in zone 5 for much longer than that.\n\nNow that you know the zones, you’re only missing one thing: your maximum heart rate, which forms the basis for them all.\n\nCommonly, these systems will recommend you subtract your age from the number 220 to find your max heart rate. Occasionally they’ll use another formula. But these formulas are often wrong, since they give a single number for everybody at the same age. We're supposed to believe all 43-year-olds have a max heart rate of 177, but in reality there are plenty of 43-year-olds with a max heart rate over 200, and it's not rare to find some 43-year-olds with a max heart rate in the 150s. (Similar caveats apply to any age.) The person with the 200 max will wonder why they're always in \"zone 4\" when they feel like they're in zone 2, and the person with the 150 max will wonder why they feel like they're dying when they're in \"zone 3.\"\n\nSo don't rely on a formula, especially if you're seeing zones that don't make sense for how a workout felt. Ideally you’ll do a max heart rate test as I describe here, or make an educated guess by looking up the highest heart rate that your device recorded during one of your hardest workouts.\n\nYou can do a little reality check on your zones by making sure they feel right. Here's what they should feel like:\n\nZone 1 will feel very easy, barely like you’re exercising at all.\n\nIn zone 2, you’ll start to feel hot and sweaty, but you can still easily carry on a conversation.\n\nIn zone 3, your breathing will get a bit heavier. The lower end of zone 3 is still conversational, but toward the top of this zone you’ll only be able to say a few words at a time.\n\nIn zone 4, you’re working hard and not in the mood to talk, but you probably feel like you could keep this effort up for a while—or a few more minutes at least.\n\nZone 5 is your absolute top speed, and you can only stand it for a few grueling seconds.\n\nIf you aren’t sure of your max heart rate, try using this effort-level guide for a while. When you actually do get to a workout that calls for zone 5, give it your all—then check your heart rate monitor to see what number it gave you.\n\nI have more on zone 2 here, including what it is, how to do it, and why it might be just a teensy bit overrated. Zone 2 refers to an easy effort that you can carry on basically forever. If you're a beginner, walking might be a zone 2 workout. For an athlete, zone 2 might be a brisk jog that they could keep up for a few hours. The best marker of a zone 2 workout is that you stop because time is up, not because you're too tired to continue.\n\nThere's nothing special about staying in zone 2, except that it's low-fatigue and so you can do a lot of it. If you find your heart rate inching up into zone 3, that's honestly totally fine. The more exercise you do, the more you have to pay attention to the intensity of it. Athletes who are exercising 10 hours every week need to make sure that some of those workouts are easy ones. But if you're getting in a few 30-minute jogs or exercises classes, any intensity is fine so long as you end most workouts feeling good and not totally exhausted.",

    "title": "My Favorite Ways to Upgrade a Laundry Room on a Budget",
    "description": "Laundry rooms can be grim, utilitarian places—but they don’t have to be.",
    "fullText": "As anyone who’s ever had to schlep their dirty linens to a laundromat knows, having in-house laundry is a godsend. But the convenience of doing laundry whenever you feel like it starts to feel less convenient if you're lacking in the necessary storage, shelving, or work space. If a total laundry room renovation isn't in the budget, though, don't fret: You can upgrade your home's laundry hub with just a few relatively inexpensive additions. Combined with some fresh paint and some other low-cost improvements, you can have a more beautiful and functional laundry area on a small budget.\n\nIf you’ve got a separate washer and dryer setup in your laundry area, picking up some appliance pedestals with built-in drawers is an easy way to add some useful storage. You’ll need to measure vertically in your laundry space to make sure you’ve got the required height, and you’ll probably need some help moving and lifting the appliances into place. But once that’s done, you’ll not only have a place to store all those unsightly bottles of detergent and other stuff, it will be easier to load and unload your clothes because you won’t have to bend down so far.\n\nIf your laundry area is its own room with a door, you can maximize your storage space by adding a slim shelving unit behind the door. It will be just deep enough to hold all your laundry materials, cleaning up the area without taking up any valuable floor space.\n\nIf your laundry area lacks storage, you’ve got a few options. One of the easiest things you can do is to add a countertop over your washer and dryer set. This could be as DIY as cutting a slab of wood or using a leftover remnant from a kitchen remodel, or you could purchase a topper with edge rails like this one. This instantly transforms the top of your appliances into a usable flat surface that won’t let things slide off as soon as you turn your back. If you have more vertical space and need more options, a tiered over-the-appliance shelf system is a great option, giving you multiple shelves plus hanging rods to get everything off the floor and organized.\n\nEven if you only iron your clothes once in a while, having a real ironing board makes a huge difference, and having that ironing board conveniently located near your laundry is ideal. If you have nothing but space, you can just have a board set up, of course, but if you don’t have a ton of space, or you’re just looking to keep the place tidy, you could opt for an over-the-door ironing board or a wall-mounted version like this. The board folds up when not in use, but is always easily accessible.\n\nIf you want a fancy version, you could install the Iron-A-Way Ironing Center, which is pricey and probably requires professional installation, as it’s designed to recess into the wall and connect to the home’s power.\n\nHaving a utility sink in the laundry area is great—it lets you rinse out clothes, clean up detergent spills, and wet-scrub stains right there. If your laundry area isn’t plumbed, you might not relish the idea of hiring a plumber to run water and drain lines for a sink—but you don’t have to. This portable sink can give you that basic functionality without any wiring or plumbing. Just fill it with water, charge it using a USB-C cable, and place it in your laundry area to use whenever you need it.\n\nIt’s a simple addition, but having a place to hang clothes to dry right there in the laundry area is a great convenience. You can buy a freestanding drying rack, of course, but as an upgrade, consider a wall-mounted option instead. This one from mDesign looks great and folds up when not in use.\n\nDispensing liquid detergent can get messy, and when you’re in a rush, those measurements can get sloppy, too, leaving you with insufficient detergent for the load or wasting detergent, running up your costs. This rechargeable electronic detergent dispenser fits on top of most plastic detergent bottles and dispenses precise amounts of detergent with the touch of a button. If that’s a bit too fancy for your laundry area, you could pick up a cheap dispenser cup holder like this to make it a little easier and neater to fill your detergent cups.\n\nIf you need some folding and storage space in your laundry area but there’s no vertical or wall options, take some inspiration from your kitchen and bring in a freestanding island or laundry cart. This one from Kitsorack is a clothes hamper with a shelf, so you can stuff your dirty clothes in there and have your supplies stored on top, but any mobile cart or island will make your laundry area more usable.",

    "description": "Meta is weighing facial recognition for its Ray-Ban smart glasses, raising serious privacy concerns.",
    "fullText": "According to a New York Times report, Meta plans to add facial recognition technology to its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses. The feature, called “Name Tag” within Meta, would allow users to identify people and get information about them through Meta's AI. The feature could be rolling out as early as this year.\n\nAdding the feature is not a done deal, however. According to an internal document cited by The Times, the company is weighing the “safety and privacy risks\" of introducing facial recognition as well as discussing how to navigate the response to a no-doubt controversial feature.\n\nA document quoted by The Times suggests Meta is deliberately timing a potential rollout to minimize scrutiny. “We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document from Meta’s Reality Labs reads.\n\nThis would not be the first time Meta dabbled in facial recognition. Meta debated adding facial recognition to the first generation of its Ray-Ban smart glasses in 2021, but decided against it due to privacy concerns. And Facebook, Meta's social media platform, identified and tagged people as early as 2010, but the company pulled the feature in 2021, citing \"many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society.”\n\nConcerns also include the risk of doxxing. The ACLU characterized facial recognition used by law enforcement as a \"systematic invasion of privacy,\" though personal use of the technology raises different issues. Facial recognition glasses could enable instant doxxing, linking anyone's face to publicly available information, including social media profiles, addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nMeta says it isn't planning to release a universal facial recognition tool. The company is considering glasses that identify only people a user knows based on their connection on a Meta platform, or only identify people who have a public account on a Meta site like Instagram. \"While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature—and some products already exist in the market—we’re still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,\" Meta said in a statement.\n\nPrivacy concerns aside, the technology has genuinely beneficial applications, particularly to people with vision problems. According to The Times' report, Meta originally planned to introduce Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the blind before releasing it to the public, highlighting a group that could potentially benefit from facial recognition technology, though that plan was scrapped for unknown reasons.\n\nMike Buckley, CEO of Be My Eyes, an accessibility technology company that works closely with Meta, said he has been in discussions with Meta about facial recognition glasses for more than a year. “It is so important and powerful for this group of humans,” Buckley told The Times.",

    "description": "This is a great chance to get the latest budget-friendly Pixel.",
    "fullText": "Google is releasing their budget a-series version of the Pixel 10 on March 5, a whole month earlier than the 9a was released in 2025. There is not much dividing the 10a from the 9a, but there are a few software updates that can make it worth it for some people. Throw in a $100 Amazon gift card, and it's hard to say no. Google has the pre-orders for the Google 10a out already, going for $499, plus the gift card. Alternatively, you can get their Pixel Buds 2a instead of the $100 gift card for the same $499 price.\n\nLifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt actually got her hands on the Pixel 10a during a recent Google demo event. As she pointed out, the specs on the Pixel 10a are not like the Pixel 10. It's more similar to the 9 instead. It has a Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage, as well as the same camera system, with a 48MP main lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera. The battery life is the same 30+ hours, too, and the MagSafe-like Pixelsnap feature is gone. The main upgrade here is a brighter 3,000 nits screen, a thinner bezel, and an improved Corning Gorilla Glass 7i cover glass. But the value might be in the software and AI.\n\nThere are two AI camera features that debuted with the Pixel 10. One is Auto Best Take, which takes 150 frames in one click, chooses the best picture, and automatically deletes the rest (or stitches together elements from multiple shots to make a new \"best\" image). And Camera Coach, which guides you with AI on how to take the best picture. Google also brought Satellite SOS for the first time to an a-series phone. It lets you connect to a Satellite and ping emergency services for help if you have no cell signal.\n\nIf you're thinking of upgrading from a Pixel 9a or later, there's not much here to make it worth it. However, if you have anything older than a Pixel 9 or are switching to Pixel for the first time, this is a great opportunity and phone to do so.",

    "title": "My Favorite 'Glances' From Garmin’s Latest Software Update",
    "description": "Garmin added sleep alignment, lifestyle logging, and battery usage, plus new training plans.",
    "fullText": "A new software update for recent Garmin watches adds “glances” for types of data that weren’t previously viewable from the watch face. These include battery usage stats, lifestyle logging, sleep alignment, and even a few extras like sports scores. The update also includes features other than glances, including, notably, fitness coaching. The features I’m writing about are now available in the Forerunner 570, Forerunner 970, and Vivoactive 6, as well as the Fenix 8 series, Venu 4, and X1. (The watch in my photos here is a Forerunner 570.)\n\nGlances are those little strips of data that you can see when you scroll up (or down) from the main watch face—things like the weather and your training status, for example. Garmin’s newest stable update for the Forerunner 570 and 970 is numbered 16.28, and has been rolling out slowly over the past week. (I just got it on my 570.) Here are my favorite new glances:\n\nBattery usage: The new battery widget has the charge level, of course, but tapping it shows you a graph of your battery life, including its long-term history, and a list of which apps or functions have been using the most battery.\n\nLifestyle logging: If you’ve been using the new Lifestyle Logging feature in the Garmin Connect app, you can now do it from your wrist. This is where you select a few health-related habits to track every day. The glance will tell you how many items you’ve logged today, and you can quickly answer these yes or no questions without opening your phone.\n\nSleep alignment: The sleep glance has been around a while, but it now includes more data, including your optimal sleep window and whether you’re aligned with it.\n\nSports scores: You can select a handful of your favorite teams to receive up to date scores on your wrist. This was surprisingly easy to set up without even unlocking my phone: You just choose a league (MLB, NFL, NCAA men’s or women’s, to name a few) and then scroll until you find the city name for your favorite team. Alphabetizing by city rather than team name is smart, especially if you’re going through the menus picking all your hometown teams. This widget seems to show the next upcoming game if your chosen team hasn’t played a recent game.\n\nWeight tracking: From this glance you can see your current body weight, and tap through to see trends and history.\n\nBesides the glances, Garmin added a bunch of other features to its watches. According to the release notes, Garmin says that pace readings (presumably during runs) have been improved to be more responsive. I look forward to trying that out. There are also color filters—instead of just turning on a red shift for nighttime, you can choose other colors as well.\n\nTraining plans also get more capabilities. In addition to the usual running and cycling plans, there’s now a fitness coach, similar to what launched on the Venu 4. This lets you set up a plan that gives you a mix of cardio and strength workouts, though I found that the coach's endurance workouts don’t actually specify the activity. Typically, when selecting my “basic endurance” workout that’s planned for today, the watch prompts me to select from my usual list of endurance activities: run, trail run, treadmill run, indoor bike, and so on. The coach, however, will simply tell you to do \"endurance\" or \"cardio\" for 20 minutes. You could choose to run, but you could also hike or use the elliptical, for instance.\n\nFor the strength workouts, I told the coach that I have access to a full gym, so my next strength workout will include deadlifts and squats. It looks like a pretty solid plan for somebody who wants well-rounded fitness without committing to running a race.",

    "description": "Google is prepping to reveal new features in May.",
    "fullText": "Google I/O 2026 is nearly upon us. This is Google's annual opportunity to showcase the software features (and perhaps some of the hardware) the company has been cooking up behind the scenes. Like other big tech keynotes, anyone can tune in live and catch Google's latest announcements as they happen. Here's when Google I/O 2026 will kick off, and what we know about the conference at this time.\n\nGoogle tends to kick off its I/O event in May of each year, and 2026 is no different. This year, Google I/O will run May 19 through May 20. If you're used to watching one single livestream, that two-day schedule might come as a surprise. But I/O isn't just an announcement: It's a developer conference, spanning keynotes, demos, and product sessions.\n\nBut if you're only interested in the company's main keynote, you'll want to get May 19 on your calendar. Google hasn't announced the exact time for its presentation, but it usually starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET), based on previous years.\n\nWhile Google invites a select group of journalists to watch its presentations live, and encourages developers to register to attend its various events, you can tune into the livestream wherever you are in the world. Google hasn't confirmed where its livestreams will be hosted this year, but looking to the past, you'll likely be able to stream the keynote from the official I/O website, as well as Google's official YouTube channel.\n\nThe short answer? We don't really know! Google is keeping I/O news close to the vest, and rumors haven't been particularly prolific this year—at least, not yet. Seeing as it's only February, it's entirely possible we'll hear more about Google I/O 2026 as we get closer to May.\n\nThat said, there are some things you can expect to see regardless of leaks and rumors. Android 17 will almost assuredly take center stage at Google I/O this year. Google just released first beta for the OS on Wednesday, though it doesn't change all that much about Android 16 at this time. That said, I suspect beta testers will discover a number of new features and changes between now and May, as Google continues to add new things to its test software ahead I/O.\n\nLike the past couple of I/O's, this year should also be all about AI. Google seems to come out with new AI announcements multiple times a week, including adding its Lyria 3 AI music model to Gemini, or adding an agentic bot to Chrome to browse the internet for you. I expect Google I/O 2026 to be full of AI features—perhaps more than some of us would like to hear about.\n\nI/O 2026 could also show off some hardware, but that's no guarantee. Google did just announce the Pixel 10a, the company's latest \"budget\" phone, and it could reveal other devices in May, but I/O really is more about the software than the hardware. (It is a developer conference, after all.)",

    "title": "Apple Is Adding ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to CarPlay in iOS 26.4",
    "description": "You'll need to wait for a new update to try it.",
    "fullText": "When Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.4 this week, testers immediately got to work looking for each and every new feature and change. To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\n\nAs spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.\n\nAccording to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant.\n\nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n\nThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.",

Round three and an opportunity for Scotland to properly put themselves in the mix for the title.\n\nThe emotional and physical energy expended in delivering these incredible Calcutta Cup victories has proved hard for Scotland to recover from and then replicate.\n\nScotland bounced back brilliantly from the gut punch of defeat to Italy in Rome to dispatch England in sensational fashion, but the memories of the Stadio Olimpico will remain with them, serving as a cautionary tale as they prepare to face a Wales side at a low ebb.\n\n\"We'll obviously be sitting there with Italy in the back of our mind and that performance,\" Scotland second row Scott Cummings said.\n\n\"We know that we can't let our performance dip to that point again. We know that we can push on and we believe we can push on. But the weekend was just a start for us, now we need to back it up.\n\n\"In the nicest way possible, we've beaten England before. We've done this before in the Six Nations quite a few times and we probably haven't backed it up after that, so that's definitely a big focus for us.\"\n\nPodcast: Can Scotland back it up?\n\nScotland trio ruled out for visit to Wales\n\nThe latest Scottish rugby news, views & analysis\n\nCaptain Sione Tuipulotu spoke before the England match about how Scotland were \"a desperate team\" with their Six Nations hopes on the line.\n\nThat desperation for a win surely applies to Wales this weekend.\n\nSteve Tandy, the former Scotland defence coach now in charge of Wales, has watched his side get battered in their opening two matches against England and France.\n\nThey sit bottom of the table having scored only 19 points across two games while conceding 102.\n\nFrance ran riot with eight tries in Cardiff to consign Wales to a 13th consecutive Six Nations defeat.\n\nYet Scotland have had enough bad experiences in Cardiff to never take a victory for granted, even with Welsh rugby in dire straits.\n\n\"I obviously know some of their coaching staff, Steve Tandy and [former Glasgow head coach] Danny Wilson,\" Cummings said.\n\n\"They'll be obviously pretty up for this game, having worked with us in the past.\n\n\"We're expecting a pretty solid, gritty performance from them, and they'll definitely be tough to break down.\n\n\"They're going to be a team that's obviously hurting and, like we were last week, that often brings the best out in teams. So we're expecting a massive fight from them.\n\n\"I want the heat on us. We need to view every single moment as the most important moment of the match. If we don't, then I don't think we'll get the win out of it. So I don't think the pressure's off us.\n\n\"In international rugby, the pressure's always on you to perform well. I think for us it's going to be a massive game, but we're definitely not resting on the weekend being a finished performance.\"",

    "fullText": "There has been a very interesting question on the OSM US Slack lately.\n\n“Does anyone have a method to search through the OSM database for a building of a particular shape? I need assistance finding OSM buildings with this specific shape. They should be located in NJ, DE, northeastern MD, eastern PA, or southern NY.”\n\nThe question quickly exploded into a huge discussion. At the time of writing, there are already 71 replies.\n\n“You could load OSM buildings into PostGIS and then use ST_HausdorffDistance to compare the geometries.”\n\nFrom there, the discussion veered into how to solve that specific puzzle and find the exact OSM building in question.\n\nOne person added, “So the strategy is: create the shape of the building you want to search for, scale it to, say, fill a 100x100 m bounding box or something. Ask Postgres to, within a search-area bounding box, take each building and scale it to a 100x100 m bounding box, compute the Hausdorff distance with the scaled input shape, and return all OSM element IDs and their Hausdorff distances, sorted in ascending order.”\n\nAnother said, “What I’m currently doing is combining several shape exports into a single file with around 20,000 objects that have concavity. Concavity plus more than 10 nodes eliminates most buildings.”\n\nAt that point, instead of hunting that elusive specific OSM building, I became more interested in the generalized version of the problem.\n\nSo I added my two cents to the discussion:\n\n“The generalized version of this problem would be : Can we represent a shape in some kind of data type that allows us to computationally check whether two objects have the same shape, regardless of rotation and scaling?\n\nI haven’t studied the Hausdorff distance yet, but I’m wondering whether it can solve this problem, or if there’s a better alternative—Hu moments, Procrustes analysis, Fourier descriptors for contours…”\n\n“Hu moments are a good option. Elliptic Fourier Descriptors, Shape Context Histograms, Turning functions, etc. I’ve experimented with those four while trying to classify sports pitches more accurately. You can actually get pretty far with just compactness, convexity, and aspect ratio, thankfully.”\n\nDo you have any other ideas on how to solve this problem?",

    "fullText": "The Gemini app now features our most advanced music generation model Lyria 3, empowering anyone to make 30-second tracks using text or images in beta.\n\nSince launching the Gemini app, we've built tools to encourage creative expression through images and video. Today, we're taking the next step: custom music generation. Lyria 3, Google DeepMind’s latest generative music model, is rolling out today in beta in the Gemini app. Just describe an idea or upload a photo, like “a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" and in a matter of seconds, Gemini will translate it into a high-quality, catchy track. To push the creative envelope further, you can even ask Gemini to take inspiration from something you upload.\n\nLyria 3 improves on audio generation from our Lyria models in three important ways:\n\nThe Gemini app creates 30-second tracks with custom cover art generated by Nano Banana. This makes it easy to quickly share with friends by downloading or simply clicking the share link. The goal of these tracks isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\n\nCreators can also explore Lyria 3 on YouTube’s Dream Track. Available in the U.S. and now rolling out to YouTube creators in other countries, Lyria 3 will enhance the quality of each unique Shorts soundtrack. Whether it's creating a lyrical verse or a vibey backing track, being able to better customize the soundtrack will take creators’ Shorts to the next level.\n\nAll tracks generated in the Gemini app are embedded with SynthID, our imperceptible watermark for identifying Google AI-generated content. We are also giving you more tools to help identify AI content, broadening our verification capabilities in the Gemini app to include audio, along with image and video. Simply upload a file and ask if it was generated using Google AI, and Gemini will check for SynthID and use its own reasoning to return a response.\n\nSince we first launched Lyria in 2023, we've sought to develop this technology responsibly in collaboration with the music community. We've learned a lot through these collaborations and our experiments, like Music AI Sandbox, and have been very mindful of copyright and partner agreements as we've trained Lyria 3.\n\nMusic generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content. We recognize that our approach might not be foolproof, so you can report content that may violate your rights or the rights of others. Additionally, in order to use our products, users must adhere to our Terms of Service and Gen AI prohibited use policies, which prohibit violations of others’ intellectual property and privacy rights.\n\nLyria 3 is available in the Gemini app for all users 18+ in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean and Portuguese, with plans to expand quality and coverage of more languages, rolling out on desktop today and to the mobile app over the next several days. And Google AI Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers will enjoy higher limits.\n\nOur goal with music generation in the Gemini app is to help you add a fun, custom soundtrack to your daily life.

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "You're migrating your monolith to microservices. The architecture is already clear: event-driven, async messaging, specific latency requirements. You just need help implementing it. Or you're fixing a bug. You know what's broken and what needs to stay the same. You want a surgical fix. What's the best way to work with an agent to achieve these goals without changing other parts of your app, or wasting tokens going in circles?\n\nWhen we launched Specs and the spec-driven development workflow, we built them around the traditional PM/engineering flow: requirements first, then design, then tasks. This works great for many projects and we’ve seen hundreds of thousands of developers default to this approach when building anything new.\n\nHowever, when we talked to Kiro users, we heard a clear pattern: not everyone starts from requirements. Especially when working on existing, brownfield apps, some developers came in with the technical architecture already mapped out. Others were fixing bugs and needed to carefully define what should change and what shouldn't. They didn't want to give up the structure of specs, but the current flow was not flexible enough for these types of tasks.\n\nWe didn’t want to ask developers to change how they were already approaching these projects, so today, we're shipping two new ways to use Specs: the Design-first workflow and the Bugfix Spec.\n\nWhen we first designed Specs, we were motivated by what Laurence Tratt calls \"the circular specification problem\" and \"the observer effect\" in software development. Tratt identifies a fundamental tension: the only way to know exactly what software we want to build is to fully specify it, but a complete specification is at least as much work as creating the software itself. This creates a catch-22 where we have to build the software to truly specify it. This is wishful thinking, especially for large projects. As Tratt observes, software occupies a \"liminal state\" between fantasy and reality—full of soft constraints that are hard to quantify until you actually build something. The act of creating software is itself an act of specification. That doesn’t mean working with no plan, but reaching a middle-ground that gives you enough structure so you can make progress quickly.\n\nRequirements-first and Design-first are two sides of the same coin, each addressing different aspects of this circular specification problem:\n\nRequirements-first works when you understand the behaviors and outcomes you need, but the technical path is unclear. You're exploring \"what should this do?\" before \"how should it work?\" Great option for net-new projects where your options are open.\n\nDesign-first works when you already have a technical vision—perhaps from experience, architectural constraints, or prototyping—and need to work backward to formalize what that system actually accomplishes. It's like whiteboarding a solution and then summarizing \"what this product does.\" This can apply to building a new feature on top of an existing app - you have to work within your current architecture and tech stack.\n\nBoth approaches embrace iteration and feedback. Neither pretends you can perfectly specify software upfront. Instead, they meet you where you actually are in your thinking, then help you work through the circular specification problem from different starting points.\n\nThe developer already knows the stack (FastAPI and mcp-python), the high-level architecture (an MCP server), and the constraints (no UI capabilities). They're not asking \"what should I build?\", they're asking \"help me build this thing I've already designed.\" In this case, starting with a design document makes more sense, because it matches how they're already thinking about the problem.\n\nSo now, when you create a new Feature Spec, Kiro asks you to choose: Requirements-first or tech Design-first. If you choose tech Design-first, you pick your level of detail. High-level design for system diagrams and components, or low-level design for algorithms and function signatures. Kiro generates your design document first. You iterate on it, exploring different technical approaches. Once you're happy with it, Kiro derives the requirements from your design, which ensures they are feasible. The rest of the spec workflow is the same: tasks, implementation, property-based testing to check if implementation matches what you want.\n\nTech Design-first works especially well when you have a pre-defined architecture, when you're prototyping to see if something is feasible, or when you're working with strict non-functional requirements that constrain your design choices. It's ideal when the technical approach is the starting point, not the destination.\n\nWhen fixing bugs, you have a different set of constraints and goals. You're not building something new, but correcting something that exists. Your surface area is different too. Change too much, and you risk breaking something that was working fine. You want the minimum change that fixes the problem.\n\nSo what’s the best way to work with an agent to do that? We found that developers who used Specs to successfully fix bugs shared two characteristics. First, they defined the detailed scenario that caused the error, not just the error message itself. Second, they explicitly stated what should not be modified. This is how experienced developers think about bugfixes, they fix what's broken but don't touch anything else.\n\nWhen you create a Bugfix Spec, Kiro follows a similar approach by generating a structured document with three sections:\n\nCurrent Behavior describes what's happening now: \"WHEN a user submits a form with special characters THEN the system crashes with a validation error.\" By being more comprehensive in this step, Kiro will better diagnose the conditions where the bug happens.\n\nExpected Behavior describes what should happen instead: \"WHEN a user submits a form with special characters THEN the system SHALL sanitize the input and process the form successfully.\" This tells Kiro what the solved state looks like so it can later check that it actually fixed the bug.\n\nUnchanged Behavior describes what must stay the same: \"WHEN a user submits a valid form THEN the system SHALL CONTINUE TO process it exactly as before.\" Instead of being implicit about what should not change, the Bugfix Spec explicitly states it. This helps Kiro check that regressions are not introduced and informs the property tests to validate.\n\nThis structure forces you to think explicitly about what changes and what doesn't, and helps the underlying model understand your intent more precisely. Kiro builds these sections for you automatically, you don't need to spend time writing this .md yourself. You can review and refine these conditions, then Kiro proceeds to create a design.md and tasks.md, just like a Feature Spec, but tailored for surgical fixes.\n\nWhat makes this work well is the unique way Kiro does testing. Kiro generates property-based tests (PBTs) for all three categories. Tests that verify the current implementation has the bug. Tests that verify your fix resolves it. And tests that verify unchanged behavior continues working exactly as before. Without these PBTs, it’s difficult to check if the agent actually fixed the bug for a comprehensive set of conditions, and that the changes were indeed surgical.\n\nBugfix Specs shine for complex bugs that benefit from structured problem-solving, situations where regression risk is high, or when you need documentation for your fix.\n\nSpecs changed the way many developers approach AI development to ship solid software. But when working with existing apps, especially over large codebases, you might prefer a different approach. Sometimes you begin with requirements, because you know exactly what you want to build. Sometimes you already know the technical approach, and it’s non-negotiable. Sometimes you're fixing a bug and need surgical precision because you don't want a regression to affect all your users. Now Specs support all three use cases.\n\nLearn",

So now we've got a plan B, I've got a bit of chalk and wax in the case from now on.\n\n\"I didn't have to use it this week at the Players Championship, it was fine, but it must have been the soap I used.\n\n\"That was the first time it's happened. It must be just whatever soap was in the toilet at Antwerp that I used and it just obviously took all the oils out of my finger and lost all grip.\"\n\nWorld number nine Rock admitted his natural reaction to his struggles against seven-time champion Van Gerwen was to \"laugh straight away\" because he \"knew what the problem was\".\n\nHe has now put that performance down to misfortune and moved on as he prepares to take on world number two Luke Humphries in night three of the competition in Glasgow on Thursday before competing in front of a home crowd in Belfast on 26 February.\n\n\"If I played like that and didn't know what the problem was then, obviously we have an issue,\" he added.\n\n\"But I knew I couldn't grip my hands and no matter how much I was trying to lick my fingers, rub my finger up and down a barrel to get my fingers rough, it wasn't working, so I just let that one go.\"",

    "description": "Without snow in the mountains, the places that depend on the West’s rivers will hurt for water.",
    "fullText": "If you are reading this on the East Coast, congratulations on the warmer weather you’re finally getting this week. It was cold and snowy for a while there. Here in the West, we wish we’d been in your shoes. Spare a thought for the tens of millions of us who live on the other side of the continent, where a catastrophe is unfolding.\n\nIn Colorado, where I live and grew up, this winter has been especially warm and dry. Last year closed with the warmest December in the history of recordkeeping. It was 8.9 degrees warmer than the average from 1991 to 2020, and the warmest of all in a record that goes back to the late 19th century. Over this past weekend, my neighbors and my family walked with our dogs and our kids in T-shirts and shorts, because it was in the mid-60s in Colorado Springs. About 60 miles north, my family in Denver saw a new record high of 68 degrees—on February 15.\n\nBut temperatures are not the only reason this winter is a catastrophe. This year, our snowpack is among the lowest ever measured, which means it won’t be enough to fill the rivers that are born in our mountains, which feed  reservoirs and water farms from here to Los Angeles. Snow is finally coming to the mountains this week, but we still cannot avoid one of the worst water years in modern history. The West is already experiencing the worst drought we have seen in 1,200 years, as our junior senator, John Hickenlooper, reminded me in an email over the weekend. Colorado politicians have to be attuned to these dynamics: “The snowpack is pretty much as large as all of our reservoirs combined. That’s why winters like this one are so terrifying,” he wrote. Drought can mean economic disaster.\n\nHickenlooper, who was also the state’s governor and the mayor of Denver, is not a man given to hyperbole. It really is that dire. Unless a lot of snow falls soon, Colorado’s environment and economy will take a huge hit. Ski resorts are losing money now. In the spring, rivers that usually offer waist-high whitewater rapids and fishing pools will instead be a trickle; in the summer, farmers will lose peach crops. Hydrologists, fire scientists, and climate researchers are bracing for summer too; their spectrum of worry ranges from concern to actual panic.\n\n“It’s as bad as you think it is,” Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, told me. On top of the ongoing, decades-long drought in the region, all of Colorado is in a snow drought too. The amount of water stored in the snowpack is the lowest it’s been at this point in winter since at least 1987, when comprehensive measurements began, he said. Going back to older records, some of which date from the Dust Bowl, the 2025–26 water year is the third-worst ever measured. In the two worse years, snowpack measured about 40 to 42 percent of average at this point in winter; this year, Colorado is sitting around 58 percent of median overall, and lower in some areas.\n\nClimatologists say that a weak La Niña pattern in the Pacific is partly to blame, parking a high-pressure “heartbreak ridge” farther east than usual, which continually pushes moisture away from the mountains. But the abysmal snowpack is also causing a bad feedback loop, allowing the mountains to warm more than usual. The pattern could finally break this week, and “we definitely have time to make up ground,” Allie Mazurek, a climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center, told me. But she also cautioned that “at this stage, it is looking almost impossible for us to get back to an average snowpack.”\n\nSchumacher’s predecessor, the longtime state climatologist Nolan Doesken, used to say that Colorado’s snowmelt is well behaved. Rain comes in a flash and is gone just as quickly, but we know where snow falls, where it will lie in wait, and which rivers it will feed months later. Flakes accumulate on cold ground, and when the Rockies stay cold the way they should, the snow remains for many months. And the surrounding air stays colder with snowpack than without it. This winter, temperatures are soaring 10 to 12 degrees above normal in northwestern Colorado—temperatures that region would not be seeing if the ground were covered in snow, Mazurek said.\n\nWestern water monitors use a metric called snow water equivalent, which is just what it sounds like, to estimate how much water will flow into rivers when the snow melts. Since 1987, the Snowpack Telemetry Network, SNOTEL, has measured snowpack by weighing the snow that falls at hundreds of stations across the West, including more than 100 currently active ones in Colorado. Other measurements are taken by hikers who snowshoe up to designated spots and measure the snowpack by hand. Climate scientists have been doing this for decades. Last week, the snow water equivalent in the Colorado River basin was tied for the lowest ever recorded, according to Brad Udall, a senior water scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on the Colorado River.\n\nThat snowpack forms the headwaters of rivers including the Colorado, the Rio Grande, and the Arkansas. And the Colorado River feeds the two largest reservoirs in the United States: Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Both reservoirs are critically low and have been for years: Powell is about 25 percent full, and Mead is at about 34 percent. If Powell’s water level drops another 40 or so feet, which it could this year, there won’t be enough water to generate hydroelectric power at Glen Canyon Dam. Water managers are starting to worry about “dead pool” too, in which the lake will get too low to let water flow through Glen Canyon toward Lake Mead; they are likely to reduce water flow out of Powell this year to avoid it.\n\nIn most of the Colorado River’s upper basin—in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming—water is not collected in many reservoirs; instead, it is diverted out to thousands of small locations, from streams to irrigation ditches. And “this year, there just isn’t going to be any water in these rivers. Or there will be water, but instead of 12 weeks or 16 weeks of water, it will be four weeks of water,” Udall told me. “Under western water law, people can basically completely dry these rivers up.”\n\nThis is bad timing, because Colorado and the other basin states are currently failing to renegotiate key parts of the more-than-century-old Colorado River Compact, which expire later this year. Along with seven states, the river-management agreement includes the federal Bureau of Reclamation, 30 tribal nations, and Mexico, and controls how the river flows into and out of Lakes Powell and Mead. The states missed a major deadline on February 14, which means that the Bureau of Reclamation will instead impose its own plan—one that none of the states are likely to be happy with. In Colorado, at least, some residents are concerned that the Trump administration will punish the solidly blue state by simply giving more water to, say, Arizona, which Donald Trump won in 2024. This is far from an irrational worry. In late December, Trump vetoed funding for a pipeline, already under construction with bipartisan support, that would bring water from a reservoir to rural communities in southeastern Colorado. The fight over the Colorado River could shape up in similar fashion, pitting state against state. (In response to a request for comment, a Department of the Interior spokesperson pointed me to a press release in which Secretary Doug Burgum said that the department had “listened to every state’s perspective” and that a “fair compromise with shared responsibility remains within reach.”)\n\nFurther in the future, the effects of water reductions will spill through the western economy. Agriculture, water recreation such as fishing and river rafting, and entire mountain ecosystems—both environmental and economic—will falter. For now, though, we are worrying about our trees budding six weeks too early, and pouring buckets of water around their trunks to keep them hydrated in the warmth. We are updating our fire checklists and go bags during red-flag warnings: One went up yesterday as I was working on this story. Winter fire watches are abnormal, but we are growing all too accustomed to them. And we are checking the snow forecast every day.",

    "description": "Newcastle's Anthony Gordon only had one thought in his mind as his side faced Qarabag in the Champions League...",
    "fullText": "Anthony Gordon had already scored a hat-trick.\n\nBut the ruthless Newcastle United forward only had one thought in his mind at the Tofig Bahramov Republican Stadium.\n\nGordon had just won his side a penalty against Qarabag in the first leg of their last 16 Champions League play-off tie, and he was not about to hand the ball over after Kieran Trippier felt Nick Woltemade should get a chance to take the spot-kick.\n\nIt brought back one or two memories of the single-mindedness of Newcastle's greatest ever goalscorer, Alan Shearer.\n\nIn fact, after already netting four goals against Sheffield Wednesday, in 1999, Shearer told striker Paul Robinson where to go after his team-mate asked him if he could take a spot-kick.\n\nSo it was rather fitting that this was a night where Gordon overtook the Newcastle legend as the club's all-time top scorer in the Champions League with 10 goals.\n\n\"We should be in it together,\" Gordon told TNT Sports after netting four goals in his side's 6-1 victory.\n\n\"But I'm an attacker. I'm the penalty taker, so I want to score as many goals as I possibly can.\"\n\nQarabag, in truth, played right into Gordon's hands.\n\nThis side had previously drawn against Chelsea and defeated Benfica, Eintracht Frankfurt and Copenhagen.\n\nBut the sight of the rapid Gordon playing further forward than Woltemade appeared to catch Qarabag a little cold.\n\n\"I have to say I was surprised by how high Qarabag defended, and how they kept a high line in the first half when the Newcastle goals were going in,\" he said.\n\n\"I was thinking, 'are they not watching Newcastle and their recent games?' Because why did they allow so much space for Gordon, who was brilliant all evening?\"\n\nGordon has impressed in such a role away from home in recent weeks - opening the scoring at Anfield last month and setting up Jacob Ramsey's winner against Spurs last week.\n\nHe gives Eddie Howe's side something different through the middle with his movement and pace, and the Azerbaijan Premier League champions could not cope.\n\n\"I think he's been really good in that position,\" Howe said. \"Looking back to the Liverpool game, where I thought he was excellent, he scores.\n\n\"He's shown he wants to play there and then he's got the quality to play there. His pressing today was incredible for us. That gave us the platform to rebuild off of his work.\n\n\"Of course he's taken the four goals and will get the headlines, naturally, but his all-round game was really strong.\"\n\nGordon's first goal set the tone for Newcastle.\n\nIt only took the rapid forward two minutes to open the scoring after he beat the offside trap to latch on to Dan Burn's through ball before coolly picking out the bottom corner.\n\nHaving scored his second from the spot, to make it 3-0, Gordon's speed caused Qarabag problems once again from the restart just seconds later when he pounced on some slack play from defender Kevin Medina and rounded Mateusz Kochalski to score his hat-trick.\n\nOn a night Gordon spurned one or two opportunities from open play, there was no chance of him letting go of the ball when he won his side another spot-kick before the break.\n\nGordon stepped up and dispatched a second powerful penalty past goalkeeper Kochalski.\n\nIt was a night he smashed a number of records, including becoming the only Englishman to score three or more goals in a knockout stage game in the Champions League.\n\nNo wonder Gordon did not want to come off midway through the second half, as the watching Pat Nevin observed.\n\n\"He is actually gutted,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"Any striker would feel exactly the same. You know it's the right thing.\n\n\"You don't want to get injured. You know you need to rest, there's big games coming up. But you also know there's goals. He's taken it well, though.\"\n\nGordon left the field to the sound of his name being chanted by those delirious Newcastle supporters in the away end.\n\nThe travelling support embarked on a gruelling 2,500-mile trip to be there - the longest any English fan base had ever travelled in the Champions League.\n\nYou suspect it was worth it as they repeatedly sang about not wanting to go home in the closing stages.\n\nWhat a difference 10 days make.\n\nA crestfallen Howe admitted he was not doing his job \"well enough\" after his side were booed off following a bruising defeat against Brentford at St James' Park earlier this month.\n\nIt led to a brief period of soul searching and one or two home truths behind the scenes, and Newcastle have responded.\n\nA side who once suffered with travel sickness have now defeated Qarabag, Aston Villa and Spurs on the road in little more than a week.\n\n\"I'm so proud of everyone because football is a highly emotional place sometimes and it's very fickle,\" Gordon added.\n\n\"People get so down and so up on you depending on your form. To go through what we went through to the position we're in now is really important and shows the character we have.\n\n\"Football does change fast so we have to keep it going, keep the momentum, because it can go the other way just as fast.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "After blowing a two-goal lead to draw against the Premier League's bottom club Wolves, there will be no dodging the questions on whether Arsenal are mentally ready to end their 22-year wait to become champions.\n\nFor the first time really this season, the title race is not completely in the control of Mikel Arteta and his players.\n\nIf Manchester City - five points behind in second place - win all of their remaining 12 games, which includes a home meeting against Arsenal, they will finish first.\n\nThe same, though, can be said for the Gunners, who have 11 matches left - and they win the April encounter at Etihad Stadium.\n\nBut after dropping four crucial points in successive draws against Brentford and Wolves, they are in danger of being haunted by the ghost of past failures.\n\nThree successive runners-up finishes, two of them to Pep Guardiola's men, provide a constant reminder.\n\nFormer Arsenal forward Alan Smith admitted \"that word bottle will be used quite a bit in the next few days\".\n\nThe scenario seemed a lot different when Piero Hincapie slotted home his first goal for the club in the 56th minute, adding to Bukayo Saka's fifth-minute opener.\n\nBut the Gunners lacked the control and ruthlessness to finish off a Wolves side that had lost their nine previous meetings and are heading for the Championship.\n\nThe hosts showed remarkable spirit to fight back with Hugo Bueno's 20-yard curler giving them hope. Then, in the fourth minute of added time, 19-year-old Tom Edozie - off the bench for his senior debut - pounced on a mix-up between Arsenal pair David Raya and Gabriel and his shot went in off Riccardo Calafiori for a dramatic, dreamy leveller.\n\nArsenal next face London derbies with Tottenham and Chelsea and they have worryingly started to wobble at a decisive stage in the season.\n\nArteta knows his side will come under fire and scrutiny.\n\n\"Any opinion you have to take it on the chin,\" he said. \"Any bullet, take it, because we didn't perform at the level required.\n\n\"Anything anyone says can be right because we didn't do what we had to do. The way to do it is on the pitch on Sunday [against Spurs].\"\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards said his side \"knew there is a massive pressure\" on Arsenal at the minute - and they capitalised on that.\n\nThe Gunners have not been performing at their best since the start of 2026 and won only two of their last seven league matches, with victories against Leeds and Sunderland.\n\nArteta added: \"Certain basics we have to do, we did them so poorly, one after the other.\n\n\"It is better not to judge it. We are all too emotional about it. You have to take the hit because we deserve it. It is very easy with emotion to say things that can damage the team. Everyone wants to do their best.\"\n\nOnly Crystal Palace and West Ham (both eight) have dropped more points from winning positions in the league in 2026 than Arsenal (seven) and the Gunners have now failed to win from a leading position in three of their last five league games.\n\nThis was also the first time in Premier League history that a side starting the day bottom of the table avoided defeat to the leaders, despite trailing by two or more goals.\n\n\"It feels like a pivotal moment, a vital one, maybe a turning point,\" Smith added on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's in Manchester City's hands now. With their experience and Guardiola's experience they will really fancy it now. They can almost feel the nerves of the Arsenal team watching that.\n\n\"Having been 2-0 up against the team rock bottom on nine points is just not good enough for the team hoping to win the title. It doesn't bode well for Arsenal to be able to handle the pressure.\"\n\nPressure mounts as Arsenal blow two-goal lead to draw at Wolves\n\nThe result also meant Arsenal failed to win an away league game in which they had a two-goal lead for the first time since April 2023 at West Ham, stretching back 18 matches.\n\nForward Saka, who ended a 15-match goal drought in all competitions, said there was a \"big difference\" with how his side performed in the second half compared to the first.\n\n\"Disappointed, not much else to say,\" added the England international. \"We dropped our standards big time and we got punished for it.\"\n\nJust a day after signing a new five-year deal, he had put his side in front after playing in the No10 role again, but could only watch in dismay at the end having gone off in the 73rd minute after receiving treatment.\n\n\"It's very flat,\" added Saka. \"It's time for us to reflect on the last few performances and fix the issues immediately, so we can get back to winning games, go on a run and build momentum because we've lost that a bit right now.\"\n\n\"I just think we have to get back to our level. Do the basics right and we've got more than enough quality in this team to win games, especially in the games where we've been dropping points in recently. We need to fix that and that's all our focus is right now.\"\n\nWith a north London derby to follow at Tottenham on Sunday, Arsenal have to respond quickly.\n\nSpurs will have Igor Tudor at the helm and they will hope he can give them the 'new manager bounce' to add to the Gunners' misery.\n\nArteta admitted: \"We need to go through the pain, looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now on Sunday.\n\n\"Anything we say from here is fine but we need to keep it all in our tummies and show it on Sunday.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, bought the franchise in 1997, saving it from potentially being moved to Southern California.\n\nHe oversaw the Seahawks' first Super Bowl win in 2014 but died in 2018, aged 65, from complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nHis estate announced on Wednesday that it has \"commenced a formal sale process\" for the franchise \"consistent with Allen's directive to eventually sell his sports holdings and direct all estate proceeds to philanthropy\".\n\nAccording to Forbes, Allen paid $194m (£143.6m) for the Seahawks and the publication's most recent valuation was $6.7bn (£5bn) - making it the 14th most valuable franchise in the NFL.\n\nThe most recent NFL team sale saw the Washington Commanders purchased in 2023 by a group controlled by Josh Harris for a record $6.05bn (£4.5bn).\n\nThat was surpassed as the world's most expensive sports team purchase last year, when the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers were bought for $10bn (£7.5bn).\n\nAllen also owned the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. since his death, his sister Jody Allen has been executor of his estate, plus chair of the Seahawks and Trail Blazers.\n\nA sale of the Trail Blazers is already in progress with Tom Dundon, owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, having agreed a contract to buy the NBA team in a deal worth $4.25bn (£3.3bn).\n\nThe Allen estate has selected investment bank Allen & Company and law firm Latham & Watkins to lead the sale process of the Seahawks.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "A college student withdrew from consideration for a reporting role in our newsroom this week because of how we use artificial intelligence.\n\nIt reminded me again how college journalism programs are failing to prepare students for the workforce. I mentioned this in a column before, and readers asked me to explain.\n\nWe don’t generally hire straight out of college. We lack the resources for heavy training, so we look for experienced journalists who can hit the ground running. This role, however, is different. It includes a free master’s degree through online courses at Syracuse University. We will accept recent graduates.\n\nLike many students we’ve spoken with in the past year, this one had been told repeatedly by professors that AI is bad. We heard the same thing at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Cleveland in August. Student after student said it.\n\nThat’s backwards — and it seriously handicaps them as they begin their careers. I’ve written extensively about how we use AI to do more and better work. It has quickly become critical to everything we do, and to our success.\n\nThe job posting involves expanding local news coverage. Last year, we began covering Lorain, Lake and Geauga counties using powerful AI tools to help identify stories. Reporters Hannah Drown and Molly Walsh have uncovered a steady stream of compelling pieces, enriching our report. I choose nine stories each day for discussion on our Today in Ohio podcast, and their work regularly rises to the top.\n\nThe effort has been so successful we expanded it to Medina County this month. With the Syracuse fellowship, we hope to add northern Summit County in May.\n\nWe could not do this without AI. We once had large teams covering these counties. That’s no longer feasible.\n\nBecause we want reporters gathering information, these jobs are 100 percent reporting. We have an AI rewrite specialist who turns their material into drafts. We fact-check everything. Editors review it. Reporters get the final say. Humans — not AI — control every step.\n\nMost heartening, the experiment is proving the value of local journalism. Hannah Drown’s reporting in Lorain County has awakened residents, especially regarding a less-than-transparent county commission. People are paying attention and asking questions as never before.\n\nThink about that: An energized electorate, partly because of how we use AI.\n\nThe candidate who withdrew could not accept AI assisting with writing. It wasn’t a “sacrifice” they were willing to make for a foothold in a thriving newsroom.\n\nI don’t blame the candidate. I blame the school.\n\nJournalism programs are decades behind. Many graduating students have unrealistic expectations. They imagine themselves as long-form magazine storytellers, chasing a romanticized version of journalism that largely never existed.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not bad for newsrooms. It’s the future of them. It already allows us to be faster, more thorough and more comprehensible. It frees time for what matters most: gathering facts and developing stories to serve you.\n\nAnyone entering this field should be immersing themselves in AI.\n\nFortunately for those of us who know exactly what skills we need in applicants, AI has altered the landscape so dramatically that we don’t need journalism school grads. Before the Watergate era, many journalists did not have college degrees. They were just smart people who knew how to get information. They were naturals at talking to people. And they knew enough about how things worked to recognize news.\n\nThat’s what we need now. AI can help draft stories, but it cannot sit across from someone, make eye contact and build trust. The core skills today differ sharply from even a decade ago. We just need to be creative about where we recruit.\n\nIf you’re a student considering journalism, I’d skip that degree. Study political science. Learn technology. Understand how government, businesses and nonprofits work. Take communications law and ethics as electives. Skip much of the rest.\n\nWe need smart, inquisitive people who love to schmooze and find adventure in change. Be that.",

    "description": "The admission comes after former President Barack Obama went viral for claiming aliens are real",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, says the president has a speech pre-written and is ready to address the discovery of aliens.\n\nLara, 43, made the shocking claim in an episode of the New York Post’s Pod Force One podcast, published Wednesday, after she was asked about former President Barack Obama's apparent confirmation that aliens are real during an interview last weekend.\n\n“I believe I’ve heard on your podcast that you’ve discussed with the president these UFOs. Do you think that he’s about to make an announcement about UFOs, because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president?” host Miranda Devine asked.\n\n“What’s kind of funny is we’ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cause we’re like, ‘Well, what do you know?...”Lara began.\n\nHowever, the president reportedly “played a little coy” when she and her husband, his son, Eric Trump, inquired about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n“Eric and I were like, ‘Oh my gosh, he won’t even fully tell us, maybe there’s more to it,’” she said.\n\n“I have just heard kind of around that he’s actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don’t know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara added.\n\nHer comments come as Obama made a stunning admission over the weekend during an appearance on the No Lie With Brian Tyler Cohen podcast.\n\nWhen asked about extraterrestrials, Obama replied, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in — what is it? There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”\n\nThe Internet went wild over his admission that aliens are real, prompting the former commander-in-chief to take to Instagram to clarify his stance.\n\n“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify,” the former president wrote. “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”\n\n“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us,” he continued,\n\nDoubling down on his claim, he added, “Really!”\n\nIts long been speculated by many that aliens and UFOs are hidden at the mysterious Area 51 base in southern Nevada — and a documentary released last year suggested that Trump may soon confirm the existence of other life forms.\n\nIn The Age of Disclosure, director Dan Farah suggests that a massive government cover-up operation has concealed the existence of non-human intelligence, but that the cover-up will soon be exposed.\n\n“I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, ‘We're not alone in the universe,’” Farah told Entertainment Weekly in late November.\n\n“It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have.”\n\nDespite Farah’s claims, Trump has not yet shared a definitive answer about the existence of aliens since returning to office.",

    "description": "First in The Independent: A Congolese woman’s life is in ‘grave danger’ after ICE secretly flew her to an unknown African nation, according to an emergency motion filed in federal court",
    "fullText": "The life of a Congolese asylum seeker granted permission to stay in the United States is in “grave danger” after ICE secretly flew her to an unknown African nation, while the woman’s husband – a widely feared local politician who allegedly had her father shot dead as she watched – continues to hunt her across continents, according to a tranche of federal court documents reviewed by The Independent.\n\nIn addition to fearing for her own safety, “Jane Doe,” as she is referred to in legal filings, “hopes for the safety of her children, whose whereabouts are unknown to her because their father, her husband, is seeking to kill them and so they are in hiding, even to her,” states an emergency motion Doe’s attorneys filed Monday in Louisiana. “She hopes for the safety of her brother, who was kidnapped in Mexico by a cartel and she has not seen him since.”\n\nAt the age of 14, “Jane Doe” - as the devoutly Christian and former hairdresser in the Democratic Republic of Congo - was forced to become the African politician’s sixth wife in order to satisfy a family debt, according to the motion. For the next decade, Doe was physically and sexually abused by her husband and two of his sons, bearing four children while being “kept like a hostage,” says the motion, which seeks Doe’s immediate return to the U.S.\n\nIn late 2024, Doe managed to escape to her parents’ house, the motion goes on. But Doe’s politician husband quickly found her, brutalized her and her brother, ordered his bodyguards to execute her father in front of her, and burned the family home to the ground, the motion says. When Doe went to the police, they said her only option was to leave the country because “her abuser was too powerful and… they could not protect her,” according to the motion.\n\n“Ms. Doe went into hiding and fled the [Democratic Republic of Congo] with the help of her brother and his employer, who in secret obtained travel documents and plane tickets to Brazil,” it states. “Ms. Doe’s abuser continued to track her abroad. Within an hour of arriving in Brazil, Ms. Doe received a WhatsApp message from her abuser, stating he knew she was in Brazil and had ‘eyes everywhere.’ He threatened to kill her.”\n\nTerrified, Doe made her way through 12 different countries – even braving the notorious Darién Gap on foot – to get to the United States, where, the motion explains, “she believed human rights were respected.” It says Doe arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border on January 2, 2025, and immediately requested asylum. She was sent to the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, as her case was processed, and last June received permission to stay in the U.S. under a “withholding of removal” decision barring her deportation to DR Congo.\n\nHowever, that all changed on February 15, 2026, when ICE decided to send her to somewhere else.\n\nAttorneys for Doe say they were never contacted by authorities about their client’s sudden removal and “don’t even know where [ICE] disappeared [her] to yesterday in the dark of night.” Doe was loaded onto a deportation flight bound for Senegal, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana and Nigeria, without any further information provided, the affidavit states, adding, “Ms. Doe has no connections, resources, money or way of contacting anyone in the world.”\n\nThe motion contends that Doe’s “unlawful removal means her life is in grave danger.”\n\nDoe, according to a companion affidavit filed by one of her attorneys, is “an extraordinary woman.”\n\n“She has lived through extensive trauma, and despite that, she smiles on video calls with me and tells me how she’s learning to make bracelets in ICE detention,” it says. “She reads her Bible and leads Bible study among other women in her detention facility. She finds a way to continue to hold onto hope… She hopes for her future education to be able to study medicine, to work as a nurse, and one day to run an orphanage. She hopes to see the outside of the detention facility where she has lived in the United States of America for 13 months: January 2025 to now.”\n\nThe affidavit lauds Doe for fighting the June 2025 withholding of removal order, which the motion explains as “similar to asylum in that she proved it was more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of a protected ground if she were removed to the Democratic Republic of Congo and that the government there was unable or unwilling to protect her.”\n\nLast summer, ICE instructed officials that immigrants can be deported from the United States to countries other than their own with as little as six hours’ notice – or no notice at all.\n\nThat memo from ICE acting director Todd Lyons followed a Supreme Court decision that opened the door for ICE to send deportees to countries where they do not have citizenship, family or any other connections.\n\nICE has since spent more than $40 million and fought several legal battles over removals to far-flung nations where deportees have no connections whatsoever, including to several countries in Africa: Eswatini, Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda and South Sudan, among others.\n\nIn a June 2025 letter to authorities, filed as an exhibit in court, another attorney representing Doe wrote that she had been told ICE was considering Canada and Spain as possible third countries where they could deport her. However, her husband has family in both places, and could easily locate her there, the letter said. Guatemala, a third possibility floated by ICE, would be equally dangerous for Doe, who also speaks no Spanish, according to a follow-up letter.\n\nStill, immigration authorities denied Doe her right to a reasonable fear interview concerning any potential third country, which Monday’s motion calls an “extraordinary and illegal measure.”\n\n“Under our Constitution, this cannot stand,” the motion argues.\n\nThroughout, ICE has refused over the course of nearly nine months to communicate at all with Doe’s lawyers, according to the motion.\n\n“Defendants communicate – if at all – solely with [Doe]: a high school graduate with no legal training who is a native French speaker and knows only limited English,” it maintains. “... This does not provide Ms. Doe meaningful notice or opportunity to respond. By excluding counsel from the equation and refusing to engage with her attorneys, Defendants have committed abhorrent behavior violating Ms. Doe’s rights.”\n\nAt 11 p.m. on Valentine’s Day, Doe’s legal team was notified by a family member that Doe had been told she “was being ‘moved,’” the motion states. “She reportedly did not have any information or know whether this ‘move’ was a transfer to a different facility or a removal to a third country.”\n\nFinally, around 1 p.m., an ICE officer picked up the phone and said Doe had been flown out of the U.S. on a 4 a.m. flight dropping deportees off in five African countries, but “could not identify which… was her destination,” the motion states. The officer referred the attorneys to a pair of higher-ups, who also never responded to their queries, according to the motion.\n\nDoe’s lawyers argue the U.S. government has violated her Fifth Amendment right to due process, as well as a section of federal law that prohibits government agencies from”arbitrary or capricious” conduct.\n\nThey are demanding U.S. officials facilitate Doe’s return to the U.S., “without incident,” to release her upon entry, and to reimburse her for any costs incurred. Late Tuesday, a judge denied Doe’s motion and ordered her attorneys to refile their motion with additional specifics.\n\nDoe’s attorneys declined to comment on the record. An ICE spokesperson did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment.\n\nWith reporting by Alex Woodward",

They didn’t know where he was, what happened to him or if they would ever see him again.”\n\nYears later, in July 2009, human remains were found on property now known as Lake Hiawatha Preserve by a work crew clearing overgrowth, the Clermont Police Department said in a statement.\n\n“Forensic consultations with the University of Central Florida, the University of Florida, and the Fifth District Medical Examiner confirmed the remains were human and belonged to an adult male,” police continued. “Evidence was submitted for forensic and DNA analysis in 2009.\"\n\nHowever, despite an extensive investigation, police said the case went cold.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn June of last year, the medical examiner’s office received approval for a genetic genealogy grant through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Clermont Police said.\n\nWith approval from the police, the medical examiner’s office submitted the evidence from the case to Othram, which specializes in using DNA technology to solve cold cases — and on Dec. 29, investigators were notified that the remains belonged to Manzanares.\n\n“This identification reflects years of persistence and collaboration,” Clermont Police Captain Malcolm Draper said in a press statement. “Although the case grew cold, it was never forgotten. Advances in forensic science, combined with the dedication of our investigative partners, produced answers that were not possible in 2009.”\n\n“We are grateful that this identification brings some measure of closure to the Manzanares family,” added Ocoee Police Chief Vincent Ogburn. “They now have the opportunity to lay their loved one to rest.”\n\nGrogan said at Friday’s news conference that calling Manzanares’ daughter was bittersweet. “She was grateful to finally have answers and to bring her father home,” said Grogan. “But like any child, she had always held on to hope that her dad might walk back into her life one day.”\n\nAlthough unknown to investigators when he disappeared, Grogan said during the news conference that in 2022 she spoke with Manzanares' mom, who wanted to \"clear the air.\"\n\nGrogan said that according to his mom, before her son disappeared, the family was \"experiencing domestic violence\" and in addition to moving from Colorado to live with his family, Manzanares convinced his father, who has since died, to move out.\n\nHis mom also said that Manzanares allegedly heard that his father and another now-deceased relative were planning to sell his sister and niece, then 7 and 8, to a motorcycle gang they were members of.\n\n\"I think in this day and age you would call it human trafficking,\" Grogan said.\n\nWhen he left to confront them, Manzanares told his mother he planned to return later that night, leaving behind his wallet and jacket.\n\nWhen pressed for questions, Grogan said that at this point in their investigation, they have no additional answers about what may have happened to Manzanares.\n\nAn investigation remains ongoing.\n\nIf you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential. The hotline is available 24/7 in more than 170 languages.",

    "fullText": "A dozen speakers took to the microphone at the \"A Day Without an Immigrant\" rally on the front steps of University of Oregon's Johnson Hall on Feb. 16.\n\nThis was the third \"A Day Without an Immigrant\" demonstration in a series that will culminate on International Workers' Day on May 1.\n\nA couple hundred participants huddled together on the slope leading up to the university's administrative building, protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in Eugene and nationwide. Students, staff, faculty and community members called for UO leaders to take action by way of using the UO Alerts system to give notification when ICE is on or near campus.\n\n\"I'm scared, I'm angry, I'm exhausted, but now isn't the time to give in to despair,\" said Isabel E, a UO student with the UO Young Democratic Socialists of America. \"It's time to act, to fight back, and to demand that this university fulfills its ethical duty to protect its students, its faculty and its city.\"\n\nMultiple student groups helped organize the rally, including YDSA, UO's Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán (MEChA), UO Student Workers and Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation. Faculty and staff also were present along with representatives from the Party for Socialism and Liberation in Eugene.\n\nUO student and MEChA member Xiomara Andrade stepped up to speak on behalf of MEChA President Maria Gaspar. She spoke about the recent UO Alerts going out, including one sent on Feb. 9 about \"water gel beads,\" commonly known as Orbeez, being shot at pedestrians near campus. Andrade called the alert \"insulting.\" She criticized the university's lack of ICE alerts, saying UO's administration cares more about its public image than its students.\n\n\"We need these alerts and we need them now,\" Andrade said. \"(Students) are looking over their shoulders instead of focusing on their future. At MEChA, we work firsthand with our immigrant and Latino community every single day. We aren't just looking at data, we are looking into the eyes of our peers and seeing the fear rise daily.\"\n\nUO students also called for a Latine Cultural Center, a center intended specifically for the Hispanic and Latino student population, similar to the Black Cultural Center. While the Multicultural Center exists, students say that space fills up quickly and isn't large enough for collaboration between Latino-serving student groups on campus. Latino and Hispanic students are the second-largest demographic at UO after white students. According to UO data from winter 2026, 17% of undergrad students are Hispanic/Latino, compared to 60% of undergrads who are white.\n\nToby Cole, a UO transfer student involved in YDSA and MEChA, said he came to the rally, in part, to find community. Cole, who grew up in Southern California, said it was a huge shock at first coming to a predominantly white institution, but he has been able to find community through groups like MEChA. He said there are lots of Latino students and some faculty, but he'd like to see more resources organized by the university itself.\n\n\"Latino student presence is strong, and it's healthy, but we aren't given space to grow,\" Cole said. \"I think that's the main thing that we're really trying to fight for.\"\n\nCole said Latino faculty have been doing what they can to support students, but Cole would like to see a Latino student specialist in UO's mental health counseling office, similar to Dr. Cecile Gadson, who is the African American/Black student specialist staff psychologist.\n\nAt Monday's rally, Cole said it's been powerful to see they are not alone as they look at all their peers who feel the same fear, but are willing to take steps to make a change.\n\n\"There's a really big fear on campus, but there's also a lot of strength that's coming out,\" Cole said. \"There's a lot of solidarity. Students that aren't Latino, aren't immigrants, aren't people of color are also rallying together and saying, 'Hey, you're my neighbor, you're my classmate, you're my friend. I'm going to protect you.'\"\n\nMiranda Cyr reports on education for The Register-Guard.

    "description": "With proper planning, RMDs may be less of an issue.",
    "fullText": "Saving for retirement in a traditional IRA or 401(k), as opposed to a Roth, can seem like a good idea when you're eager to lower your tax bill. But traditional retirement plans come with a huge drawback. Not only are withdrawals subject to taxes, but you may eventually have to take withdrawals even if you don't want to.\n\nThose mandatory withdrawals are known as required minimum distributions, or RMDs. And they kick in at age 73 or 75, depending on the year you were born.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nRMDs can cause you a host of problems in retirement. Not only can they push you into a higher tax bracket, but they could also drive up the cost of your Medicare premiums by leaving you subject to surcharges known as IMRAAs, or income-related monthly adjustment amounts.\n\nThe good news? There's a step you can take to reduce your RMDs in retirement. But you'll need to plan ahead to pull it off.\n\nRoth conversions are a good option for getting out of RMDs or reducing them. But many people wait until the last minute to do a Roth conversion and end up moving a large sum of money at once out of a traditional retirement account. That tends to produce a very large tax bill.\n\nPlus, depending on your age, doing a large Roth conversion in a single year could put you at risk of Medicare IRMAAs. So a better bet may be to do your conversions over time.\n\nAnother option many people overlook? Rather than do a conversion, simply take withdrawals from your IRA or 401(k) before RMDs begin.\n\nLet's say you have to start taking RMDs at age 73 but you retire at 65. During that eight-year gap, you may have a fairly low income and therefore land in a fairly low tax bracket.\n\nIf you withdraw funds from your IRA or 401(k) during that time, you'll have less money subject to RMDs down the line. You can then reinvest the money you're withdrawing so it doesn't go to waste.\n\nIf you do those withdrawals during a fairly low-income year, not only might your tax bracket not rise too much, but you may not risk pushing your income into IRMAA territory. So all told, it's a strategy that could spare you a lot of financial pain.\n\nOne reason older people run into trouble with RMDs is that they wake up at the last minute and realize they're a year or two away from potentially large mandatory withdrawals. A better bet? Plan early.",

    "fullText": "Home Depot and Lowe’s have dominated the home improvement and hardware retail sectors for decades, continuing to rise above hardware cooperatives True Value Hardware and Ace Hardware, and making life even harder for independent hardware retailers.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has also surpassed True Value and Ace as the No. 3 destination for home improvement products.\n\nHome Depot captured an average of 28% of the home improvement market sales in 2025, while Lowe’s followed with 17% of the market, and Amazon had about 11% of sales, according to the Numerator Home Improvement Tracker, which was updated on Feb. 4.\n\nWith Home Depot, Lowe's, and Amazon holding a combined 56% of the market's sales last year, the hardware cooperatives and independent retailers have had a difficult time competing and remaining in business.\n\nAce, True Value, and independent hardware stores are a convenient source for tools and other home improvement products for me, as I can quickly navigate a smaller store for my needs as opposed to much larger big-box stores.\n\nAnd I find that the employees at the smaller stores near me have often worked at the stores for years and have a quick answer for my needs.\n\nHowever, even long-time community hardware stores that have operated for over 50 years are struggling to stay open.\n\nIndependent hardware store C&H Hardware of Yakima, Wash., which operated for 65 years, had enough problems competing against the hardware and home improvement chain giants, but the store could not compete against lower online prices and shut down permanently in November 2025.\n\n\"This year has been tough because everybody’s buying online now,” C&H store owner Jay Fleck said before shutting his doors permanently. “You can get stuff online cheaper than you can come in and pay us.”\n\nFleck said business was good at C&H before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, but business deteriorated afterward.\n\n“It was smooth until Covid hit,” Fleck said. “Of course, we were fortunate to have stayed open. A lot of other places had to shut down. So, we’ve done pretty good through Covid. And after that, it was kind of over. It’s been a downhill slide ever since.”\n\nAnd now, 53-year-old Home Depot rival Blossom True Value Hardware will close its doors for the final time in summer 2026 when its lease expires.\n\nThe Mountain View, Calif.,-based hardware store will permanently close, after suffering a loss of about half of its business since the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, longtime store owner Paul Zeitman told Mountain View Voice.\n\n\"Every year is worse than before. People are buying less and less,\" Zeitman said.\n\nZeitman explained that the store's monthly rent is reasonable but is no longer affordable.\n\nThe store owner said that Blossom True Value was allowed to remain open during the pandemic as an essential business and benefited from people buying hardware and home improvement goods to fix up their homes until the pandemic subsided.\n\nBankrupt restaurant chains permanently close popular locations\n\nMajor retail chain closes 35 stores nationwide, no bankruptcy\n\nAnother major retail chain closes warehouse operations\n\nThe retailer lost half its business as regular customers moved away, and e-commerce expanded further since the end of the pandemic, according to Mountain View Voice.\n\nThe store owner said Ace Hardware's expansion and opening of new stores in the region also cut into the retailer's business.\n\nZeitman said the final factor in the decision to close down was rising tariffs.\n\nMuch of Blossom True Value's merchandise is imported from China, and has been affected by the Trump administration's higher tariffs that have increased prices and cut into profits, while sales have also dropped, he said.\n\nRetailer distress has been blamed on high rents and labor costs, online shopping, and competition from big-box retailers, according to Mountain View City Councilman John McAlister, who is also Blossom's retail neighbor.\n\nHome Depot and Lowe's closest stores to Mountain View are in neighboring Sunnyvale, Calif.\n\nHome Depot, 28% of sales in 2025",
