The schools that were denied were Classen SAS, Guymon, John Marshall, Northwest Classen and U.S. Grant in 5-4 votes.\n\nThe board has 15 members, but two — Dudley Darrow of Enid and Brad Herzer of Oklahoma City — recused themselves in each vote. The four others who make up the 15 were not present.\n\nAll of the programs requesting to go independent have been struggling to be competitive, with many low on numbers compared to their opponents.\n\nAll of the programs that were approved of competing as independents were winless this past season.\n\nIt was a major struggle for the programs that were denied, as well. Classen SAS went 0-10 and John Marshall finished 2-8 while competing as Class 5A schools, Northwest Classen had a 2-9 record and U.S. Grant went 3-7 while in Class 6A-II and Guymon finished 5-5 as an independent.\n\nNick Sardis covers high school sports for The Oklahoman.

    "fullText": "With no Henri Veesaar or Caleb Wilson in the starting lineup, the Tar Heels need contributions from virtually everyone else on their roster.\n\nWe're not talking about Zayden High or Jarin Stevenson, who are doing a respectable job filling in down low. In the case of this story, we're looking at North Carolina's backcourt.\n\nDuring UNC's lopsided, 82-58 loss at NC State on Tuesday night, the backcourt struggled mightily. Luka Bogavac, who the Tar Heels recruited for his international experience, sweet shot and ability to pour in 15 points on any given night, scored just nine points against the Wolfpack.\n\nSeth Trimble, North Carolina's captain and senior guard, contributed just four points on 1-of-9 shooting – and two made free throws. This continues a recent hot-and-cold stretch for Trimble, who scored 19 points against Pitt, just four at Miami (FL) and 16 vs. Duke.\n\nDerek Dixon struggled with his shot the most of any UNC backcourt member, making just two of 12 attempts, while Jonathan Powell and Jaydon Young combined for 14 points off the bench. Kyan Evans took just two shots in 15 minutes, while Isaiah Denis played two minutes.\n\nPost production is how the 2025-26 Tar Heels get most of their scoring, a stark contrast from 2024-25, which featured a guard-heavy lineup and undersized big men. North Carolina has plenty of talented guards on its current team, but they have to play consistently for team victories.\n\nI'm not talking every UNC guard scoring 10+ points on a given night, though that is a dream. Whether assists, taking better care of the basketball, getting higher-percentage looks or something else, guard play will dictate the Tar Heels' success, particularly as they face extensive roster injuries.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball: Guards have to play consistent for additional wins",

    "description": "Finnish scoring sensation Jesse Kiiskinen eyes a North American pro debut. Could his dynamic talent ignite the Griffins' playoff push?",
    "fullText": "The Grand Rapids Griffins may be getting some reinforcements soon, as one of the team’s quietly rising prospects could be on the verge of making the jump to professional hockey in North America. Finnish forward Jesse Kiiskinen, currently playing in Finland’s Liiga, may finally be heading to the Griffins as the Finnish season nears its conclusion.\n\nKiiskinen was acquired by the Detroit Red Wings in June 2024, along with a second-round pick, in exchange for defense prospect Andrew Gibson. While initially considered a quiet addition, Kiiskinen quickly emerged as a notable name in the Red Wings’ prospect pipeline following a breakout 2024–25 season. He recorded 44 points in 46 games with HPK, demonstrating a natural scoring touch that caught the attention of fans and scouts alike.\n\nKiiskinen also made an impact on the international stage, representing Finland at the World Junior Championships. In seven games, he tallied six goals and one assist, underscoring his potential as a dynamic offensive presence.\n\nJesse Kiiskinen \nGoal🚨 on the power play#LGRW pic.twitter.com/U636I9lzsd\n\n— Red Wings Prospects (@LGRWProspects) February 17, 2026\n\nThis season, Kiiskinen has been less prolific, posting 24 points in 45 games, but scouts and analysts note that while his scoring ability remains, the broader aspects of his game are still developing. With HPK sitting outside the playoff picture with a 14-6-8-23 record, and just nine regular-season games left through March 17, the timing could allow Kiiskinen to make the jump to North America.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Detroit Red Wings team site to stay connected to the latest news, game-day coverage, and player features.\n\nThe Griffins’ season extends until April 19, which opens the possibility for Kiiskinen to join the team for a few games before the season concludes. Such a move would provide a glimpse into how the Red Wings’ trade for Gibson might ultimately be evaluated.\n\nJesse Kiiskinen GOAL🚨 rips it past Trey Augustine. Prospect on prospect crime. #LGRW pic.twitter.com/Xiimc3zAj7\n\n— Red Wings Prospects (@LGRWProspects) January 6, 2025\n\nGibson, who made his professional debut this past season, posted seven points and a plus-three rating in 44 games with the Milwaukee Admirals, part of the Nashville Predators organization.\n\nAdding Kiiskinen could inject some excitement into the Griffins’ roster late in the year to hopefully help sustain their epic run this season while giving the young Finnish winger valuable North American experience.\n\nNever miss a story by adding us to your Google News favorites!\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "Cade Smith will not be competing in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, instead focusing on the Cleveland Guardians' upcoming season.",
    "fullText": "Three years ago, before Cade Smith made his Major League debut or even threw a pitch for the Cleveland Guardians, he had the opportunity to compete for his home country of Canada in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n\nSince then, Cade has established himself as one of the best high-leverage relievers in MLB, and for the first time in his career, enter the season as Cleveland’s closer.\n\nHowever, Smith is not playing for Team Canada in the 2026 WBC. It was a decision that he recently told Foul Territory was his own as he heads into\n\n“It was my decision [to not play in the WBC], Cade said.\n\n“In ‘23, it was a phenomenal experience. Like, that was my first experience pitching in major league stadiums in front of sold-out crowds and that kind of environment. I had so much fun and enjoyed that. So, just this year, being at, kind of where things are architecturally, I didn't feel that it was wise for me to take that time away. I wanted to make sure that I was here and completely present and focused on the year coming up.”\n\nThe 2026 season will be Smith’s last year on a minimum MLB contract before his arbitration eligibility next winter. Considering that through his first two years, Smith has a 2.42 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, and 17 saves under his belt, he is in line for quite a large payday, even in his first year in the arbitration process.\n\nThat inevitable payday is contingent on one thing, though: health.\n\nSmith has pitched in 150 games through his first two big-league seasons. That’s a heavy workload for any pitcher in MLB, let alone one with an average fastball velocity of 96.4 mph.\n\nIt’s hard to blame Cade if he didn’t want to compete in the WBC because of this high workload, and solely focus on the upcoming season.\n\nPerhaps three years from now, in the 2029 WBC, Cade will get another chance to rep Candada, but for now, he’s concentrated on the Guardians.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

Senior forward Hannah Stuelke also notched her seventh double-double of the season and the 18th of her career with 14 points and 16 rebounds.\n\nAgainst the Cornhuskers, sophomore center Avav Heiden dominated en route to a career-high-tying 27 points on 12-for-15 from the floor and 3-for-3 from the charity stripe, along with to go along with her 11 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 blocks, and 1 steal. As a result, this was the 6-foot-4 Sherwood, Ore., native's sixth double-double of the season. Sophomore guard Taylor Stremlow also added a career-high 17 points on top of Heiden's sensational effort.\n\nDespite the wins this past week, Iowa remains at the No. 12 spot in this week's Coaches Poll.\n\nIn addition to Iowa, six other Big Ten squads are within the updated Top 25. NO. 2 UCLA leads the group, followed by No. 5 Michigan, No. 10 Ohio State, No. 15 Maryland, No. 16 Michigan State, and No. 23 Minnesota.\n\nNebraska is the lone conference representative in the receiving votes category, earning just 1 vote.\n\nIowa will have two matchups this week to improve its standing in the next Coaches Poll, as the Hawkeyes travel to Purdue on Feb. 19, before returning home for \"Senior Day\" against No. 5 Michigan on Feb. 22.

    "description": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the […]",
    "fullText": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the place. And with the Minnesota Vikings holding the 18th overall pick, NFL.com’s Daniel Jeremiah believes Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores will scoop a Harrison Smith replacement: Oregon safety Dillon Thieneman.\n\nNFL.com ties Minnesota to Thieneman as the Smith succession plan, signaling a 2026 secondary transition.\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether Smith will retire, but if so, Thieneman might have the juice to fill his shoes.\n\nAnother mock draft for the Vikings — more defense.\n\nJeremiah: Thieneman to Vikings at No. 18\n\nBecause Lewis Cine didn’t pan out and the fact that Smith may indeed retire soon, Minnesota will need a safety for the long haul. Jeremiah thinks Thieneman is the right guy.\n\nHe wrote Tuesday, “After studying Thieneman’s impressive 2025 tape at Oregon, I went back and watched the film from his career at Purdue, where he played in 2023 and ’24. His range and playmaking skills were evident back then, too. He would be an excellent replacement for Harrison Smith.”\n\nJeremiah continued the defensive trend for the Vikings’ spot in mock drafts. Most editions have the club selecting a defensive back or defensive lineman.\n\nThieneman is 6’0 and 200 pounds and will turn 22 in August. He’s known for his versatility at safety, which sounds like a page from the Smith playbook. His ball-tracking is elite for a rookie prospect, and he is known for high football IQ. NFL.com recently compared him to Jevon Holland, a safety for the New York Giants.\n\nA to Z Sports‘ Rob Gregson on Thieneman: “You turn on three years’ worth of tape from Thieneman, and it just gets better and better. After bursting on to the scene as a true freshman in 2023, where he recorded six interceptions, Thieneman then led the Big-10 in tackles in 2024, before doing a little bit of everything for the Ducks in 2025.”\n\n“You’re betting on instincts and explosion with Thieneman. He may not be elite laterally and challenged in terms of his man coverage projection, but if you need a player who can play the high post, poach the middle as a robber, and align as a box safety for a plus one help in the run game, Thieneman is your guy.”\n\nNFL.com’s Lance Zierlein: “Savvy three-year starter with NFL size, speed and alignment versatility. Thieneman is an extension of his defensive coordinator, aligning and adjusting the secondary to motion and pre-snap shifts. He’s an instinctive, rangy safety who can roll down into big nickel or robber positioning.”\n\n“He has a good feel for play design and route concepts in zone but has average change of direction to match breaks in man. He’s not a big thumper near the line, but he rushes into the action with a relentless pursuit that should allow him to keep stacking high scores in the tackle columns. Thieneman checks important boxes for teams looking to add versatile playmakers in the secondary.”\n\nThe 2026 Safeties + a Smith Verdict\n\nIf one pretends that Smith will indeed retire, Minnesota’s safety group would look like this in 2026 with Thieneman:\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, as of February 18th, there’s been no official retirement announcement from Smith, which is a bit odd. He can still call it quits, but with each day that passes, Smith is more likely to return for Year No. 15, especially with Flores back in the saddle as the defensive coordinator.\n\nThieneman ranks No. 37 on the Consensus Big Board at the time of this article’s publication. He might be a 2nd-Round commodity. If the Vikings don’t reach and pick him at No. 18, the team’s draftboard might resemble this, based on the best player available and long-term roster need:\n\nEmmanuel McNeil-Warren (S, Toledo)\n\nKayden McDonald (DT, Ohio State)\n\nJordyn Tyson (WR, Arizona State)\n\nThe NFL draft is about nine weeks away. Minnesota has at least nine picks line up this cycle — four more than last year, when the club had a skimpy cupboard due to the expensive Dallas Turner trade in 2024.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEver since we heard the news that Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans will be returning in 2026, but will be exploring his options, naturally, many think that means he will play elsewhere.\n\nOf course, that is entirely true, and it has allowed the thought process to begin about which Super Bowl-contending teams could be interested in his services.\n\nBut for Buccaneers fans, the thought of Evans, a franchise great, not only playing for a different team for the first time in his career, but potentially winning a Super Bowl, isn't something they want to think about.\n\nHowever, Sports Illustrated's Karl Rasmussen offered up one sentence from his piece on Evans' landing spots that might soothe the nerves.\n\n\"Just because Evans is going to explore his options in free agency doesn’t mean his departure is inevitable,\" Rasmussen wrote.\n\nMore:Chiefs could pull off incredible free agency move for Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe biggest thing is, does Evans want to return to chase a Super Bowl? Because if so, then his time in Tampa is likely over, as Todd Bowles' team isn't in the hunt right now.\n\nBut if he wants to keep playing football with the franchise that gave him his start, and that he loves with all his heart, along with the locker room, then Tampa Bay wins the tug of war.\n\nWith reports stating Evans is set to meet with the Buccaneers in the coming weeks, there's a chance he remains a Buc in 2026.\n\nBut until that move is made official, the option that he moves on remains a very real possibility.\n\nESPN analyst makes stunning call on future of Chiefs' Travis Kelce\n\nBills face huge $19 million decision on underrated star\n\nPatriots named as potential landing spot for $25 million sack monster\n\n2 huge free agency decisions set to impact Bills' Josh Allen\n\nAnalyst urges Ravens not to make 'stupid' offseason move\n\nAnalyst ripped to shreds over embarrassing Mike Evans Buccaneers Super Bowl take\n\nWill Ravens' Lamar Jackson need Superman cape under new OC?",

    "fullText": "SAN ANTONIO – The Phoenix Suns have emerged from the NBA All-Star break healthy as they have no one listed on their injury report due to an injury.\n\nThe Suns (32-23) face the San Antonio Spurs (38-16) Thursday, Feb. 19, at Moody Center on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin. They are seventh in the Western Conference while the Spurs are second.\n\nGrayson Allen (right knee sprain) and Isaiah Livers (left shoulder sprain) suffered injuries against the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 5 and sat out the next three games going into the NBA All-Star break.\n\nThey were scheduled for a re-evaluation after the break.\n\nThe Suns will be without Dillon Brooks, who will serve a one-game suspension Thursday for picking up his 16th technical foul in a Feb. 11 loss to defending NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n\"He said I'm playing victim all the time. When I don't play the victim, I'm a bad guy. Choose one.\"\n\nDillon Brooks on a conversation with lead official James Williams during Suns loss to OKC.\n\nNow has 16 technical fouls. If it stands, he'll receive 1-game suspension. #Suns pic.twitter.com/XL1A9QRal0\n\n— Duane Rankin (@DuaneRankin) February 12, 2026\n\n“He knows his technical situation,” Suns general manager Brian Gregory said Feb. 18. “We've had plenty of sit-downs and talks. He also knows how important he is for us to be on the court. So, I think with that, I think he understands exactly where he's at.”\n\nBrooks leads the NBA in technical fouls this season. Each two additional technical fouls will result in a one-game suspension (18th, 20th, 22nd, etc.).\n\nJalen Green isn’t on the injury report as he participated in workouts and improved his conditioning during the All-Star break.\n\n“Yeah, he's in a good spot right now,\" Gregory said. \"You know, injuries, unfortunately, are part of this league, and he's done an unbelievable job. His spirit on a daily basis in terms of attacking the rehab, attacking the recovery, attacking the workouts has been spot on from Day 1.”\n\nGreen has played only seven games this season, mostly due to a right hamstring injury, after playing every game the previous two seasons with the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe explosive 6-4 guard played in two of Phoenix’s last three games before the break after suffering a left hip contusion Jan. 30 against Cleveland that sidelined him three games.\n\nCole Anthony remains listed on the team’s injury report as “not with team.” Sources informed The Arizona Republic last week the Suns were looking to waive Anthony.\n\nThe Suns acquired Amir Coffey and Anthony from the Milwaukee Bucks in a three-team deal sent Nick Richards to the Chicago Bulls and Nigel Hayes-Davis to the Bucks before the Feb. 5 trade deadline.\n\nHave opinions about the current state of the Suns?

The Royals had him all over the field, playing first base, second base, third base, two outfield positions and designated hitter.\n\nIn 69 major league at-bats with the Royals, Biggio slahed .174/.296/.246 with a .543 OPS and a 55 OPS+. Biggio also tallied 12 hits along with one home run and four RBIs.\n\nThe seven-year veteran reported to camp on Sunday and spoke about his excitement to get a chance with the Astros.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it was a big dream of mine, but the Astros, I loved that team more than anything growing up,” Cavan said. “Those teams growing up, I could name every player on those teams. This organization has always been very special for me, and it’s an absolute honor to don the uniform now.”\n\nCavan is the son of long-time Astors infielder, Craig Biggio. Craig played his entire 20-year career with the Astros and is the franchise’s leader in games played, at-bats, hits, runs, total bases, doubles and extra-base hits.\n\nCavan was the ball boy when Craig reached 3,000 career hits in 2007, alongside his brother, Conor.\n\n“That last year was something that obviously was truly special for us,” Craig said. “It was something that playing your whole career here with one team and one organization and being able to achieve a milestone like that in front of your fans and in front of your family and having your boys in the dugout as bat boy because they were old enough to do it, it was very special.”\n\nBiggio spent 30 games with the Dodgers in 2024. In 73 at-bats, the Houston native slashed .192/.306/.329 with a .635 OPS. He also recorded 14 hits, three home runs, 10 RBIs and 11 runs in his brief stint in L.A.\n\nHe was released in early August 2024 after he was traded to L.A. from the Toronto Blue Jays in June of that season.",

    "description": "Lars Nootbaar is at the team's spring training complex with his future with the organization in doubt",
    "fullText": "In the last year, almost every established veteran on the St. Louis Cardinals roster has been linked to trade rumors.\n\nThere was fire to a lot of smoke behind those rumors. Closer Ryan Helsley, starting pitcher Sonny Gray, first baseman/catcher Willson Contreras, second baseman Brendan Donovan and third baseman Nolan Arenado have all been dealt by the Cardinals in the last year.\n\nEven for the players who didn't or haven't been traded yet, those rumors haven't gone unnoticed.\n\nOutfielder Lars Nootbaar arrived to the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Fla., on Wednesday. Nootbaar was late reporting to camp due to the team not having a piece of equipment he needed to keep his rehab on schedule.\n\nAccording to a post on \"X\" from Jeff Jones of the Belleville News-Democrat, Nootbaar heard from his representation this offseason about the possibility of being dealt.\n\nDespite the injury and recovery, Nootbaar did acknowledge that he heard consistently from his reps throughout the winter about the possibility of his being moved. So, we’ll see how that works out.\n\n— Jeff Jones (@jmjones) February 18, 2026\n\nIt looks like the potential of being traded is still on the table for Nootbaar, who's currently recovering from surgery to repair a condition in his heels.\n\nNootbaar underwent a procedure in October to correct a condition in both of his heels. He was reportedly dealing with Haglund's deformities, which is a bone deformity that causes pain, enlargement and inflammation.\n\nAccording to Jones' report, Nootbaar has been able to throw and hit but is just getting around to being able to run without aid.\n\nIt's still unclear when Nootbaar will be able to compete in games.\n\nLast season, Nootbaar slashed .234/.325/.361 with a .686 OPS and hit 24 doubles, a triple and 13 home runs with 48 RBIs in 135 games.\n\nNootbaar's games played, hits, RBIs and doubles were all single-season career-highs for the 28-year-old, who made his major league debut in 2021. In the same breath, his on-base percentage, slugging percentage and OPS were all single-season career-lows.\n\nLars Nootbaar makes an UNBELIEVABLE catch in the 9th 😱 pic.twitter.com/7H3QMYGpTX\n\nNootbaar is currently under his second year of arbitration and is set to earn $5.25 million in 2026. He has one more year or arbitration for 2027 before he'll be a free agent ahead of the 2028 season.\n\nSt. Louis has moved on from the aforementioned veterans in efforts of building assets who can contribute and become focal points for the Cardinals' rebuilt roster.\n\nNootbaar is still relatively young and St. Louis will need some veterans to balance out the growing amount of young players who are expected to become faces of the franchise. Time will tell if Nootbaar will be one of those veterans of the future or another player that Cardinals choose to cut ties with.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "Manchester United are gearing up for a huge summer, and, according to the latest reports, INEOS have grand plans in mind.\n\nThe midfield is in the most urgent need of reinforcements, with as many as two additions possible, while the team also needs cover at the back and possibly a left-sided winger.\n\nAll this is going to cost a bomb, and according to The Daily Mail‘s Chris Wheeler, the Red Devils have devised two sets of targets, contingent on where the club finishes at the end of the season.\n\nFinishing within the Champions League places and trimming a bloated wage bill while also getting rid of the deadwood would transform United’s capability in the market.\n\nThe 20-time English league champions could raise as much as £100 million through player sales, with the likes of Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund likely to depart permanently.\n\nThat would hand them greater leeway when it comes to bidding for players and agreeing on wages. United are currently fourth, and with fifth place also good enough to secure entry into Europe’s premier club competition, INEOS will be quietly confident.\n\nIn case things go horribly wrong, the Old Trafford side will struggle to pay top midfield target Elliot Anderson’s wages, handing Manchester City a free run at the Englishman.\n\nINEOS have kept a backup list ready just in case. Hopefully, it does not come to that.\n\n“United’s budget this summer will be night and day depending on whether they qualify for the Champions League,” Wheeler was quoted as saying.\n\n“They’ll effectively be working with two different budgets, two different shopping lists and two completely different plans. If United secure Champions League football and £100m-plus, that would be transformative.\n\n“It would put them back at the top table in terms of the players they can attract and the salaries they can offer. Without a top-four or top-five finish, could United afford to pay Elliott Anderson’s wage demands? I’m not so sure.”\n\nUnited’s Premier League finish will also have a bearing on Michael Carrick‘s future, with Thomas Tuchel currently leading the race.\n\nBut with the squad and club captain backing the caretaker head coach, INEOS will have a tough time denying Carrick the top job if the season aims are met.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "LSU baseball has opened the season 5-0. What has stood out from the Tigers' fast start to the season?",
    "fullText": "BATON ROUGE — The only way LSU baseball could've played more this last handful of days is if it would've played a game Tuesday.\n\nNo. 1 LSU has played every other day since Opening Day on Friday, Feb. 13, working through five games in a six-day span and it came out the busy stretch unscathed. The Tigers (5-0) capped the homestand with a 12-1 run-rule victory over in-state foe Nicholls State at Alex Box Stadium on Wednesday, Feb. 18.\n\nPinch hitter John Pearson ended the game in the eighth with a three-run homer. Junior Jake Brown continued his torrid start to the 2026 season, going 2 for 5 with two RBIs and a run. Trent Caraway hit a first-inning grand slam.\n\nMORE LSU BASEBALL COVERAGE What Jay Johnson, LSU baseball players said after win over Kent State\n\nSenior Zac Cowan earned his first win of the season on the mound while freshman Reagan Ricken picked up the save in his first collegiate appeaance.\n\nWith the first handful of games out of the way for the Tigers, here are three takeaways for LSU as it gets ready to board the plane to Jacksonville, Florida to play Indiana, Notre Dame and UCF in the Jax College Baseball Classic over the weekend.\n\nIt's early, but what Brown is doing at the plate right now is eyebrow-raising. He's smashed four home runs in the first five games — back-to-back two-home run games against Milwaukee and Kent State — and is currently hitting .500 with 12 RBIs and eight runs.\n\nMore times than not, Brown has jumpstarted LSU's offense when it has needed a spark and the lineup is feeding off of his production and timeliness.\n\nThis is Brown's third year starting for the Tigers so his ascension shouldn't be a surprise. But how well he is playing and seeing the ball is scary for opponents.\n\nFor one, the starters outside of Cooper Moore have struggled against Milwaukee, Kent State and Nicholls. That should raise some flags but it is early. Guys like Casan Evans and Zac Cowan have pitched enough at this level that quick turnarounds are expected from them.\n\nBut LSU's starting weekend rotation doesn't seem to be fully nailed down yet. Evans and Moore will be there, but who the third starter will be is the question. Sophomore William Schmidt struck out a lot of batters during his start Sunday, but he also gave up three runs on as many hits with three walks.\n\nLSU's bullpen, however, was a bright spot for coach Jay Johnson and company through the first five games. Deven Sheerin is fully healthy from his ACL tear and has looked masterful. Mavrick Rizy, Cooper Williams, and Gavin Guidry were all unhittable with Guidry picking up a win and a save in two outings.\n\n\"I think pitching we're not totally just dialed just quite yet,\" Johnson said after LSU's win over Nicholls. \"I think we will move closer to it. There's way more positives from the mound than not. It's obviously a deep staff. And that's five games in six days. We're running out (freshman) Reagan Ricken for the last three innings and that guy probably could pitch on Friday.\"\n\nLSU's offense showed this opening stretch how difficult it could be on an opposing dugout. It scored 17 runs with two outs over the course of its first five games.\n\nA number of those run-scoring hits were for extra bases as well, including Trent Carayway's first-inning grand slam Wednesday with two outs. What has stood out is how well the Tigers' approach is with two outs, and especially with runners on and two gone.\n\nIf LSU can continue that trend, it'll be a difficult team to beat moving forward.\n\nCory Diaz covers the LSU Tigers for The Daily Advertiser as part of the USA TODAY Network.

    "fullText": "The Raiders have hired Al Holcomb as a senior defensive assistant, Mike Garafolo of NFL Media reports.\n\nNew defensive coordinator Rob Leonard, a first-time coordinator who is 38, has never worked with Holcomb. But the fact that Holcomb is 55 and with coordinator experience gives Leonard somebody to lean on.\n\nHolcomb was the Bills' linebackers coach the past two seasons after one season as senior defensive assistant.\n\nThe Raiders have yet to announce a linebackers coach, but it does not appear Holcomb will serve as a position coach.\n\nHolcomb began his NFL coaching career with the Giants in 2009, and spent four seasons there as a defensive quality control coach (2009-10) and a defensive assistant (2011-12). He was the linebackers coach with the Panthers from 2013-17 before going to the Cardinals as the defensive coordinator and assistant head coach.\n\nHolcomb departed Arizona after one season and joined the Browns for one season as its linebackers coach and run game coordinator. He returned to Carolina for three seasons as defensive run game coordinator and then assistant head coach, defense in 2022 before the Panthers fired Matt Rhule, which led to Holcomb being named interim defensive coordinator.",

    "description": "Granlund's Finland surges toward Olympic glory, while Gudas and Dostal's medal hopes end in a thrilling quarterfinal overtime loss.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Olympic Games are coming to an end, as all four men’s hockey quarterfinals were played on Wednesday.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks had three players in action: Lukas Dostal (Czechia), Radko Gudas (Czechia), and Mikael Granlund (Finland). Damian Clara’s Italy squad was eliminated on Tuesday, and Jackson LaCombe was a healthy scratch for the fourth consecutive game for the United States.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas, Dostal Advance with Czechia, Clara Eliminated with Italy\n\nFrank Vatrano Talks Shoulder Injury and Tough Season\n\nWith the way the qualifying games shook out after the preliminary round, Czechia found themselves facing Canada for the second time in five games. They had lost 5-0 to open the tournament and were more prepared to face the gold-medal favorite in the quarterfinals.\n\nAn evenly-played first period saw Czechia take a 2-1 lead into the second period, and Canada handily controlled the majority of possession from there. Behind astute interior defending from Gudas and the blueline, Dostal made a handful of big saves and gave his team a chance to win.\n\nOndrej Palat gave Czechia a 3-2 lead late in the third period, but it was answered by Nick Suzuki four minutes later, and the game was sent to overtime, where Mitch Marner advanced Canada to the semis after a minute and a half of OT.\n\nGudas made his presence felt early and often on the defensive side of the puck, not only by providing his trademark physical play, but with keen anticipation skills that disrupted several Canadian attacks through the neutral zone.\n\nUnfortunately, one of those neutral zone pressures sent Canada captain Sidney Crosby to the locker room for the remainder of the game with a lower-body injury. Gudas stepped up on Crosby, as an outlet in the second period, and Crosby seemingly attempted to dodge the hit, but folded on his right leg in an unfortunate way. No penalty was called on the ice.\n\nGudas had an up-and-down tournament, but saved his best hockey for when it mattered most in today’s game. Gudas finished this game with an assist, a high-skilled play where he picked off a cross-ice neutral zone pass and turned it the other way, starting a 3v2. He also registered two penalty minutes and two shots on goal in 19:57 TOI.\n\nHe finished his second, and what will likely be his last, Olympic Games with a point (an assist) in five games played, but he won’t bring a medal home with him.\n\nMuch like the rest of the tournament and his entire 2025-26 season with the Anaheim Ducks, Dostal played very well. However, “very well” is below the superhuman level he needed to perform at if he was to carry his Czech team to the podium at these Olympics.\n\nAs mentioned, he did enough to earn a win in this game, but he didn’t solely win the game for Czechia. He brought his entire arsenal to this quarterfinal matchup: perfect lateral puck tracking, powerful pushes when pucks moved from the goal line to the slot or dots, and terrific rebound control.\n\nThe element that stood out most this tournament, with Czechia’s suspect blueline as a whole, was his ability to knock down dump-ins and individually start breakouts with pinpoint outlets to his defensemen or wingers up the wall.\n\nDostal finished this game by saving 37 of the 41 shots he faced for a .902 SV%. He finished his first Olympic Games medal-less, sporting a 1-3-0 record, and an .886 SV%.\n\nSwitzerland gave Finland quite the scare, as Switzerland had been one of the more impressive and cohesive teams in this tournament, even without the services of star forward Kevin Fiala. Switzerland got a pair of goals late in the first period of what was a high-intensity back-and-forth affair.\n\nSebastian Aho and MIro Heiskanen dashed the Swiss’s hopes of winning in regulation with a pair of late goals that sent the game to overtime, as the Finnish firepower proved too overwhelming and unrelenting for Switzerland. On the ropes, the Finnish coaching staff threw their forward lines into a blender halfway through the game with hopes of igniting a comeback, and they were eventually rewarded.\n\nFinland captain and Ducks’ forward Mikael Granlund started the game in the spot where he started the tournament: on the left wing of Roope Hintz and opposite Mikko Rantanen. As lines were tinkered with, he played with Sebastian Aho and Tuevo Teravainen for a stretch in the second, and played most of the third with Hintz and Kaapo Kakko. It will be curious to monitor how the lines shake out for Finland’s all-important semi-final game against Canada on Friday.\n\nHe was mostly a non-factor on the top line, but provided linemates with steady defensive habits, typically as an F3. When lines began to mix, he earned more puck touches, made several connecting plays to advance pucks up ice, and displayed elite edges multiple times when breaking down defenders along the offensive wall.\n\nGranlund finished this game scoreless with four shots on goal in 20:12 TOI, third-most among Finnish forwards.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Dostal, Gudas, Czechia Drop Overtime Game to Switzerland, LaCombe Scratched for Third Straight\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Granlund's Finland Dismantles Clara's Italy, LaCombe Scratched for USA\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas Defeats France with Czechia, Granlund Assists in Finland Win Against Rival Sweden",

    "description": "Pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, speaking Spanish, entered not guilty pleas through a translator to a rewritten indictment in Brooklyn federal court.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — A scheduled spring fraud trial for two Cleveland Guardians pitchers accused of colluding with sports bettors to rig bets and betray “America’s pastime” will likely be postponed until October, a federal judge said Wednesday as the men pleaded not guilty to a rewritten indictment.\n\nJudge Kiyo A. Matsumoto left a May 4 trial date on the books for now, but indicated she’ll probably move it to the fall in the coming weeks.\n\nPitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, speaking Spanish, entered not guilty pleas through a translator to a rewritten indictment in Brooklyn federal court.\n\nNo new charges were in the superseding indictment unsealed on Friday, as prosecutors charged a third individual with serving as a middleman between bettors and Clase. That person also pleaded not guilty Wednesday.\n\nThe pitchers were first charged in November with accepting several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two gamblers from their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 by placing more than 100 in-game prop bets and parlays on the speed and the outcome of certain pitches. Charges include wire fraud conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests.\n\nThe rewritten indictment released Friday added allegations that Clase used code words like “rooster” and “chicken” in communications about pitches to be thrown.\n\nPrior to a May 18, 2025, game against the Cincinnati Reds, Clase received a message to “throw a rock at the first rooster in today’s fight” and responded with: “Yes, of course, that’s an easy toss to that rooster,” the indictment said. However, Clase never entered the game and could not fulfill the plan to throw outside the strike zone to the first batter he faced, it added.\n\nA day earlier, though, Clase broke Major League Baseball rules by using his cellphone in the middle of a game against the Reds to signal to gamblers that a pitch would be outside the strike zone, enabling them to win about $27,000, the indictment said.\n\nClase, the Guardians’ former closer, and Ortiz, a starter, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July. Their teammates are just starting training camp for the new season. The team’s home opener is April 3.\n\nClase and Ortiz, who are free on bail, left the courthouse separately after Wednesday’s hearing. Neither commented. Lawyers for both men have insisted their clients never colluded with gamblers.\n\nLawyers for Ortiz have asked that he be tried separately, saying in court papers that if Clase passed along Ortiz’s pitching strategy to gamblers, he did so without Ortiz’s knowledge. They also noted that Ortiz is accused of throwing only two pitches that drew scrutiny over a 12-day span, while Clase is charged with colluding with gamblers on numerous pitches since 2023.\n\n“Mr. Clase may have abused his relationship with Mr. Ortiz as friends and teammates by convincing Mr. Ortiz to throw certain pitches at certain times — ostensibly for baseball reasons as far as Mr. Ortiz was aware,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nThey said they might present a defense to the jury that would cast “Ortiz as a victim of Mr. Clase’s scheme, rather than a knowing and willing participant.”\n\nClase, a three-time All-Star, had a $4.5 million salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract. Prosecutors say he started providing bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn’t seek payoffs until last year.\n\nProsecutors have said that Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary last season, joined the scheme last June.\n\nThe Guardians and Major League Baseball have said they are cooperating with the investigation. MLB said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity.",

    "fullText": "As expected, the Seahawks are for sale.\n\nDespite recent denials, the inevitable is happening. Owner Paul Allen died in October 2018. He left an express directive that the team will be sold, with the proceeds going to charity. After more than seven years, the league leaned on his sister, Jody, to get it done.\n\nThe timing is no surprise. We've previously reported that the league held a $5 million fine in abeyance with the understanding that the team would promptly be put on the market after Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe goal will be to sell the team to the highest bidder, in order to maximize the charitable contribution. The price tag, despite valuations in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion, is expected to land in the range of $9 billion to $11 billion.\n\nThe Seahawks organization, along with the team's fans, will be stuck with whoever the high bidder may be.\n\nIt's currently not known who it will be, or what that person will choose to do once they acquire full control over the franchise. It will be the next owner's prerogative to make changes, or not. To meddle, or not. To screw up a good thing, or not.\n\nAnd the fans will be stuck. Owners can't be fired. The fans can only hope the team lands in the hands of someone who will allow G.M. John Schneider to keep doing what he's been doing.\n\nBut no one other than the next owner will have any control over the situation. The next owner could be closer to Dan Snyder than any of the various good owners. (If we name one as an example, the ones not named won't be happy.)\n\nThe only thing that will matter is the money. As often is the case.\n\nEither way, the Seahawks will soon be meeting a new boss. They can only hope it's roughly the same as the old boss.",

He's awesome – tons of respect for him. But they need to beat Jon at some point,\" Martinez told MMA Junkie Radio of Cormier. \"Daniel Cormier hasn't beat Jon.

She has competed in the Olympics since she was a teenager, and it is no secret that the end of her Olympic career is drawing near.\n\nHere is more on Shiffrin’s future and whether she plans to compete in the 2030 Olympics.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nShiffrin has not decided if she will participate in the next Olympics. A lot could change over the next four years, and she would still have to qualify for her events if she does choose to compete.\n\nAfter winning her gold medal in slalom, Shiffrin kept her reaction short and to the point.\n\n— Mikaela Shiffrin ⛷️ (@MikaelaShiffrin) February 18, 2026\n\nBefore winning her gold medal, Shiffrin had been struggling, continually coming up short in events since taking fourth in the 2018 Olympics. She said, \"The irony is I've cared so much about wanting everybody to know the reality and to not want to answer those questions and to be so sick and tired of it. And I’ve felt that way since (being) fourth in South Korea in the slalom.\" And then about the win she said, \"In order to do this today, I kind of needed to accept the possibility that those questions would keep coming. It was like, just don't resist it. Just live in my own moment.”\n\nThe gold medal win moved Shiffrin into a tie with Shaun White and Kaillie Humphries for second-most gold medals for American athletes at the Winter Olympics. She now has four total medals in alpine skiing, which moves her into a tie for most in the event by an American woman.\n\nAbout competing, Shiffrin said, \"The reality of our sport is you lose a lot more than you win. When you look back on my career, I know statistics and everything, but still I've definitely lost a lot more than I've won. So that's the one thing that's certain is that you're not going to win everything.”\n\nShe hasn't committed to her future, but has acknowledged that her career can't continue forever. She said, \"The one thing that's certain is that that wave's going to stop. You don't get to ride that wave forever.\"\n\nMORE: Mikaela Shiffrin snaps Olympics drought with historically dominant slalom gold",

    "fullText": "One day after Tony Clark's surprise resignation amid a reported inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, the Major League Baseball Players Association elected Bruce Meyer as its executive director, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.\n\nThe vote was reportedly unanimous, with Meyer receiving the job on an interim basis after previously serving as deputy executive director.\n\nMeyer was the natural choice as Clark's No. 2 and the union's lead negotiator with MLB. He spoke earlier Wednesday about the importance of the union remaining united in the wake of Clark's ouster.\n\nAccording to Passan, Clark resigned on the heels of an internal investigation, which revealed an inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, who worked for the union beginning in 2023. The union held an emergency meeting Tuesday afternoon, but did not vote on an executive director until Wednesday.\n\nThe news comes less than a year before the current CBA is set to expire on Dec. 1. The union and MLB owners are expected to engage in a furious labor battle ahead of the new CBA, which many expect could lead to a lockout ahead of the 2027 MLB season. There is speculation the owners will push hard for a salary cap, something the players have opposed for years.\n\nMeyer joined the MLBPA in 2018 and played a central role in the last CBA negotiation. This election confirms he'll indeed be at the table for the upcoming negotiation.\n\nClark played a major role in helping negotiate previous CBAs for the players. He reportedly took an active part in negotiations as a player before being hired by the MLBPA in 2010. He was initially a director of player relations before being hired as the union's executive director in 2013. He oversaw negotiations ahead of the 2016 CBA and the contentious 2022 lockout, which resulted in Opening Day being postponed by a week as negotiations extended into March.",

    "description": "Despite his sharp statistical downturn in recent years, Robert Woods should be long remembered in fantasy football circles.",
    "fullText": "A torn ACL at age 29 altered the trajectory of one of the most underrated wide receivers of the past decade, and certainly one of the most underrated fantasy WRs. Now that Robert Woods has retired, let's recognize just how good he was.\n\nThere were three distinct phases to Woods' fantasy football career. His first four seasons were in Buffalo, where he caught passes thrown by QBs like EJ Manuel, Thaddeus Lewis, Kyle Orton, and Tyrod Taylor. Naturally, there was little room for glory. Woods' best fantasy numbers came in 2014.\n\nA switch to the Rams beginning in 2017 helped make him a fantasy mainstay. In his first year there, he was joined by rookie WR Cooper Kupp, second-year QB Jared Goff, and third-year RB Todd Gurley. It was the foundation of an offensive juggernaut, and as managers know all too well, it's often wise to invest in starters on high-scoring teams. The Rams led the league in scoring that season.\n\nDespite frequently sharing the field with one of the game's best running backs and a rapidly rising wide receiver, Woods carved out a unique fantasy niche. In Year 1, he was the WR19 in points per game -- the first of five consecutive seasons finishing in the top 20. Few WRs this century can make the same claim.\n\nHowever, in that fifth season in L.A., Woods tore his ACL at age 29. He was never the same after that, finishing outside the top 70 in each of his remaining seasons with Tennessee and Houston.\n\nIt's been more than five years since Woods was fantasy-relevant. But it doesn't take away from what he achieved: one of the most consistent statistical outputs by a WR in the modern NFL.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Robert Woods retires: an underrated fantasy football legacy",

They rotated guys through the lineup, but little was learned from that.\n\nJack Bech had the makings of a decent slot receiver coming out of TCU but has a lot to prove. Thornton was given every opportunity to be a starting X receiver and only proved that he has all the physical tools and none of the other requirements at the position.\n\nAs of now it’s Tre Tucker and a lot of questions. At very least, they need to add a starting caliber X receiver. They would be wise to look for a good slot receiver too. Just to cover themselves.

I just felt like we could be better all the way around, and I kind of wanted to focus more on just taking the team to another level. So, I decided to get out of the seat. I just didn't feel like our team was at the level it could be, and that's my goal to fix that.”\n\nPritchett, a former Top Alcohol Dragster competitor and longtime Top Fuel crew member with the Torrence Racing team, said, “I feel like all the stars are kind of aligning and [am] really excited for the opportunity. It feels like I got the opportunity I've been waiting on my whole life.”\n\nThe change reunites Pritchett with crew chief Doug Kuch, who guided him through his Top Fuel licensing procedure in 2015.\n\n“Doug Kuch actually got me my Top Fuel license back in 2015, in Charlotte,” Pritchett said, remarking that the relationship is “coming full circle.”\n\nFoley, a seasoned Top Fuel driver with a handful of IHRA victories and a longtime co-owner with the late Tim Lewis, said the move allows him to focus on strengthening the organization both competitively and commercially.\n\nDoug Foley Racing will compete in a combination of NHRA and IHRA events in 2026.

    "fullText": "Spring training is rolling on in Major League Baseball, though many stars will depart camp early to join their teams for the World Baseball Classic.\n\nHere are some top headlines from around the MLB, including the Houston Astros targeting a pair of former Dodgers and the fallout from the MLB Players Association’s executive director’s surprise resignation.\n\nCavan Biggio, son of Astros great and Hall of Famer Craig Biggio, was signed to a minor league deal by the team, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe younger Biggio was a Dodger for part of 2024, appearing in 30 games and slashing .192/.306/.329.\n\nThe utility man has spent seven years in the majors as part of four teams.\n\nMichael Conforto, who spent 2025 with the Dodgers but had the worst season of his career, has also drawn interest from the Astros, according to Brian McTaggart of MLB.com.\n\nThe Houston Astros have reportedly showed interest in signing Michael Conforto, who still remains a free agent at the beginning of Spring Training.\n\nConforto is coming off a disappointing season with the Dodgers and is 32-years-old. pic.twitter.com/dUQx20cXcC\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) February 18, 2026\n\nDuring his year in LA, Conforto slashed .199/.305/.333 in 138 games.\n\nHe hit 12 home runs and knocked in 36 runs as well.\n\nConforto slashed .237/.309/.450 with 20 home runs and 66 RBIs for the San Francisco Giants in 2024.\n\nHe’d been on a one-year, $17 million deal with the Dodgers, but the Boys in Blue filled that hole in the outfield with Kyle Tucker, perhaps the top free agent of the offseason.\n\nFollowing the shocking resignation of Tony Clark, who’d been having an “inappropriate relationship” with his sister-in-law, deputy executive director Bruce Meyer projected strength on Wednesday.\n\n“I’m not going to say this is a great thing; this is unforeseen,” he said, as reported by Jesse Rogers of ESPN. “At the end of the day, leadership is important and leadership comes and goes, but what remains is the players.\n\n“Our union is strong and always has been strong because of the solidarity of our members, of our players. That is going to continue, and as I’ve said in the past in different contexts, anybody who underestimates the strength of the MLB Players Association does so at their own peril.”",

    "description": "Social media users claimed Seattle's Super Bowl champions declined an invitation, but evidence is lacking.",
    "fullText": "A decades-long custom of championship-winning sports teams making a celebratory trip to the White House has become a political lightning rod throughout U.S. President Donald Trump's time in office, leaving fans uncertain as to whether the Seattle Seahawks will make the trip to D.C. following their Super Bowl win on Feb. 8, 2026.\n\nOn Feb. 17, rumors began spreading online that the Seahawks had explicitly declined a White House invitation. The claim spread on multiple platforms (archived, archived, archived), including an X post (archived) that received more than 3.8 million views, as of this writing. The X user didn't appear to have any related, official role that would lend credibility to his claim:\n\nOther posts, including one from a sports parody X account (archived), continued to gain momentum, with many users in the comments apparently believing the claim that the Seahawks either declined an invitation from the White House or the White House rescinded an invitation to the Seattle team.\n\nEither way, the claim lacks evidence. Neither the Seahawks nor the White House has made any official announcement, as of this writing, regarding whether the team will make an appearance at the White House. We reached out to Seahawks spokespeople and the White House, as well as top players' representatives, and did not immediately receive responses. We will update this story if we do.\n\nSeveral news media outlets, including NBC Sports, reported on the rumor, similarly noting the claim lacked supporting evidence.\n\nThe Seahawks' official site (archived) and X account didn't feature any news release corroborating the claim, as of this writing.\n\nFollowing the Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl win in 2025, several players — including quarterback Jalen Hurts — chose to skip the scheduled appearance with Trump. An NBC White House correspondent reported their expected absence just hours before the team's visit took place in April 2025.\n\nIt's possible, judging by precedent, that a Seahawks visit will take place that hasn't, as of this writing, been scheduled. In 2021, for example, the Super Bowl champion Buccaneers didn't make the trip until July.\n\nIf Trump's White House did decline to invite the Seahawks, it wouldn't be the first time a Super Bowl champion's audience with the president intentionally did not take place. In 2018, during Trump's first term, his office released a statement (archived) after several Philadelphia Eagle players publicly indicated they would decline. Trump's statement claimed the players disagreed with Trump because \"he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\"\n\nBecause neither the White House nor an official representative for the Seahawks confirmed whether the team will appear at the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl win, we leave this claim unrated.\n\nCaplan, Anna Lazarus.

    "description": "In a unanimous vote, the MLB Players Association has selected Bruce Meyer to be its interim leader.",
    "fullText": "PHOENIX — Bruce Meyer, the tenacious veteran litigator who has been the Major League Baseball Player Association’s lead negotiator, was voted unanimously Wednesday by the players to be their interim executive director, replacing Tony Clark.\n\nMeyer, who was promoted to be the union’s deputy executive director in 2022, has been MLB’s public enemy since he joined the union in 2018. He frequently has clashed on even small agenda items with MLB, which has accused him of being bad for baseball.\n\nMeyer is considered the union’s most fierce litigator since the days of Don Fehr and Gene Orza, and once again Wednesday expressed his deep resentment towards MLB’s hopes for a salary cap, believing that a lockout Dec. 1 is inevitable when the collective bargaining agreement expires.\n\n“A lockout is all but guaranteed at the end of the agreement,’’ Meyer said Wednesday afternoon after meeting with the Chicago Cubs, and spending the morning with the Kansas City Royals. “The league has pretty much said that. Their strategy in bargaining has always been to put as much pressure on players as they can to try and create divisions and cracks among our membership.\n\n“It never worked. I don’t think it will ever work.’’\n\nMeyer, who said he will continue to be the lead negotiator, said that he and his staff have a duty to the players to listen to whatever MLB offers, but showed his disdain towards even entertaining a salary cap.\n\n“Our position and the historic position of this union for decades on the salary cap is well known,’’ Meyer said. “It’s the ultimate restriction. It is something that owners in all the sports have wanted more than anything, and in baseball in particular. There’s a reason for that, because it’s good for them and not the players.’’\n\nMeyer, even with the sudden resignation of Clark over an inappropriate relationship with a union employee, insisted Wednesday morning there is no disarray among the union ranks, and its resolve remains strong.\n\n“I think anybody who's going to assume that and act on that,’’ Meyer said, “is really making a mistake. I'm not going to say (the timing of Clark’s resignation) is a great thing. This is unforeseen. There have been some issues hanging over (him), and in some respects, it's good to get them out of the way sooner rather than later.’’\n\nMeyer, while respected for his fierceness, does have his detractors. There was an attempt to remove him from the office two years ago, an effort led by attorney Harry Marino, who organized the efforts to have minor leaguers unionized. It failed when Clark came to Meyer’s defense.\n\nThe eight-person executive subcommittee pushed for Meyer to be voted as the executive director in their meeting Tuesday, but after pushback by at last three players on the call, no vote was taken. The group of 72 players, including player representatives from 30 teams, decided to reconvene at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday after polling their own teammates. If Meyer didn’t receive enough support, they likely would have turned to Matt Nussbaum, the union’s general counsel.\n\nNow, Meyer will be running the whole show, much to MLB’s fear thanks to past negotiations.\n\nWhen the 99-day lockout ended in 2022, and the rank-and-file voted to accept MLB’s last proposal, Meyer sympathized with the executive council who wanted to continue negotiations, even if it meant losing games.\n\n“Some players emerged from bargaining disappointed that we did not accomplish more,’’ Meyer said in a letter to players two years ago, “and in particular that we did not miss games to see if more gains could be made. To be clear, I sympathized and still do with these players and this position.’’\n\nMeyer, who becomes the seventh executive director of the union, expects negotiations with MLB to begin in April on the next CBA, and just like the last round, tranquility will not be on anyone’s bingo card.\n\n“I'd say I'm known as a tough litigator who also knows how to make deals when necessary,’’ Meyer said in a Q&A with the MLBPA newsletter. “In the sports area I've been involved in just about every type of issue, including labor, antitrust, licensing, collective bargaining and others. But the common thread is I have a passion for player advocacy and defending player rights.’’\n\nLet the negotiations, with plenty of rancor, begin.\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: MLBPA selects Bruce Meyer as interim boss after Tony Clark resignation",

    "fullText": "SEATTLE — The Washington Huskies have parted ways with offensive coordinator Jimmie Dougherty.\n\nWashington has not yet filled Dougherty’s role. No offensive coordinator has been listed on the university’s website for the 2026 season.\n\nDougherty, who last season added the offensive coordinator title after serving as the Huskies’ passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2024, said it was an “honor” to represent the University of Washington Tuesday night on social media.\n\n“To the city of Seattle, words can’t express what you mean to me and my family!!!” Dougherty said. “Most of all the players, love you guys forever, thank you.”\n\nDougherty, 47, began working alongside Washington head coach Jedd Fisch in 2021 when both were at Arizona. When Fisch was hired at Washington, Dougherty followed him and eventually became an offensive coordinator for the first time since he held that role at San Jose State in 2014.\n\n“I have worked with Jimmie Dougherty for 7 years and am appreciative for his many contributions to our success as an offense and as a team,” Fisch said on social media. “I want to thank Jimmie and wish him all the best in the future.”\n\nIt is unclear where Dougherty, who has also previously coached at Illinois Wesleyan, San Diego, San Jose State, Michigan and UCLA, is headed next. Whoever fills his role will inherit an offense that will be led by quarterback Demond Williams Jr., who was the subject of controversy last month because of his entering and exiting the transfer portal.",

    "fullText": "The derby. Is there a more raw feeling in football than seeing your club face another just down the road? Local bragging rights. Ownership of territory. Your land is ours now.\n\nK League has several major derbies, but hidden beneath the surface, unheralded rivalries are screaming out for your attention.\n\nSupporters of Jeonbuk Hyundai, Pohang Steelers, and Ulsan HD can rightly spit out their cornflakes when glossing over an article that largely passes them by. Veteran followers of K League will know that the Donghaean Derby between Pohang and Ulsan is among the three most significant rivalries in Korea. Jeonbuk share rivalries with those clubs — and several others in the league. Add the price on their heads for consistently winning titles, and every Jeonbuk fixture feels like an event in 2026.\n\nIf you're interested in the destination of the trophy, or in seeing the best players lining up for the best teams, examine the schedule for matches involving those three clubs and Daejeon Hana. However, this article is written for the groundhopper. The casual fan looking for something a little different. A train journey to a less familiar destination. A match off Broadway, if you like.\n\nThis article leans heavily on clubs located in or near Seoul. That isn’t inherent bias towards the capital region — merely a reflection of geography. Across K League 1 and 2, 15 of 29 clubs are on or near a Seoul Metro line.\n\nHere is a list of underrated rivalries worth checking out in 2026.\n\nSuwon Samsung Bluewings vs. Suwon FC (K League 2)\n\nSuwon Bluewings love some razzamatazz at Big Bird.\n\nSeparated by just3.3 km, this is currently the only city derby in Korea’s top two divisions. For the first time ever, the two sides will meet in K League 2 in 2026, following relegations in 2023 (Bluewings) and 2025 (Suwon FC).\n\nOn a national scale, this fixture never truly captured the wider football public’s attention, but when the distance between the two grounds can be covered on foot, it demands inclusion.\n\nStaring down automatic relegation in November 2023, unproven manager Yeom Ki-hun appeared to be turning the tide when the neighbours met in a proverbial six-pointer. Despite falling behind early and being reduced to ten men, the Bluewings stormed back to win 3–2. Their survival hopes remained alive — but ultimately, it wasn’t enough. The clubs finished level on points, yet Suwon FC’s superior goals-scored record sent the Bluewings down.\n\nIncredibly, Suwon FC boast a winning record against their bigger, richer, and historically more successful neighbours. In 16 K League 1 meetings, Suwon FC have won nine to the Bluewings’ six, with one draw.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Suwon Samsung Bluewings, Castle Park — Sunday, May 3, 19:00.\n\nSuwon Samsung Bluewings vs. Suwon FC, Suwon World Cup Stadium — Saturday, August 15, 16:30.\n\nAside from being the only current city derby in the top two leagues, the stadiums are a spectacular contrast in style. Suwon Stadium is an ageing, multi-purpose ground with limited pitchside seating, minimal facilities, and no roof cover. Big Bird, by contrast, is a majestic football-specific arena with an iconic roof and a riot of seat colours.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nSeoul will be on the menu for hungry Bucheon this year.\n\nApproximately15 km — across the Han River — separates two clubs who have never officially met in league competition. Until Seoul E-Land can convert investment into promotion, Bucheon will serve as Seoul’s nearest true rival.\n\nThe history is complicated. A team from Bucheon once faced the modern incarnation of FC Seoul — but that club is now Jeju SK. Bucheon FC 1995 was founded in response. Context aside, this one will be spicy.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Seoul World Cup Stadium — Tuesday, April 21, 19:30.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. FC Seoul, Bucheon Stadium — Sunday, July 19, 19:30.\n\nFC Seoul vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Seoul World Cup Stadium — Tuesday, August 25, 19:30.\n\nEstablished K League fanbases enjoy visiting new grounds. Many Seoul supporters weren’t following the club during the Bucheon SK era. A packed away section is guaranteed when they make the short trip across the river. Likewise, Bucheon should travel well to Sangam. Two Tuesday fixtures, however, are far from ideal.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nIncheon's famous South Stand is an imposing structure.\n\nThe 031 Derby — named after the regional area code — pits Bucheon against Incheon to the west. The stadiums are18 km apart and easily reached by subway. The clubs first met in K League 2 last season and renew their rivalry in the top flight following joint promotion. This will be Bucheon’s first taste of K League 1 football.\n\nBucheon pulled off a major shock last September, defeating the champions-elect. The result forced the rest of K League 2 to take notice: Bucheon were not just promotion contenders, but genuine candidates for automatic promotion. They ultimately fell short of completing a 031 Derby clean sweep, but the win did nothing to derail their playoff ambitions.\n\nIncheon lead the series two wins to Bucheon’s one. Incheon claimed both home fixtures at Sungui Arena (3–1 and 1–0), while Bucheon exacted revenge on home soil in September.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Incheon United, Bucheon Stadium — Saturday, April 18, 16:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Sungui Arena — Sunday, July 26, 19:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Sungui Arena — Tuesday, September 8, 19:30.\n\nLong sandwiched between major K League powers, Bucheon — a compact city on Incheon’s eastern edge — now have an opportunity to bloody the noses of their neighbours. After years of scrapping with regional sides like Ansan Greeners and Seoul E-Land, this step up in opposition and status should produce genuine edge.\n\nOn the pitch, the colors will be familiar to fans of Milan's big 2. Anyone who grew up in the 90's watching Italian Football on Channel 4 with James Richardson will absolutely appreciate seeing red/black vs. blue/black again.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Ansan Greeners (K League 2)\n\nAt long last, Ansan have a rendezvous with Suwon, based 20 km east as the crow flies. The Green Wolves have waited six years for revenge following a 4–0 trouncing during the COVID era.\n\nAnsan supporters still recall the days of Hallelujah and Police — the Greeners’ predecessors in the city. Suwon FC remain the most visited away side to Wa~.\n\nIshida Masatoshi returned to Wa~ after a successful season with Ansan and tore his former club apart in a comfortable 4–0 win for Suwon. An Byong-jun was also on the scoresheet as Suwon continued their march toward promotion. Fortunately for the Greeners, COVID restrictions meant the gates were closed that October afternoon.\n\nSuwon currently edge the rivalry with seven wins to Ansan’s six, alongside two draws. Ansan dominated the early meetings before Suwon finally broke through in 2018.\n\nAnsan Greeners vs. Suwon FC, Wa~ Stadium — Saturday, July 4, 19:30.\n\nSuwon FC vs. Ansan Greeners, Castle Park — Sunday, November 1, 14:00.\n\nAbout the only recognisable feature of Ansan Greeners is the enormous VERDOR banner that follows the downtrodden club around the country. The trip to Castle Park will be a short one for their signature banner. If there is one image that will bring back the horrors of K League 2 for Suwon FC fans, it is that green banner.\n\nFC Seoul vs. FC Anyang (K League 1)\n\nThe mural that angered Anyang's fans.\n\nThanks to the dense cluster of clubs in the Seoul Capital Area — particularly south and west of the river — familiar names recur.\n\nSeoul and Anyang sit just24 km apart. Anyang hate Seoul. Why? Because the club now known as FC Seoul once played in Anyang as the LG Cheetahs. In 2004, they announced their return to the capital, moving into the vacant World Cup Stadium. This is both a rivalry and a derby.\n\nThe last meeting saw Anyang celebrate one of the greatest nights in their history — on Seoul’s turf. Goals from Thomas Oude Kotte and Bruno Mota secured a stunning 2–1 victory. Tears flowed in the away end. The win exorcised old demons and convinced Anyang they belonged at this level.\n\n[READ: For Anyang, life will never be the same again]\n\nPerfect balance: one win, one draw, and one defeat each.\n\nFC Anyang vs. FC Seoul, Anyang Stadium — Sunday, April 5, 14:00.\n\nFC Seoul vs. FC Anyang, Seoul World Cup — Tuesday, May 5, 19:00.\n\nFC Anyang vs. FC Seoul, Anyang Stadium — Saturday, August 22, 19:30.\n\nThe rivalry is established and only set to intensify. When Seoul welcomed Anyang to Sangam last February, the home fans held up a mural reading 1983 - their year of formation. Anyang were furious. They feel some of that history belongs in the Violet city.\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United (K League 1)\n\nI can’t fully explain it — and I may be wrong — but the overdue meeting between Incheon and Anyang feels like fertile ground for a genuine rivalry.\n\nAnyang were a lifetime K League 2 club until lifting the title in 2024. They effectively took Incheon’s place after Incheon suffered their first relegation. Incheon’s rapid return and Anyang’s survival now place them on a collision course. The clubs are separated by33 km of Gyeonggi Province sprawl.\n\n[READ: A League You Have to Walk To: Football and Geography in Korea]\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United, Anyang Stadium — Sunday, March 22, 16:30.\n\nIncheon United vs. FC Anyang, Sungui Arena — Sunday, July 12, 19:30.\n\nFC Anyang vs. Incheon United, Anyang Stadium — Wednesday, August 26, 19:30.\n\nPost-match pints. Incheon and Anyang have their go-to bar for beers. Anyang's, named after a famous football club in England, is a shrine to global football. Liverpool and Anyang dominate, but don't be surprised to see scarves from Japan, Russia, and South America on the walls. Have a pint, meet new friends, and keep the fists on the table.\n\nCheonan City FC vs. Chungnam Asan (K League 2)\n\nThe first ever K League clash between Asan and Cheonan.\n\nOtherwise known simply as “the Derby,” Cheonan and Asan are neighbouring cities divided by one landmark: Cheonan-Asan KTX Station. You can’t travel between the two grounds without passing beneath the high-speed tracks. The clubs are also five stops apart on Metro Line 1 — just13 km.\n\nOn a clear November afternoon, the provincial rivals drew 1–1 at Yi Sun-sin Stadium. Cheonan led until half-time. Asan equalised with 30 minutes remaining. With little left to play for, the draw felt especially flat for Asan, who had narrowly missed promotion in 2023.\n\nAs the more established club, Asan hold the stronger record (five wins to two). However, both of Cheonan’s victories came last season, and with the draw included, they are unbeaten in the fixture since September 2024.\n\nCheonan City FC vs. Chungnam Asan, Cheonan Stadium — Sunday, May 3, 16:30.\n\nChungnam Asan vs. Cheonan City FC, Yi Sun-sin — Sunday, November 1, 14:00.\n\nMost fixtures on this list are Gyeonggi-based. While Cheonan and Asan sit on Metro Line 1, Asan in particular still feels remote — which only adds to the charm.\n\nJeju SK vs. Bucheon FC 1995 (K League 1)\n\nBuses, trains, or bikes won’t help much here. Jeju SK, based on the island of the same name, trace their roots to Seoul. Forced from the capital under K League’s decentralisation policy, they relocated first to Bucheon. Then, in 2006, the club woke up in a different city again. Bucheon FC 1995 were born in response.\n\nBucheon knocked Jeju out of the cup last year, but their last league meeting came during the COVID-affected 2020 season. Jeju won 2–0 in Bucheon, scoring twice inside 13 minutes through An Hyeon-beom and Joo Min-kyu.\n\nRemarkably, the clubs have met only three times in league competition — all in 2020. Jeju won all three, scoring seven and conceding none.\n\n[READ: Buying Tickets and Football Guide in Korea (Updated for 2026)]\n\nJeju SK vs. Bucheon FC 1995, Jeju World Cup Stadium — Saturday, April 4, 14:00.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Jeju SK, Bucheon Stadium — Tuesday, May 5, 14:00.\n\nBucheon FC 1995 vs. Jeju SK, Bucheon Stadium — Saturday, September 12, 16:30.\n\nBucheon hate Jeju. When Jeju rebranded from Jeju United to Jeju SK last winter, it sparked outrage in Bucheon. As fate would have it, the sides were drawn together in the cup. Bucheon won — serenading Jeju off the pitch to chants of “Bucheon SK.”\n\nA crowd of zero witnessed those 90 minutes due to virus restrictions. Maybe it never happened.",

    "fullText": "PFL heads to Pittsburgh for its third event of 2026 with former middleweight champion Johnny Eblen leading the charge.\n\nEblen faces Bryan Battle in the middleweight main event of PFL Pittsburgh, which takes place March 28 at UPMC Events Center. The full lineup for the event was officially announced Wednesday.\n\nComing off of his first-ever loss after starting 16-0 as a pro, Eblen looks to get back on the championship track (and possibly a rematch with Costello van Steenis, who defends his title against Fabian Edwards on March 20) when he takes on Battle, a promising UFC contender derailed by weight-cutting issues. The bout marks Battle’s league debut.\n\nIn the middleweight co-main event, Dalton Rosta fights 2023 PFL light heavyweight tournament winner Impa Kasanganay.\n\nThe main card also features the PFL debut of Ariane Lipski da Silva. The veteran flyweight went 6-8 in the UFC before signing with PFL this past September. She fights Sumiko Inaba.\n\nMaking his comeback on the preliminaries is two-time PFL lightweight tournament champion Natan Schulte. The Brazilian fighter was suspended indefinitely following a 2023 win over Raush Manfio—a close friend of Schulte’s—when the league ruled that neither competitor fought with the intention to win. Schulte has not fought since that incident.\n\nSee the full PFL Pittsburgh lineup below.\n\nDalton Rosta vs. Impa Kasanganay\n\nAriane Lipski da Silva vs. Sumiko Inaba\n\nPreliminaries (ESPN App, 7 p.m. ET)\n\nBryce Meredith vs. Jack Cartwright\n\nNatan Schulte vs. Jakub Kaszuba\n\nErnesto Rodriguez vs. Masayuki Kikuiri\n\nTatiana Postarnakova vs. Elora Dana\n\nJosh Fremd vs. Jarrah Al Salawi",

    "description": "Seattle brings back a familiar face for Cactus League catching depth",
    "fullText": "The offseason may be officially over, with the first slate of spring training games set to begin in just two days (!), but the Mariners aren’t done making moves, and they’ve brought back an old friend for at least the Cactus League.\n\nThere has been enough ink spilled about how Garver’s previous two years with Seattle didn’t live up to the expectations of his two-year, $24 million contract he was signed to on Christmas Eve 2023. After spending 2025 as Cal Raleigh’s backup, it was an easy call for the M’s to decline their end of his mutual option, despite a couple of fun moments in the postseason. Seattle brought aboard Andrew Knizner and Jhonny Pereda to round out the 40-man roster, and with the former being out of options, the Garv man looks to be on the outside looking in for the backup catcher gig.\n\nThat doesn’t mean he won’t get a good look this spring, though. With Cal Raleigh set to suit up for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic, Seattle will find itself in need of extra backstops for a good chunk of the Cactus League. Garver also has a leg up on the rest of the competition when it comes to familiarity with the Mariners’ pitching staff, with prominent hurlers like Andrés Muñoz and George Kirby previously citing his work with them as reasons for their success. While it’s currently unknown if his minor league deal contains an opt-out clause, it’s not out of the realm of possibility he sticks around with the Rainiers should he not break camp – after all, Tacoma needs catchers, too.\n\nIt’s a mild surprise that Mitch Garver couldn’t find a big league deal elsewhere. Despite his multi-year struggles, he was still a capable option against left-handed pitching, and settled in nicely as the second-string catcher after the plan of deploying him as a primary DH went off the rails. In any case, he’ll be a solid addition to the club’s catching depth for now, and his previous work with Seattle’s pitching corps could stand a decent chance at rubbing off on Knizner and Pereda.",

Hardaway had said last week that both players were suspended indefinitely.\n\nMemphis officials said they will continue to support Abdul Hakim academically as he pursues his degree. Memphis also will provide access to treatment and sports medicine resources as needed.\n\nAbdul Hakim averaged 6.2 points, 4.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 22.3 minutes in 13 games, including 10 starts. He came to Memphis after spending two seasons at UT Rio Grand Valley, where he averaged 13.2 points in 19 games in 2023-24 and 13.3 points in 12 games in 2024-25.\n\nDavis, a South Carolina transfer, has averaged 7.2 points, 4 rebounds and 20.5 minutes in 22 games. He has made eight starts.\n\nMemphis (12-13, 7-5 American Athletic Conference) will try to end a two-game skid Thursday when it visits South Florida (18-8, 10-3).",

With that comes free agency and new deals being handed out left and right.\n\nOne of those names primed to get a nice new deal is quarterback Malik Willis. The signal caller market is very thin, which is a big advantage for Willis.\n\nHe will likely have more than one suitor. Here are three teams to keep an eye on as free agency approaches for Willis and the NFL.\n\nMORE: Colts make surprising QB decision for 2026 season amid Anthony Richardson uncertainty\n\nThe obvious connection here is new head coach Jeff Hafley. The two worked together in Green Bay for two seasons.\n\nIn that time, Hafley likely saw Willis up close as he gave his defense looks in practice. Willis got some clear development in Green Bay—something he saw firsthand.\n\nMORE: Chiefs WR Rashee Rice faces legal trouble as ex-partner files lawsuit\n\nWill Willis take his talents to South Beach? A familiar face makes comfort a little easier and plus no state taxes is a nice deal to have.\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but let’s face the facts. Head coach Kevin Stefanski likely wants his pick at quarterback.\n\nThe thin market makes it tough for him to have that. What a great prospect that Willis just happens to be a local product out of Roswell.\n\nMORE: Dolphins are nearing decision on quarterback Tua Tagovailoa\n\nCould a home reunion in Atlanta be the move for Willis? He’d have a two time NFL coach of the year, plenty of weapons, and a defense that is on the rise–all in his home state of Georgia.\n\nWhich city is the best destination for Malik Willis?\n\nBoth @fieldyates and I liked the same team…. pic.twitter.com/wafqpNfVxQ\n\n— Mina Kimes (@minakimes) February 18, 2026\n\nThe Steelers are in limbo with Aaron Rodgers (again). Will he stay or will he go? They need a plan.\n\nPittsburgh also needs to throw a different dart. The well of older QBs isn’t getting them over the hump. Willis could provide a spark and, in general, something different.\n\nThe Steelers almost drafted him in 2022 as well. Can they bring Willis to Pittsburgh and correct the wrong pick(ett)?

    "fullText": "In the first six years of the hit Netflix dating show \"Love Is Blind,\" dozens of couples formed connections — but not every pair ultimately got married, and even fewer have stayed married.\n\nOnly eight \"Love Is Blind\" couples have gone the distance; of those couples, three have expanded their families in the years since we saw them walk down the aisle and say \"I do.\" Notably, \"Love Is Blind\" season nine, which took place in Denver, ended without a single couple getting married, underscoring just how rare lasting matches from the pods can be.\n\nWith season 10 of \"Love Is Blind\" now streaming on Netflix, there's no better time for a refresher on every couple who's still married — and where they are today.\n\nLibby Torres, Esme Mazzeo, Caralynn Matassa, Ayomikun Adekaiyero, and Palmer Haasch contributed to previous versions of this article. The article was first published in 2023.\n\nCameron and Lauren met and married on season one of \"Love Is Blind\" and are widely considered one of the franchise's biggest success stories. The couple, who share a dog named Mr. Sparx, celebrated their five-year anniversary in November 2023.\n\nThe couple share updates on their life on their YouTube channel, \"Hanging with the Hamiltons\", and co-authored the 2021 book \"Leap of Faith: Finding Love the Modern Way.\"\n\nIn October 2025, they added a new chapter to their story, welcoming their first child, Ezra. This comes after the couple had been open about facing struggles with fertility.\n\n\"To God be the GLORY! 🙌🏾🩵 Our son, Ezra William Hamilton, made his debut October 1st ,a little earlier than planned, but perfectly on God's time. After an unexpected turn with preeclampsia and a few days in the hospital, we've been taking it slow… healing, resting, and soaking up all the love,💛\" Lauren and Cameron said in a post on Instagram.\n\nMatt Barnett and Amber Pike also got married on \"Love Is Blind\" season one. Like Cameron and Lauren, they celebrated their five-year anniversary in November 2023.\n\nIn October 2024, the couple revealed that they were expecting their first child together on the inaugural episode of \"The Love Seat,\" the podcast hosted by their season one costars.\n\nIn April 2025, they welcomed their first child, a daughter.\n\n\"It may be the hormones but @barnettisblind and our baby girl have my heart so full I can hardly function. I hope this feeling never goes away,\" Amber said in a post on Instagram.\n\nBrett Brown and Tiffany Pennywell Brown met during \"Love Is Blind\" season four, which aired in 2023. They married in May 2022.\n\nAppearing on the \"Love Is Blind\" season six reunion episode in March 2024, Tiffany and Brett confirmed they're still happily married.\n\nThey closed on their house in September 2024.\n\nKwame Appiah and Chelsea Griffin Appiah met in the pods during season four and married in May 2022, though Kwame's mother didn't initially approve of the relationship. Despite some friction, they've managed to go the distance.\n\nChelsea and Kwame celebrated a year of marriage in May 2023 by adding to their engagement and wedding jewelry, and Chelsea shared in July 2023 that the couple had honeymooned in Santorini, Greece.\n\nChelsea announced in August 2023 that she was working for Netflix and helping cast people on \"Love Is Blind.\" She and Kwame also appeared at the season six reunion in March 2024, confirming they're still happily married.\n\nZack Goytowski and Bliss Poureetezadi-Goytowski met on \"Love Is Blind\" season four, but they didn't get engaged sight unseen like most couples on the show.\n\nZack chose Irina Solomonova in the pods, got engaged to her, and went on the couple's trip to Mexico with her before they decided they weren't a good match and swiftly broke up.\n\nAfter connecting in the pods, Bliss and Zack met in person when Zack returned from Mexico and had instant, undeniable chemistry. Zack proposed to Bliss while the season was being filmed, and she said yes. \"Love Is Blind\" followed their journey up to their wedding day in May 2022.\n\nLike all of the other season four couples, they had to keep their marriage a secret until April 2023, when the wedding episodes aired.\n\nAfter celebrating a year of marriage in May 2023 and announcing in November that they were expecting their first child together, their daughter, Galileo Terri Rayne, was born on April 26, 2024.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2026, the couple announced on Instagram that they are expecting their second child.\n\n\"We cannot wait to see Galileo become a big sister! Baby #2 coming Summer 2026 ✨,\" Zack and Bliss said in a joint Instagram post.\n\nAmy and Johnny had the most unproblematic romance on \"Love Is Blind\" season six. In the finale, they became the only couple from their season to both say \"I do\" at the altar.\n\nJohnny and Amy confirmed that they were still together at the season six reunion, which aired in March 2024. The reunion even featured a cute montage of their first year of marriage, including goofy moments at home and their trip to Paris.\n\nTaylor and Garrett had the most drama-free romance on \"Love Is Blind\" season seven, despite one disagreement over Garrett acknowledging a text from his ex. They were one of two couples to eventually make it to the altar. They confirmed at the season seven reunion, which aired in October 2024, that they were still married.\n\nDuring the reunion, Taylor and Garrett laughed at speculation that his glow-up — mostly longer, more styled hair — was due to Taylor's influence, though she said that he had driven the transformation.\n\nThey also revealed that they had decided to move to Washington, DC, rather than San Diego, as they had discussed on the show.\n\nDaniel and Taylor had the smoothest journey of any couple in season eight, except for one moment in episode six, where Taylor nearly derailed the relationship because she thought Daniel had stalked her on Instagram (he hadn't).\n\nThey confirmed at the \"Love Is Blind\" reunion, which aired in March 2025, that they're still married and had bought a home outside Minneapolis. Daniel also showed off his tattoo of Taylor's eyes.\n\nThe couple recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary and added a golden retriever named Sunny to their family.\n\nBrennon and Alexa Lemieux met on \"Love Is Blind\" season three and married in 2021.\n\nIn January 2024, they revealed that they were expecting their first child. In an interview with People announcing the news, Alexa said the two had been trying to conceive for more than a year, and she'd undergone fertility treatments that didn't work before unexpectedly conceiving naturally.\n\nAlexa and Brennon revealed on December 3, 2025, that they had decided to part ways. The announcement came a little more than a year after the birth of their daughter, Vienna Ziva Lemieux, in July.\n\n\"This choice was not made lightly, and it comes with a great deal of care, respect, and appreciation for the time we've shared,\" Brennon and Alexa said in a joint statement on Instagram.\n\n\"We entered this relationship with love and optimism, and we leave it with gratitude for the experiences that shaped us and the growth we each gained along the way. While our journey as a married couple is coming to an end, we remain supportive of one another, devoted to our daughter, and committed to navigating this transition with compassion.\"\n\nLike Brennon and Alexa, Matt and Colleen met on season three of \"Love Is Blind\" and married in 2021.\n\nColleen and Matt are quieter than many \"Love Is Blind\" cast members on social media, but they sparked conversation online because of their unconventional living arrangement.\n\nAfter the finale, they were married for about two years and lived separately before announcing they'd finally moved in together in June 2023.\n\nAfter almost four years of marriage, Matt and Colleen said in a May 2025 Instagram statement that they were parting ways.\n\nLydia and Milton met on \"Love Is Blind\" season five and bonded over their shared love of science. Their age gap worried Lydia at first, but they got married at the altar in June 2022. They later had a second wedding in Lydia's native Puerto Rico.\n\nAfter nearly three years of marriage, Lydia and Milton got divorced.\n\nDuring a June 11, 2025, appearance on fellow \"Love Is Blind\" alum Amber Desiree \"AD\" Smith's podcast, \"What's the Reality?\", Lydia opened up about life since her stint on the show.\n\nAshley and Tyler were the second couple to make it to the altar on season seven. Before they married, they had one obstacle to overcome: Tyler told Ashley that he had donated his sperm to a friend and her wife and fathered three children, something that he hadn't disclosed to her in the pods.\n\nWhen the show started airing, however, speculation and claims about Tyler's relationship with the three children circulated online. Despite breakup speculation, Ashley supported Tyler at the season seven reunion in October 2024, where the two reaffirmed their commitment to one another, and she publicly defended him in post-show interviews.\n\nHowever, on January 21, 2025, Ashley announced that she and Tyler had separated several weeks earlier and decided to divorce.\n\n\"While I had hoped for mutual understanding and transparency in our relationship, it has become clear that our paths are no longer aligned, making it impossible for me to continue in this marriage,\" Ashley said in a statement to People, also asking for privacy as she focuses on \"healing and building a new future.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider via Instagram DM, Tyler called the decision to split \"an incredibly difficult and emotional process\" for both of them and added that he takes \"full accountability\" for his role in their relationship difficulties.\n\n\"I respect Ashley's decision to move forward in a way that prioritizes her peace and happiness,\" he said. \"Ashley is an incredible woman, and I have nothing but admiration and gratitude for the love and support she has given me. I ask for kindness and understanding as we both move forward separately, focusing on healing and growth.\"\n\nJarrette and Iyanna's path to the altar on season two of \"Love Is Blind\" was relatively smooth. Though they encountered road bumps due to their differing lifestyles (Jarrette likes to go out, while Iyanna is more of a homebody), the two married and were still married when that season's \"After the Altar\" was filmed.\n\nThe two announced their separation with a now-deleted joint statement on Instagram on August 17, 2022, about a year after their marriage, and finalized their divorce in November of that year. The post-show special, which aired in September, revealed the cracks that had been forming in their marriage prior to the split, including that Iyanna had moved out of their home because of Jarrette's partying.\n\nDespite initially being amicable in their separate announcement, Iyanna later said on a podcast that Jarrette had cheated on her during their marriage, which Jarrette denied.\n\nIyanna hard-launched her new relationship in a 2023 wrap-up post on Instagram and got engaged in December 2024. Jarrette hasn't posted about his relationship status.\n\nDanielle and Nick were another season two couple who didn't make it. The two only had eyes for each other and seemed like a perfect match — which is why fans were shocked when People reported in late August 2022 that Danielle had filed for divorce from Nick earlier that month.\n\nInitially, the split was contentious, but they later reconciled and became friendly, with Danielle even appearing on Nick's podcast in May 2023.\n\nDanielle hard-launched her new relationship on Instagram in July 2024. Nick is also now in a relationship.",

    "description": "Gordon Ramsay and his wife, Tana, have six children together. The chef shares a peek at his family life in his new Netflix show \"Being Gordon Ramsay.\"",
    "fullText": "Gordon Ramsay may be famous for his foul-mouthed persona on TV, but behind the scenes, he's a proud father of six.\n\nThe Michelin-starred chef has been married to cookbook author Cayetana \"Tana\" Ramsay since 1996. Together, they have three sons and three daughters, including Holly Ramsay, who was walked down the aisle by her father at her star-studded wedding to Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty in December. Naturally, Ramsay designed the menu.\n\nRamsay shared a glimpse of his family life in his six-episode Netflix series \"Being Gordon Ramsay,\" which premiered on Wednesday.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the celebrity chef's wife and kids.\n\nCayetana \"Tana\" Elizabeth Hutcheson was in her early 20s — and engaged to someone else — when she met Gordon Ramsay at a New Year's Eve party in London, but she didn't think much of him at first, she told The Guardian in 2008. However, they shared a mutual friend and, after bumping into each other again, started dating.\n\nIn 1996, when Gordon was 29 and Tana was 21, they got married in Chelsea, London.\n\nAfter initially struggling to conceive and going through in vitro fertilization, they welcomed their first child, Megan, in 1998. By 2001, their first four children had been born.\n\nSpeaking to The Herald in 2008, Tana said they were surprised by how quickly their family grew.\n\n\"We knew we wanted a large family,\" she said, \"but for it to happen that close together is amazing. When I discovered I was expecting [our fourth child] Tilly, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God, how am I going to manage?' But you do.\"\n\nTana, who initially trained as a teacher, is also accomplished in the kitchen. She's published several cookbooks, including \"Tana's Kitchen Secrets\" and \"Tana Ramsay's Real Family Food.\"\n\nMegan Ramsay, 27, was the first in her family to graduate from college, her dad shared on Instagram at the time. She earned a degree from Oxford Brookes University in June 2019.\n\n\"So proud of this young Lady,\" he wrote alongside photos of Megan in her cap and gown, adding, \"hard work pays off!\"\n\nWhile she generally avoids the spotlight, Megan did appear on a 2021 episode of \"Hell's Kitchen\" to celebrate her 21st birthday alongside her father.\n\nAnd while she keeps a low profile, that didn't stop Ramsay from publicly disparaging her boyfriend.\n\nDuring a January 2022 appearance on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" Ramsay said Megan's ex-boyfriend, Byron, was \"a bit wet.\"\n\n\"You want a man to date your daughter, and he was just a little bit pathetic,\" he added.\n\nBut the Michelin-starred chef can be a doting dad, too. On Megan's 24th birthday in May 2022, he shared a photograph on Instagram showing the two together.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to this gorgeous lady,\" he captioned the photo. \"Words can't describe enough how proud you make me feel every day.\"\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Holly Anna Ramsay and Jack Scott Ramsay were born. They arrived seven weeks early, according to Hello! magazine.\n\nIn an Instagram post in December 2020, Tana recalled her struggles as a mother to premature twins.\n\n\"Seeing them become little chubby, healthy babies within the first year was a true blessing and I will always be grateful for the determination they showed and their feisty characters,\" she wrote.\n\nToday, the twins have a close relationship, but their professional interests differ.\n\nHolly Ramsay is a mental health advocate, podcast and documentary producer, influencer, and model. She has over 500,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nIn 2021, Holly launched the podcast \"21 & Over\" and opened up about her mental health journey, disclosing that she is a survivor of sexual assault.\n\n\"I went to university, studied fashion design, and I loved it. But by the second half of the first year I was being affected by my PTSD and I had no idea that this was happening,\" she said of the aftermath.\n\nOn December 27, 2025, Holly married Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty. She changed into her mother's 1996 wedding gown for their first dance.\n\nDuring an interview with Vogue, Holly said her father would get emotional every time she talked about the wedding.\n\n\"The other day I was asking him which car he and I would take to the church, and he welled up immediately,\" she recalled.\n\nJack is the athlete of the Ramsay family. According to People, he has played rugby and water polo, and he's studied jiu-jitsu.\n\nIn 2020, Jack joined the Royal Marines. Ramsay publicized his son's accomplishment in an Instagram post at the time.\n\n\"Can't tell you enough how proud I am of this young man Jack Ramsay you've made me feel like the proudest father today congrats on joining @royalmarines what amazing achievement,\" he wrote.\n\nA year prior, Ramsay celebrated his son finishing the famous Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\"Jack Ramsay you are an IronMan 19yrs old what took you so long! Congrats on an amazing achievement,\" the proud dad wrote on Instagram.\n\nIn 2015, Matilda, also known as Tilly, began starring in \"Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch,\" a children's cooking show on the BBC. Tilly later created a corresponding book, \"Matilda & The Ramsay Bunch: Tilly's Kitchen Takeover.\"\n\nBeyond her cooking show, Tilly has made her fair share of TV appearances, including as a contestant on \"Strictly Come Dancing\" and Australia's \"MasterChef.\" In 2024, she graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Nottingham.\n\nTilly frequently shares cooking videos on her TikTok, where she has nearly 10 million followers. She also hosted her own cooking show, \"Dish It Out,\" which premiered on Amazon in 2025.\n\nTana has spoken publicly about the pregnancy loss she experienced in 2016, and she encouraged people to discuss the often taboo topic of miscarriage.\n\n\"I found it really hard when people would talk to me and not mention it because it was like it never happened,\" she told Metro in 2020.\n\nIn an October 2021 Instagram post, Tana wrote about her family's experience.\n\n\"If all had gone as we hoped yesterday 14/10/21 would have been our little boy Rocky's 5th birthday, the day he was due not the day he was actually born when he was too little to survive,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Not a day goes by when we don't think of him,\" she continued, \"but, it wasn't meant to be.\"\n\nSpeaking on her husband's role during the hardship, Tana told Metro, \"Gordon was amazing, and he's always been one to talk about everything, and he was very good at sort of talking it out of me and never making me feel that, 'Oh, you know, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.'\"\n\nIn June 2023, she thanked her entire family in an Instagram post for their support throughout the hardship. \"I couldn't do this without my family, you are all everything to me,\" she wrote.\n\nIn 2018, when they were 18, Holly and Jack ran the London Marathon to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital and in memory of Rocky, Hello! reported.\n\nOscar James Ramsay was born in April 2019. In 2023, Tana shared photos of her son on Instagram for his 4th birthday, writing, \"4 already — wow where has that gone!! 4 years of loving you you crazy clever little boy - love you endlessly.\"\n\nHis sisters, Tilly and Holly, manage the toddler's Instagram account.\n\nA post shared by Oscar Ramsay (@oscarjramsay)\n\nRamsay once told Jimmy Fallon during a January 2021 interview that Oscar was his \"last hope\" of getting any of his children into the cooking industry.\n\nRamsay announced the birth via Instagram on November 11, 2023, by sharing a post showing his wife in the delivery room with their newborn son, Jesse James Ramsay.\n\nIn the caption, Ramsay confirmed that Jesse James would be their last child, writing: \"3 boys, 3 girls.... Done.\"\n\nRamsay had told the Daily Mail in 2021 that he and Tana were contemplating having one more child.\n\n\"I said it was a great idea. She said: 'Well, let's start planning.' So I'm like: 'Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I'm going to be the oldest dad at school, what's going to happen on sports day?'\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"But it's something we'd still consider, because it's been such a joy spending time with Oscar,\" he added.",

    "description": "I've followed the Mediterranean diet for more than five years, and I meal prep to save time and money. Here are my favorite meals to make ahead.",
    "fullText": "I have followed the Mediterranean diet for more than five years.\n\nIt's long been considered the healthiest diet, and this way of eating emphasizes the consumption of unprocessed foods and healthy fats.\n\nCommon ingredients people on the diet eat include vegetables, seafood, whole grains, and beans. While following it, I like to cook meals in advance in larger batches so I can enjoy them throughout the week or freeze them to eat at a later date.\n\nSome of my go-to Mediterranean-diet recipes stray slightly from more typical ones I've seen, but I try to stick with the core principles of this style of eating while keeping things interesting.\n\nHere are some of my favorite meals to make in advance and how I usually prepare them.\n\nChicken meatballs are versatile and can be easily incorporated into pasta dishes, salads, wraps, and sandwiches. Plus, they freeze well.\n\nTo make them, I usually combine ground chicken, chopped red onion, egg, breadcrumbs, and olive oil. Then, I mix in oregano, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper and form my meatballs.\n\nI pop them in the air fryer or oven until brown, let them cool, then freeze them in individual portions for later.\n\nStuffed peppers are easy to customize with different types of meat, rice, cheese, and vegetables.\n\nTo start, I cut each bell pepper in half and remove the seeds. I drizzle the peppers in olive oil and bake them for a bit while I cook my preferred filling on my stovetop.\n\nI often stuff peppers with a mix of cooked ground turkey (be sure to drain any excess juice), diced onions, canned diced tomatoes, garlic, tomato puree, chicken stock, and herbs.\n\nOnce I bake and cool the peppers, I freeze them. When I defrost them, I add grated cheese and heat them in the oven until they're hot and the cheese is golden.\n\nSometimes I spend a free afternoon cooking a large batch of beef stew I can fill my freezer with.\n\nTo make it, I brown ground beef in olive oil on my stove and set it aside on a plate. Then, I add diced onion, rosemary, and garlic to the pan I was using. I cook them for a few minutes and then add red wine.\n\nI then pour in beef stock, canned chopped tomatoes, and jarred grilled peppers. I add the beef back in and cook my stew in the oven for two hours.\n\nThen, I stir in canned butterbeans and olives and cook for another 30 minutes. I make a slurry with cornstarch and cold water and stir it into my stew to help it thicken. I let it simmer until I like the consistency.\n\nOnce it cools, I freeze individual serving sizes that I can thaw whenever I want them.\n\nHomemade fishcakes are a great way to incorporate seafood into your diet without spending a fortune at the fishmonger.\n\nTo make them, I fry chopped leeks on the stove and set them aside in a bowl. Then, I grind up a few tilapia filets in a food processor and add them to the leeks, along with an egg, breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley, lemon juice, and cumin.\n\nI form my mixture into small cakes, then fry them in a pan for five minutes on each side until golden brown.\n\nI freeze the cakes individually and usually serve them with garlic mayo and salsa.\n\nA one-pan chicken traybake is perfect to throw in the oven on a busy weeknight, particularly if you also need lunch prepped for the next day.\n\nFor mine, I chop potatoes, onions, and lemons into medium-sized chunks and toss them in a pan with olive oil, capers, jarred peppers, sundried tomatoes, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper.\n\nI start roasting them in the oven while I season chicken thighs with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n\nI fry the thighs skin-side down on the stove until the skin turns brown, then add them to the tray of things I began roasting. I cover the whole thing in foil for a bit, then keep baking and tossing everything around until my potatoes are crispy.\n\nOnce finished, I serve myself a portion and keep the rest for lunch the next day. It's very tasty leftover.\n\nNothing says batch cooking like a cozy soup.\n\nDrizzle diced carrots, onion, celery, and leeks with olive oil and cook in a large pan on the stove. Season with turmeric, harissa, and red-pepper flakes before adding chopped tomatoes, fresh cilantro, vegetable stock, and water.\n\nLeave to simmer uncovered for at least 30 minutes, then add cans of green lentils and chickpeas. Simmer for another half an hour.\n\nWhisk a couple of eggs, a tablespoon of flour, and lemon juice into a couple of cups of water, then add that mixture to the soup.\n\nLet it simmer for a few more minutes before pouring yourself a serving and freezing the rest.",

    "title": "The US Navy is pulling more and more warships into its Middle East force buildup",
    "description": "The Pentagon has dramatically reduced the number of ships it had in the Caribbean ahead of the Maduro raid, moving vessels toward the Middle East.",
    "fullText": "The US military added another warship to its large Middle East buildup in recent days, and a second carrier strike group is on its way, bringing additional fighter jets and missiles toward the region.\n\nThe large-scale deployment of American forces to the Middle East has escalated significantly this month as the Trump administration pressures Iran to strike a deal that would limit its nuclear and military capabilities.\n\nAs the US Navy's Middle East force presence has grown, its footprint in the Caribbean Sea — once the site of a substantial show of force ahead of US military action against Venezuela and its former president Nicolás Maduro — has shrunk dramatically.\n\nThere are 10 warships and an aircraft carrier positioned in the Central Command area of responsibility, the Middle East, and two more vessels situated on the outskirts of the region, according to a defense official.\n\nMuch of the US naval force in the Middle East was operating in the Arabian Sea as of Tuesday. That includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group — the guided-missile destroyers USS Spruance, USS Frank E. Petersen Jr., and USS Michael Murphy.\n\nThe Lincoln has dozens of embarked aircraft, including fighters, electronic attack jets, and early warning planes. The destroyers escorting the carrier are equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. Among its air wing are F-35 stealth fighters.\n\nThree additional destroyers — USS Mitscher, USS McFaul, and USS Pinckney — are also in the Arabian Sea. Pinckney arrived in the region in the past couple of days, the defense official said.\n\nAnother destroyer, USS Delbert D. Black, is in the Red Sea. And three littoral combat ships — USS Santa Barbara, USS Tulsa, and USS Canberra — are in the Arabian Gulf. These warships are designed for near-shore operations.\n\nUSS Roosevelt and USS Bulkeley, two destroyers capable of ballistic missile defense, are operating in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, which is part of US Naval Forces Europe and Africa's area of responsibility.\n\nThe defense official said the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group — destroyers USS Mahan, USS Winston S. Churchill, and USS Bainbridge — are also operating under that command, which covers the eastern half of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Ford carrier strike group had been operating in the Caribbean for months. However, earlier this month, it was reported that the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier was being sent to the Middle East.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the aircraft carrier was operating off the coast of Morocco near the Strait of Gibraltar, ship-tracking data shows.\n\nTwo additional destroyers — USS Thomas Hudner and USS Stockdale — that were previously in the Caribbean are now in the US Naval Forces Europe and Africa area of responsibility as well.\n\nThe departure of Ford and the five destroyers has diminished the Navy's presence in the Caribbean, which falls under the Southern Command area of responsibility.\n\nThe US armed forces initially positioned a large number of warships in the waters near Venezuela last year as part of President Donald Trump's effort to pressure Maduro. A few weeks after his capture, a dozen vessels were still present in the region.\n\nNow, only five remain, the defense official said. Those include the cruiser USS Lake Erie, the destroyer USS Truxtun, the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima, and the amphibious transport dock ships USS Fort Lauderdale and USS San Antonio.\n\nThe US and Iran held indirect talks earlier in the week, and officials hinted that additional dialogue could be on the horizon.\n\nHowever, US military assets — including aircraft such as fighter jets and refueling tankers — are still moving into and toward the Middle East, giving Trump plenty of options to strike Iran for a second time, which he has threatened. The US military bombed Iran's nuclear sites last year as part of Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nIran, meanwhile, conducted military exercises in the strategic Strait of Hormuz this week, and Tehran's leadership warned the US warships deployed to the region that it is capable of sinking them in the event of a fight.",

    "fullText": "At the World Liberty Forum at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, David Solomon revealed that he holds some bitcoin among his personal investments.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs CEO hasn't always spoken positively about the apex crypto token. In 2024, he said he believed bitcoin is a speculative asset without a real use case. More recently, he downplayed the potential threat that some think it poses to the US dollar, making it clear that he wasn't concerned.\n\nSolomon didn't reveal exactly how much he has invested in bitcoin or how long he has held it for, only that he holds a \"very, very limited\" amount. He added that he doesn't see himself as a forecaster but rather as an observer of crypto, implying that he believes it is important to understand it as the technology continues to intersect with finance.\n\nGoldman has warmed to cyrpto more recently. Solomon previously stated that the bank has a team assessing how to implement stablecoins. Yet, it hasn't embraced crypto as much as peers like JPMorgan, which has debuted tokenized offerings for clients and issued its own JPM Coin.\n\nIn his address at the World Liberty Forum, Solomon also discussed regulation, noting that he sees the regulatory approach of the last few years as burdensome.\n\n\"When you burden this system with excessive regulation, you start to extract capital,\" he said. \"That absolutely happened in the last five years.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has prioritized easing regulations on the crypto industry, which initially spurred growth for bitcoin and other digital assets. However, the top crypto has been in a rut since hitting an all-time high last October, with prices down nearly 50% since then.\n\nBitcoin was down on Wednesday, struggling to gain momentum after its latest streak of declines. The token was trading at $66,500, down about 1%.",

    "fullText": "A company can use AI to code faster than ever — but that won't matter if the idea itself is lousy.\n\nThat's just one point from a scathing critique of the current state of AI in the workplace from veteran software engineer Dax Raad, whose blunt assessment is resonating with many workers online.\n\nRaad, the developer behind OpenAuth, said the bottleneck facing companies isn't coding productivity — it's a lack of good ideas, unmotivated employees, corporate bureaucracy, and \"the dozen other realities of shipping something real.\"\n\nBefore AI, companies were reined in by development costs, he argued in a February 14 post on X that has since gone viral on Reddit as well. While it's easier than ever to produce code, that doesn't mean the original idea was worthwhile — or that employees will produce more instead of simply using AI to work \"with less energy spend.\"\n\n\"your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping,\" Raad wrote.\n\neveryone's talking about their teams like they were at the peak of efficiency and bottlenecked by ability to produce code\n\nhere's what things actually look like\n\n- your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping\n\n- majority of workers have…\n\nRaad described a search for meaning among employees faced with potential productivity gains from AI, arguing that the \"majority of workers have no reason to be super motivated, they want to do their 9-5 and get back to their life.\"\n\nPart of the issue, he wrote, is that some workers may simply use AI to coast. \"they're using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend,\" he said. That can actually make work harder for those who are giving it their all, he wrote.\n\n\"the 2 people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon,\" Raad wrote.\n\nThere are also very real monetary costs to outfitting a company's engineers with AI coding tools and the tokens required to power new AI features.\n\n\"your CFO is like what do you mean each engineer now costs $2000 extra per month in LLM bills?\" he wrote.\n\nRaad, who also created OpenCode, an open-sourced AI coding tool, said that people shouldn't mistake his criticism of AI.\n\n\"so many people don't understand how I can be critical of AI while also building an AI tool,\" he wrote in a different post on X.\n\nThe OpenCode developer has begun to develop a reputation for expressing skepticism about AI's progress, or at least the hype around it. In a recent \"contrarian talk,\" Raad said that his job is just as hard as it was before AI.\n\n\"I'm tired of people feeling like suddenly the tables are going to turn and things are going to be easier,\" he said during a talk with the AI Engineer podcast. \"They're not easier. My life is just as hard as it's ever been. It's just as hard as it's ever been to do something amazing. But it's also where all the fun comes from, where all the purpose comes from.\"\n\nRaad's views have resonated within the development community. His post on X has been viewed roughly 793,000 times, and a user who shared Raad's thoughts on Reddit has received over 22,000 upvotes. On Medium, JP Capras, a fellow engineer, praised Raad's \"honest take.\"\n\n\"Omg, you guys are making me feel much less alone now :D,\" a Reddit user replied, adding that requests from their management have \"destroyed\" their development process.\n\n\"It's funny how accurate this is to my current situation,\" reads the top-voted comment on the viral Reddit post.\n\nSome companies have said AI has allowed them to do more, faster — and others have talked about the potential to \"fail fast\" and iterate. Okta, Salesforce, Snowflake, and Blackstone have all leaned heavily into utilizing AI.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, previously told Business Insider.\n\nRaad's perspective comes amid a broader concern about \"AI fatigue.\"\n\nSiddhant Khare, who builds AI tools, recently wrote an essay about what he described as how \"the tool that was supposed to save you time has consumed your entire day.\" In short, it's the view that whatever AI may increase in productivity, it comes at the cost of a burned-out workforce.\n\nSteve Yegge, an Amazon and Google vet, recently said companies should consider a three-hour cap on AI-assisted work or risk their workforces crumbling.\n\n\"I seriously think founders and company leaders and engineering leaders at all levels, all the way down to line managers, have to be aware of this and realize that you might only get three productive hours out of a person who's vibe coding at max speed,\" Yegge told \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" newsletter.\n\nRaad's larger point is that AI isn't a magic wand that companies can wave and expect to suddenly find success — and that real pain points remain.\n\n\"even when you produce work faster you're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Kevin Hassett said Fed researchers should be disciplined for their views on tariffs, sparking fresh concern from commentators about Fed independence.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump's economic advisor said that Federal Reserve writers behind a report claiming that Americans bear the brunt of tariffs should be \"disciplined.\"\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, criticized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's economic analysis of the impact of tariffs published last week, calling for the authors to be punished for their findings.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment. It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined because what they've done is put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first semester econ class,\" Hassett told CNBC.\n\nThe economists found that 90% of the economic burden of higher tariffs fell on US firms and consumers. The average tariff rate climbed to 13% from 2.6% in 2025 as part of Trump's sweeping trade policy unveiled last April.\n\n\"While importers pay the duty, the 'economic burden' of the tariff can be shifted onto exporters if they lower their export prices,\" the report reads. \"There is 100 percent pass-through from tariffs to import prices, and therefore on U.S. consumers and firms,\" the economists explained in the write.\n\nHassett defended the tariffs in his comments to CNBC.\n\n\"The basic theory of President Trump's tariffs is that, sure we're importing stuff from China, but we've got producers in the US that make the same stuff, maybe at a slightly higher price. If we bring the stuff home, create the demand at home, then that will hurt China and drive up wages in the US and American consumers be better off.\"\n\nHassett's remarks come as Fed independence is in focus. The Trump administration is in the midst of criminal investigations into Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed governor Lisa Cook.\n\nClaudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is known for creating the Sahm rule, a popular recession indicator, said the comments, specifically Hassett calling for the paper's authors to be disciplined, are \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nShe added that Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair, \"must\" be asked about Hassett's comments at his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"The Fed Chair has the ability to suppress research from the Fed. Will he if it disagrees with White House?\" Sahm wrote.\n\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider that Hassett's comments are \"distressing.\"\n\n\"At best it's an angry outburst instead of a reasoned response, and at worst it is meant to chill speech and curb central bank independence,\" he added.",

    "description": "The new Netflix doc \"Being Gordon Ramsay\" offers a glimpse into the life of the iconic chef and TV personality and his most ambitious project.",
    "fullText": "The iconic chef might have been known by a completely different moniker — one that, it seems, he would have preferred.\n\n\"Scott's a lot better than fucking Gordon,\" Ramsay quips to his wife Tana.\n\nRamsay elaborated in a recent interview with BBC Radio 2, revealing he was named Gordon after his father.\n\n\"They christened me and mum said, 'We're going to name you after your father,'\" Ramsay said, noting that doctors originally believed he wasn't going to live for longer than two hours.\n\n\"Scott's a cool name,\" he added. \"I would've preferred to be called Scott.\"\n\nRamsay said his father believed that cooking wasn't a job for real men. He never ate at one of his son's restaurants before he died at the age of 53 from a heart attack.\n\n\"Deep down inside, I would love for my dad to have tasted something and even said, 'Yeah, good job,''' Ramsay said. \"I would've loved him to have understood, even though he didn't back what I was doing or believed in where it was going. You want validation from your parents.\"\n\nBoth Ramsay and Tana were in relationships when they first met while attending a mutual friend's wedding.\n\n\"I was looking at my mate thinking, 'Oh my god, your girlfriend is fucking gorgeous,'\" Ramsay recalled. \"She looked like a young Julia Roberts.\"\n\nTana, who was 18 when she met Ramsay, said it wasn't love at first sight with her future husband.\n\n\"I thought he was really arrogant, really full of himself; he used to really irritate me,\" she said. \"It took about a month, and then we were both single.\"\n\n\"I honestly thought for many months that Tana was out of my league,\" Ramsay added. \"I won her over with food.\"\n\nRamsay said he was \"transformed\" by the legendary chef, who became the first Brit to ever win three Michelin stars.\n\n\"He was like a father figure,\" Ramsay said. \"He had the gift of this Picasso; he put food on the plate like no other.\"\n\nRamsay said he was White's \"right-hand man\" at The Restaurant Marco Pierre White, working 18-hour days six days a week during his early 20s.\n\n\"I became very good very quickly,\" Ramsay added. \"He brought the natural talent out of me.\"\n\nRamsay said that The Restaurant Gordon Ramsay \"started with nothing.\" Since he couldn't buy expensive cuts of meat, he sold oxtail instead.\n\n\"But I still won two Michelin stars with oxtail,\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"When you get that third star, everyone says it's a sigh of relief, but it's not a sigh of relief,\" Ramsay said. \"It's fucking magical.\"\n\nThe Restaurant Gordon Ramsay remains open today and still has three Michelin stars to its name. During the docuseries, Ramsay hit back at critics who claim he cares more about being a \"TV chef\" than his actual restaurants.\n\n\"I didn't sacrifice the restaurants for TV, and I haven't used the TV to fake what's going on in the restaurants,\" he said. \"They go hand in glove.\"\n\nWhen Ramsay hosted a preview event for Bishopsgate, he opted to invite influencers to see the space instead of food critics.\n\n\"Ten years ago, we were depending on their pens,\" he said about critics. \"Ten years ago, we were depending on their insults. Ten years ago, we were depending on their egos, and they destroyed restaurants.\"\n\nRamsay noted how critics would often get personal throughout his career. He recalled one writer who called him a \"failed footballer that had a shotgun wedding.\"\n\n\"How does that relate to food?\" Ramsay asked. \"How do you write about a restaurant experience with that headline?\"\n\nNow, Ramsay believes that influencers are \"the most powerful critics on the planet.\"\n\n\"Being Gordon Ramsay\" also briefly follows Tilly's journey as she attends the Ballymaloe Cookery School in Ireland.\n\nTilly said she began cooking when she was very young, wanting to be \"part of everything\" that her father did.\n\n\"Cooking is definitely something that has brought us together,\" she said.\n\nDuring the docuseries, Ramsay goes with Tilly for the fitting of her first chef whites and visits her at the cooking school. Tilly hopes to someday open her own restaurant, just like her father.\n\nRamsay believes he could have \"been there a bit more\" for his four oldest children, who are now all in their 20s. So he's planning to do things a bit differently for his 6-year-old son Oscar and 2-year-old son Jesse James.\n\n\"I'll make more time for them because I never want them to say, 'You weren't there my first day at school. You missed my play. You missed my football match,'\" Ramsay said.\n\n\"But I'm shit at Nativity plays, I'm shit at Christmas carols, I'm shit at sports days because I want to compete and beat all the dads,\" he added. \"So maybe it's a good thing I didn't do all those.\"\n\n22 Bishopsgate will feature the restaurants Lucky Cat, Lucky Cat Terrace, Bread Street Kitchen, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High, and the culinary school Gordon Ramsay Academy.\n\nLucky Cat is a 250-seat Asian-inspired restaurant, while Lucky Cat Terrace has 60 seats in a rooftop garden with a retractable roof. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay High is a 12-seat fine-dining restaurant, and Bread Street Kitchen will be an all-day brasserie.\n\nRamsay said he wants to make sure 22 Bishopsgate has \"some of the best restaurants in the world.\"\n\n\"It's sort of one of my final stakes in the ground, something I'm going to be best remembered for,\" he added.\n\nRamsay, who has a 20-year lease on the building, called it one of the \"most fraught projects I've ever done.\"\n\n\"The pressure with this project is that if it doesn't go to plan, it's my neck on the line, and I have to guarantee that every penny that we're borrowing, if it doesn't work, I have to pay that back personally,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to create something incredibly special to keep alive for 20 years, without a doubt.\"",

    "description": "After years of inconsistent routines, a dad explains how committing to just 20 minutes of daily exercise helped him build lasting fitness habits.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Skye Mackintosh, a 29-year-old regional sales manager and father of two, based in Utah. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn October 15th, 2024, I saw a picture of myself sitting by the pool and didn't recognize myself. It was the biggest I'd ever been, and I felt like it wasn't really me.\n\nI decided to go a year without added sugar, and I lost some weight. If anything had even one gram of added sugar, I didn't eat it for a full year.\n\nAlthough I've never been particularly sedentary — I grew up hunting and fishing on my family farm, played basketball once a week or so, and used to run a lot — I had a hard time working out consistently. If I had days I didn't want to exercise, I just didn't. I've completed 75 hard a couple of times, and I even ran a 50k ultramarathon with six weeks of training, but I always just went back to how I was.\n\nSo, I wanted to find a way of working out that I would actually do forever.\n\nI decided to start posting evidence of my daily 20-minute workouts. I knew that if I put my fitness journey online, I wouldn't be able to face the embarrassment of not following through on my word.\n\nI chose 20 minutes because 30 isn't always achievable, and 10 didn't seem to be enough. My wife and I are going to have more kids, and then I'll have grandkids, and who knows where my career will take me. But regardless of what's going on, I figure I'll always have 20 minutes.\n\nI chose push-ups and jump squats to start with because I wanted to hit the core muscle groups while keeping it simple enough to do anywhere.\n\nAs my account grew, I started getting advice from people in my comments. They told me that I would mess up my posture or injure myself if I didn't work different parts of my body, so around day 35, I added one back exercise and one core exercise.\n\nI felt like I was plateauing with a full-body workout every day, so now I do upper body 3 days a week and lower body and core 2 days a week. On Wednesdays, I either play basketball or do some stretching, and Sundays are full rest days.\n\nAs I have gotten stronger, I've added more reps in those 20 minutes and some equipment, so it isn't too monotonous. Nothing crazy — just a kettlebell and pull-up bar, and some free equipment I have gotten from brands as my account got more popular.\n\nI always do movements that anyone can do with bodyweight or really simple, cheap equipment. For example, I really like lunges with a kettlebell or ab rollouts.\n\nA few commenters have said that my routine is getting too complicated and intimidating, and I get it; it would have been overwhelming if I had tried to jump straight into what I was doing on day 143 on day one. My whole point is to start where you are — don't compare my day 143 with your day one.\n\nI don't want to overcomplicate my diet, either, so I just try to eat as many whole foods as I can and hit my goal of 185 grams of protein a day.\n\nGetting jacked wasn't my main goal. It's not about seeing the abs or the muscles in the mirror, but what that signifies — that I'm dedicated and I can do hard things to become the man I want to be.\n\nIt helps that somewhere between day 30 and day 40, I realised I was finding working out fun, too. I was travelling, but it didn't feel like a pain to figure out how to fit in my workout. Instead, I was excited to do it.\n\nI've also gotten a lot stronger and improved my form. On day 100, I recreated the workout I did on day one, and what took me about 15 minutes at the start only took me five minutes. And while I could only do two pull-ups at the start, I can now do 15 with a 10-lb weighted vest.\n\nI sleep more deeply, too, and dream so much more. I also dream more when I'm awake — I have more confidence and self-respect, and feel able to take on more ambitious goals.\n\nI want others to feel the way I'm feeling, so inspiring people through my Instagram page has been so special. People have been messaging me to say they've worked out for the first time in years, or they are on day 50 of their own journeys.\n\nMy main advice is just to start and keep it simple. I wanted to test whether even something small, stacked over time, is better than great spurts of effort, and I've found that it is — it's all about consistency.\n\nIf 20 minutes seems overwhelming, start with 10, or even five. You don't need to put pressure on yourself to work out for 100 days in a row; you just need to do it today.",

    "description": "Military students face uncertainty as the Pentagon evaluates universities beyond Harvard, potentially affecting top-leveleducation plans.",
    "fullText": "University officials and military students say they were blindsided by a Pentagon decision to not only sever ties with Harvard University, but also put dozens of other colleges under review.\n\nTroops pursuing military legal and specialist careers are barred from attending Harvard through certain Defense Department-funded programs, officials say, and recent internal messaging has raised the prospect that other long-standing education partnerships could be affected as well.\n\nAfter an internal list of schools under review leaked online last week, Business Insider reached out to each institution for their reaction to the news.\n\nA spokesperson for The George Washington University said the school had not \"received any direct notification or communication\" from the Department of Defense. Northeastern University said the same, sharing that while it was aware of press reports on the matter, it was still working to establish facts.\n\n\"I'm a little bit flabbergasted,\" said a professor at one listed school. \"This is very strange.\" Another questioned what the long-term effects of this decision might be. It's a question military students are asking as well.\n\n\"We've had no clarification as to what's going on,\" shared a prospective lawyer currently on active duty and enrolled at one of the listed schools. Like the professors, they spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.\n\nLast Friday, screenshots of internal US Army emails began circulating online. The emails, which CNN first reported and Business Insider verified, identified Harvard University as \"fully off limits\" for service members seeking US military tuition assistance while marking 33 other schools as moderate or high risk. Self-paying students were also encouraged to apply elsewhere.\n\nOne email said that prospective students who had applied to or had been accepted to schools like American University, Stanford University, or Georgetown University, among others, \"should have a backup plan\" in case the Pentagon gives those schools the same treatment as Harvard.\n\nArmy spokesperson Cynthia Smith said in a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday that only US military ties to Harvard are being halted. Other university programs are under review, she said, but \"no further decisions have been made at this time.\"\n\nA separate defense official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive issues also told Business Insider that the list is still \"up in the air.\"\n\nSuch considerations signal a potentially significant shift in how the US military interacts with civilian universities — institutions that have long played a central role in educating military lawyers, specialists, and leaders rising to higher ranks — and raise questions about whether political factors are shaping where troops are permitted to study.\n\nThe Department of Defense declined to provide any further clarity and referred Business Insider to a social media post by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth earlier this month that said the Pentagon intends to sever ties with Harvard for all professional military education programs and fellowships.\n\nHegseth, who received a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School, said Harvard is \"one of the red-hot centers of Hate America activism,\" adding that \"too many faculty members openly loathe our military; they cast our armed forces in a negative light and squelch anyone who challenges their leftist political leanings.\" Harvard hasn't publicly responded.\n\nThe internal Army emails that leaked online were focused on soldiers applying to the Army's legal education program, a pathway to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG), the military's legal branch. Graduate degrees at civilian universities, however, are not limited to prospective JAGs and also include competitive programs for degrees relevant to other military jobs.\n\nThe potential blacklisting of universities beyond Harvard has prompted concerns among current and prospective students that coveted spots at their chosen schools may be eliminated.\n\nThe active-duty service member preparing for a military legal career at a top law school told Business Insider that they worry that even if they graduate, a degree from a blacklisted university might be viewed unfavorably when future promotion opportunities arise.\n\nAnother service member who is set to start school at a top institution in the fall — and is preparing to relocate their family — said they have not received information about how their studies may be affected; however, they fear that if they are barred from attending their chosen university, they might not have time to apply to another school.\n\n\"It's a thing you earn on merit that I would hate to have taken away,\" they said of their acceptance at a top institution.\n\nUS military officer culture has long prized continued study, particularly for those advancing to senior ranks who are expected to understand the global and strategic implications of American power beyond the boots-on-the-ground level. Civilian graduate programs have historically helped the military build legal, policy, and strategic expertise at senior levels.\n\nEducational priorities are shifting in the Pentagon under the current administration, which has labeled Ivy League schools and other universities as \"woke\" for some of their policies and programs. In some cases, the admin has also threatened federal funding freezes on several schools, including some on the Army list.\n\n\"This is such a slippery slope,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School and a retired Air Force JAG. She expressed alarm at the prospect of certain schools being off-limits for troops without transparency about the exact criteria the Pentagon is using to judge them.\n\n\"Everyone is just kind of scratching their heads,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "As Mark Zuckerberg was ushered into the Los Angeles Superior Court early on Wednesday morning, one accessory in his entourage stood out: Meta Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nZuckerberg, wearing a navy blue suit and tie, arrived without any glasses. Flanking either side of him as he walked up to the courthouse were longtime executive assistant Andrea Besmehn and an unidentified man donning Meta's Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nMeta declined to comment about the accessory choice.\n\nAI-powered smart glasses weren't just a hot accessory in the California sun. They were a hot topic inside the courtroom.\n\nThe judge presiding over the trial announced that anyone using glasses to record inside the courtroom would be \"held in contempt of the court,\" according to CNBC.\n\nThis isn't the first trial where Meta's glasses have caused issues.\n\nLast year, while Meta battled the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust allegations, New York Times reporter Mike Isaac posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he had been reprimanded by the court for wearing Meta Ray-Bans.\n\ndo not wear camera glasses in federal buildings folks 😞\n\nThe glasses cameo came as Zuckerberg took the stand in a Los Angeles trial accusing major social media companies of building addictive products that harm young users. The case centers on a now-20-year-old plaintiff, identified in court filings as \"KGM,\" who alleged that Instagram and YouTube worsened her depression and suicidal thoughts after she started using the apps as a child. TikTok and Snap have already settled, leaving Meta and Google's YouTube as the remaining defendants in the trial, which could shape similar lawsuits nationwide.\n\nThe trial underway in Los Angeles is focused on design features that plaintiffs say keep teens scrolling. Zuckerberg's testimony follows an earlier appearance from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri.\n\nMeta's Ray Ban smart glasses have become a surprise hit. On the company's earnings call last month, Zuckerberg said that sales of the glasses more than tripled in 2025, and compared the moment to the shift from flip phones to smartphones.\n\nMeta has increasingly positioned the glasses as a vehicle for its AI ambitions. In addition to taking pictures and playing music, users can ask questions to Meta AI, Meta's AI assistant, about anything that they're looking at through the glasses.\n\nLast week, the New York Times reported that Meta is planning to add facial recognition technology to the glasses.",

    "title": "Palantir's Florida move is more than just a change of address",
    "description": "Even if a company doesn't cite a reason for relocating, experts say the change can signal financial, political, or other motives.",
    "fullText": "When a company moves its headquarters, it's making a statement — whether leadership spells it out or not.\n\nThat's the case with Palantir's surprise announcement Tuesday that it has relocated its home base to Florida from Colorado.\n\nThe defense-tech contractor disclosed the change in a one-sentence press release citing a new address just outside Miami. Palantir, led by cofounder and CEO Alex Karp, didn't provide a reason or say what it means for employees.\n\nThe lack of details has left many observers speculating on the motive.\n\n\"This seems like a pretty obvious attempt to put both Karp and Palantir in friendlier territory,\" said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\nThough Karp backed Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign, he has more recently praised the Trump administration's immigration and national security policies.\n\nOn a November earnings call, Karp called for tougher border policies and highlighted Palantir's work with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Israel. Palantir, which relies heavily on government contracts, has also faced protests in Colorado in recent years. Colorado is a blue state, Florida is red.\n\n\"Not only will the company receive a more welcoming reception and more eager labor pool in Florida, but Karp and his top deputies will probably be more comfortable spending time there than they do in Colorado,\" said Pozner.\n\nPalantir didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the reason for the headquarters shake-up or the move's impact on employees.\n\nPalantir was founded in California's Silicon Valley region in 2003 and moved to Colorado in 2020. At the time, Karp cited an \"increasing intolerance and monoculture\" in Silicon Valley. Karp owns property in Colorado.\n\nSome leadership experts point to Florida's more tax-friendly policies as a reason why Palantir has a new ZIP code.\n\n\"To me, this is dollars and cents,\" said Zack Kass, a former OpenAI executive who now advises companies and governments on leading in today's AI-centric business world. \"If building a better company meant Karp moving the business to Alaska, he'd probably do it.\"\n\nA number of finance and tech heavyweights have planted flags in Florida in recent years, including Citadel, Thiel Capital, and Thoma Bravo. In January, venture capitalist David Sacks proclaimed that Miami will soon replace New York City as America's financial capital.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the leadership of the state of Florida,\" said Citadel's Ken Griffin at the America Business Forum in Miami in November. \"This is a great place to call home.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees, though, as others have noted that Miami's social scene hollows out in the summer and the city lacks a major university to pipe in tech talent.\n\nWhatever the incentives are behind Palantir's change of address, headquarters moves in general are rarely about real estate, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management professor at Bentley University. Instead, they often speak to the kind of identity leaders want for their companies.\n\n\"In a world where so much work is hybrid or distributed, the HQ is often more symbolic than operational,\" he said. \"Geography communicates. It says something about who you want to attract, who you align with, and what kind of company you believe you are.\"\n\nLeBlanc pointed Elon Musk's decision to move some of his companies' headquarters from California to Texas for political reasons as an example. In 2024, the billionaire lashed out at California for being the first state to outlaw schools from having to notify parents if a child changes their name, pronouns, or gender identity at school, calling the move the \"final straw.\"\n\n\"Particularly in founder-led companies, those moves often reflect worldview as much as strategy,\" LeBlanc said. \"Geography has become part of executive messaging.\"",

    "title": "FCC Chair Brendan Carr calls Stephen Colbert's censorship concerns 'fake news'",
    "description": "FCC Chair Brendan Carr addressed Stephen Colbert's claims that CBS pulled a Democratic lawmaker's interview over federal regulatory concerns.",
    "fullText": "Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said it's \"fake news\" to suggest that the government pressured CBS to pull a Democratic lawmaker's interview from Stephen Colbert's \"The Late Show\" earlier this week.\n\nCarr addressed the latest flash point moment between broadcasters and the FCC in his Wednesday remarks during the commission's February open meeting, saying there was \"no censorship by the government here.\"\n\nSpeaking to Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Wednesday evening, Carr doubled down, describing the incident as \"Democrat on Democrat violence,\" rather than evidence that the commission had pressured CBS not to air the interview.\n\nInstead, Carr said, CBS's advice to \"The Late Show\" not to air an interview with James Talarico, a Democratic Texas state representative running for a hotly contested US Senate seat, was an appropriate response to prevent the commission from enforcing its equal time rule.\n\nThe equal time rule requires TV and radio broadcast stations to provide equivalent airtime opportunities to legally qualified political candidates, or risk fines or, potentially, the revocation of their broadcast license. The rule does not apply to bona fide newscasts, interviews, or on-the-spot news.\n\nThe rule has rarely been applied in recent decades. Broadcasters had generally understood a 2006 FCC ruling to mean that interviews on daytime and late-night talk shows were exempt from the rule. However, the FCC said in revised guidance sent to stations last month that \"This is not the case.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Colbert and other establishment Democrats want to put the thumb on the scale in this Democrat primary for one candidate over the other,\" Carr told Ingraham. \"I don't know, you'll have to ask them, but we're going to enforce the law and hold broadcasters accountable.\"\n\nCarr told reporters during the FCC's open meeting that the commission was pursuing \"enforcement actions\" against the talk show \"The View\" over its broadcast of an interview with Talarico.\n\n\"What we're doing now is simply applying the law on the books in an even-handed manner, and for people that benefited from a two-tier system of justice during the Biden years, they may feel like that's weaponization, but that doesn't make it so,\" Carr told Ingraham.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox News, CBS, The Late Show, and the campaigns of Talarico and primary opponent Jasmine Crockett did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. The FCC pointed to Carr's remarks during the open meeting when reached for comment.\n\nCBS previously said in a statement that it did not specifically prohibit \"The Late Show\" from broadcasting the interview, but that it did provide the show with legal guidance.\n\nColbert, who has hosted \"The Late Show\" since 2015, told his viewers on Monday that CBS lawyers said \"in no uncertain terms\" that his late-night talk show could not air the interview with Talarico. He also said he was told not to acknowledge the decision on air, which prompted his decision to post the interview on YouTube.\n\nRep. Crockett, a Democrat running against Talarico, said during a Tuesday appearance on \"The Briefing with Jen Psaki\" likely gave her primary rival a \"boost.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday social media post, Talarico's campaign confirmed that the fervor around the incident had a positive effect, saying it had raised $2.5 million in 24 hours after the Colbert interview was scrapped.",

    "description": "DoorDash offers more choice than Amazon by working with a wider range of grocery chains, CEO Tony Xu said during the company's Q4 earnings call.",
    "fullText": "DoorDash CEO Tony Xu says that his company's grocery offering has a key advantage over Amazon: choice.\n\nAmazon is doubling down on grocery delivery, especially perishables like produce and ice cream. The retail and tech giant said last month that it's expanding same- and next-day grocery delivery to more parts of the US this year, adding to the thousands of towns and cities it already serves — news that sent shares of Instacart and DoorDash tumbling at the time.\n\nDoorDash, though, has something that shoppers want and that Amazon isn't replicating, Xu said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nUnlike Amazon, which owns Whole Foods and several of its own food brands, DoorDash works with existing grocery chains. The delivery service has struck deals in recent years. Last year, it expanded its partnership with Kroger and signed new deals with regional chains, including Schnucks in the Midwest.\n\nFew customers complete all their grocery shopping at a single chain, Xu said. Many stop at multiple stores each week, especially to find specific fresh groceries, such as produce, meat, and seafood.\n\n\"Consumers prefer choice,\" Xu said on the call, adding that he expects there to \"continue to be very strong interest in the DoorDash product\" as a result.\n\nDoorDash is also expanding its services for retailers, such as fulfillment through its DashMarts, convenience store-sized retail spaces designed for picking and delivering orders.\n\nXu said DoorDash is \"doing that for every single grocer so that they have the capability to compete against companies like Amazon.\"\n\nDoorDash shares rose as much as 14% in after-market trading on Wednesday, despite disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and guidance for 2026. The company's stock took its biggest one-day hit in November after it unveiled plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on tech improvements.\n\nWhile DoorDash has become known for restaurant deliveries, its gig workers are increasingly making grocery deliveries — many of which make more financial sense for DoorDash.\n\nXu said DoorDash has attracted more big grocery orders from customers, not just small fill-in trips. That matters in the grocery industry, where grocers tend to make more money when customers buy a wider range of goods.\n\n\"People use us for both the quick runs as well as the stock-up use cases,\" he said.\n\nRavi Inukonda, DoorDash's CFO, said on the call that DoorDash's retail and grocery business expects to \"be unit-economic positive\" in the second half of 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta is deepening its ties to Nvidia in a move that could further pressure Intel and AMD, even as AI demand remains strong.",
    "fullText": "Meta is doubling down on its relationship with Nvidia in what the AI chip giant called a \"multigenerational\" deal.\n\nThe agreement, announced Tuesday, calls for Meta to build data centers powered by millions of Nvidia's current and next-generation chips for AI training and inference.\n\nThe move underscores how Meta is deepening its reliance on Nvidia, even as the social networking giant develops its own in-house chips and works with competing suppliers like AMD. Reports also suggested Meta has explored using TPUs — chips designed by its rival, Google.\n\nThe Nvidia deal could cool speculation around Meta's purported TPU talks, said Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy — though Big Tech companies often test several suppliers at the same time.\n\nThe deal arrives amid increased competition in AI infrastructure. While Nvidia leads the market, rivals including Google, AMD, and Broadcom are working to chip away at its dominance.\n\nCrucially, the partnership will see Meta deploy not only Nvidia's GPUs, but also CPUs.\n\nCPUs, long dominated by Intel and AMD, are the central processors that work with GPUs inside data centers. They're used for general computing tasks and are core to essentially all modern computing systems, whereas GPUs are used in specialized cases that require more compute power, such as AI training and graphics in gaming. By supplying both, Nvidia stands to capture even more spend and deepen its role within Meta's AI stack.\n\nWhile that increases competitive pressure, Moorhead said the demand for infrastructure has become so high that Nvidia's rivals will unlikely see outright declines in the near term.\n\nNvidia has been making its CPU ambitions more explicit, Moorhead said, including marketing its forthcoming Vera CPU as a stand-alone product. This emphasis reflects how CPUs play a larger role as AI workloads move beyond model training and toward inference.\n\n\"CPUs tend to be cheaper and a bit more power-efficient for inference,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group.\n\nBoth Moorhead and Enderle said that Meta's decision to source both GPUs and CPUs from a single vendor can also reduce complexity, with chief information officers often favoring a \"one-throat-to-choke\" approach to problem resolution.\n\nIn addition to GPUs and CPUs, Meta will use Nvidia's networking equipment inside data centers as part of the deal, as well as its confidential computing technology to run AI features within WhatsApp.\n\nThe companies will also work together to deploy Nvidia's next-generation Vera CPUs beyond the current Grace CPU model, Nvidia said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "8 luxury crossbody bags that are worth the splurge, according to style editors",
    "description": "I prefer crossbody bags for their comfort and convenience. These luxury picks stood out for their beautiful materials and thoughtful design details.",
    "fullText": "I was standing in a shivering mass of well-dressed spectators in the Upper East Side this past New York Fashion Week. Among them I noticed a subtle trend: accessories with a practical edge, like deep pockets, adjustable fastenings, and an emphasis on comfort.\n\nLuxury crossbody bags embody this utilitarian aesthetic. You can sling one on and carry it hands-free, and because their weight is distributed more evenly than with a shoulder bag, they're also the most comfortable travel purse.\n\nBeyond their high-quality materials and stylish designs, our favorite luxury crossbody bags we've tested also come with intuitive pockets to keep you organized whether you're exploring a new city, running a quick errand, or attending a formal event.\n\nI used to be the type who would stuff everything in my pockets so I wouldn't have to hold anything while I'm out. But since investing in the form and function of a luxury crossbody bag, I can see the appeal of being a purse girl. Here are 8 splurge-worthy styles that will work hard while adding intrigue to your outfit.\n\nSee \n\nI brought along this luxury crossbody bag from Parisa Wang when I traveled to Rhode Island for my best friend's wedding. Parisa Wang partners with artisans who typically work with top luxury brands like The Row and Prada, and you can tell by the elite craftsmanship. It starts at the very bottom with tiny gold feet that protects the yummy chocolate suede from coming into contact with the floor.\n\nOn its sides are slip pockets that snap shut on their own with a satisfying magnetic closure, and inside is a wide main compartment where you can easily fit a variety of bulbous items (overpackers rejoice). The long strap is removable, so I carried it is as a handbag anytime I wasn't wearing it slung over my shoulder.\n\nThe Gabrielle comes in two larger sizes, as described by style editor Samantha Crozier in our guide to the best work bags for women. \"The Gabrielle 35 looks and feels like the ultra-coveted suede Margaux bag from The Row, which will run you $5K or more,\" she writes. '\"But dare I say that the Gabrielle is cuter?\"\n\nThis brand is literally fit for royals, as it's been spotted on Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. It's not a traditional work bag — you won't find a padded laptop sleeve or built-in tech compartments — but the Strathberry Tote is considered a holy grail over on the Reddit's r/handbags forum as a luxury office purse.\n\nThe mid-tier luxury brand has a reputation for delivering exceptional materials and meticulous construction at a price that, while still a splurge, feels justified in the luxury space. Each Strathberry bag takes an artisan at least 20 hours to complete, and that care is evident the moment you see it up close. The stitching is precise, the leather feels rich and substantial, and the suede lining is soft to the touch.\n\nIts signature music bar hardware is weighty, polished, and unmistakably luxe — the kind of detail that elevates even the simplest outfit. It also comes in Midi and Mini sizes.\n\nTravel writer Maria Yagoda tested the best travel purses, where this versatile Lo & Sons bag came out on top. \n\n\"The interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder,\" according to Maria.\n\n\"In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options,\" she continues.\n\n\"The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable.\"\n\nMy own favorite part about the Aoyama is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder. Just don't get the Ivory colorway, since I found it stains more easily.\n\nRead \n\n\"KAAI's Rebel Crossbody is the Rolex of functional purses,\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. The Belgian brand created this luxury crossbody bag with a unique, asymmetrical design and a long strap that can easily fit over a puffy jacket.\n\n\"Like all of KAAI's beautifully made bags, it's lined with a blue suede material that feels luxurious to the touch. On the outside, the single-source leather is treated to be resistant to weather and stains. This is super important to me, since I wouldn't carry a bag this nice outside without trusting how well the leather can stand up to the elements. But all my KAAI bags have remained like-new, even though they're some of my most used pieces,\" continues Samantha.\n\n\"The only issue with this bag is that it is relatively narrow and structured, so you won't be able to stuff it,\" she advises. \"A phone, wallet, lipstick, and keys fit perfectly, but anything bulky or irregular would prevent the bag from closing.\"\n\nI tested the Petite version of one of Clare V's bestselling styles, the Moyen Messenger. The Petit is one of my favorite crossbody bags I own, but the larger size has a more practical advantage with the same relaxed, woven leather look. And I know this bag is a hot commodity because sure enough, Quince has its own dupe. \n\nClare V. is a Los Angeles-based brand that makes what I call 'character bags.' You can build an outfit around them and make them your own with their extensive collection of interchangeable straps. I'm not a huge bag charm person myself, but the D-rings on this luxury crossbody make it the perfect backdrop for colorful key chains.\n\nThe medium-sized Moyen Messenger comes with two straps, so you can wear it as a shoulder bag or a crossbody. It has a slouchy, curved construction like the hobo bags that are making a return. Even better: the soft, flexible leather lies flat, so I'm easily able to pack it in my carry-on.\n\nThe Mini Maestra from Senreve takes modular design to another level. This 4-in-1 luxury crossbody can also be worn as a tote, satchel, or backpack, depending on whatever you need it to be. The top features a flap and the Senreve's signature studded belt closure, and inside is a zipper to secure your belongings. \n\nExecutive editor Sally Kaplan tested out the full-sized Maestra as a luxury work bag and confirmed it to be worth the splurge. Besides its fashion-forward shape, the 100% leather is seriously high-quality. It comes in both pebbled and long-grain finishes, and inside it's lined with smooth suede. This premium leather is also water-repellent, so you can wear it out in the rain without fussing over stains. Plus, it comes with a lifetime warranty.\n\nSee similar styles in our guide to the best convertible backpack tote bags.\n\nI was inspired to test out this style when I was getting ready to go out with my friend, and she asked me if my bag was a Polène. In fact, it was from Quince. But when a Quince dupe can pass for French luxury, it makes me skeptical that the real deal could be any good to begin with.\n\nInstead, I was happily proven wrong. The 'Cognac' shade of the Numéro Dix is the perfect color for people who wear similar gourmand shades like chocolate and almond. It's made with a single panel of structured, full-grain leather that has a deliciously rich sheen.\n\nIt also beats out the Quince dupe in terms of storage capacity. Because the crescent shape has a flared base, I can fill it from the bottom up with my everyday carry. I've only worn mine as a crossbody or shoulder bag, but it also converts to a belt bag and the adjustable strap extension means it can fit a tall frame. There's now a JW Pei dupe of the same style.\n\nThe real Numéro Dix feels worth the splurge because it's a true heritage piece and the materials are primed to age gracefully. The simple, stylish shape puts an elevated twist on the contemporary saddle silhouette.\n\n\"Despite its teeny-tiny silhouette, this miniature crossbody can hold a surprising amount of items,\" writes freelance style reporter Talia Ergas. If you're getting your looks together for vacation season, Talia found the artisan-made Milaner Grazia Mini to be the perfect little clutch for tying your whole outfit together.\n\n\"My iPhone fits effortlessly across the bottom, and there's plenty of room for my sunglasses, a small wallet, and some odds and ends like mints and a chapstick,\" Talia writes. \"I love this hand-woven leather bag because it has the elegance of a clutch with the ease and comfort of a crossbody bag. The strap is removable, though, which is convenient for occasions when I might prefer to swap in its shorter strap for a wristlet.\"\n\nYou can tell a luxury crossbody bag by its intuitive design details, artisan-level craftsmanship, and longevity. Our favorites are typically made from high-quality leather — like full-grain or pebbled Italian leather — and feature precise stitching, durable hardware, and thoughtfully-placed pockets. The result is a versatile accessory that will age gracefully despite regular wear.\n\nBetween small and medium is best if you want something to comfortably weigh on your shoulder. A small bag that's about 8 inches wide will fit only the essentials, but be more streamlined to carry. Medium crossbody bags of about 14 inches offer a bit more space for a small tablet or a bulky sunglasses case.\n\nA luxury crossbody bag typically uses higher-quality materials — like full-grain leather, suede lining, and solid metal accents — that hold up significantly better over time. Cheaper bags will instead use bonded leather or flimsy hardware that can peel, scratch, or tarnish quickly. If you carry a bag daily, think about in terms of cost-per-wear. The durability of a luxury crossbody bag will prove itself in the long run.\n\nCrossbodies are already practical by design — they keep your hands free, and many of our favorites can be converted into a shoulder bag. A luxury version elevates that functionality with easy-to-carry proportions, reinforced stitching, smooth straps that don't dig into your shoulder, and scratch-resistant, water-repellent materials.\n\nYes. As someone who used to try and carry everything in my pockets, I found that luxury crossbody bags are the easiest gateway into stylish personal organization — especially if you prefer a lighter load. A well-designed crossbody prioritizes smart compartments and a streamlined shape, so you don't feel the bulk as you go about your business.\n\nRead how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "title": "What Are Heart Rate Zones, and How Can You Find Yours?",
    "description": "For when you need to be in \"zone 2\" and have no idea what that is.",
    "fullText": "Heart rate zones are a way to describe how hard you're working during a cardio workout, like running or cycling. The faster your heart beats, the harder you're working. So an easy jog might have you in zone 2 for a whole workout, while a HIIT workout might have you bouncing between zones 1 and 5. Read on for a breakdown of what heart rate zones are, how to use them, and some of the caveats you should know when you're training this way.\n\nOne quick thing before we dive in: Heart rate zones are for cardio. Cardio means exercise that involves doing the same rhythmic movement over and over, like running or swimming or stair climbing. Heart rate zones mean nothing for strength training, even if you have an app or watch that reports them to you as if they matter.\n\nWhen you do cardio, your heart has to beat faster to get nutrients and oxygen to your muscles. Your heart rate is the number of time your heart beats in each minute. So if you can easily measure your heart rate—which fitness watches and trackers can—then you have a number that tells you how hard you're working.\n\nThe exact numbers you'll see for hard and easy workouts are different for everybody, so we have the idea of heart rate \"zones.\" Depending on exactly how your watch or app calculates it, you might see something like a \"zone 2\" when your heart rate is between 50% and 70% of maximum. A workout that goes a bit harder might put you into zone 3. In many systems the highest zone, for the very hardest parts of the hardest workouts, is zone 5.\n\nOnce you know your zones, you can follow workouts or targets for those zones. For example, you might go jogging and try to keep your heart rate in zone 2 for 30 minutes. Then on another day, you might do a workout that aims to have you cycling hard in zone 4 for several minutes at a time, with recovery time where you pedal easy in zone 1.\n\nEach zone has its benefits. Most commonly you'll hear people talking about the low-fatigue aerobic work of zone 2, or the benefits of tempo work that mostly happens in zone 4. But there's a lot to be said for getting a variety of work in all different zones. Every zone is good for you, even the zone 3 that is sometimes incorrectly painted as a \"gray zone\" where nothing happens. (Hot take: Zone 3 is great and most of us could use a little more of it.)\n\nBefore I tell you how to find and use your zones, I'm going to start with a huge caveat. You may hear everybody talking about zone this and zone that, but if you're new to exercise or new to heart rate tracking, you're actually better off ignoring zones for a while. Pay more attention to how you feel. A workout that's meant to be easy should feel easy, regardless of what number is on your heart rate monitor. A workout that's meant to be hard should feel hard.\n\nOver time, if you watch your heart rate during exercise, you'll start to notice which numbers go with which feelings. Knowing that you see (for example) 140 on your watch when you're in the middle of an easy workout means a lot more than knowing that your device considers it to be \"zone 2.\"\n\nZone workouts are hard for beginners to follow, for a few reasons:\n\nYour zones may be hard to stay in, especially the lower zones like zone 2. If your heart rate skyrockets into zone 4 as soon as you start to jog, a zone 2 jog may just not be possible right now.\n\nYour zones may not be properly calibrated. You need an accurate max heart rate to set your zones properly (more on that below), and an age-based formula is not guaranteed to be correct.\n\nYou have more important things to do than stick to zones! Your body needs to learn technique, pacing, and all kinds of physical and psychological skills. Every brain cell you spend on obsessing over zones is a brain cell that's not available for the more important tasks before you.\n\nRemember, the reason your watch tells you your heart rate is because that's something that is easy for the watch to measure and display—not because it's the most important thing for you to pay attention to.\n\nThere isn't just one heart rate zone system! There are dozens, if not hundreds. Some have three zones, some four, some five, and some even more. Even when two apps or wearables use a five-zone system, they don't necessarily set the boundaries of the zones in the same places. For example, some systems will set \"zone 2\" at 60% to 70% of your max heart rate, while others will use 65% to 75%.\n\nThe different systems also don't agree on what those percentages are of. Sometimes it's maximum heart rate, which we'll discuss below; sometimes it's heart rate reserve, which also takes your resting heart rate into account. Less commonly, you might find zones based around other metrics like lactate threshold.\n\nI know you're not going to be happy until you see me set out a chart of numbers, so here goes. This is not the only zone system out there, but it's one that works decently well for most purposes, and you'll find versions of it in several different apps and wearables. It's not the best, but it is perhaps the simplest. You'll need to know your maximum heart rate (MHR), and then you can take percentages of that to know your zones:\n\nZone 1: 50% to 60% of your maximum heart rate (MHR), though some systems will go up to 65%\n\nZone 2: 61% to 70% of MHR; some systems will go up to 75%\n\nZone 3: 71% to 80%, or it might be more like 76% to 85%\n\nZone 4: 80% to 90%, or sometimes 85% to 95%\n\nIn these systems, zone 1 is for warmups or very easy recovery between intervals. Zone 2 is for easy aerobic training, like a light jog—something you could keep up for hours if you're reasonably fit. Zone 3 is for stuff that feels like a medium intensity, like a faster jog, something that would tire you out to do for more than an hour, but you can keep it up pretty steadily. Zone 4 is when things get intense, usually for just a few minutes at a time, and you’ll only bump in zone 5 for a few seconds during your hardest intervals. You can’t sustain work in zone 5 for much longer than that.\n\nNow that you know the zones, you’re only missing one thing: your maximum heart rate, which forms the basis for them all.\n\nCommonly, these systems will recommend you subtract your age from the number 220 to find your max heart rate. Occasionally they’ll use another formula. But these formulas are often wrong, since they give a single number for everybody at the same age. We're supposed to believe all 43-year-olds have a max heart rate of 177, but in reality there are plenty of 43-year-olds with a max heart rate over 200, and it's not rare to find some 43-year-olds with a max heart rate in the 150s. (Similar caveats apply to any age.) The person with the 200 max will wonder why they're always in \"zone 4\" when they feel like they're in zone 2, and the person with the 150 max will wonder why they feel like they're dying when they're in \"zone 3.\"\n\nSo don't rely on a formula, especially if you're seeing zones that don't make sense for how a workout felt. Ideally you’ll do a max heart rate test as I describe here, or make an educated guess by looking up the highest heart rate that your device recorded during one of your hardest workouts.\n\nYou can do a little reality check on your zones by making sure they feel right. Here's what they should feel like:\n\nZone 1 will feel very easy, barely like you’re exercising at all.\n\nIn zone 2, you’ll start to feel hot and sweaty, but you can still easily carry on a conversation.\n\nIn zone 3, your breathing will get a bit heavier. The lower end of zone 3 is still conversational, but toward the top of this zone you’ll only be able to say a few words at a time.\n\nIn zone 4, you’re working hard and not in the mood to talk, but you probably feel like you could keep this effort up for a while—or a few more minutes at least.\n\nZone 5 is your absolute top speed, and you can only stand it for a few grueling seconds.\n\nIf you aren’t sure of your max heart rate, try using this effort-level guide for a while. When you actually do get to a workout that calls for zone 5, give it your all—then check your heart rate monitor to see what number it gave you.\n\nI have more on zone 2 here, including what it is, how to do it, and why it might be just a teensy bit overrated. Zone 2 refers to an easy effort that you can carry on basically forever. If you're a beginner, walking might be a zone 2 workout. For an athlete, zone 2 might be a brisk jog that they could keep up for a few hours. The best marker of a zone 2 workout is that you stop because time is up, not because you're too tired to continue.\n\nThere's nothing special about staying in zone 2, except that it's low-fatigue and so you can do a lot of it. If you find your heart rate inching up into zone 3, that's honestly totally fine. The more exercise you do, the more you have to pay attention to the intensity of it. Athletes who are exercising 10 hours every week need to make sure that some of those workouts are easy ones. But if you're getting in a few 30-minute jogs or exercises classes, any intensity is fine so long as you end most workouts feeling good and not totally exhausted.",

    "title": "My Favorite Ways to Upgrade a Laundry Room on a Budget",
    "description": "Laundry rooms can be grim, utilitarian places—but they don’t have to be.",
    "fullText": "As anyone who’s ever had to schlep their dirty linens to a laundromat knows, having in-house laundry is a godsend. But the convenience of doing laundry whenever you feel like it starts to feel less convenient if you're lacking in the necessary storage, shelving, or work space. If a total laundry room renovation isn't in the budget, though, don't fret: You can upgrade your home's laundry hub with just a few relatively inexpensive additions. Combined with some fresh paint and some other low-cost improvements, you can have a more beautiful and functional laundry area on a small budget.\n\nIf you’ve got a separate washer and dryer setup in your laundry area, picking up some appliance pedestals with built-in drawers is an easy way to add some useful storage. You’ll need to measure vertically in your laundry space to make sure you’ve got the required height, and you’ll probably need some help moving and lifting the appliances into place. But once that’s done, you’ll not only have a place to store all those unsightly bottles of detergent and other stuff, it will be easier to load and unload your clothes because you won’t have to bend down so far.\n\nIf your laundry area is its own room with a door, you can maximize your storage space by adding a slim shelving unit behind the door. It will be just deep enough to hold all your laundry materials, cleaning up the area without taking up any valuable floor space.\n\nIf your laundry area lacks storage, you’ve got a few options. One of the easiest things you can do is to add a countertop over your washer and dryer set. This could be as DIY as cutting a slab of wood or using a leftover remnant from a kitchen remodel, or you could purchase a topper with edge rails like this one. This instantly transforms the top of your appliances into a usable flat surface that won’t let things slide off as soon as you turn your back. If you have more vertical space and need more options, a tiered over-the-appliance shelf system is a great option, giving you multiple shelves plus hanging rods to get everything off the floor and organized.\n\nEven if you only iron your clothes once in a while, having a real ironing board makes a huge difference, and having that ironing board conveniently located near your laundry is ideal. If you have nothing but space, you can just have a board set up, of course, but if you don’t have a ton of space, or you’re just looking to keep the place tidy, you could opt for an over-the-door ironing board or a wall-mounted version like this. The board folds up when not in use, but is always easily accessible.\n\nIf you want a fancy version, you could install the Iron-A-Way Ironing Center, which is pricey and probably requires professional installation, as it’s designed to recess into the wall and connect to the home’s power.\n\nHaving a utility sink in the laundry area is great—it lets you rinse out clothes, clean up detergent spills, and wet-scrub stains right there. If your laundry area isn’t plumbed, you might not relish the idea of hiring a plumber to run water and drain lines for a sink—but you don’t have to. This portable sink can give you that basic functionality without any wiring or plumbing. Just fill it with water, charge it using a USB-C cable, and place it in your laundry area to use whenever you need it.\n\nIt’s a simple addition, but having a place to hang clothes to dry right there in the laundry area is a great convenience. You can buy a freestanding drying rack, of course, but as an upgrade, consider a wall-mounted option instead. This one from mDesign looks great and folds up when not in use.\n\nDispensing liquid detergent can get messy, and when you’re in a rush, those measurements can get sloppy, too, leaving you with insufficient detergent for the load or wasting detergent, running up your costs. This rechargeable electronic detergent dispenser fits on top of most plastic detergent bottles and dispenses precise amounts of detergent with the touch of a button. If that’s a bit too fancy for your laundry area, you could pick up a cheap dispenser cup holder like this to make it a little easier and neater to fill your detergent cups.\n\nIf you need some folding and storage space in your laundry area but there’s no vertical or wall options, take some inspiration from your kitchen and bring in a freestanding island or laundry cart. This one from Kitsorack is a clothes hamper with a shelf, so you can stuff your dirty clothes in there and have your supplies stored on top, but any mobile cart or island will make your laundry area more usable.",

    "description": "Meta is weighing facial recognition for its Ray-Ban smart glasses, raising serious privacy concerns.",
    "fullText": "According to a New York Times report, Meta plans to add facial recognition technology to its Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses. The feature, called “Name Tag” within Meta, would allow users to identify people and get information about them through Meta's AI. The feature could be rolling out as early as this year.\n\nAdding the feature is not a done deal, however. According to an internal document cited by The Times, the company is weighing the “safety and privacy risks\" of introducing facial recognition as well as discussing how to navigate the response to a no-doubt controversial feature.\n\nA document quoted by The Times suggests Meta is deliberately timing a potential rollout to minimize scrutiny. “We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document from Meta’s Reality Labs reads.\n\nThis would not be the first time Meta dabbled in facial recognition. Meta debated adding facial recognition to the first generation of its Ray-Ban smart glasses in 2021, but decided against it due to privacy concerns. And Facebook, Meta's social media platform, identified and tagged people as early as 2010, but the company pulled the feature in 2021, citing \"many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society.”\n\nConcerns also include the risk of doxxing. The ACLU characterized facial recognition used by law enforcement as a \"systematic invasion of privacy,\" though personal use of the technology raises different issues. Facial recognition glasses could enable instant doxxing, linking anyone's face to publicly available information, including social media profiles, addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nMeta says it isn't planning to release a universal facial recognition tool. The company is considering glasses that identify only people a user knows based on their connection on a Meta platform, or only identify people who have a public account on a Meta site like Instagram. \"While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature—and some products already exist in the market—we’re still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out,\" Meta said in a statement.\n\nPrivacy concerns aside, the technology has genuinely beneficial applications, particularly to people with vision problems. According to The Times' report, Meta originally planned to introduce Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the blind before releasing it to the public, highlighting a group that could potentially benefit from facial recognition technology, though that plan was scrapped for unknown reasons.\n\nMike Buckley, CEO of Be My Eyes, an accessibility technology company that works closely with Meta, said he has been in discussions with Meta about facial recognition glasses for more than a year. “It is so important and powerful for this group of humans,” Buckley told The Times.",

    "description": "This is a great chance to get the latest budget-friendly Pixel.",
    "fullText": "Google is releasing their budget a-series version of the Pixel 10 on March 5, a whole month earlier than the 9a was released in 2025. There is not much dividing the 10a from the 9a, but there are a few software updates that can make it worth it for some people. Throw in a $100 Amazon gift card, and it's hard to say no. Google has the pre-orders for the Google 10a out already, going for $499, plus the gift card. Alternatively, you can get their Pixel Buds 2a instead of the $100 gift card for the same $499 price.\n\nLifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt actually got her hands on the Pixel 10a during a recent Google demo event. As she pointed out, the specs on the Pixel 10a are not like the Pixel 10. It's more similar to the 9 instead. It has a Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage, as well as the same camera system, with a 48MP main lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera. The battery life is the same 30+ hours, too, and the MagSafe-like Pixelsnap feature is gone. The main upgrade here is a brighter 3,000 nits screen, a thinner bezel, and an improved Corning Gorilla Glass 7i cover glass. But the value might be in the software and AI.\n\nThere are two AI camera features that debuted with the Pixel 10. One is Auto Best Take, which takes 150 frames in one click, chooses the best picture, and automatically deletes the rest (or stitches together elements from multiple shots to make a new \"best\" image). And Camera Coach, which guides you with AI on how to take the best picture. Google also brought Satellite SOS for the first time to an a-series phone. It lets you connect to a Satellite and ping emergency services for help if you have no cell signal.\n\nIf you're thinking of upgrading from a Pixel 9a or later, there's not much here to make it worth it. However, if you have anything older than a Pixel 9 or are switching to Pixel for the first time, this is a great opportunity and phone to do so.",

    "title": "My Favorite 'Glances' From Garmin’s Latest Software Update",
    "description": "Garmin added sleep alignment, lifestyle logging, and battery usage, plus new training plans.",
    "fullText": "A new software update for recent Garmin watches adds “glances” for types of data that weren’t previously viewable from the watch face. These include battery usage stats, lifestyle logging, sleep alignment, and even a few extras like sports scores. The update also includes features other than glances, including, notably, fitness coaching. The features I’m writing about are now available in the Forerunner 570, Forerunner 970, and Vivoactive 6, as well as the Fenix 8 series, Venu 4, and X1. (The watch in my photos here is a Forerunner 570.)\n\nGlances are those little strips of data that you can see when you scroll up (or down) from the main watch face—things like the weather and your training status, for example. Garmin’s newest stable update for the Forerunner 570 and 970 is numbered 16.28, and has been rolling out slowly over the past week. (I just got it on my 570.) Here are my favorite new glances:\n\nBattery usage: The new battery widget has the charge level, of course, but tapping it shows you a graph of your battery life, including its long-term history, and a list of which apps or functions have been using the most battery.\n\nLifestyle logging: If you’ve been using the new Lifestyle Logging feature in the Garmin Connect app, you can now do it from your wrist. This is where you select a few health-related habits to track every day. The glance will tell you how many items you’ve logged today, and you can quickly answer these yes or no questions without opening your phone.\n\nSleep alignment: The sleep glance has been around a while, but it now includes more data, including your optimal sleep window and whether you’re aligned with it.\n\nSports scores: You can select a handful of your favorite teams to receive up to date scores on your wrist. This was surprisingly easy to set up without even unlocking my phone: You just choose a league (MLB, NFL, NCAA men’s or women’s, to name a few) and then scroll until you find the city name for your favorite team. Alphabetizing by city rather than team name is smart, especially if you’re going through the menus picking all your hometown teams. This widget seems to show the next upcoming game if your chosen team hasn’t played a recent game.\n\nWeight tracking: From this glance you can see your current body weight, and tap through to see trends and history.\n\nBesides the glances, Garmin added a bunch of other features to its watches. According to the release notes, Garmin says that pace readings (presumably during runs) have been improved to be more responsive. I look forward to trying that out. There are also color filters—instead of just turning on a red shift for nighttime, you can choose other colors as well.\n\nTraining plans also get more capabilities. In addition to the usual running and cycling plans, there’s now a fitness coach, similar to what launched on the Venu 4. This lets you set up a plan that gives you a mix of cardio and strength workouts, though I found that the coach's endurance workouts don’t actually specify the activity. Typically, when selecting my “basic endurance” workout that’s planned for today, the watch prompts me to select from my usual list of endurance activities: run, trail run, treadmill run, indoor bike, and so on. The coach, however, will simply tell you to do \"endurance\" or \"cardio\" for 20 minutes. You could choose to run, but you could also hike or use the elliptical, for instance.\n\nFor the strength workouts, I told the coach that I have access to a full gym, so my next strength workout will include deadlifts and squats. It looks like a pretty solid plan for somebody who wants well-rounded fitness without committing to running a race.",

    "description": "Google is prepping to reveal new features in May.",
    "fullText": "Google I/O 2026 is nearly upon us. This is Google's annual opportunity to showcase the software features (and perhaps some of the hardware) the company has been cooking up behind the scenes. Like other big tech keynotes, anyone can tune in live and catch Google's latest announcements as they happen. Here's when Google I/O 2026 will kick off, and what we know about the conference at this time.\n\nGoogle tends to kick off its I/O event in May of each year, and 2026 is no different. This year, Google I/O will run May 19 through May 20. If you're used to watching one single livestream, that two-day schedule might come as a surprise. But I/O isn't just an announcement: It's a developer conference, spanning keynotes, demos, and product sessions.\n\nBut if you're only interested in the company's main keynote, you'll want to get May 19 on your calendar. Google hasn't announced the exact time for its presentation, but it usually starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET), based on previous years.\n\nWhile Google invites a select group of journalists to watch its presentations live, and encourages developers to register to attend its various events, you can tune into the livestream wherever you are in the world. Google hasn't confirmed where its livestreams will be hosted this year, but looking to the past, you'll likely be able to stream the keynote from the official I/O website, as well as Google's official YouTube channel.\n\nThe short answer? We don't really know! Google is keeping I/O news close to the vest, and rumors haven't been particularly prolific this year—at least, not yet. Seeing as it's only February, it's entirely possible we'll hear more about Google I/O 2026 as we get closer to May.\n\nThat said, there are some things you can expect to see regardless of leaks and rumors. Android 17 will almost assuredly take center stage at Google I/O this year. Google just released first beta for the OS on Wednesday, though it doesn't change all that much about Android 16 at this time. That said, I suspect beta testers will discover a number of new features and changes between now and May, as Google continues to add new things to its test software ahead I/O.\n\nLike the past couple of I/O's, this year should also be all about AI. Google seems to come out with new AI announcements multiple times a week, including adding its Lyria 3 AI music model to Gemini, or adding an agentic bot to Chrome to browse the internet for you. I expect Google I/O 2026 to be full of AI features—perhaps more than some of us would like to hear about.\n\nI/O 2026 could also show off some hardware, but that's no guarantee. Google did just announce the Pixel 10a, the company's latest \"budget\" phone, and it could reveal other devices in May, but I/O really is more about the software than the hardware. (It is a developer conference, after all.)",

    "title": "Apple Is Adding ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to CarPlay in iOS 26.4",
    "description": "You'll need to wait for a new update to try it.",
    "fullText": "When Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.4 this week, testers immediately got to work looking for each and every new feature and change. To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\n\nAs spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.\n\nAccording to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant.\n\nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n\nThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.",

Round three and an opportunity for Scotland to properly put themselves in the mix for the title.\n\nThe emotional and physical energy expended in delivering these incredible Calcutta Cup victories has proved hard for Scotland to recover from and then replicate.\n\nScotland bounced back brilliantly from the gut punch of defeat to Italy in Rome to dispatch England in sensational fashion, but the memories of the Stadio Olimpico will remain with them, serving as a cautionary tale as they prepare to face a Wales side at a low ebb.\n\n\"We'll obviously be sitting there with Italy in the back of our mind and that performance,\" Scotland second row Scott Cummings said.\n\n\"We know that we can't let our performance dip to that point again. We know that we can push on and we believe we can push on. But the weekend was just a start for us, now we need to back it up.\n\n\"In the nicest way possible, we've beaten England before. We've done this before in the Six Nations quite a few times and we probably haven't backed it up after that, so that's definitely a big focus for us.\"\n\nPodcast: Can Scotland back it up?\n\nScotland trio ruled out for visit to Wales\n\nThe latest Scottish rugby news, views & analysis\n\nCaptain Sione Tuipulotu spoke before the England match about how Scotland were \"a desperate team\" with their Six Nations hopes on the line.\n\nThat desperation for a win surely applies to Wales this weekend.\n\nSteve Tandy, the former Scotland defence coach now in charge of Wales, has watched his side get battered in their opening two matches against England and France.\n\nThey sit bottom of the table having scored only 19 points across two games while conceding 102.\n\nFrance ran riot with eight tries in Cardiff to consign Wales to a 13th consecutive Six Nations defeat.\n\nYet Scotland have had enough bad experiences in Cardiff to never take a victory for granted, even with Welsh rugby in dire straits.\n\n\"I obviously know some of their coaching staff, Steve Tandy and [former Glasgow head coach] Danny Wilson,\" Cummings said.\n\n\"They'll be obviously pretty up for this game, having worked with us in the past.\n\n\"We're expecting a pretty solid, gritty performance from them, and they'll definitely be tough to break down.\n\n\"They're going to be a team that's obviously hurting and, like we were last week, that often brings the best out in teams. So we're expecting a massive fight from them.\n\n\"I want the heat on us. We need to view every single moment as the most important moment of the match. If we don't, then I don't think we'll get the win out of it. So I don't think the pressure's off us.\n\n\"In international rugby, the pressure's always on you to perform well. I think for us it's going to be a massive game, but we're definitely not resting on the weekend being a finished performance.\"",

    "fullText": "There has been a very interesting question on the OSM US Slack lately.\n\n“Does anyone have a method to search through the OSM database for a building of a particular shape? I need assistance finding OSM buildings with this specific shape. They should be located in NJ, DE, northeastern MD, eastern PA, or southern NY.”\n\nThe question quickly exploded into a huge discussion. At the time of writing, there are already 71 replies.\n\n“You could load OSM buildings into PostGIS and then use ST_HausdorffDistance to compare the geometries.”\n\nFrom there, the discussion veered into how to solve that specific puzzle and find the exact OSM building in question.\n\nOne person added, “So the strategy is: create the shape of the building you want to search for, scale it to, say, fill a 100x100 m bounding box or something. Ask Postgres to, within a search-area bounding box, take each building and scale it to a 100x100 m bounding box, compute the Hausdorff distance with the scaled input shape, and return all OSM element IDs and their Hausdorff distances, sorted in ascending order.”\n\nAnother said, “What I’m currently doing is combining several shape exports into a single file with around 20,000 objects that have concavity. Concavity plus more than 10 nodes eliminates most buildings.”\n\nAt that point, instead of hunting that elusive specific OSM building, I became more interested in the generalized version of the problem.\n\nSo I added my two cents to the discussion:\n\n“The generalized version of this problem would be : Can we represent a shape in some kind of data type that allows us to computationally check whether two objects have the same shape, regardless of rotation and scaling?\n\nI haven’t studied the Hausdorff distance yet, but I’m wondering whether it can solve this problem, or if there’s a better alternative—Hu moments, Procrustes analysis, Fourier descriptors for contours…”\n\n“Hu moments are a good option. Elliptic Fourier Descriptors, Shape Context Histograms, Turning functions, etc. I’ve experimented with those four while trying to classify sports pitches more accurately. You can actually get pretty far with just compactness, convexity, and aspect ratio, thankfully.”\n\nDo you have any other ideas on how to solve this problem?",

    "fullText": "The Gemini app now features our most advanced music generation model Lyria 3, empowering anyone to make 30-second tracks using text or images in beta.\n\nSince launching the Gemini app, we've built tools to encourage creative expression through images and video. Today, we're taking the next step: custom music generation. Lyria 3, Google DeepMind’s latest generative music model, is rolling out today in beta in the Gemini app. Just describe an idea or upload a photo, like “a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" and in a matter of seconds, Gemini will translate it into a high-quality, catchy track. To push the creative envelope further, you can even ask Gemini to take inspiration from something you upload.\n\nLyria 3 improves on audio generation from our Lyria models in three important ways:\n\nThe Gemini app creates 30-second tracks with custom cover art generated by Nano Banana. This makes it easy to quickly share with friends by downloading or simply clicking the share link. The goal of these tracks isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\n\nCreators can also explore Lyria 3 on YouTube’s Dream Track. Available in the U.S. and now rolling out to YouTube creators in other countries, Lyria 3 will enhance the quality of each unique Shorts soundtrack. Whether it's creating a lyrical verse or a vibey backing track, being able to better customize the soundtrack will take creators’ Shorts to the next level.\n\nAll tracks generated in the Gemini app are embedded with SynthID, our imperceptible watermark for identifying Google AI-generated content. We are also giving you more tools to help identify AI content, broadening our verification capabilities in the Gemini app to include audio, along with image and video. Simply upload a file and ask if it was generated using Google AI, and Gemini will check for SynthID and use its own reasoning to return a response.\n\nSince we first launched Lyria in 2023, we've sought to develop this technology responsibly in collaboration with the music community. We've learned a lot through these collaborations and our experiments, like Music AI Sandbox, and have been very mindful of copyright and partner agreements as we've trained Lyria 3.\n\nMusic generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content. We recognize that our approach might not be foolproof, so you can report content that may violate your rights or the rights of others. Additionally, in order to use our products, users must adhere to our Terms of Service and Gen AI prohibited use policies, which prohibit violations of others’ intellectual property and privacy rights.\n\nLyria 3 is available in the Gemini app for all users 18+ in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean and Portuguese, with plans to expand quality and coverage of more languages, rolling out on desktop today and to the mobile app over the next several days. And Google AI Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers will enjoy higher limits.\n\nOur goal with music generation in the Gemini app is to help you add a fun, custom soundtrack to your daily life.

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "You're migrating your monolith to microservices. The architecture is already clear: event-driven, async messaging, specific latency requirements. You just need help implementing it. Or you're fixing a bug. You know what's broken and what needs to stay the same. You want a surgical fix. What's the best way to work with an agent to achieve these goals without changing other parts of your app, or wasting tokens going in circles?\n\nWhen we launched Specs and the spec-driven development workflow, we built them around the traditional PM/engineering flow: requirements first, then design, then tasks. This works great for many projects and we’ve seen hundreds of thousands of developers default to this approach when building anything new.\n\nHowever, when we talked to Kiro users, we heard a clear pattern: not everyone starts from requirements. Especially when working on existing, brownfield apps, some developers came in with the technical architecture already mapped out. Others were fixing bugs and needed to carefully define what should change and what shouldn't. They didn't want to give up the structure of specs, but the current flow was not flexible enough for these types of tasks.\n\nWe didn’t want to ask developers to change how they were already approaching these projects, so today, we're shipping two new ways to use Specs: the Design-first workflow and the Bugfix Spec.\n\nWhen we first designed Specs, we were motivated by what Laurence Tratt calls \"the circular specification problem\" and \"the observer effect\" in software development. Tratt identifies a fundamental tension: the only way to know exactly what software we want to build is to fully specify it, but a complete specification is at least as much work as creating the software itself. This creates a catch-22 where we have to build the software to truly specify it. This is wishful thinking, especially for large projects. As Tratt observes, software occupies a \"liminal state\" between fantasy and reality—full of soft constraints that are hard to quantify until you actually build something. The act of creating software is itself an act of specification. That doesn’t mean working with no plan, but reaching a middle-ground that gives you enough structure so you can make progress quickly.\n\nRequirements-first and Design-first are two sides of the same coin, each addressing different aspects of this circular specification problem:\n\nRequirements-first works when you understand the behaviors and outcomes you need, but the technical path is unclear. You're exploring \"what should this do?\" before \"how should it work?\" Great option for net-new projects where your options are open.\n\nDesign-first works when you already have a technical vision—perhaps from experience, architectural constraints, or prototyping—and need to work backward to formalize what that system actually accomplishes. It's like whiteboarding a solution and then summarizing \"what this product does.\" This can apply to building a new feature on top of an existing app - you have to work within your current architecture and tech stack.\n\nBoth approaches embrace iteration and feedback. Neither pretends you can perfectly specify software upfront. Instead, they meet you where you actually are in your thinking, then help you work through the circular specification problem from different starting points.\n\nThe developer already knows the stack (FastAPI and mcp-python), the high-level architecture (an MCP server), and the constraints (no UI capabilities). They're not asking \"what should I build?\", they're asking \"help me build this thing I've already designed.\" In this case, starting with a design document makes more sense, because it matches how they're already thinking about the problem.\n\nSo now, when you create a new Feature Spec, Kiro asks you to choose: Requirements-first or tech Design-first. If you choose tech Design-first, you pick your level of detail. High-level design for system diagrams and components, or low-level design for algorithms and function signatures. Kiro generates your design document first. You iterate on it, exploring different technical approaches. Once you're happy with it, Kiro derives the requirements from your design, which ensures they are feasible. The rest of the spec workflow is the same: tasks, implementation, property-based testing to check if implementation matches what you want.\n\nTech Design-first works especially well when you have a pre-defined architecture, when you're prototyping to see if something is feasible, or when you're working with strict non-functional requirements that constrain your design choices. It's ideal when the technical approach is the starting point, not the destination.\n\nWhen fixing bugs, you have a different set of constraints and goals. You're not building something new, but correcting something that exists. Your surface area is different too. Change too much, and you risk breaking something that was working fine. You want the minimum change that fixes the problem.\n\nSo what’s the best way to work with an agent to do that? We found that developers who used Specs to successfully fix bugs shared two characteristics. First, they defined the detailed scenario that caused the error, not just the error message itself. Second, they explicitly stated what should not be modified. This is how experienced developers think about bugfixes, they fix what's broken but don't touch anything else.\n\nWhen you create a Bugfix Spec, Kiro follows a similar approach by generating a structured document with three sections:\n\nCurrent Behavior describes what's happening now: \"WHEN a user submits a form with special characters THEN the system crashes with a validation error.\" By being more comprehensive in this step, Kiro will better diagnose the conditions where the bug happens.\n\nExpected Behavior describes what should happen instead: \"WHEN a user submits a form with special characters THEN the system SHALL sanitize the input and process the form successfully.\" This tells Kiro what the solved state looks like so it can later check that it actually fixed the bug.\n\nUnchanged Behavior describes what must stay the same: \"WHEN a user submits a valid form THEN the system SHALL CONTINUE TO process it exactly as before.\" Instead of being implicit about what should not change, the Bugfix Spec explicitly states it. This helps Kiro check that regressions are not introduced and informs the property tests to validate.\n\nThis structure forces you to think explicitly about what changes and what doesn't, and helps the underlying model understand your intent more precisely. Kiro builds these sections for you automatically, you don't need to spend time writing this .md yourself. You can review and refine these conditions, then Kiro proceeds to create a design.md and tasks.md, just like a Feature Spec, but tailored for surgical fixes.\n\nWhat makes this work well is the unique way Kiro does testing. Kiro generates property-based tests (PBTs) for all three categories. Tests that verify the current implementation has the bug. Tests that verify your fix resolves it. And tests that verify unchanged behavior continues working exactly as before. Without these PBTs, it’s difficult to check if the agent actually fixed the bug for a comprehensive set of conditions, and that the changes were indeed surgical.\n\nBugfix Specs shine for complex bugs that benefit from structured problem-solving, situations where regression risk is high, or when you need documentation for your fix.\n\nSpecs changed the way many developers approach AI development to ship solid software. But when working with existing apps, especially over large codebases, you might prefer a different approach. Sometimes you begin with requirements, because you know exactly what you want to build. Sometimes you already know the technical approach, and it’s non-negotiable. Sometimes you're fixing a bug and need surgical precision because you don't want a regression to affect all your users. Now Specs support all three use cases.\n\nLearn",

So now we've got a plan B, I've got a bit of chalk and wax in the case from now on.\n\n\"I didn't have to use it this week at the Players Championship, it was fine, but it must have been the soap I used.\n\n\"That was the first time it's happened. It must be just whatever soap was in the toilet at Antwerp that I used and it just obviously took all the oils out of my finger and lost all grip.\"\n\nWorld number nine Rock admitted his natural reaction to his struggles against seven-time champion Van Gerwen was to \"laugh straight away\" because he \"knew what the problem was\".\n\nHe has now put that performance down to misfortune and moved on as he prepares to take on world number two Luke Humphries in night three of the competition in Glasgow on Thursday before competing in front of a home crowd in Belfast on 26 February.\n\n\"If I played like that and didn't know what the problem was then, obviously we have an issue,\" he added.\n\n\"But I knew I couldn't grip my hands and no matter how much I was trying to lick my fingers, rub my finger up and down a barrel to get my fingers rough, it wasn't working, so I just let that one go.\"",

    "description": "Without snow in the mountains, the places that depend on the West’s rivers will hurt for water.",
    "fullText": "If you are reading this on the East Coast, congratulations on the warmer weather you’re finally getting this week. It was cold and snowy for a while there. Here in the West, we wish we’d been in your shoes. Spare a thought for the tens of millions of us who live on the other side of the continent, where a catastrophe is unfolding.\n\nIn Colorado, where I live and grew up, this winter has been especially warm and dry. Last year closed with the warmest December in the history of recordkeeping. It was 8.9 degrees warmer than the average from 1991 to 2020, and the warmest of all in a record that goes back to the late 19th century. Over this past weekend, my neighbors and my family walked with our dogs and our kids in T-shirts and shorts, because it was in the mid-60s in Colorado Springs. About 60 miles north, my family in Denver saw a new record high of 68 degrees—on February 15.\n\nBut temperatures are not the only reason this winter is a catastrophe. This year, our snowpack is among the lowest ever measured, which means it won’t be enough to fill the rivers that are born in our mountains, which feed  reservoirs and water farms from here to Los Angeles. Snow is finally coming to the mountains this week, but we still cannot avoid one of the worst water years in modern history. The West is already experiencing the worst drought we have seen in 1,200 years, as our junior senator, John Hickenlooper, reminded me in an email over the weekend. Colorado politicians have to be attuned to these dynamics: “The snowpack is pretty much as large as all of our reservoirs combined. That’s why winters like this one are so terrifying,” he wrote. Drought can mean economic disaster.\n\nHickenlooper, who was also the state’s governor and the mayor of Denver, is not a man given to hyperbole. It really is that dire. Unless a lot of snow falls soon, Colorado’s environment and economy will take a huge hit. Ski resorts are losing money now. In the spring, rivers that usually offer waist-high whitewater rapids and fishing pools will instead be a trickle; in the summer, farmers will lose peach crops. Hydrologists, fire scientists, and climate researchers are bracing for summer too; their spectrum of worry ranges from concern to actual panic.\n\n“It’s as bad as you think it is,” Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, told me. On top of the ongoing, decades-long drought in the region, all of Colorado is in a snow drought too. The amount of water stored in the snowpack is the lowest it’s been at this point in winter since at least 1987, when comprehensive measurements began, he said. Going back to older records, some of which date from the Dust Bowl, the 2025–26 water year is the third-worst ever measured. In the two worse years, snowpack measured about 40 to 42 percent of average at this point in winter; this year, Colorado is sitting around 58 percent of median overall, and lower in some areas.\n\nClimatologists say that a weak La Niña pattern in the Pacific is partly to blame, parking a high-pressure “heartbreak ridge” farther east than usual, which continually pushes moisture away from the mountains. But the abysmal snowpack is also causing a bad feedback loop, allowing the mountains to warm more than usual. The pattern could finally break this week, and “we definitely have time to make up ground,” Allie Mazurek, a climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center, told me. But she also cautioned that “at this stage, it is looking almost impossible for us to get back to an average snowpack.”\n\nSchumacher’s predecessor, the longtime state climatologist Nolan Doesken, used to say that Colorado’s snowmelt is well behaved. Rain comes in a flash and is gone just as quickly, but we know where snow falls, where it will lie in wait, and which rivers it will feed months later. Flakes accumulate on cold ground, and when the Rockies stay cold the way they should, the snow remains for many months. And the surrounding air stays colder with snowpack than without it. This winter, temperatures are soaring 10 to 12 degrees above normal in northwestern Colorado—temperatures that region would not be seeing if the ground were covered in snow, Mazurek said.\n\nWestern water monitors use a metric called snow water equivalent, which is just what it sounds like, to estimate how much water will flow into rivers when the snow melts. Since 1987, the Snowpack Telemetry Network, SNOTEL, has measured snowpack by weighing the snow that falls at hundreds of stations across the West, including more than 100 currently active ones in Colorado. Other measurements are taken by hikers who snowshoe up to designated spots and measure the snowpack by hand. Climate scientists have been doing this for decades. Last week, the snow water equivalent in the Colorado River basin was tied for the lowest ever recorded, according to Brad Udall, a senior water scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on the Colorado River.\n\nThat snowpack forms the headwaters of rivers including the Colorado, the Rio Grande, and the Arkansas. And the Colorado River feeds the two largest reservoirs in the United States: Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Both reservoirs are critically low and have been for years: Powell is about 25 percent full, and Mead is at about 34 percent. If Powell’s water level drops another 40 or so feet, which it could this year, there won’t be enough water to generate hydroelectric power at Glen Canyon Dam. Water managers are starting to worry about “dead pool” too, in which the lake will get too low to let water flow through Glen Canyon toward Lake Mead; they are likely to reduce water flow out of Powell this year to avoid it.\n\nIn most of the Colorado River’s upper basin—in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming—water is not collected in many reservoirs; instead, it is diverted out to thousands of small locations, from streams to irrigation ditches. And “this year, there just isn’t going to be any water in these rivers. Or there will be water, but instead of 12 weeks or 16 weeks of water, it will be four weeks of water,” Udall told me. “Under western water law, people can basically completely dry these rivers up.”\n\nThis is bad timing, because Colorado and the other basin states are currently failing to renegotiate key parts of the more-than-century-old Colorado River Compact, which expire later this year. Along with seven states, the river-management agreement includes the federal Bureau of Reclamation, 30 tribal nations, and Mexico, and controls how the river flows into and out of Lakes Powell and Mead. The states missed a major deadline on February 14, which means that the Bureau of Reclamation will instead impose its own plan—one that none of the states are likely to be happy with. In Colorado, at least, some residents are concerned that the Trump administration will punish the solidly blue state by simply giving more water to, say, Arizona, which Donald Trump won in 2024. This is far from an irrational worry. In late December, Trump vetoed funding for a pipeline, already under construction with bipartisan support, that would bring water from a reservoir to rural communities in southeastern Colorado. The fight over the Colorado River could shape up in similar fashion, pitting state against state. (In response to a request for comment, a Department of the Interior spokesperson pointed me to a press release in which Secretary Doug Burgum said that the department had “listened to every state’s perspective” and that a “fair compromise with shared responsibility remains within reach.”)\n\nFurther in the future, the effects of water reductions will spill through the western economy. Agriculture, water recreation such as fishing and river rafting, and entire mountain ecosystems—both environmental and economic—will falter. For now, though, we are worrying about our trees budding six weeks too early, and pouring buckets of water around their trunks to keep them hydrated in the warmth. We are updating our fire checklists and go bags during red-flag warnings: One went up yesterday as I was working on this story. Winter fire watches are abnormal, but we are growing all too accustomed to them. And we are checking the snow forecast every day.",

    "description": "Newcastle's Anthony Gordon only had one thought in his mind as his side faced Qarabag in the Champions League...",
    "fullText": "Anthony Gordon had already scored a hat-trick.\n\nBut the ruthless Newcastle United forward only had one thought in his mind at the Tofig Bahramov Republican Stadium.\n\nGordon had just won his side a penalty against Qarabag in the first leg of their last 16 Champions League play-off tie, and he was not about to hand the ball over after Kieran Trippier felt Nick Woltemade should get a chance to take the spot-kick.\n\nIt brought back one or two memories of the single-mindedness of Newcastle's greatest ever goalscorer, Alan Shearer.\n\nIn fact, after already netting four goals against Sheffield Wednesday, in 1999, Shearer told striker Paul Robinson where to go after his team-mate asked him if he could take a spot-kick.\n\nSo it was rather fitting that this was a night where Gordon overtook the Newcastle legend as the club's all-time top scorer in the Champions League with 10 goals.\n\n\"We should be in it together,\" Gordon told TNT Sports after netting four goals in his side's 6-1 victory.\n\n\"But I'm an attacker. I'm the penalty taker, so I want to score as many goals as I possibly can.\"\n\nQarabag, in truth, played right into Gordon's hands.\n\nThis side had previously drawn against Chelsea and defeated Benfica, Eintracht Frankfurt and Copenhagen.\n\nBut the sight of the rapid Gordon playing further forward than Woltemade appeared to catch Qarabag a little cold.\n\n\"I have to say I was surprised by how high Qarabag defended, and how they kept a high line in the first half when the Newcastle goals were going in,\" he said.\n\n\"I was thinking, 'are they not watching Newcastle and their recent games?' Because why did they allow so much space for Gordon, who was brilliant all evening?\"\n\nGordon has impressed in such a role away from home in recent weeks - opening the scoring at Anfield last month and setting up Jacob Ramsey's winner against Spurs last week.\n\nHe gives Eddie Howe's side something different through the middle with his movement and pace, and the Azerbaijan Premier League champions could not cope.\n\n\"I think he's been really good in that position,\" Howe said. \"Looking back to the Liverpool game, where I thought he was excellent, he scores.\n\n\"He's shown he wants to play there and then he's got the quality to play there. His pressing today was incredible for us. That gave us the platform to rebuild off of his work.\n\n\"Of course he's taken the four goals and will get the headlines, naturally, but his all-round game was really strong.\"\n\nGordon's first goal set the tone for Newcastle.\n\nIt only took the rapid forward two minutes to open the scoring after he beat the offside trap to latch on to Dan Burn's through ball before coolly picking out the bottom corner.\n\nHaving scored his second from the spot, to make it 3-0, Gordon's speed caused Qarabag problems once again from the restart just seconds later when he pounced on some slack play from defender Kevin Medina and rounded Mateusz Kochalski to score his hat-trick.\n\nOn a night Gordon spurned one or two opportunities from open play, there was no chance of him letting go of the ball when he won his side another spot-kick before the break.\n\nGordon stepped up and dispatched a second powerful penalty past goalkeeper Kochalski.\n\nIt was a night he smashed a number of records, including becoming the only Englishman to score three or more goals in a knockout stage game in the Champions League.\n\nNo wonder Gordon did not want to come off midway through the second half, as the watching Pat Nevin observed.\n\n\"He is actually gutted,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"Any striker would feel exactly the same. You know it's the right thing.\n\n\"You don't want to get injured. You know you need to rest, there's big games coming up. But you also know there's goals. He's taken it well, though.\"\n\nGordon left the field to the sound of his name being chanted by those delirious Newcastle supporters in the away end.\n\nThe travelling support embarked on a gruelling 2,500-mile trip to be there - the longest any English fan base had ever travelled in the Champions League.\n\nYou suspect it was worth it as they repeatedly sang about not wanting to go home in the closing stages.\n\nWhat a difference 10 days make.\n\nA crestfallen Howe admitted he was not doing his job \"well enough\" after his side were booed off following a bruising defeat against Brentford at St James' Park earlier this month.\n\nIt led to a brief period of soul searching and one or two home truths behind the scenes, and Newcastle have responded.\n\nA side who once suffered with travel sickness have now defeated Qarabag, Aston Villa and Spurs on the road in little more than a week.\n\n\"I'm so proud of everyone because football is a highly emotional place sometimes and it's very fickle,\" Gordon added.\n\n\"People get so down and so up on you depending on your form. To go through what we went through to the position we're in now is really important and shows the character we have.\n\n\"Football does change fast so we have to keep it going, keep the momentum, because it can go the other way just as fast.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "After blowing a two-goal lead to draw against the Premier League's bottom club Wolves, there will be no dodging the questions on whether Arsenal are mentally ready to end their 22-year wait to become champions.\n\nFor the first time really this season, the title race is not completely in the control of Mikel Arteta and his players.\n\nIf Manchester City - five points behind in second place - win all of their remaining 12 games, which includes a home meeting against Arsenal, they will finish first.\n\nThe same, though, can be said for the Gunners, who have 11 matches left - and they win the April encounter at Etihad Stadium.\n\nBut after dropping four crucial points in successive draws against Brentford and Wolves, they are in danger of being haunted by the ghost of past failures.\n\nThree successive runners-up finishes, two of them to Pep Guardiola's men, provide a constant reminder.\n\nFormer Arsenal forward Alan Smith admitted \"that word bottle will be used quite a bit in the next few days\".\n\nThe scenario seemed a lot different when Piero Hincapie slotted home his first goal for the club in the 56th minute, adding to Bukayo Saka's fifth-minute opener.\n\nBut the Gunners lacked the control and ruthlessness to finish off a Wolves side that had lost their nine previous meetings and are heading for the Championship.\n\nThe hosts showed remarkable spirit to fight back with Hugo Bueno's 20-yard curler giving them hope. Then, in the fourth minute of added time, 19-year-old Tom Edozie - off the bench for his senior debut - pounced on a mix-up between Arsenal pair David Raya and Gabriel and his shot went in off Riccardo Calafiori for a dramatic, dreamy leveller.\n\nArsenal next face London derbies with Tottenham and Chelsea and they have worryingly started to wobble at a decisive stage in the season.\n\nArteta knows his side will come under fire and scrutiny.\n\n\"Any opinion you have to take it on the chin,\" he said. \"Any bullet, take it, because we didn't perform at the level required.\n\n\"Anything anyone says can be right because we didn't do what we had to do. The way to do it is on the pitch on Sunday [against Spurs].\"\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards said his side \"knew there is a massive pressure\" on Arsenal at the minute - and they capitalised on that.\n\nThe Gunners have not been performing at their best since the start of 2026 and won only two of their last seven league matches, with victories against Leeds and Sunderland.\n\nArteta added: \"Certain basics we have to do, we did them so poorly, one after the other.\n\n\"It is better not to judge it. We are all too emotional about it. You have to take the hit because we deserve it. It is very easy with emotion to say things that can damage the team. Everyone wants to do their best.\"\n\nOnly Crystal Palace and West Ham (both eight) have dropped more points from winning positions in the league in 2026 than Arsenal (seven) and the Gunners have now failed to win from a leading position in three of their last five league games.\n\nThis was also the first time in Premier League history that a side starting the day bottom of the table avoided defeat to the leaders, despite trailing by two or more goals.\n\n\"It feels like a pivotal moment, a vital one, maybe a turning point,\" Smith added on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's in Manchester City's hands now. With their experience and Guardiola's experience they will really fancy it now. They can almost feel the nerves of the Arsenal team watching that.\n\n\"Having been 2-0 up against the team rock bottom on nine points is just not good enough for the team hoping to win the title. It doesn't bode well for Arsenal to be able to handle the pressure.\"\n\nPressure mounts as Arsenal blow two-goal lead to draw at Wolves\n\nThe result also meant Arsenal failed to win an away league game in which they had a two-goal lead for the first time since April 2023 at West Ham, stretching back 18 matches.\n\nForward Saka, who ended a 15-match goal drought in all competitions, said there was a \"big difference\" with how his side performed in the second half compared to the first.\n\n\"Disappointed, not much else to say,\" added the England international. \"We dropped our standards big time and we got punished for it.\"\n\nJust a day after signing a new five-year deal, he had put his side in front after playing in the No10 role again, but could only watch in dismay at the end having gone off in the 73rd minute after receiving treatment.\n\n\"It's very flat,\" added Saka. \"It's time for us to reflect on the last few performances and fix the issues immediately, so we can get back to winning games, go on a run and build momentum because we've lost that a bit right now.\"\n\n\"I just think we have to get back to our level. Do the basics right and we've got more than enough quality in this team to win games, especially in the games where we've been dropping points in recently. We need to fix that and that's all our focus is right now.\"\n\nWith a north London derby to follow at Tottenham on Sunday, Arsenal have to respond quickly.\n\nSpurs will have Igor Tudor at the helm and they will hope he can give them the 'new manager bounce' to add to the Gunners' misery.\n\nArteta admitted: \"We need to go through the pain, looking in the mirror and understand what the game requires now on Sunday.\n\n\"Anything we say from here is fine but we need to keep it all in our tummies and show it on Sunday.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, bought the franchise in 1997, saving it from potentially being moved to Southern California.\n\nHe oversaw the Seahawks' first Super Bowl win in 2014 but died in 2018, aged 65, from complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nHis estate announced on Wednesday that it has \"commenced a formal sale process\" for the franchise \"consistent with Allen's directive to eventually sell his sports holdings and direct all estate proceeds to philanthropy\".\n\nAccording to Forbes, Allen paid $194m (£143.6m) for the Seahawks and the publication's most recent valuation was $6.7bn (£5bn) - making it the 14th most valuable franchise in the NFL.\n\nThe most recent NFL team sale saw the Washington Commanders purchased in 2023 by a group controlled by Josh Harris for a record $6.05bn (£4.5bn).\n\nThat was surpassed as the world's most expensive sports team purchase last year, when the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers were bought for $10bn (£7.5bn).\n\nAllen also owned the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. since his death, his sister Jody Allen has been executor of his estate, plus chair of the Seahawks and Trail Blazers.\n\nA sale of the Trail Blazers is already in progress with Tom Dundon, owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, having agreed a contract to buy the NBA team in a deal worth $4.25bn (£3.3bn).\n\nThe Allen estate has selected investment bank Allen & Company and law firm Latham & Watkins to lead the sale process of the Seahawks.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "A college student withdrew from consideration for a reporting role in our newsroom this week because of how we use artificial intelligence.\n\nIt reminded me again how college journalism programs are failing to prepare students for the workforce. I mentioned this in a column before, and readers asked me to explain.\n\nWe don’t generally hire straight out of college. We lack the resources for heavy training, so we look for experienced journalists who can hit the ground running. This role, however, is different. It includes a free master’s degree through online courses at Syracuse University. We will accept recent graduates.\n\nLike many students we’ve spoken with in the past year, this one had been told repeatedly by professors that AI is bad. We heard the same thing at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Cleveland in August. Student after student said it.\n\nThat’s backwards — and it seriously handicaps them as they begin their careers. I’ve written extensively about how we use AI to do more and better work. It has quickly become critical to everything we do, and to our success.\n\nThe job posting involves expanding local news coverage. Last year, we began covering Lorain, Lake and Geauga counties using powerful AI tools to help identify stories. Reporters Hannah Drown and Molly Walsh have uncovered a steady stream of compelling pieces, enriching our report. I choose nine stories each day for discussion on our Today in Ohio podcast, and their work regularly rises to the top.\n\nThe effort has been so successful we expanded it to Medina County this month. With the Syracuse fellowship, we hope to add northern Summit County in May.\n\nWe could not do this without AI. We once had large teams covering these counties. That’s no longer feasible.\n\nBecause we want reporters gathering information, these jobs are 100 percent reporting. We have an AI rewrite specialist who turns their material into drafts. We fact-check everything. Editors review it. Reporters get the final say. Humans — not AI — control every step.\n\nMost heartening, the experiment is proving the value of local journalism. Hannah Drown’s reporting in Lorain County has awakened residents, especially regarding a less-than-transparent county commission. People are paying attention and asking questions as never before.\n\nThink about that: An energized electorate, partly because of how we use AI.\n\nThe candidate who withdrew could not accept AI assisting with writing. It wasn’t a “sacrifice” they were willing to make for a foothold in a thriving newsroom.\n\nI don’t blame the candidate. I blame the school.\n\nJournalism programs are decades behind. Many graduating students have unrealistic expectations. They imagine themselves as long-form magazine storytellers, chasing a romanticized version of journalism that largely never existed.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not bad for newsrooms. It’s the future of them. It already allows us to be faster, more thorough and more comprehensible. It frees time for what matters most: gathering facts and developing stories to serve you.\n\nAnyone entering this field should be immersing themselves in AI.\n\nFortunately for those of us who know exactly what skills we need in applicants, AI has altered the landscape so dramatically that we don’t need journalism school grads. Before the Watergate era, many journalists did not have college degrees. They were just smart people who knew how to get information. They were naturals at talking to people. And they knew enough about how things worked to recognize news.\n\nThat’s what we need now. AI can help draft stories, but it cannot sit across from someone, make eye contact and build trust. The core skills today differ sharply from even a decade ago. We just need to be creative about where we recruit.\n\nIf you’re a student considering journalism, I’d skip that degree. Study political science. Learn technology. Understand how government, businesses and nonprofits work. Take communications law and ethics as electives. Skip much of the rest.\n\nWe need smart, inquisitive people who love to schmooze and find adventure in change. Be that.",

    "description": "The admission comes after former President Barack Obama went viral for claiming aliens are real",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, says the president has a speech pre-written and is ready to address the discovery of aliens.\n\nLara, 43, made the shocking claim in an episode of the New York Post’s Pod Force One podcast, published Wednesday, after she was asked about former President Barack Obama's apparent confirmation that aliens are real during an interview last weekend.\n\n“I believe I’ve heard on your podcast that you’ve discussed with the president these UFOs. Do you think that he’s about to make an announcement about UFOs, because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president?” host Miranda Devine asked.\n\n“What’s kind of funny is we’ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cause we’re like, ‘Well, what do you know?...”Lara began.\n\nHowever, the president reportedly “played a little coy” when she and her husband, his son, Eric Trump, inquired about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n“Eric and I were like, ‘Oh my gosh, he won’t even fully tell us, maybe there’s more to it,’” she said.\n\n“I have just heard kind of around that he’s actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don’t know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara added.\n\nHer comments come as Obama made a stunning admission over the weekend during an appearance on the No Lie With Brian Tyler Cohen podcast.\n\nWhen asked about extraterrestrials, Obama replied, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in — what is it? There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”\n\nThe Internet went wild over his admission that aliens are real, prompting the former commander-in-chief to take to Instagram to clarify his stance.\n\n“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify,” the former president wrote. “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”\n\n“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us,” he continued,\n\nDoubling down on his claim, he added, “Really!”\n\nIts long been speculated by many that aliens and UFOs are hidden at the mysterious Area 51 base in southern Nevada — and a documentary released last year suggested that Trump may soon confirm the existence of other life forms.\n\nIn The Age of Disclosure, director Dan Farah suggests that a massive government cover-up operation has concealed the existence of non-human intelligence, but that the cover-up will soon be exposed.\n\n“I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, ‘We're not alone in the universe,’” Farah told Entertainment Weekly in late November.\n\n“It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have.”\n\nDespite Farah’s claims, Trump has not yet shared a definitive answer about the existence of aliens since returning to office.",

    "description": "First in The Independent: A Congolese woman’s life is in ‘grave danger’ after ICE secretly flew her to an unknown African nation, according to an emergency motion filed in federal court",
    "fullText": "The life of a Congolese asylum seeker granted permission to stay in the United States is in “grave danger” after ICE secretly flew her to an unknown African nation, while the woman’s husband – a widely feared local politician who allegedly had her father shot dead as she watched – continues to hunt her across continents, according to a tranche of federal court documents reviewed by The Independent.\n\nIn addition to fearing for her own safety, “Jane Doe,” as she is referred to in legal filings, “hopes for the safety of her children, whose whereabouts are unknown to her because their father, her husband, is seeking to kill them and so they are in hiding, even to her,” states an emergency motion Doe’s attorneys filed Monday in Louisiana. “She hopes for the safety of her brother, who was kidnapped in Mexico by a cartel and she has not seen him since.”\n\nAt the age of 14, “Jane Doe” - as the devoutly Christian and former hairdresser in the Democratic Republic of Congo - was forced to become the African politician’s sixth wife in order to satisfy a family debt, according to the motion. For the next decade, Doe was physically and sexually abused by her husband and two of his sons, bearing four children while being “kept like a hostage,” says the motion, which seeks Doe’s immediate return to the U.S.\n\nIn late 2024, Doe managed to escape to her parents’ house, the motion goes on. But Doe’s politician husband quickly found her, brutalized her and her brother, ordered his bodyguards to execute her father in front of her, and burned the family home to the ground, the motion says. When Doe went to the police, they said her only option was to leave the country because “her abuser was too powerful and… they could not protect her,” according to the motion.\n\n“Ms. Doe went into hiding and fled the [Democratic Republic of Congo] with the help of her brother and his employer, who in secret obtained travel documents and plane tickets to Brazil,” it states. “Ms. Doe’s abuser continued to track her abroad. Within an hour of arriving in Brazil, Ms. Doe received a WhatsApp message from her abuser, stating he knew she was in Brazil and had ‘eyes everywhere.’ He threatened to kill her.”\n\nTerrified, Doe made her way through 12 different countries – even braving the notorious Darién Gap on foot – to get to the United States, where, the motion explains, “she believed human rights were respected.” It says Doe arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border on January 2, 2025, and immediately requested asylum. She was sent to the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, as her case was processed, and last June received permission to stay in the U.S. under a “withholding of removal” decision barring her deportation to DR Congo.\n\nHowever, that all changed on February 15, 2026, when ICE decided to send her to somewhere else.\n\nAttorneys for Doe say they were never contacted by authorities about their client’s sudden removal and “don’t even know where [ICE] disappeared [her] to yesterday in the dark of night.” Doe was loaded onto a deportation flight bound for Senegal, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana and Nigeria, without any further information provided, the affidavit states, adding, “Ms. Doe has no connections, resources, money or way of contacting anyone in the world.”\n\nThe motion contends that Doe’s “unlawful removal means her life is in grave danger.”\n\nDoe, according to a companion affidavit filed by one of her attorneys, is “an extraordinary woman.”\n\n“She has lived through extensive trauma, and despite that, she smiles on video calls with me and tells me how she’s learning to make bracelets in ICE detention,” it says. “She reads her Bible and leads Bible study among other women in her detention facility. She finds a way to continue to hold onto hope… She hopes for her future education to be able to study medicine, to work as a nurse, and one day to run an orphanage. She hopes to see the outside of the detention facility where she has lived in the United States of America for 13 months: January 2025 to now.”\n\nThe affidavit lauds Doe for fighting the June 2025 withholding of removal order, which the motion explains as “similar to asylum in that she proved it was more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of a protected ground if she were removed to the Democratic Republic of Congo and that the government there was unable or unwilling to protect her.”\n\nLast summer, ICE instructed officials that immigrants can be deported from the United States to countries other than their own with as little as six hours’ notice – or no notice at all.\n\nThat memo from ICE acting director Todd Lyons followed a Supreme Court decision that opened the door for ICE to send deportees to countries where they do not have citizenship, family or any other connections.\n\nICE has since spent more than $40 million and fought several legal battles over removals to far-flung nations where deportees have no connections whatsoever, including to several countries in Africa: Eswatini, Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda and South Sudan, among others.\n\nIn a June 2025 letter to authorities, filed as an exhibit in court, another attorney representing Doe wrote that she had been told ICE was considering Canada and Spain as possible third countries where they could deport her. However, her husband has family in both places, and could easily locate her there, the letter said. Guatemala, a third possibility floated by ICE, would be equally dangerous for Doe, who also speaks no Spanish, according to a follow-up letter.\n\nStill, immigration authorities denied Doe her right to a reasonable fear interview concerning any potential third country, which Monday’s motion calls an “extraordinary and illegal measure.”\n\n“Under our Constitution, this cannot stand,” the motion argues.\n\nThroughout, ICE has refused over the course of nearly nine months to communicate at all with Doe’s lawyers, according to the motion.\n\n“Defendants communicate – if at all – solely with [Doe]: a high school graduate with no legal training who is a native French speaker and knows only limited English,” it maintains. “... This does not provide Ms. Doe meaningful notice or opportunity to respond. By excluding counsel from the equation and refusing to engage with her attorneys, Defendants have committed abhorrent behavior violating Ms. Doe’s rights.”\n\nAt 11 p.m. on Valentine’s Day, Doe’s legal team was notified by a family member that Doe had been told she “was being ‘moved,’” the motion states. “She reportedly did not have any information or know whether this ‘move’ was a transfer to a different facility or a removal to a third country.”\n\nFinally, around 1 p.m., an ICE officer picked up the phone and said Doe had been flown out of the U.S. on a 4 a.m. flight dropping deportees off in five African countries, but “could not identify which… was her destination,” the motion states. The officer referred the attorneys to a pair of higher-ups, who also never responded to their queries, according to the motion.\n\nDoe’s lawyers argue the U.S. government has violated her Fifth Amendment right to due process, as well as a section of federal law that prohibits government agencies from”arbitrary or capricious” conduct.\n\nThey are demanding U.S. officials facilitate Doe’s return to the U.S., “without incident,” to release her upon entry, and to reimburse her for any costs incurred. Late Tuesday, a judge denied Doe’s motion and ordered her attorneys to refile their motion with additional specifics.\n\nDoe’s attorneys declined to comment on the record. An ICE spokesperson did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment.\n\nWith reporting by Alex Woodward",

They didn’t know where he was, what happened to him or if they would ever see him again.”\n\nYears later, in July 2009, human remains were found on property now known as Lake Hiawatha Preserve by a work crew clearing overgrowth, the Clermont Police Department said in a statement.\n\n“Forensic consultations with the University of Central Florida, the University of Florida, and the Fifth District Medical Examiner confirmed the remains were human and belonged to an adult male,” police continued. “Evidence was submitted for forensic and DNA analysis in 2009.\"\n\nHowever, despite an extensive investigation, police said the case went cold.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn June of last year, the medical examiner’s office received approval for a genetic genealogy grant through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Clermont Police said.\n\nWith approval from the police, the medical examiner’s office submitted the evidence from the case to Othram, which specializes in using DNA technology to solve cold cases — and on Dec. 29, investigators were notified that the remains belonged to Manzanares.\n\n“This identification reflects years of persistence and collaboration,” Clermont Police Captain Malcolm Draper said in a press statement. “Although the case grew cold, it was never forgotten. Advances in forensic science, combined with the dedication of our investigative partners, produced answers that were not possible in 2009.”\n\n“We are grateful that this identification brings some measure of closure to the Manzanares family,” added Ocoee Police Chief Vincent Ogburn. “They now have the opportunity to lay their loved one to rest.”\n\nGrogan said at Friday’s news conference that calling Manzanares’ daughter was bittersweet. “She was grateful to finally have answers and to bring her father home,” said Grogan. “But like any child, she had always held on to hope that her dad might walk back into her life one day.”\n\nAlthough unknown to investigators when he disappeared, Grogan said during the news conference that in 2022 she spoke with Manzanares' mom, who wanted to \"clear the air.\"\n\nGrogan said that according to his mom, before her son disappeared, the family was \"experiencing domestic violence\" and in addition to moving from Colorado to live with his family, Manzanares convinced his father, who has since died, to move out.\n\nHis mom also said that Manzanares allegedly heard that his father and another now-deceased relative were planning to sell his sister and niece, then 7 and 8, to a motorcycle gang they were members of.\n\n\"I think in this day and age you would call it human trafficking,\" Grogan said.\n\nWhen he left to confront them, Manzanares told his mother he planned to return later that night, leaving behind his wallet and jacket.\n\nWhen pressed for questions, Grogan said that at this point in their investigation, they have no additional answers about what may have happened to Manzanares.\n\nAn investigation remains ongoing.\n\nIf you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential. The hotline is available 24/7 in more than 170 languages.",

    "fullText": "A dozen speakers took to the microphone at the \"A Day Without an Immigrant\" rally on the front steps of University of Oregon's Johnson Hall on Feb. 16.\n\nThis was the third \"A Day Without an Immigrant\" demonstration in a series that will culminate on International Workers' Day on May 1.\n\nA couple hundred participants huddled together on the slope leading up to the university's administrative building, protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in Eugene and nationwide. Students, staff, faculty and community members called for UO leaders to take action by way of using the UO Alerts system to give notification when ICE is on or near campus.\n\n\"I'm scared, I'm angry, I'm exhausted, but now isn't the time to give in to despair,\" said Isabel E, a UO student with the UO Young Democratic Socialists of America. \"It's time to act, to fight back, and to demand that this university fulfills its ethical duty to protect its students, its faculty and its city.\"\n\nMultiple student groups helped organize the rally, including YDSA, UO's Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán (MEChA), UO Student Workers and Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation. Faculty and staff also were present along with representatives from the Party for Socialism and Liberation in Eugene.\n\nUO student and MEChA member Xiomara Andrade stepped up to speak on behalf of MEChA President Maria Gaspar. She spoke about the recent UO Alerts going out, including one sent on Feb. 9 about \"water gel beads,\" commonly known as Orbeez, being shot at pedestrians near campus. Andrade called the alert \"insulting.\" She criticized the university's lack of ICE alerts, saying UO's administration cares more about its public image than its students.\n\n\"We need these alerts and we need them now,\" Andrade said. \"(Students) are looking over their shoulders instead of focusing on their future. At MEChA, we work firsthand with our immigrant and Latino community every single day. We aren't just looking at data, we are looking into the eyes of our peers and seeing the fear rise daily.\"\n\nUO students also called for a Latine Cultural Center, a center intended specifically for the Hispanic and Latino student population, similar to the Black Cultural Center. While the Multicultural Center exists, students say that space fills up quickly and isn't large enough for collaboration between Latino-serving student groups on campus. Latino and Hispanic students are the second-largest demographic at UO after white students. According to UO data from winter 2026, 17% of undergrad students are Hispanic/Latino, compared to 60% of undergrads who are white.\n\nToby Cole, a UO transfer student involved in YDSA and MEChA, said he came to the rally, in part, to find community. Cole, who grew up in Southern California, said it was a huge shock at first coming to a predominantly white institution, but he has been able to find community through groups like MEChA. He said there are lots of Latino students and some faculty, but he'd like to see more resources organized by the university itself.\n\n\"Latino student presence is strong, and it's healthy, but we aren't given space to grow,\" Cole said. \"I think that's the main thing that we're really trying to fight for.\"\n\nCole said Latino faculty have been doing what they can to support students, but Cole would like to see a Latino student specialist in UO's mental health counseling office, similar to Dr. Cecile Gadson, who is the African American/Black student specialist staff psychologist.\n\nAt Monday's rally, Cole said it's been powerful to see they are not alone as they look at all their peers who feel the same fear, but are willing to take steps to make a change.\n\n\"There's a really big fear on campus, but there's also a lot of strength that's coming out,\" Cole said. \"There's a lot of solidarity. Students that aren't Latino, aren't immigrants, aren't people of color are also rallying together and saying, 'Hey, you're my neighbor, you're my classmate, you're my friend. I'm going to protect you.'\"\n\nMiranda Cyr reports on education for The Register-Guard.

    "description": "With proper planning, RMDs may be less of an issue.",
    "fullText": "Saving for retirement in a traditional IRA or 401(k), as opposed to a Roth, can seem like a good idea when you're eager to lower your tax bill. But traditional retirement plans come with a huge drawback. Not only are withdrawals subject to taxes, but you may eventually have to take withdrawals even if you don't want to.\n\nThose mandatory withdrawals are known as required minimum distributions, or RMDs. And they kick in at age 73 or 75, depending on the year you were born.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nRMDs can cause you a host of problems in retirement. Not only can they push you into a higher tax bracket, but they could also drive up the cost of your Medicare premiums by leaving you subject to surcharges known as IMRAAs, or income-related monthly adjustment amounts.\n\nThe good news? There's a step you can take to reduce your RMDs in retirement. But you'll need to plan ahead to pull it off.\n\nRoth conversions are a good option for getting out of RMDs or reducing them. But many people wait until the last minute to do a Roth conversion and end up moving a large sum of money at once out of a traditional retirement account. That tends to produce a very large tax bill.\n\nPlus, depending on your age, doing a large Roth conversion in a single year could put you at risk of Medicare IRMAAs. So a better bet may be to do your conversions over time.\n\nAnother option many people overlook? Rather than do a conversion, simply take withdrawals from your IRA or 401(k) before RMDs begin.\n\nLet's say you have to start taking RMDs at age 73 but you retire at 65. During that eight-year gap, you may have a fairly low income and therefore land in a fairly low tax bracket.\n\nIf you withdraw funds from your IRA or 401(k) during that time, you'll have less money subject to RMDs down the line. You can then reinvest the money you're withdrawing so it doesn't go to waste.\n\nIf you do those withdrawals during a fairly low-income year, not only might your tax bracket not rise too much, but you may not risk pushing your income into IRMAA territory. So all told, it's a strategy that could spare you a lot of financial pain.\n\nOne reason older people run into trouble with RMDs is that they wake up at the last minute and realize they're a year or two away from potentially large mandatory withdrawals. A better bet? Plan early.",

    "fullText": "Home Depot and Lowe’s have dominated the home improvement and hardware retail sectors for decades, continuing to rise above hardware cooperatives True Value Hardware and Ace Hardware, and making life even harder for independent hardware retailers.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has also surpassed True Value and Ace as the No. 3 destination for home improvement products.\n\nHome Depot captured an average of 28% of the home improvement market sales in 2025, while Lowe’s followed with 17% of the market, and Amazon had about 11% of sales, according to the Numerator Home Improvement Tracker, which was updated on Feb. 4.\n\nWith Home Depot, Lowe's, and Amazon holding a combined 56% of the market's sales last year, the hardware cooperatives and independent retailers have had a difficult time competing and remaining in business.\n\nAce, True Value, and independent hardware stores are a convenient source for tools and other home improvement products for me, as I can quickly navigate a smaller store for my needs as opposed to much larger big-box stores.\n\nAnd I find that the employees at the smaller stores near me have often worked at the stores for years and have a quick answer for my needs.\n\nHowever, even long-time community hardware stores that have operated for over 50 years are struggling to stay open.\n\nIndependent hardware store C&H Hardware of Yakima, Wash., which operated for 65 years, had enough problems competing against the hardware and home improvement chain giants, but the store could not compete against lower online prices and shut down permanently in November 2025.\n\n\"This year has been tough because everybody’s buying online now,” C&H store owner Jay Fleck said before shutting his doors permanently. “You can get stuff online cheaper than you can come in and pay us.”\n\nFleck said business was good at C&H before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, but business deteriorated afterward.\n\n“It was smooth until Covid hit,” Fleck said. “Of course, we were fortunate to have stayed open. A lot of other places had to shut down. So, we’ve done pretty good through Covid. And after that, it was kind of over. It’s been a downhill slide ever since.”\n\nAnd now, 53-year-old Home Depot rival Blossom True Value Hardware will close its doors for the final time in summer 2026 when its lease expires.\n\nThe Mountain View, Calif.,-based hardware store will permanently close, after suffering a loss of about half of its business since the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, longtime store owner Paul Zeitman told Mountain View Voice.\n\n\"Every year is worse than before. People are buying less and less,\" Zeitman said.\n\nZeitman explained that the store's monthly rent is reasonable but is no longer affordable.\n\nThe store owner said that Blossom True Value was allowed to remain open during the pandemic as an essential business and benefited from people buying hardware and home improvement goods to fix up their homes until the pandemic subsided.\n\nBankrupt restaurant chains permanently close popular locations\n\nMajor retail chain closes 35 stores nationwide, no bankruptcy\n\nAnother major retail chain closes warehouse operations\n\nThe retailer lost half its business as regular customers moved away, and e-commerce expanded further since the end of the pandemic, according to Mountain View Voice.\n\nThe store owner said Ace Hardware's expansion and opening of new stores in the region also cut into the retailer's business.\n\nZeitman said the final factor in the decision to close down was rising tariffs.\n\nMuch of Blossom True Value's merchandise is imported from China, and has been affected by the Trump administration's higher tariffs that have increased prices and cut into profits, while sales have also dropped, he said.\n\nRetailer distress has been blamed on high rents and labor costs, online shopping, and competition from big-box retailers, according to Mountain View City Councilman John McAlister, who is also Blossom's retail neighbor.\n\nHome Depot and Lowe's closest stores to Mountain View are in neighboring Sunnyvale, Calif.\n\nHome Depot, 28% of sales in 2025",
