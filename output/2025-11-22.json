The new island features four named locations based on the town of Hawkins, Indiana, as well as a border right down the middle separating the normal world from locations that have been corrupted by the Upside Down--essentially giving the map a pair of distinct biomes, something that Blitz hasn't done before since its map is already so little.\nThe map and the new item shop skins based on Vecna and the original four boys are the entirety of this takeover--there aren't any new Stranger Things weapons added to the loot pool or anything like that. That's fine, because between the ongoing Simpsons season and the imminent launch of Chapter 7, we've already got plenty of new mechanics to worry about.",

This isn't a huge shock, though, as Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown didn't unlock the Easter egg right away, either.\nA popular video from the Detonated account shows that the mannequin heads on Nuketown 2025 cannot be shot off, thereby not allowing the Easter egg to unlock once they're all blasted away.

    "description": "Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault asks you to choose from four weapon options at the start of a new game. These are just the base versions of the four weapon types, but you'll be using whichever weapon you pick for several runs before you can unlock another one, making this choice one you'll want to think about. In this guide, we'll break down which weapon is best in Moonlighter 2, so you aren't stuck with the wrong one for a good while.\nMerchant's Sword\nThe sword is considered a balanced weapon, offering a four-hit attack-pattern for its primary attack, with the final hit functioning as a finisher. The special move is a spinning attack, dealing damage in a circle around Will.",
