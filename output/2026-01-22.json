    "description": "Florida faces a frigid Winnipeg and a resurgent Jets team. Can the Panthers heat up on their lengthy road journey?",
    "fullText": "The Florida Panthers are back on the road again.\n\nAfter a brief stop in South Florida for Monday’s matchup with the San Jose Sharks, the Panthers boarded a plane on Wednesday bound for the great white north.\n\nAssuming they can defrost, Florida will kick off a three-game road trip Thursday when they face the Winnipeg Jets at Canada Life Centre.\n\nHopefully the Cats brought their fur layers, as the temperature on Thursday in Winnipeg has a high of minus-17 and a low of minus-22.\n\nWhen they eventually hit the ice, Florida will be playing against a Jets squad that is desperately trying to bounce back from an atrocious stretch that took up most of November and December.\n\nAfter winning nine of their first 12 games, the Jets went into a tailspin that peaked with an 11-game losing streak that ran from mid-December to early January.\n\nThey went from a strong 9-3-0 start to the season to holding a 15-22-5 mark on Jan. 8 (that’s a 6-19-5 run for those wondering).\n\nSince ending the losing streak, Winnipeg has seemingly turned a corner, going 5-1-1 over the past couple weeks.\n\nThey will face a Florida squad that is also trying to make up ground and viewing every potential point in the standings as crucial.\n\nIt helps that the Panthers are getting healthier, welcoming Matthew Tkachuk into the lineup for the first time on Monday against San Jose.\n\nWith Tkachuk back in the fold, it’s just a matter of time before Florida’s forward ranks become as potent as they’ve been all season, which will happen when Brad Marchand is cleared to return.\n\n“He’s certainly close, day-to-day,” Maurice said of Marchand, who has missed six straight games with an undisclosed injury. “Whether it happens on this road trip, I don’t know yet. We are just kind of building off how he comes in each day. He felt better today than he maybe expected to (after) he got through practice. So we’ll need him to wake up tomorrow at least, and then probably the next day, before we start feeling that he’s right there.”\n\nFor Maruice, any time Florida returns to Winnipeg, it’s a special night for him.\n\nMaurice spent nine seasons coaching the Jets, leading them to the playoffs five times.\n\n“I do look forward to it,” Maurice said of returning to Winnipeg. “There’s great memories in that place, so it’s a fun trip.”\n\nSince joining the Panthers in 2022, Maurice has yet to see Florida pick up a victory in his old stomping grounds, going 0-3-0 in Winnipeg by a combined score of 14-5.\n\n“I don’t know if we’ve ever won in there,” Maurice said with a smile. “Other than the final scores, it’s been good.”\n\nHere are the Panthers projected lines and pairings for Thursday’s tussle in Winnipeg:\n\nEetu Luostarinen – Anton Lundell – Sam Reinhart\n\nCarter Verhaeghe – Sam Bennett – Matthew Tkachuk\n\nMackie Samoskevich – Evan Rodrigues – A.J. Greer\n\nSandis Vilmanis – Luke Kunin – Jesper Boqvist\n\nLATEST STORIES FROM THE HOCKEY NEWS - FLORIDA\n\nSeth Jones replaced on Team USA Olympic roster due to injury\n\nPanthers' Niko Mikkola Exits Game Early, Misses Practice But Is Still Expected To Play Against The Jets\n\nPanthers local TV viewership numbers continue to rise\n\nAs Panthers get healthier, salary cap could be major obstacle in Florida suiting up its full roster\n\n'We loved it,' Panthers Players Discuss Sergei Bobrovsky's Goalie Fight With Sharks' Alex Nedeljkovic",

    "title": "Houston Texans Fans Get Great News As Tank Dell Is Nearing A Return And Could Fix Several Problems",
    "description": "Hope arrives for Houston fans as explosive receiver Tank Dell nears return for the 2026 season, poised to reignite the offense and boost C.J. Stroud's performance.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Texans are coming off a disappointing end to the 2025 season, as the franchise was blown out by the New England Patriots in the Divisional round of the playoffs. Fans may be upset with how things ended, but the franchise is in the midst of its best stretch in history, having won a postseason game in each of the last three seasons. Things could also be looking up as Tank Dell will likely be returning for the 2026 season.\n\nDell has faced a ton of adversity in his career. The wide receiver attended three different colleges on his way to being the Texans' third-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. He had an immaculate rookie season in 2023, hauling in 47 passes for over 700 yards and seven touchdowns. The young wideout has dealt with injury issues since then as he missed the entire 2025 season while recovering from a knee injury he suffered at the end of the 2024 campaign.\n\nGeneral Manager Nick Caserio spoke to the media on Wednesday, providing updates on many topics. He spoke about Dell, and the executive shared that the wide receiver should be ready to go for the team's offseason program.\n\n#Texans GM Nick Caserio says the team expects Tank Dell to be ready for the offseason program.\n\n— Sam Warren (@samwarren_3) January 21, 2026\n\nThis is great news, as it means Dell will return to the lineup for the 2026 season. This brings Houston back one of its offensive weapons, while also giving quarterback C.J. Stroud back one of his favorite targets.\n\nDell and Stroud have always had a good connection, as evidenced by each player's numbers when they are on the field together. Dell has played in just 25 games in his career and has amassed 1,300 receiving yards while scoring 10 touchdowns. It's almost as if he makes the game a little bit easier for Stroud, which is something fans in Houston would like to see after the quarterback regressed once again during the 2025 campaign.\n\nStroud has been trying to get back to playing the way he did during his rookie season, but the quarterback has taken steps backward in his second and third years in the league. Dell returning to the lineup might spark some confidence in the quarterback, which hopefully will allow him to play the way he did in 2023.\n\nThe wide receiver room is a little more crowded now than it was in 2023, but Dell will hopefully fit back into the offense seamlessly once he is fully recovered from his injury.",

    "description": "England's secondary cup competition will adopt a format like the Champions League from next season – and will \"probably not\" be called the League Cup.",
    "fullText": "The Women's League Cup is undergoing a major revamp for next season which will include adopting a similar format to the Champions League and possibly altering its name.\n\nIt has already been confirmed that Women's Super League (WSL) clubs who qualify for the Women's Champions League will not compete.\n\nAnd in further changes, the WSL has said it plans to introduce a Swiss-style format for the league phase to guarantee more games for all participating teams.\n\nCurrently, all WSL2 and some WSL teams play in round-robin groups of four or five in the first round, with the winners progressing to the quarter-finals. Teams taking part in the Champions League - Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United this season - enter at the knockout stage.\n\nIn the revamped competition, all participating clubs would enter the league phase and be drawn to play six other sides.\n\nThe top eight teams in the league phase would progress to the quarter-finals. Unlike in the Champions League, there will be no play-off round because there is no space in the fixture calendar.\n\nThe name of the competition is still being discussed. It will \"probably not\" be called the League Cup because it will not have all the league teams involved.\n\nA WSL spokesperson said other options, including scrapping the League Cup, had been considered, but they felt these changes would give \"clarity of purpose\" to the competition.\n\n\"The calendar is one of the biggest constraints and challenges, there is only so much space on weekends for us to work with,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We've listened to fans and clubs, and it felt like it didn't have complete purpose, including Champions League teams entering at the quarter-final stage.\n\n\"We even put on the table, do we not have a secondary cup competition?\n\n\"But the challenge is that top players at top clubs get loads of minutes, loads of matches. If you are in the WSL2, you have a real disparity – we want to close that gap.\n\n\"We looked at whether Champions League clubs could enter a secondary team, but at this stage we deemed it was not possible.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said plans were being finalised with clubs and commercial partners, and would be put before the Football Association within the next four weeks.\n\nThe changes come amid the women's domestic calendar growing ever more crowded.\n\nThe Women's Champions League this season expanded from 16 to 18 clubs at the league phase, with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United involved – the first time three WSL teams had reached that point.\n\nArsenal and Manchester United will play in the knockout play-offs – a new round of games introduced this season - after finishing fifth and sixth respectively in the league.\n\nNext year the number of domestic top-flight games is also set to increase following the expansion of the WSL from 12 to 14 teams.\n\nWSL organisers have confirmed that teams who play in the Champions League will not drop into the secondary domestic cup even if they fail to progress through the qualifying rounds.\n\nBBC Sport also understands that the league phase will still be regionalised, as it is currently, to help clubs with travel time and costs.\n\nSponsorship of the competition is also uncertain. The deal with current sponsors Subway expires this summer, although it has an option to extend the contract by a year.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast. New episodes drop every Tuesday on BBC Sounds, plus find interviews and extra content from the Women's Super League and beyond on the Women's Football Weekly feed\n\nWomen's Club World Cup could be 'catastrophic' for WSL\n\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

    "fullText": "Atlético Madrid couldn't get past a draw in their Champions League match against Galatasaray. However, the big surprise of the night wasn't the result, but the performance of Marc Pubill.\n\nDue to absences in the defense, Simeone opted for the young full-back as a central defender, a risky decision that ended up resulting in a tactical showcase.\n\nPubill recorded an impeccable statistic in ball distribution with a 90.2% pass accuracy (37 out of 41 completed). His ability to interpret the game allowed the team to maintain possession under pressure, also adding zero ball losses in critical areas, a vital stat for his new position.\n\nIn the defensive aspect, the touch map reveals a constant presence in his own area and the central lane. His reading of the plays allowed him to intercept key balls that cut off the Turkish team's quick transitions.\n\nWith 59 total touches, the player demonstrated that his versatility is an invaluable asset for \"El Cholo's\" scheme. This performance not only secures the three points in Europe but also opens up a new range of tactical possibilities for the rest of the season.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Mercedes became the latest Formula 1 team to share their look for the new season, unveiling the striking W17 with a series of images released on Thursday.\n\nThe technical elements are in line with the incoming set of regulations, geared towards making the cars smaller, lighter, and more agile. The front and rear wings are smaller and the car is narrower overall, particularly when compared with previous season.\n\nFrom a livery standpoint, the design is a departure from what we have seen from Mercedes in previous years. A green line — a nod to title partner Petronas — anchors the car from the nose to the rear, drawing attention to a “transition” from silver to black as the eye trails along the W17. The iconic Mercedes three-pointed star dots the engine cover, while the sidepods contain a stunning array of silver lines.\n\nTop-down on the Mercedes W17 👁️#F1 @MercedesAMGF1 pic.twitter.com/MCTYSll4K9\n\n— Formula 1 (@F1) January 22, 2026\n\n“Formula One will undergo significant change in 2026, and we are prepared for that transition. The new regulations demand innovation and absolute focus across every area of performance. Our work on the new car, and the long-term development of the Power Unit and advanced sustainable fuels with Petronas, reflects that approach,” said Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff. \n\n“Releasing the first images of the W17 is simply the next step in that process. It represents the collective, sustained effort of our teams in Brixworth and Brackley. We will continue to push hard in the months ahead.”\n\nUp next for Mercedes — and the rest of the grid — is next week’s Barcelona Shakedown, where the teams will put their 2026 challengers through a private testing session. Two more testing sessions in Bahrain will follow next month.\n\nThe Silver Arrows will also officially unveil the W17 at a season launch event on February 2.",

    "title": "Real Madrid Set the Global Financial Standard",
    "description": "Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football according to Deloitte",
    "fullText": "Real Madrid continue to operate in a financial stratosphere of their own. According to Deloitte’s latest Football Money League report, Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football — and by a significant margin.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the club tops Deloitte’s global ranking after generating €1.161 billion in revenue during the 2024–25 season. That figure represents a year-on-year increase of €115.5 million and places Real Madrid nearly €200 million ahead of second-placed Barcelona (€974.8m). It also puts them well clear of the Premier League’s financial heavyweights, with Liverpool the highest English club in fifth place on €836.1m.\n\nCrossing the €1.1 billion threshold further cements Real Madrid’s status as football’s dominant economic force. What makes the achievement even more striking is that it comes despite a season without major silverware on the pitch in 2023–24. While trophies remain the club’s ultimate objective, the numbers underline Madrid’s ability to thrive financially regardless of short-term sporting outcomes.\n\nDeloitte notes that football’s three primary revenue streams — commercial, broadcasting, and matchday income — all reached record levels across the industry. Real Madrid were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this growth, consolidating their place at the top of the global game.\n\nKey contributors included revenue generated through the operation of the renovated Santiago Bernabéu, alongside income from participation in elite competitions such as the Champions League and the Club World Cup.\n\nThe central pillar of Real Madrid’s financial dominance remains its commercial arm. According to Deloitte, the club’s commercial revenue increased by 23% over the previous season, fueled by stronger merchandising sales and the addition of new global commercial partners.\n\nThe scale of that growth is such that Real Madrid’s commercial revenue alone would be enough to rank the club inside the top ten of the Money League — a threshold currently occupied by Chelsea at €584.1m in total revenue. This commercial strength also helped Madrid absorb a 6% drop in matchday revenue, largely linked to fluctuations tied to stadium usage and scheduling.\n\nIn short, Real Madrid’s business model is no longer dependent on any single income stream. Instead, it is built on diversification, global reach, and the growing monetization of the Bernabéu as a multi-purpose venue.\n\nBelow is the full top-20 ranking from Deloitte’s report, highlighting just how far ahead Real Madrid currently stand:\n\nThe latest Money League figures reinforce a trend that has been developing for years: Real Madrid are not merely competing with Europe’s elite — they are financially separating from them (at least from a revenue standpoint). With sustained growth across commercial partnerships, global merchandising, and stadium-driven revenue, the club has set a benchmark few others appear capable of matching.\n\nAs football’s economic landscape continues to evolve, Deloitte’s report makes one thing clear: when it comes to revenue generation, Real Madrid are not just winning — they are redefining the scale of the game.",

Anderson knows what it's like to beat the New England Patriots with a backup quarterback under center.\n\nDuring the 2025 season, starting quarterback Peyton Manning went down with a foot injury and Brock Osweiler was called on to start in his place. Osweiler ended up going 5-2 as a starter, including a 30-24 win against the Patriots in Week 11.\n\nDenver Broncos running back C.J. Anderson rushed 15 times for 113 yards and two touchdowns in that contest, including a 48-yard game-winner in overtime. That victory helped Denver (12-4) claim the No. 1 playoff seed over New England (12-4) later in the season.\n\nThat time the Broncos had a comeback win over the Patriots with C.J. Anderson’s 48-yard touchdown run in overtime. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/n6956b3izO\n\n— Sunday Night Football on NBC (@SNFonNBC) July 13, 2024\n\nTen years later, the Broncos are set to face the Patriots in the AFC Championship game with backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham under center following Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury. Denver could get running back J.K. Dobbins (foot) back from injured reserve in time for the game, and Anderson believes the Broncos can upset New England.\n\nIf the Defense is like 2015 then you find a way to win 2 games out Defense took on the challenge and they step up. RB’s step up defense step up rally behind JS and go find a way to win at home\n\n— Cj Anderson (@cjandersonb22) January 18, 2026\n\nLed by a talented defense and a productive rushing attack, Anderson believes Denver can beat the Patriots again, just like they did in 2015. Two months after that regular season showdown, the Broncos hosted New England again in the AFC title game and won 20-18. Fans in Denver will hope to see history repeat on Sunday.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: C.J.

    "description": "Oregon State women's basketball is beyond the halfway point of the 2025-26 season. Are the Beavers on track for March Madness?",
    "fullText": "The NCAA women’s basketball season has crossed over the halfway point.\n\nEyes are starting to turn toward postseason basketball as teams establish resumes worthy of a March Madness appearance.\n\nAmong them is Oregon State, which sits near the top of the West Coast Conference and is 14-6 overall (6-1 WCC) heading into the Jan. 22 home conference matchup with Gonzaga (also 14-6, 6-1)\n\nLeading the charge for the Beavers this season is junior guard Jenna Villa, a Washington native who’s averaging a team-high 15.9 points per game.\n\nNext to her are a pair of guards, Kennedie Shuler and Tiara Bolden, who are both averaging above 10 points per game. Shuler dishes out a team-high 5.6 assists per game, which is among the 25 best individual tallies in the nation.\n\nWins against Illinois, Utah State, Colorado State and a slew of WCC competition bolster the Oregon State resume, while the Beavers have losses to teams including Vanderbilt, No. 4 team in the USA Today’s coaches poll, Oregon and Arizona State.\n\nHow do the Beavers’ March Madness hopes stack up to the rest of the country?\n\nThe clearest path to March Madness for any team is to win the conference tournament. In 2025, Oregon State won the WCC tournament to earn an automatic bid to the dance.\n\nThis season, a competitive field of WCC opposition will challenge the Beavers to retain the throne.\n\nGonzaga, Oregon State and Santa Clara boast overall records securely above .500, while Loyola Marymount and Portland also hold strong conference records midway through the season.\n\nAll will be decided March 5-10 in Las Vegas, when the WCC hosts its conference championship. It’s a strong field, and bracketologists have conflicting predictions for which school will stand above the rest in the West Coast Conference.\n\nIn one prediction made by CBS’ Connor Groel, Gonzaga claims the WCC title to earn an automatic bid as a 12 seed. In another by ESPN’s Charlie Creme, the Beavers take WCC gold and an automatic bid as a 13 seed.\n\nThe WCC, notably, didn’t receive an at-large bid in 2025 but did in 2024 with Gonzaga.\n\nAccording to the NCAA, at-large bids are decided by a committee with a 10-step process that gathers a list of nominations, which is followed by an eight-step process that then ranks those nominations. Restrictions to nominees are lenient, but teams must hold a .500-or-better overall record.\n\nOregon State was 84th in the NCAA NET rankings, a tool used in the selection process, through Jan. 20 games.\n\nOregon State has become a familiar face in the field of 68 teams for the past decade or so under coach Scott Rueck.\n\nSince 2014, the Beavers have appeared in the Big Dance nine times. Of those nine, five have resulted in Sweet Sixteen appearances. Of those five, three ended in the Elite Eight.\n\nThe 2016 OSU team made it to the Final Four.\n\nWhen Rueck took over the program in 2010, something changed in Corvallis.\n\nRueck’s teams have been ranked in the top 25 in 10 different seasons. Rueck was named Pac-12 Conference coach of the year five times, he’s been nominated for numerous national coach of the year awards and OSU has won the Pac-12 three times.\n\nPrior to Rueck’s tenure, the Beavers had only made March Madness five times in school history.\n\nLandon Bartlett covers Oregon State and high school sports for the Statesman Journal.

    "fullText": "Leadership is the invisible currency of sports. Hard to quantify, but impossible to win without. The Athletic surveyed over 100 industry insiders to find the figures who command the most respect in 2025. From tacticians to culture-setters, these are the names that define the modern standard.

It should come as no surprise to see that Clemson has been ranked high in Andy Katz's first NCAA Tournament bracket.\n\nThis ranking might look eerily similar to those who followed last season and it would be right to have this mindset. Last year Clemson came in at the 5 seed squaring off against 12 seed McNeese State Cowboys, which lead to a 69-67 upset knocking Clemson out in the first round.\n\nBut this time around the projections is that we would be playing Yale who currently sits second at 3-1 in the conference and 14-3 overall. They are currently in a tight Ivy League title race with Dartmouth. Last year Yale was the #13 seed and was knocked out by the #4 seed Texas A&M Aggies.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M baseball head coach Michael Earley's roster continues to garner national preseason accolades entering his second year at the helm in College Station.\n\nAccording to Perfect Game USA's Top Players by Class list, six Aggies were recognized as some of the best players in college baseball in their respective classes. It includes juniors Caden Sorrell, Chris Hacopian, Gavin Grahovac, and Shane Sdao, sophomore Terrence Kiel II, and freshman Nico Partida. After losing many top contributors to the MLB Draft in the spring of 2025, Earley reloaded well in the transfer portal and maintained decent roster retention.\n\nTexas A&M will look to put last year's woes behind it and turn the page to a new chapter in 2026. To accomplish that feat, it will take talent like Perfect Game USA's Aggie selections to contribute and stay healthy throughout the upcoming season.\n\nSee which Aggies made the @PerfectGameUSA Top Players by Class list this season 🔝 👀#GigEm pic.twitter.com/xOnyFyp13w\n\n— Texas A&M Baseball (@AggieBaseball) January 21, 2026\n\nThe Maroon and White stood atop the national preseason rankings before last season's first pitch, but it didn't last long. While Texas A&M's roster suffered many injuries to open last year's efforts, the team's underwhelming performances led to the Aggies becoming the first preseason No. 1 to miss the postseason since 1991. As a result, some national journalists, such as Baseball America's Jacob Rudner, have avoided ranking the program in the top 25.\n\n\"So, what’s the holdup? The decision to hold Texas A&M out is rooted entirely in last season’s outcome. A year ago, a similarly talented roster opened the season ranked No. 1 and missed the NCAA Tournament altogether. Michael Earley retooled his staff this offseason and early returns have been positive, but until the Aggies translate that talent into consistent results, the benefit of the doubt is withheld. The expectation is not whether Texas A&M belongs in the rankings, but whether or not it will prove it does,\" Rudner said.\n\nTexas A&M's first pitch of 2026 is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 13, against the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles in College Station. Game 1 is set for 6 p.m., with Games 2 and 3 scheduled for 2 p.m. CT on Saturday, February 14, and 12 p.m. CT on Sunday, February 15, respectively.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M baseball's 2026 roster racking up preseason accolades",

The implications of the game for both the Broncos and Stidham are clear.\n\nA win would send the Broncos to the Super Bowl and it would take Stidham from unheralded backup to a household name overnight. On Wednesday, Stidham said he knows this is \"not about myself\" but how he can \"help my teammates succeed on Sunday.\" He said the approach to doing that is by keeping things as routine as possible despite the unusual circumstances.\n\n\"I think what I always go back to — in any game, regular season, preseason, the AFC Championship — it's still the same game,\" Stidham said, via the team's website. \"Obviously, there are implications and winner advances, all that kind of stuff, but at the end of the day, it's still football.

I'm not going to try to be somebody that I'm not. I know how I can play, and I know the kind of guys I have around me and the kind of team that we have. So, we all just have to play within ourselves.\"\n\nBroncos teammates and head coach Sean Payton have expressed confidence in Stidham's ability to handle being thrown into the fire in a do-or-die situation, but one look at the odds shows how much doubt exists outside of the organization. Stidham won't be able to quiet that before Sunday, so it is something else to ignore as he prepares for the biggest moment of his professional career.",

    "fullText": "It’s always interesting to see how a head coach votes during the final US LBM Coaches Poll, and for Notre Dame’s Marcus Freeman, he certainly tried to make a statement as shared by Tyler Horka.\n\nFor some odd reason, Alabama was still ranked ahead of the Irish, but not according to Freeman, who had the Crimson Tide a spot behind his team at No. 10. He also placed Brigham Young, a Notre Dame 2026 opponent who also was skipped over in the College Football Playoff at No. 11.\n\nThere was a big omission as well, as Freeman opted to leave USC out of his top-25 all-together. This was most likely a jab at the Trojans, who decided that they couldn’t play Notre Dame anymore due to the potential of missing out on the CFP. It was a weak eat out of the storied rivalry, and Freeman made sure they knew it as well.\n\nIt was fun to see how the Irish’s leader opted to vote in the final coaches poll, as he most likely didn’t have one of his staff members submit the picks.\n\nThis is Marcus Freeman’s final Coaches Poll ballot of the 2025 season, via @usatodaysports.\n\nOf note, out of 62 coaches…\n\n-He was one of 16 who had Notre Dame ranked ahead of Alabama.\n\n-He was one of 16 who did not rank USC. pic.twitter.com/T8em4buRBM\n\n— Tyler Horka (@tbhorka) January 21, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: See who Marcus Freeman omitted in his final coaches poll vote of 2026",

    "description": "Iowa State's Joshua Jefferson become the first player in program history to record multiple triple-doubles in a season, ending a two-game slide.",
    "fullText": "Iowa State star Joshua Jefferson had every opportunity to be a football player.\n\nHis father, Ben, played at Maryland along with the NFL and CFL. His two brothers played collegiately, with Cameron winning the Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos.\n\nAll are large humans on the offensive or defensive line.\n\nYet, Joshua chose basketball early. And with his 6-foot-9, 240-pound frame, he’s been a monster for the Cyclones.\n\nAnd the biggest reason for their most recent bounceback.\n\nAfter struggling for two games — both the Cyclones’ first and second loss of the year — he responded with a triple-double in a rout of UCF, becoming the first Cyclone to have multiple triple-doubles in a season.\n\nJohnson had 17 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds. He made 6 of 11 shots and had no turnovers.\n\n“I'm just proud of his ability mentally to lock in on the things that are important for us to be successful,” Iowa State coach TJ Otzelberger said, “and now we just gotta work together and maintain that every night out.\"\n\nIf Iowa State gets that every night from Jefferson, the two-game blip will be forgotten deep into March.\n\nLet’s get to this week’s Big 12 power rankings.\n\nMore: Iowa State basketball gets back to being Iowa State basketball | Hines\n\nThis week: vs. West Virginia (Saturday); at BYU (Monday)\n\nWhat to know: The Wildcats are one of only three unbeaten teams remaining around the country. And it really hasn’t been close in league play. They’ve beaten each team by at least nine points.\n\nThis week: at Texas Tech (Saturday); at TCU (Wednesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Cougars, winners of 11 straight, have won their last three games by an average of 27 points. Twenty-seven! That’s unheard of in the Big 12.\n\nThis week: at Oklahoma State (Saturday); vs. Colorado (Thursday)\n\nWhat to know: The Cyclones uncharacteristically lost two straight games then took out their frustrations on UCF. Getting back to lock-down defense was key, but Jefferson getting right was crucial.\n\nThis week: vs. Houston (Saturday)\n\nWhat to know: The Red Raiders set a Big 12 record with 14 first-half 3-pointers in a demolition of Baylor. They tied a program record with 17 3s in the game. So, now the team with the reigning Big 12 Player of the Year can overwhelm others from deep.\n\nMore: Texas Tech basketball demolishes Baylor behind trio of 20-point scorers\n\nThis week: vs. Arizona (Monday)\n\nWhat to know: Robert Wright III has been an excellent addition for the Cougars. The Baylor transfer is averaging 22.2 points in Big 12 play. He’s been so valuable that he missed one whole minute against Texas Tech, which went on a 6-0 run without him to take control.\n\nThis week: at Kansas State (Saturday)\n\nWhat to know: The Jayhawks have three straight wins but the health of coach Bill Self is the biggest concern. Here’s to hoping he is back on the team’s bench sooner than later.\n\nThis week: at Colorado (Saturday); vs. Arizona State (Tuesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Knights suffered back-to-back losses for the first time all season. Being without Jamichael Stillwell and losing Jeremy Foumena to an injury is a big problem for a team with a NCAA Tournament resume.\n\nThis week: at Baylor (Saturday); vs. Houston (Wednesday)\n\nWhat to know: David Punch is having a breakout season. His latest gem was a double-double and game-winning shot in a wild comeback over Oklahoma State. That avoided a five-game skid for the Frogs.\n\nThis week: vs. TCU (Saturday); at Cincinnati (Wednesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Bears are 1-5 in league play, but they have losses to conference contenders Iowa State, Houston, Kansas and Texas Tech. A softer schedule awaits.\n\nThis week: at Arizona (Saturday); vs. Kansas State (Tuesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Mountaineers are 4-2 in the Big 12, a bit of a surprise. Outside of the upset of Kansas, they’ve topped three of the bottom teams in the league, though.\n\nThis week: vs. Iowa State (Saturday)\n\nWhat to know: The Cowboys have not won at TCU since 2017, a streak that continued with a nine-point collapse this week. That loss will sting come March, especially with Iowa State, BYU and Arizona in three of the next four games.\n\nMore: Oklahoma State basketball collapses late at TCU as David Punch stuns Cowboys\n\nThis week: at Arizona State (Saturday); vs. Baylor (Wednesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Bearcats finally had a Big 12 winning streak, even taking down Iowa State. But nobody beats the No. 1- and No. 2-ranked teams in back-to-back games.\n\nThis week: vs. UCF (Saturday); at Iowa State (Thursday)\n\nWhat to know: The Buffaloes have lost four straight games. In that span, their 3-point percentage has drastically fallen. For a team built on a high-powered offense, that’s a problem.\n\nThis week: vs. Cincinnati (Saturday); at UCF (Tuesday)\n\nWhat to know: Sun Devils coach Bobby Hurley said a stretch of games against Arizona, BYU and Houston is like playing in the Final Four. His team didn’t quite respond well. ASU has lost 7 of 8 games.\n\nThis week: vs. Kansas (Saturday); at West Virginia (Tuesday)\n\nWhat to know: Down to just seven players, the Wildcats topped Utah for their first win in league play. But losing sharpshooter Abdi Bashir Jr. to a foot injury is potentially devastating to a team already struggling.\n\nWhat to know: The Utes have been scrappy, particularly in their last four games. Terrence Brown’s hot play has been a big reason.\n\nJacob Unruh is the deputy sports editor for The Oklahoman. Have a story idea for Jacob?

    "fullText": "The 2025 Ryder Cup will be remembered as one of the most intense and chaotic editions in the event’s history.\n\nFrom the opening tee shot, the atmosphere was raucous, with the European team heckled relentlessly by the home crowd.\n\nWhile some of the comments crossed the line, Viktor Hovland found humour in at least one of them.\n\nThe Norwegian, who played a key role for Europe, shared the moment that stood out most – a rare example of wit amid the noise.\n\nWhile much of the American crowd’s energy was directed toward unsettling Europe, one comment in particular made Hovland laugh.\n\nHe told Dan Rapaport: “One said, ‘Yeah, three Ryder Cups and no girlfriend. Kinda weird.’”\n\nKnown for his calm personality and sense of humour, the 28-year-old admitted that the remark was so unexpected that he couldn’t help but laugh.\n\nThe Norwegian’s reaction stood in stark contrast to some of his teammates, who were visibly frustrated by the constant heckling throughout the tournament.\n\nThe 2025 edition was widely described as the rowdiest Ryder Cup in history, with several moments where crowd behaviour pushed the boundaries of sportsmanship.\n\nStill, Hovland’s ability to stay composed summed up the approach that has made him one of the most popular figures in modern golf.\n\nHovland was asked to put together his version of the ‘perfect golfer,’ combining the best qualities of the players he most admires.\n\nHis choices showed both his respect for his peers and his insight into what separates the elite from the rest.\n\nThe selections reflected Hovland’s deep respect for his peers and his understanding of what makes each player elite in their own way.\n\nFrom McIlroy’s effortless power to Matsuyama’s creativity around the greens, his picks offered a thoughtful glimpse into how one of golf’s sharpest minds views greatness.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool took the decision to send Harvey Elliott on loan to Aston Villa on transfer deadline day.\n\nThe 22-year-old - now a double Premier League title winner - was permitted to join Unai Emery’s side on a one-season loan deal ahead of a potential permanent move.\n\nThe terms of the deal dictated that Elliott’s loan would become permanent once he played 10 first-team games for the Villans. But it looked as though his fate was sealed early - with no appearances in any competition since October and stuck on five games overall.\n\nLiverpool have been linked with a move to bring Elliott back from his nightmare loan spell with Villa having little inclination to activate the £35m clause.\n\nHowever the England under-21 international would be severely limited in his options for the second half of the season if he did come back.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThe Anfield club would be unable to send the playmaker on loan to another European club - as Elliott has already featured for two clubs in the 2025/26 season.\n\nTherefore the midfielder is stuck in a limbo - unable to be fixed up with a new deal and with no chance of first-team football at Villa or Liverpool for that matter.\n\nBut Elliott could be set for an UNEXPECTED Aston Villa reprieve.\n\nFollowing John McGinn’s knee injury against Everton at the weekend Villa are very much down to the bare bones in midfield.\n\nThe Scotland international joins Amadou Onana, Ross Barkley and Boubacar Kamara on the treatment table at Villa Park.\n\nEmery is quickly running out of options in midfield - utilising Dutch defender Lamare Bogarde in the engine room against the Toffees.\n\nWith McGinn sidelined he opted to bring in Evann Guessand and shuffle his deck but he has got nowhere to turn for the upcoming weeks unless he offers the olive branch to Elliott.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what he does over the on-loan Liverpool star for the games against Fenerbahce on Thursday as well as Newcastle at the weekend.\n\nNo one is saying Elliott is going to reach the 10-game threshold in order to facilitate a permanent deal.",

I was ready after five or six weeks, but because it was for a world title, we thought we had to do the full 12.”\n\nWhat might be an issue for Pimblett is that he has become used to longer camps throughout his career, especially in the UFC.\n\nBut being given a world title shot has made this training camp even more intense and is reportedly something that Pimblett has not enjoyed at all.\n\nPimblett explained: “I am very glad I did it for this fight, though, but I’ll never be doing another one unless it’s for Khabib [Nurmagomedov] in his comeback!”\n\nUFC 324 will be a first for Pimblett, as he’s never fought in January before. And if his comments to new UFC host Kate Scott are anything to go by, it’s not something he plans on repeating.\n\nDuring CBS’ coverage of the UEFA Champions League, he made it clear that fighting this early in the year doesn’t suit him at all.\n\nHe also made sure Dana White and the UFC know that future January or February offers will be turned down before they’re even made.\n\n“I’ve never fought this early before. This is the earliest I’ve ever fought,” Pimblett said.\n\n“I’m never, ever fighting in January or February ever again. I just hope everyone at the UFC knows that because it ruined my Christmas and ruined my birthday.\n\nPimblett doubled down on his stance, urging fans not to expect any matches from him so early next year either: “Next year, get on me in March.”\n\nPaddy Pimblett may be glad he didn’t go too heavy over Christmas, especially if it makes the weight cut down to 155 pounds a bit easier.\n\nJust days out from UFC 324, Pimblett gave an update on his progress, saying things are looking good as he aims to hit the championship weight limit for the first time in his career.\n\n“I’ve still got weight to lose but I’ve got less weight to lose now than I did have 12 hours before I fought Michael Chandler,” he said during the same interview.",

    "fullText": "Inter are making significant strides toward a sensational return for Ivan Perisic, with negotiations already reaching an advanced stage.\n\nAccording to Alfredo Pedullà, the Croatian international has given his total approval to a move back to the San Siro. Discussions with Perisic’s entourage are well advanced as the Nerazzurri seek a reliable wide option to bolster Cristian Chivu’s squad, especially given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Denzel Dumfries’ fitness. Questions have been raised about Luis Henrique’s abilities too.\n\nHowever, the timing of the deal hinges on PSV Eindhoven’s European journey. The Dutch side are currently in a delicate stretch of their campaign and will face Bayern Munich next Wednesday in a crucial Champions League clash. If PSV are eliminated from the competition, the path for Perisic’s departure is expected to clear immediately.\n\nThe 36-year-old’s desire to wear the Inter shirt again is the driving force behind the talks, and while the Italian giants remain respectful of PSV’s current commitments, an exit from Europe for the Eredivisie club could bring the transfer to life in the final days of the window.",

The Trojans dropped their final game of the year, falling 30-27 to TCU in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nUSC was one of six Big Ten teams ranked in the final poll. The national champion Hoosiers were No. 1, followed by No. 4 Oregon and No. 5 Ohio State. In addition, Iowa was ranked No. 17 and Michigan No. 21.\n\nDoes it make sense to have USC three spots behind an Iowa team that the Trojans finished with the same record as and beat head-to-head? No. Is it worth complaining about at this point? Also no. Finishing a few spots higher in the final poll would not have meant much for USC in the scheme of things.\n\nNext season, USC is slated to face three of the top five teams from the final 2025 rankings. The Trojans will visit Indiana and host Ohio State and Oregon. It will certainly not be an easy road next year as USC enters what could be a make-or-break season for head coach Lincoln Riley.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: USC football ranked No. 20 in final AP Poll of season",

FC Schalke 04 has shaken up the winter transfer market with the signing of Edin Džeko.\n\nThe veteran Bosnian striker, 39 years old, arrives from AC Fiorentina to lead the Miners’ attack during the final 16 matches of the 2025/2026 season.\n\nDžeko, who will wear the number 10 shirt, returns to Germany where he was already a champion and top scorer with Wolfsburg.\n\nAccording to Youri Mulder, the club’s sporting director, the striker showed immediate enthusiasm for the project, bringing the necessary leadership to a team looking to consolidate its growth in the second half of the season.\n\nThe Bosnian international highlighted Schalke’s positive evolution after difficult years. “I was impressed by how much the team has grown this season. I’m eager to play in front of a full VELTINS-Arena,” said the striker, who has already spoken with coach Miron Muslic and his compatriot Nikola Katic.\n\nWith an enviable career at clubs like Manchester City, Inter, and Roma, the \"Bosnian Diamond\" is now seeking one last successful dance in Gelsenkirchen. His arrival not only brings goals, but also vital leadership to the dressing room in the decisive stretch of the championship.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Marseille 0-3 Liverpool: Goals from Dominik Szobozslai and Cody Gakpo, plus an own goal, ensured the Reds eased past their French opponents on Mohamed Salah’s return after Afcon",
    "fullText": "Liverpool breezed past Marseille with a 3-0 victory at the Orange Velodrome in the Champions League, firing the Reds into the top eight of this season’s league phase.\n\nWith Mohamed Salah making his much-anticipated return to the starting XI after coming back from the Afcon, an audacious free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai broke the deadlock for Liverpool on the stroke of half-time.\n\nJeremie Frimpong forced Marseille goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli to deflect the ball into his own net after 72 minutes before substitute Cody Gakpo managed to add a third in what turned out to be a memorable European night for Arne Slot’s side.\n\nThe last time the French side beat Liverpool was just shy of 20 years ago in 2007, and they didn’t pose any threat to changing that statistic. Liverpool have now extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 13 games and Slot will be hoping that his team will be able to maintain the same composure when they travel to Bournemouth this weekend.\n\nHere are The Independent’s player ratings for Liverpool’s win over Marseille:\n\nKept a clean sheet. He looked in control, commanding his area and comfortably claiming crosses, it was business as usual for the Brazilian veteran. He only had to make one real save from Amine Gouiri in the first half. The Liverpool shot-stopper may not quite be in his prime anymore but he still looks as safe a pair of hands as almost any keeper in world football. He also made a great save from a Mason Greenwood shot where the ball was bouncing awkwardly in front of him and made another good stop from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang late on.\n\nEffective and worked hard in both attacking and defensive positions, did well to get crosses in the box considering Marseille’s very wide shape. He could be shaping up to be one of Liverpool’s best signings this season. Frimpong was the key to Liverpool’s second goal which ultimately killed the game off, beating his man before Rulli parried the shot into his own net. He was everywhere constantly, not giving any Marseille player a moment’s rest, and dealt well with Igor Paixao who came on for Hamed Traore for the hosts.\n\nMissed a header but it wouldn’t have counted anyway so that first career goal still eludes him. Worked well with Virgil van Dijk defensively in the first half, remained composed at the back and calmly dissolved many Marseille attacking chances. The centre-back looked good, especially given Ibrahima Konate has been starting ahead of him for a while now, and could be a more regular partner for Van Dijk moving forward.\n\nDidn’t have much to do in the first half but dealt with Timothy Weah well and produced a typically ice-cool performance. He played his usual lofted passes into midfield, particularly to Dominik Szoboszlai and prevented a good chance with a very timely interception of Weah’s low driven shot in the 66th minute for Marseille.\n\nIt could’ve easily been a hard night for Kerkez to deal with Mason Greenwood down the left flank, but he stood his ground well against the Marseille talisman, although he lacked some quality in his own delivery at times. He undoubtedly could’ve been the best player on the pitch tonight if he’d had more quality in the final third but a classy defensive display from the left-back overall.\n\nTracked back well, didn’t have too much of the ball but made the Liverpool midfield tick. It was the Dutchman who won the free-kick in a dangerous position on the stroke of half-time which resulted in the goal. He played well given he wasn’t playing in his usual box-to-box role, getting an assist for Cody Gakpo in 92nd minute.\n\nCame so close to scoring after just 20 minutes, played well throughout and contributed to some fluid attacking play. Although he’s not as effective as he once was for the Reds, his and Gravenberch’s understanding as a deep two in midfield showed. He linked up nicely with the forwards in the second half and was still kickstarting attacks all the way to the very end of the match.\n\nProduced silky touches and still contributed defensively despite playing in behind Hugo Ekitike and Mohamed Salah as one of the twin 10s alongside Florian Wirtz. He made great runs and linked up well with Van Dijk, plus scored an audacious free-kick on his 100th start for the club, which was perfectly executed under the wall. You have to be a certain class of player to do that under those circumstances in the first of the two added minutes before half time. He then also played a huge part in the final goal, with a gorgeous touch to set Gravenberch away, who then assisted Gakpo. It’s seven goals in all competitions this season for the Hungarian and he is well on his way to becoming a free-kick specialist.\n\nHis first game since returning from Afcon was nothing to shout about for the Egyptian on the whole, although he played a brilliant ball in behind to Ekitike at one point and nearly scored a wonderful flicked goal after jumping high in the air to get on the end of a ball in from the right. However, it ended up on the roof of the net. He didn’t have his signature killer instinct in front of goal, fluffing a chance in the 83rd minute after bizarrely shooting with outside of the boot from close range and other players look like more potent attacking forces for Liverpool currently. Still a case of dusting off the cobwebs at the moment for Salah.\n\nTimid from the German, who lacked sharpness and his normal quick feet. Multiple attacking build-ups ended with him mistiming his first touch, and was set up multiple times by Ekitike, only to miss a decent chance. Despite looking sharper in the second half, he didn’t have his signature class in front of goal in the final third.\n\nSo unlucky, hit the post with a lovely side-footed effort, posed a major offensive threat like he usually does, won multiple fouls and nearly broke the deadlock after 23 minutes when he finished smartly but the goal was ruled out for offside. He showed desire to get in behind, fed clever passes into the likes of Wirtz in 48th minute, who failed to get his shot off in time, and could’ve very easily got an assist or two. He did practically everything but get his goal at the Orange Velodrome.\n\nDidn’t see too much of the ball but put some good runs in behind to stretch a lethargic Marseille side and helped his team see the game out.\n\nAlmost made a quick impact as he played a lovely weighted pass into Salah which could’ve wrapped up a demolition job in the 83rd minute. However he wrapped up it himself with a tidy finish, opening up his body to slot home in injury-time.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid have received a timely double boost ahead of their upcoming La Liga clash against Villarreal, with a report from Melchor Ruiz confirming that both Rodrygo and Brahim Diaz have returned to training.\n\nRodrygo’s comeback is particularly significant given his recent absence from competitive action.\n\nThe Brazilian forward has been sidelined for a period after suffering physical problems during the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nThose issues forced him to miss Real Madrid’s last two domestic fixtures against Albacete and Levante, before also being ruled out of the midweek encounter against AS Monaco.\n\nNow back on the training pitch, Rodrygo’s return gives the coaching staff more attacking options as preparations intensify for the Villarreal match.\n\nWhile his availability for the weekend will depend on how his physical condition responds in the final sessions, his presence alone is a positive sign.\n\nThe 25-year-old remains an important piece in Madrid’s attacking structure, and his recovery comes at a crucial moment in the season.\n\nBrahim’s return carries a very different emotional context.\n\nBrahim Diaz has returned to training. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nThis is because the attacking midfielder has just completed international duty with Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nNotably, this tournament ended in heartbreak, as Morocco lost the final to Senegal, with Brahim missing a decisive penalty.\n\nDespite returning clearly affected by the outcome of that final, those close to the player insist that he also comes back mentally strengthened.\n\nIn many ways, it is a renewed version of Brahim who re-joins the squad, motivated to channel that experience into his club performances.\n\nSportingly, Brahim is once again fighting for something familiar – a place in Real Madrid’s starting lineup.\n\nCompetition is fierce, particularly on the right side of attack, where Franco Mastantuono is also pushing for opportunities.\n\nRodrygo’s return further intensifies that battle, even if the Brazilian is only just working his way back to full fitness.",

    "fullText": "Pitchers and catchers have their first workouts from February 9th to February 13th. This offseason saw many players move in the form of trades and free agency. As anticipation starts for the 2026 season, baseball fans are beginning to home in on their favorite teams.\n\nFans begin to research rosters, minor league prospects, and the 2026 schedules. Spring Training baseball brings hope to fans anxiously awaiting their favorite team to reach World Series glory. Here are the top 10 MLB teams heading into Spring Training.\n\nDetroit rosters MLB’s best starting pitcher in Tarik Skubal. The Tigers could trade their superstar if a long-term extension can’t be reached. If Skubal is traded, the Tigers will be in need of a number one starting pitcher.\n\nThe team’s lineup features young players and blossoming superstar Riley Greene. This offseason, the front office helped strengthen Detroit’s bullpen.\n\nLast season, Houston missed the playoffs for the first time since 2016. The team’s shortcomings were due to injuries, most notably to Yordan Alvarez and team closer Josh Hader. This offseason, the Astros added free agent Japanese pitcher Tatsuya Imai.\n\nImai joins Hunter Brown and Christian Javier in Houston’s starting rotation. The key to Houston’s upcoming season is health.\n\nOn paper, teams are better than the Brewers, but the front office and coaching staff get the best out of the team’s roster. Last season, Milwaukee’s top starting pitching prospect, Jacob Misiorowski, made his debut and took the league by storm.\n\nMisiorowski will join Freddie Peralta at the top of the team’s starting rotation. The Brewers’ lineup will again be led by Christian Yelich, Brice Turang, and last season’s breakout outfielder, Jackson Chourio.\n\nBoston was led by ace starting pitcher Garrett Crochet in 2025. The starter had the best season of his career and will produce more production in 2026. The team lost third baseman Alex Bregman in free agency, but the lineup features Trevor Story, Jarren Duran, Wilyer Abreu, Roman Anthony, and newly acquired hitter Willson Contreras.\n\nThe Red Sox bolstered their rotation, signing starting pitcher Sonny Gray. If Boston can successfully slide prospect Marcelo Mayer into Bregman’s void, they can reach the playoffs again in 2026.\n\nThe Yankees have the lineup to win the World Series, but continue to fall short. Any team with Aaron Judge will always have the chance to win. The Yankees haven’t made a splash in free agency, but the upcoming season will feature the return of starting pitcher Gerrit Cole.\n\nCole will rejoin the starting rotation that features Max Fried, Carlos Rodon, and breakout candidate Cam Schlitter. With Cody Bellinger locked up long-term, the glaring questions are whether shortstop Anthony Volpe can fix his consistency issues and if the pitching staff can stay healthy throughout the season.\n\nChicago started the first half of 2025 as one of MLB’s best teams. However, the Cubs regressed mightily in the second half. This offseason, the team lost outfielder Kyle Tucker in free agency but signed Alex Bregman to fill the glaring hole at third base. The front office acquired starting pitcher Edward Cabrera, and he will join starting pitchers Shota Imanaga, James Taillon, Cade Horton, and Matthew Boyd.\n\nStarting pitcher Justin Steele returns to the starting rotation after missing all of 2025 to elbow surgery. After outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong’s breakout season, the Cubs’ lineup is projected to be one of the strongest in Major League Baseball.\n\nBarring injuries, Seattle’s rotation has the chance to be one of the league’s best. It’s difficult to name a starting five better than the combination of Luis Castillo, Logan Gilbert, Bryan Woo, George Kirby, and Bryce Miller. The group makes up the best strength of the Mariners’ roster.\n\nThey came up short during last season’s playoff push but brings back a lineup that features Cal Raleigh, Josh Naylor, Randy Arozarena, and Julio Rodriguez. Seattle will be the team to beat in the AL West.\n\nThe Phillies are the best National League team to dethrone the Los Angeles Dodgers. Last season, Philadelphia fell to Los Angeles in the NLDS. Unfortunately, the team was without starting pitcher Zack Wheeler and is likely to begin 2026 without its ace. With Ranger Suarez leaving in free agency, the Phillies will look to Christopher Sanchez, Aaron Nola, and Jesus Luzardo as their top three starters.\n\nProspect Andrew Painter will have the opportunity to break Spring Training in the rotation, and he has one of the best arms of any minor league prospect. Philadelphia’s lineup returns veterans J.T. Realmuto, Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Kyle Schwarber, and free agent acquisition Adolis Garcia. Outfielder Nick Castellanos is likely to be traded before Spring Training.\n\nToronto was one of MLB’s top teams throughout the 2025 season. The Blue Jays represented the American League in the World Series but fell to the Dodgers in seven games. This season, Toronto looks to repeat as American League pennant winners. Its starting pitching rotation of Kevin Gausman, Dylan Cease, Shane Bieber, Jose Berrios, and postseason standout Trey Yesavage can be one of the top rotations in MLB.\n\nThey added to their lineup this season, adding Japanese free agent Kazuma Okamoto. The team hopes Okamoto will mitigate lost production following shortstop Bo Bichette’s signing with the Mets. The Japanese free agent will be included in a lineup that features Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Anthony Santander, Addison Barger, Daulton Varsho, and George Springer.\n\nLA enters Spring Training as the top team in Major League Baseball. Their roster features Shohei Ohtani, the league’s best player, and they added Kyle Tucker as a free agent.\n\nTucker joins the best lineup, top to bottom, and is positioned to have the best season of his career. If the starting rotation can stay healthy, the group of Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow, Blake Snell, Roki Sasaki, and Shohei Ohtani can finish as the league’s top-ranked staff.\n\nThe front office brought in free agent closer Edwin Diaz to secure the ninth inning of ball games. For all the negative talk about the front office’s spending, one thing is clear: team ownership wants to win every season.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post Ranking the top 10 MLB teams entering 2026 Spring Training appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Ospreys head coach Mark Jones says his squad will attempt to do the under-fire region proud when they face Lions in the United Rugby Championship (URC) on Friday night in Bridgend.\n\nWelsh rugby was plunged into fresh crisis after it emerged Ospreys owners - Y11 Sport & Media - were the preferred bidders in a deal to purchase Cardiff from the Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nThe WRU has proposed cutting one of its four men's professional sides - Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - to the dismay of fans across the country.\n\nOspreys had a stormy meeting with chief executive Lance Bradley where \"one or two of the players\" walked out early, while a full contact training session was cancelled.\n\nJones - who makes 10 changes to the starting XV for the game - says it has been a tough week and not ideal preparation but says his side will try to focus on matters on the field.\n\n\"I'm confident that on Friday night, the Ospreys supporters will see a group of men and women working on behalf of the Ospreys trying to get a result,\" said Jones.\n\n\"Hopefully they'll be proud of the effort they're seeing from the group.\"\n\nLions assistant coach Wessel Roux says he is expecting an Ospreys backlash from the off-the-field controversy.\n\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty in Welsh rugby at the moment,\" said Wessels.\n\n\"I think everybody wants to fight and put their best foot forward. They'll be an absolutely hungry side and will want to make a statement.\"\n\nThis could prove a crucial battle for both sides in the race to finish in the top eight and reach the URC play-offs, with the Lions currently seventh and the Ospreys ninth.\n\nCentre Keiran Williams will make his 100th appearance in the much-changed side from the team that lost in the Challenge Cup against Montpellier.\n\nOnly wing Daniel Kasende, centre Owen Watkin, prop Steffan Thomas, lock Rhys Davies and number eight Morgan Morris keep their starting spots.\n\nWales captain Dewi Lake and fellow internationals Dan Edwards, Kieran Hardy, James Ratti and Harri Deaves return, alongside Australian lock Ryan Smith.\n\nLions centre Henco van Wyk will make his 50th appearance for the South African side.\n\nWelsh rugby rallies around crisis-hit Ospreys\n\nOspreys told of Cardiff interest as players walk out of meeting\n\nOspreys: Hopkins; Kasende, Watkin, K Williams, Giles; Edwards, Hardy; S Thomas, Lake (capt), Botha, R Davies, R Smith, Ratti, Deaves, Morgan.\n\nReplacements: L Lewis, C Jones, Hire, L Jones, Moriarty, Morse, Morgan-Williams, Cokanasiga.\n\nJohannesburg Lions: Horn; Davids, van Wyk, Mills, R Kriel; M van den Berg, Smith; Kotze, PJ Botha, Ntlabakanye, Schoeman, Nothnagel, R du Plessis, Hlekani, F Horn (capt).\n\nReplacements: Brandon, RF Schoeman, C van Vuuren, E Oosthuizen, Landsberg, Cairns, Pead, E Cronje.\n\nReferee: Federico Vedovelli (Italy)\n\nAssistant referees: Adam Jones (Wales), Lucas Yendle (Wales)\n\nLegal action considered over Ospreys future as players hit out\n\nWelsh players' body gives bosses 6 February deadline\n\nWRU has 'immense disconnect' with fans, say MPs",

    "fullText": "Everton are still trying to bring in a new striker this month, but it looks like one of their targets has come up on Sean Dyche’s radar too.\n\nThey have not made any signings so far this month.\n\nEven though a forward is needed, the Toffees are not expected to spend much. Loans seem more realistic at this stage.\n\nStill, they are keeping their options open and checking out what might be possible.\n\nThis week, reports came out that Everton had asked about Sunderland’s Wilson Isidor. He has not been getting much playing time and could be available.\n\nBut if Everton do decide to make a move, they will not be the only club interested in him.\n\nAccording to Sky Sports’ Keith Downie, interest in Isidor has been picking up as the transfer window nears its close.\n\nHe mentioned that Everton are interested, and so are Nottingham Forest under Sean Dyche.\n\nDownie posted on X: “Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired on Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor. No concrete approach has been made, as both clubs are waiting and/or considering other targets.\n\n“The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and is one to watch this window.\n\n“25-year-old Isidor’s contract is up in 2028 but he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland.\n\n“Isidor has scored 4 Premier League goals this season, but hasn’t netted since October.”\n\nIt remains to be seen if either club will decide to make a formal offer for Isidor.\n\nEarlier this week, there were reports suggesting that Everton were not actively moving forward with a pursuit of Isidor, which could give Dyche and Forest an opening.\n\nDyche has a clear need for more firepower this month. Only Wolves have scored fewer goals than Forest this season, and adding another option up front could be crucial in the battle against relegation.\n\nForest are just five points above the drop zone at the moment, making every decision in the transfer window even more important.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool icon and CBS Golazo pundit Jamie Carragher has told the story of when he got into it with new Real Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa, at the time, a teammate of Carragher’s at Anfield. The two had to be separated, amusingly, by Arbeloa’s predecessor, Xabi Alonso.\n\nArbeloa moved to Real Madrid from Real Zaragoza as a teenager, and came through at La Fabrica, before leaving for Deportivo La Coruna in 2006. A move to Liverpool followed a year later, and he spent two seasons at Anfield before returning to Real Madrid as a senior player, where he would be for seven years.\n\nSpeaking on CBS Sports‘ Golazo show alongside Thierry Henry, Kate Giles and Micah Richards, Carragher was shown images of the two during a Liverpool clash.\n\n“I’m saying ‘If you even dare to take that job off Xabi Alonso’, and Xabi’s saying, ‘don’t worry about it, they’re all the prima donnas anyway, I don’t want the job!'” he joked over images of Alonso separating him from Arbeloa during a Liverpool game.\n\n“Basically. You go and shake hands off the back of it don’t you? We were going for the most clean sheets. Listen, he was a good player Arbeloa, he wasn’t a great player, he was a good player. And he started thinking he was a great player. So I just needed to rein him back in a little bit. He was attacking too much.”\n\n“He just didn’t want to defend. And that was his job. Just defend. And we get our clean sheet. And I think we won 2-0 that day against West Brom, we got the golden gloves, for Pepe Reina.”\n\nInterestingly, just 24 hours beforehand, Arbeloa had commented on not wanting Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior to do too much defending. The defensive work-rate of their superstar duo was called into question under Xabi Alonso, but it seems Arbeloa will be placing less demands on them in that sense.",

    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov, the country's new defense minister, said his troops are already inflicting 35,000 battlefield kills a month. He wants more.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister has set a new goal for its forces to kill 50,000 Russian troops a month, a sharp increase from the losses that Kyiv says it's inflicting on the Kremlin now.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters on Tuesday, Mykhailo Fedorov said the new figure would be a core \"strategic objective\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"The objective is to impose costs on Russia that it cannot bear. In this way to force peace through strength,\" Fedorov said.\n\nNotably, he specified only battlefield fatalities.\n\nThe new standard comes as Russia intensified its offensive in some areas of the front lines last year, aiming to take key cities such as Pokrovsk. The nature of its operations — often reliant on continuous high-casualty infantry attacks — has led to political discussion in recent months that the Kremlin may soon reach a point where it will lose more soldiers than it can recruit.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in December that his forces had, for the first time, killed and wounded more Russian soldiers in one month than the Kremlin had called up for the same time period.\n\nFedorov, who was confirmed in his role last week, said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops are already documenting 35,000 kills every month via video.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte cited another figure while speaking in Brussels on January 16, saying that 20,000 to 25,000 Russian troops were dying every month.\n\nWhile differing significantly, both figures indicate that Russia is fighting the war at a high cost.\n\nRutte said the death rate has become \"unsustainable\" for Russia, and drew comparisons to the Soviet Union's losses during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, when an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops died every month over nine years.\n\nLikewise, Fedorov expressed hopes that ramping up a focus on lethality will exhaust Russia's war machine.\n\n\"If we reach the figure of 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They treat people as a resource, and problems with that resource are already obvious,\" he said.\n\nRussia does not disclose how many of its troops are wounded or killed during the war. However, international and Ukrainian analyses say the number is likely tracking past 1 million people over nearly four years of war.\n\nThe UK's defense ministry said in early January that the Kremlin may have suffered at least 1.2 million total casualties, which includes both wounded and deceased, since February 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has relied largely on hefty sign-up bonuses to attract local contract soldiers, though it's also been found to sustain troop levels through other means, such as by recruiting from prisons or hiring foreigners via informal channels.\n\nSome of those strategies may be waning. On Tuesday, the Russian independent media outlet Vertska reported that contract soldier sign-ups were slowing in some areas of the country.\n\nData from an unnamed source in the Moscow mayor's office, it wrote, showed that the capital had seen a roughly 25% annual drop in recruitment in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear how Fedorov intends to specifically target increasing combat kills. He said in his opening remarks to Ukrainian lawmakers last week that he intended to divert more staffing to drone units. Drones are thought to be responsible for roughly 70 to 90% of casualties inflicted during the war.\n\nHis new objective also comes against the backdrop of the US attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Many of the Kremlin's latest war actions, such as attempts to take Pokrovsk, have been seen in Ukraine as efforts to posture into a position of strength.\n\nAt 32, Fedorov is Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister. He's begun his new appointment with promises of aggressive reform of the military's structure and how it distributes resources to its fighters.\n\nFedorov was previously Ukraine's minister for digital transformation.",

    "description": "Derek Fulton left Nvidia to launch Carolina Cloud, a North Carolina cloud startup offering affordable compute services.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Derek Fulton, 31, a former Nvidia software engineer who quit to found the North Carolina-based cloud startup Carolina Cloud with his wife. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment about its work culture. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been messing around with computers since I got my first MacBook in 2006 at age 11. From building potato cannons to flying drones, I always wanted to solve problems and build things.\n\nAfter college, I worked in data science at a European bank and as a quantitative analyst at a hedge fund specializing in mortgage investments.\n\nWhen a friend from college who worked at Nvidia posted on LinkedIn about a software engineering opportunity, I knew I had to apply. I've always been a technologist at heart, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nWhen I first joined, I felt like I was learning a good bit. It was the first time I was on a team where software was the final product and not just an internal tool — where getting the last mile right really mattered.\n\nBut after a few months, I felt like I wasn't learning anymore. There was a top-down management style and a nitpicky, boxed-in way of working. I worked on a lot of bugs and features, and when I asked to work on different projects that I wasn't familiar with, I was told no.\n\nPeople assume that if you work at Nvidia, you make a lot of money. My package was in the low six figures, and the wide disparities in pay between older and newer employees impacted the culture because we were all playing different games.\n\nThe way I view a job is I want to either be learning or earning. I joined late enough that the money wasn't life-changing, and I felt I could get another job that paid roughly the same amount if it ever came to that. Also, our cost of living is reasonable in the Raleigh-Durham area, and my wife and I are both pretty fiscally shrewd.\n\nI always knew I would launch my own company one day. One of my ambitions was to command my own time by the age of 30 and to have kids who could grow up seeing me do that every day.\n\nMy wife and I invested about $20,000 to found our family-owned cloud provider, Carolina Cloud. We're bootstrapping for now, but aren't opposed to raising a small round down the line if we fill our current server fleet.\n\nCarolina Cloud does offer GPUs, but we're focused on CPUs because we believe they absolutely aren't going anywhere: they're less finicky, use less power, are cheaper, and last for years.\n\nAt previous jobs where we'd rented cloud, the prices were so high compared to what I knew it would cost to actually build one of the computers, so I saw an opportunity to create a provider that delivered value while still making money.\n\nCarolina Cloud is focused on on-demand, high-performance compute. Some of our early customers are hedge funds and genomics companies, particularly in the Research Triangle. We differentiate from hyperscalers with lower pricing, no egress fees, and high-touch support.\n\nQuitting my job at Nvidia has turned out to be a boon for my mental health. After a couple of weeks, I started sleeping better, chatting with strangers in public, spontaneously running errands I'd forgotten about, and calling people I hadn't thought about in years.\n\nI've also been working really hard, but on my own terms, which has allowed me to reconnect with my love for technology.\n\nWhile it takes time to get a business off the ground, I told myself that if we didn't turn a profit in 18 months, I could go back to a traditional job. But right now, early interest has gone as expected and indicates that we should be able to stay the course.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "In a world of AI chatbots and agents, we're not talking enough about physical AI.\n\nAt a Thursday morning Davos panel moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, robotics experts dived into ways bots are going to change the world — and their key limitations.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the World Economic Forum panel, which featured robotics and automation experts and a trade minister:\n\nOne phrase dominated the conversation: digital twins.\n\nExecutives from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a distant possibility is now delivering real productivity gains for companies.\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a physical object, person, or process. They can help organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, allowing them to make better decisions.\n\n\"Digital twins have been around, but the technology has exponentially improved, and the computing power has exponentially improved,\" said Automation Anywhere CEO Mihir Shukla.\n\nHe added, \"Let's say digital twins tell you that there is going to be a problem in manufacturing. You can proactively act on it. It has implications on your inventory. It has implications on your shipping planning.\"\n\nSiemens' CEO Roland Busch said that the productivity boost is showing up in numbers.\n\nHe said that the company's output is 20% higher and that energy costs are 20% lower.\n\n\"You have much, much faster and ramping up, you don't make mistakes,\" if you use a digital twin, he said.\n\nRobots can do work that humans are unable to — or don't want to — do, said Peggy Johnson, the CEO of Agility Robotics.\n\n\"It's very hard to hire for these manual jobs,\" she said. \"They're dull and dirty, and they're dangerous at times because you're lifting over and over again, very repetitive. It's kind of mind-numbing work.\"\n\nFaster progress in robotics means a better quality of life for the humans who are doing such jobs.\n\n\"The injuries are also another thing,\" she said about jobs that require a lot of heavy lifting. \"We have an aging workforce. A lot of young kids don't want to go into environments like this. So the older employees are also getting hurt more.\"\n\nThani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the Minister of Foreign Trade for the United Arab Emirates, echoed that robotics was the future of \"non-skilled\" labor.\n\n\"It's too difficult to attract new young people to start working on the construction,\" he said. \"Robotics is the main solution.\"\n\nBut building robots that are safe to use in human environments is also key, Johnson said.\n\nAl Zeyoudi added that financing AI is only the first step toward AI integration.\n\n\"Sometimes you have the money, but you haven't diagnosed the right solution to the problem that you're having,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the UAE's push for AI includes government appointments, policy development, and research and development, which was the \"main game changer.\"\n\n\"Many, many stakeholders are avoiding that because they say someone else will do it,\" he said, referring to R&D. \"I'll just copy and paste it.\"\n\n\"But when it comes to AI, it's too late,\" Al Zeyoudi added. \"You have to start working on R&D because you ensure to customize things to your own ecosystem, your own environments, your own conditions.\"",

    "fullText": "From Davos to Washington to America's high school classrooms, people are questioning the foundations of our economic system — and we at Business Insider are tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.\n\nPolls show Americans' trust in capitalism is falling fast, as daily life has grown more expensive and less secure. Our own recent survey of readers found that people are worried their wages aren't keeping up with their expenses, that housing feels out of reach, and that the whole system seems shaky. Many employers are leaning even more heavily into a capitalistic approach, deemphasizing loyalty and tenure in favor of ruthless meritocracy. Meanwhile, the US government has taken a more hands-on role in the economy, becoming a shareholder in several companies and upending its place in the capitalist system.\n\nAs questions about the state of capitalism grow, leaders are pitching competing visions of the economy's future. President Trump told a room full of CEOs, executives, and media figures at Davos this week that the US is reshaping the rules to make sure the country comes out of this period of transition \"bigger and better than before.\" Some are pushing for reform, like California governor Gavin Newsom, who called for a \"rules-based, competitive\" model at Davos. Others, like New York City's self-described socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani, want to rethink the system from the ground up — and have a lot of voters on board.\n\nWhile capitalism's future hangs in the balance, Business Insider is digging in. We're exploring how and why the system is being reshaped — by government policy, by companies, and by you.\n\nTell us what you think about the future of capitalism. Test your own understanding. And stick with us as we track how this system is evolving in real time, and what it will look like next.",

    "description": "Apple, Siri, and Google Gemini AI are at the forefront as Apple rebuilds its assistant, betting on AI model commoditization and flexibility.",
    "fullText": "Apple's decision to rebuild Siri around Google's Gemini AI models looks, at first glance, like an admission of failure. After years of promising breakthroughs, Apple is reportedly paying Google roughly $1 billion a year to keep its digital assistant relevant.\n\nLook closer, though, and the move represents something more radical: a giant bet that AI models will become commodities.\n\nTop tech reporter Mark Gurman wrote this week that Apple's revamped Siri, codenamed Campos, will launch later this year as a full-fledged chatbot embedded across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The underlying intelligence will come from Google's Gemini.\n\nThe more important detail is architectural. Apple is designing Campos so that the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time, according to Gurman's report for Bloomberg.\n\n\"That means the company will have the flexibility to move away from Google-powered systems in the future if it so chooses,\" he wrote.\n\nThat design choice tells us a lot about Apple's AI strategy.\n\nRather than trying to win an AI arms race against Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta by spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure, Apple appears to be positioning itself as model-agnostic. Siri remains Apple's direct interface to more than 1 billion iPhone users. The \"brains\" underneath, however, can change.\n\nIf Apple is right, the leading AI models will converge in quality over time, becoming roughly interchangeable. At that point, differentiation shifts away from the model itself and toward distribution, integration, privacy controls, and user experience — areas where Apple already excels.\n\nApple could then choose whichever AI provider is best, cheapest, or most strategically useful every few years. So, Google's Gemini might power Siri today, but tomorrow it could be OpenAI's latest GPT offering, or Claude from Anthropic, or whatever Meta is cooking up next, or xAI's Grok, or Mistral's offerings, or even region-specific models such as DeepSeek or Alibaba's Qwen in China. Services like OpenRouter already demonstrate how models can be swapped in and out.\n\nApple is also playing a longer game. Its search deal with Google, worth an estimated $20 billion a year, shows how valuable iPhone distribution is. If AI models truly commoditize, Apple could eventually flip the Siri relationship the same way: AI model providers could end up paying Apple for access to its massive user base.\n\nThe strategy also saves Apple enormous capital expenditure. While rivals pour huge sums of money into AI data centers and chips, Apple can let others shoulder that cost. For instance, Google spent more than $60 billion in capex during the first three quarters of 2025, while Apple spent $12.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.\n\nIf this AI building boom turns about to be a bust, Apple may dodge a bullet. Of course, it might turn out that underinvesting in your own AI capabilities is a strategic blunder of epic proportions.\n\nWe'll see in the next few years. Right now, Apple just placed a huge bet that the real power in the AI era won't belong to model makers, but to whoever controls the interface.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump repeatedly called Greenland a \"piece of ice\" while speaking at Davos. Three Greenlanders gave Business Insider their responses.",
    "fullText": "For over 56,000 people, Greenland is far more than a \"piece of ice\" — it's home.\n\nThat's what three residents of Greenland told Business Insider on Wednesday after President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the island as a \"piece of ice\" and called it \"Iceland\" on several occasions during a speech to World Economic Forum attendees at the Davos Conference.\n\nOn one occasion, Trump took a more complimentary tone and referred to the autonomous territory of Denmark as a \"big, beautiful piece of ice.\" He added that the US \"alone can defend this giant piece of ice,\" calling it a \"core national security interest.\"\n\nTrump isn't the first US president to want to acquire Greenland. In fact, the US has been discussing it since the 19th century. However, residents across Greenland — in the south, the north, and the capital — told Business Insider they don't appreciate Trump's rhetoric.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"Just calling Greenland a 'piece of ice' is so inaccurate,\" 32-year-old Ole Olsvig told Business Insider. Olsvig, an entrepreneur and tourist guide in Qaarsut in North Greenland, called the rhetoric \"outrageous,\" \"disrespectful,\" and \"commoditizing.\"\n\nTechnically, about 80% of Greenland is covered by a giant ice sheet. That's not what concerns Olsvig, though; it's what the remarks imply.\n\nIt erases people and implies disposability, he said. \"Greenland is like being treated as an asset, not a society of people.\"\n\nTrump has spoken of acquiring Greenland since his first presidential term. In his Davos speech on Wednesday, he called for \"immediate negotiations\" about the US taking control of Greenland, saying, \"We need it for strategic, national security, and international security.\"\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer who lives in Qassiarsuk in South Greenland, told Business Insider.\n\nShe added that she thinks Trump wants Greenland for more than just national security reasons — he also wants access to Greenland's trove of natural resources.\n\n\"We have very strict rules in the mining industry, which is good. So even though he really wants to buy Greenland, it's not just like a place he can just buy and then make a mine,\" she said.\n\nAnother point of contention among Greenlanders is that Trump's portrayal of Greenland as a \"piece of ice\" ignores the territory's rich and distinct culture.\n\nGreenland has its own official language, self-governance, and cultural practices, including hunting, fishing, and sled dogs, Olsvig said. \"Greenland isn't just a blank map.\"\n\nKleist added, \"We're not becoming part of America,\" despite Trump's wishes.\n\nThe attention Greenland has gotten on the world stage has had some positive effects, said 28-year-old Casper Frank Møller, the CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, which is based in Nuuk.\n\nFor example, his company saw a surge in interest from tourists at the start of 2025 when Trump re-raised the topic of acquiring Greenland.\n\nHowever, Møller said that the US's raid on Venezuela has caused further concerns among people in Greenland because \"there was just way more power behind the words.\" He estimates that 20 to 30 customers have postponed travel plans to Greenland as they wait out the situation.\n\nHe added that Trump's aggressive approach toward Greenland has actually made the country a little less polarized and more united toward potential independence.\n\n\"We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?\" he said.\n\n\"We as Greenlandic people, we are democratic, we aim for diplomacy, and we don't want any warfare to be happening here in Greenland. We're looking for diplomatic solutions,\" he added.\n\nMøller, for one, seemed to see some truth in the description of Greenland as a \"piece of ice.\"\n\n\"Greenland for sure has an immense, abnormally big piece of ice in the ice sheet,\" he said. \"It's true.\"\n\nThat said, \"we have some of the most beautiful places on Earth. Some of the most remote, untouched areas that you can imagine,\" he added. \"And I would say, for that big chunk of ice, that's what we call home.\"",

    "description": "The US government wants us to drink whole milk instead of skim, as if that's some treat.",
    "fullText": "I refuse the long arm of the government's reach into my refrigerator: I'm not drinking whole milk!\n\nAnd I readily accept that food is political, so the fact that the latest dietary guidelines from the US government — which say to drink whole milk instead of skim — are being seen as the latest political battle isn't a surprise.\n\nBut there's something in the latest whole milk debate that is truly confusing to me. It's that … whole milk isn't very good? And I don't think many of us have felt we couldn't drink it because of government guidelines. We just don't like it!\n\nSecretary of Health and full-fat dairy booster Robert Kennedy Jr. is a polarizing figure, so people are going to interpret this kind of video in a way that fits their worldview:\n\nThe government is positioning this change as people being desperate to drink whole milk but feeling they weren't allowed to. That they were forced to settle for skim or 2% milk, and finally, thanks to the Trump administration, are allowed the verboten pleasures again.\n\nWhole milk is too sludgy, too thick. It always kind of smells like it's on its way to turning sour. I find the white residue it leaves on the sides of a glass off-putting.\n\nOne-percent milk is crisp, drinkable, watery, cold, and refreshing.\n\nGreat to drink on its own or as a bath for cereal. Personally, I think skim is too watery, and 2% too close to whole, but I accept those options as well.\n\nFor me, it's not any fear of fat intake that has kept me from buying whole milk; it's that whole milk is stinky and gross.\n\nI should note here that the health benefits of whole vs. low-fat milk are a living, breathing debate. Whole milk has more saturated fat, which is potentially \"bad,\" but it has more vitamins and enzymes or whatever, which are potentially \"good.\" (Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist here, people! Don't trust me — do your own research.)\n\nIf you're truly interested in learning more about the details of the health benefits of dairy, I suggest you read this instead of listening to me whine about my personal milk preference. Don't listen to me about healthy food choices; my doctor shook her head sadly and said \"noooooo\" when I told her what kinds of garbage I typically eat for dinner (yes, my cholesterol is high).\n\nFor me, worrying about the milkfat content of my cereal is like worrying about which multivitamin brand to buy when I often go days without eating a fresh vegetable. I'm stuffing so many chemicals and processed garbage down my gullet on the reg that any kind of milk is the healthiest thing I'll consume by far.\n\nLike whole milk? Know that I see you, I accept you, and you are valid. It's fine to have a taste preference.\n\nBut I simply don't believe there are throngs of adults out there who've been feeling forced to choke down 2% when they were dying for whole milk. You're a grownup! Buy whatever milk you like!\n\nOf course, the main point of the latest guidelines isn't really aimed at making suggestions to adults. The actionable part of the guidelines is that they inform the rules for federal food programs for kids, like the National School Lunch Program, which previously only allowed low-fat milk options.\n\nI don't really care if a kid prefers whole or skim milk with their sloppy Joe or PB&J — either option seems better to me than chocolate milk, which, according to my own elementary school children, is what everyone chooses at lunch anyway.\n\nIf the government is going to start meddling more with school lunches, frankly, I'd welcome them to start with the abusive fee structure in some of the digital lunch payment systems that many districts have adopted. My kids' school uses a payment provider for lunches that charges a $3.50 fee every time you add money to your kid's account (and requires separate accounts per sibling). President Trump, please look into that.\n\nFor me, I am not going to change my milk-drinking ways. I was raised in a 1% household. I will continue to buy 1% because it's delicious, and whole milk is gross, and Uncle Sam can't tell me what to do.",

    "description": "Trump agreed to a settlement that would end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Lawmakers raised concerns about pushing borrowers off too soon.",
    "fullText": "Millions of student-loan borrowers could soon be forced off a key repayment plan — and debt relief is on the line.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Tim Kaine, led their colleagues in raising concerns regarding the Department of Education's proposed settlement to end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nOver 7 million borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, which was created by former President Joe Biden and intended to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness. Litigation halted the plan in 2024, and President Donald Trump's administration recently announced a proposed settlement that would effectively eliminate the plan and require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan with higher payments.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for eliminating SAVE by 2028, and this settlement would accelerate that timeline. The lawmakers wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that borrowers are likely to face \"significant hurdles\" switching to a new plan, and those enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program — which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years — are at heightened risk.\n\n\"Forcing these borrowers to transition out of SAVE with little guidance risks further lost time to debt relief and payment increases that could render continued public service untenable,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nBorrowers have not received credit toward PSLF while on the SAVE forbearance. While resuming payments on a different income-driven repayment plan would count toward PSLF, the lawmakers wrote that transitioning millions of borrowers to a new plan in a short timeframe would be a significant administrative burden, and they requested that the Department of Education give borrowers at least six months to switch to a new plan before their next payment comes due.\n\nThe department wrote in its press release that SAVE borrowers \"will have a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan. Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement at the time that \"American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.\"\n\nA slew of changes is on the horizon for student-loan borrowers. While borrowers are still waiting for a court to approve the SAVE settlement, provisions of Trump's spending legislation — including new repayment plans and borrowing caps — are set to be rolled out beginning in July.\n\nThose changes come as over 5 million borrowers are in default on their student loans, following the Trump administration's resumption of collections in May 2025 after a five-year pause. The Education Department announced last week that it is temporarily pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted borrowers. Still, Democratic lawmakers said in their letter that SAVE borrowers are at risk of defaulting should they face challenges transitioning to a new plan.\n\n\"It is imperative the Department take every action possible to ensure the 7 million borrowers currently enrolled in SAVE are provided with the information and resources necessary to avoid delinquency or default in order to avoid an even bigger default crisis,\" they wrote.",

    "description": "Michael Rumph and Darlene Person, siblings in Atlanta, built a profitable 13-car Turo fleet that started with their mother's car in 2022.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Michael Rumph, 60, and Darlene Person, 61, siblings in metro Atlanta who run JDM Whipz, a 13-car Turo fleet. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDarlene: For several years, my brother, Mike, and I talked about wanting to go into business together. We considered a few ideas but hadn't settled on one.\n\nIn February 2022, we rented an Escalade from Turo for a family trip. Almost exactly a year later, we launched our own Turo business, JDM Whipz.\n\nDarlene: Mike dove into research, sending me videos and websites every week. We began meeting on Sundays to discuss launching a Turo business.\n\nI'm a federal government employee, and I still work full-time. Most of my Turo work takes place in the evenings, when I prep cars after my day job. When we started, both of us were balancing full-time jobs.\n\nMike: I'm an IT nerd with 37 years of experience in desktop support, server support, and project management. Now, I'm a full-time Turo project manager.\n\nMike: The Corolla belonged to our mom, who died in June 2022. It's still on the platform; I just had the front end repainted and protective film added.\n\nFrom there, we purchased a 2017 Mazda, a 2017 Chevy Malibu, a 2017 Equinox, and a 2018 Equinox. By the end of our first year, we had 10 cars. We purchased eight with cash and used \"creative financing\" for the other two, purchasing them with 0% credit cards\n\nToday, we have 13 vehicles — we own 12 outright and have one payment on a 2019 Chrysler Pacifica. We've had five cars totaled in the past year, but because I hold a dealer's license and buy vehicles wholesale at auctions, we've been able to replace them and even come out ahead on insurance payouts.\n\nMike: Enterprise once quoted me $805 for an SUV from Friday to Sunday. Turo cost us $360 for four days and 600 miles when we rented that Escalade.\n\nDarlene: We listed mom's Corolla as a trial, but the first renter kept extending her trip week after week, and it ended up being 2.5 months total. The car was gone, and we had nothing to do, so we said, \"Let's add another.\"\n\nFrom the start, we reinvested every dollar back into the business. That's how we grew to 10 cars in a year.\n\nWe choose Turo's 60% protection plan: we keep 60%, Turo takes 40%, but our deductible is lower. Hosts can take up to 90% but risk a much higher deductible. Understanding that trade-off is important.\n\nMike: Day-to-day, I'm checking cars in and out, cleaning, handling inspections, and keeping up with competition in the Atlanta market.\n\nI left my IT job last April after paying off all my debts. I was breathing and dreaming of Turo at work. Now it's my focus.\n\nDarlene: Atlanta is huge, so Mike covers the north side, and I handle the south. We've never had all 13 cars sitting at our homes at once, where we store them.\n\nUsually they're rented out, coming back for a day or two before heading out again. I've learned more about cars in these two and a half years than I ever imagined.\n\nDarlene: We're obsessed with customer service. Over the years, we've both complained about poor service elsewhere. When we started JDM Whipz, I told Mike, \"I want people to feel valued.\" Our reviews consistently mention exceptional service, which is the most rewarding feedback we receive.\n\nMike: I built JDMWhipz.com because Turo's search doesn't show business names. Our site lets visitors view our entire fleet in one place without having to search. When ready to book, they tap a link that takes them directly to Turo to complete the reservation process.\n\nThe biggest challenge for new hosts is capital. Ideally, buy or own your first car outright. Read Turo's Terms of Service carefully to understand the responsibilities of both the host and the guest.\n\nDarlene: Most people start Turo while working full-time. You need excellent planning and time management. We learned the hard way: clean a car as soon as it returns.\n\nEarly on, we'd say, \"I'll do it in the morning,\" and then get a 7 a.m. booking. At 5 a.m., with car washes closed, you're in the driveway scrubbing, photographing, and prepping the car. Now it's a habit: the car comes in, and it gets cleaned.\n\nMike: Revenue now depends on the season and the vehicle. Our Corolla rents for $42 to $46 per day. Some cars earn $800 a month, while others earn $1,200 during peak season in Atlanta, which typically spans from March to September.\n\nWe're still making six figures in profit a year.\n\nDarlene: Check Turo's website for rules, like no cars older than 12 years or with more than 130,000 miles when listed.\n\nWatch videos from Turo hosts on YouTube, but vet their advice. Don't be afraid to ask experienced hosts for guidance. Mike and I mentor people all the time; we love helping new hosts succeed.\n\nOur long-term goal is to become Atlanta's go-to personal car rental company. We're proud of what we've built — and even prouder to do it together as siblings.",

    "description": "Business Insider visited an air base in Lithuania where Spanish jets are deployed to support NATO air policing operations.",
    "fullText": "ŠIAULIAI AIR BASE, Lithuania — The fighter pilots quickly grabbed their gear and stormed out the door of the small command building as alarm bells wailed from a loudspeaker. The countdown had started.\n\nThe Spanish pilots and the support crew piled into two vans, which swiftly shuttled them down snow-covered roads to the hangars. The powerful EF-18 jet engines roared to life, and with pre-flight checks complete, the fighters taxiied out onto the runway.\n\nAs the planes took off into the frigid January sky, the air base fell silent.\n\nFighter pilots from the 15th Wing of the Spanish Air Force deployed to NATO's forward edge have just 15 minutes to get airborne once a quick reaction alert mission is activated, usually in response to a nearby aircraft flying without identification or purposefully dodging international regulations.\n\nFighter jets are frequently sent out on very short notice to intercept Russian military aircraft over the Baltic Sea. NATO’s Air Command recorded more than 500 such rapid-response launches, known as scrambles, across allied airspace last year as part of air policing missions and other operations.\n\nAt Šiauliai Air Base in Lithuania, Business Insider observed Spanish fighter jets taking off for what began as a training sortie. Once they were airborne, though, the flight became an \"alpha scramble,\" meaning they were tasked with responding to something suspicious — potentially a real threat.\n\nLt. Col. Fernando Allen, the commander of the Spanish detachment, could only say that the target was an unidentified aircraft. Recent NATO scrambles have intercepted Russian aircraft, including fighter jets and surveillance planes.\n\nAllen said that he and his fellow airmen are deployed to Lithuania \"to make safe skies for partner nations and allies.\"\n\nNATO launched the Baltic Air Policing mission in 2004 following the accession of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the alliance. Member states take turns deploying fighter jets to Šiauliai and two other bases in the region on a four-month rotational basis.\n\nThe mission is to protect the airspace above and around the three Baltic states — often referred to as NATO's front lines — amid anxiety over Russian activities in and near allied skies.\n\nSpain's 15th Wing deployed at the start of December to Šiauliai Air Base, where it is contributing to the air policing mission and the Eastern Sentry operation that NATO launched in September after Russian drones violated Polish airspace.\n\nThe Spanish detachment arrived with just over 200 personnel and 11 EF-18M fighters, upgraded versions of the American-made F/A-18 Hornet that only Madrid operates. The jets are armed with air-to-air missiles and equipped for round-the-clock operations, including night flights, with pilots using night-vision goggles.\n\nAlpha scrambles follow a step-by-step procedure. Control centers are monitoring the airspace 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If crews detect an unidentified radar track or an aircraft failing to follow international rules, they relay the information to one of NATO's combined air operations centers.\n\nWhen commanders decide to launch an alpha scramble, the pilots receive an order to take off and must be airborne within 15 minutes. They normally complete the task well ahead of time.\n\nThe scramble alert can come in at any moment, so pilots and support crews are always on standby. Some might be resting or even sleeping, but when the alarm bells ring, airmen are ready to get moving.\n\n\"You don't have time to think about what's happening. You only think about getting dressed and running to the airplane,\" Lt. Jesus Ortín, one of the Spanish EF-18 pilots, told Business Insider during a visit to Šiauliai this week. \"We are not waiting for it. We are on alert.\" There is an expectation that even at rest, they're ready.\n\nLt. Arturo Guitán, another EF-18 pilot, said his reaction to a scramble order is automatic in his brain, drilled in through extensive preparation before the deployment. \"I think it's quite easy to scramble,\" he said, \"because we train every day.\"\n\nFor identification and intercept missions, NATO fighter jets — regularly scrambled in pairs or fours — fly alongside aircraft until they move farther out into international airspace. Intercepts commonly occur over the Baltic Sea, a busy route linking mainland Russia with its heavily militarized Kaliningrad exclave between allied countries Poland and Lithuania.\n\nNATO has said that Russian aircraft often approach or fly near allied airspace without using transponders, having filed an official flight plan, or communicating with air traffic control. However, the culprit behind a scramble alert isn't always Moscow; civilian planes can trigger an alpha scramble as well.\n\nMembers of the 15th Wing couldn't disclose exactly how many alpha scrambles they have carried out since their deployment began. Allen, the detachment commander, said there were lots in December, but 2026 started off relatively quiet.\n\nSome weeks may trigger five scrambles, while others may see only two, the 15th Wing said. They appear random, and while intelligence officers are trying to map out any patterns, they've been unable to do so.\n\n\"We are proud to be here, and it's an honor to help our allied partner countries,\" Allen said. \"I know we're farther in the east, but we are doing the same mission that we were performing in our own country.\"",

    "description": "Fisayo Che is the founder of Elisamama, a brand that's sold at Saks. She's finding a path forward as the department store goes through bankruptcy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Fisayo Che, the founder of women's wear brand Elisamama. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified Che's statements, including the amount Saks owes, with documentation she provided.\n\nSaks Global filed in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows it to continue operating while undergoing a court-supervised reorganization of its debt. In a statement, Saks said it is committed to \"trusted relationships with brand partners,\" and that funding it secured through the bankruptcy will \"facilitate go-forward payments to brand partners.\"\n\nBecoming a fashion designer was never a part of my vision board. When I founded Elisamama, I was still working a corporate job.\n\nI felt like I wanted to live a life of more meaning and purpose. My family is from Nigeria, and I spent time there growing up. I got the idea to start a brand that supports women artisans in the country.\n\nElisamama is a women's wear and children's brand inspired by African artistry and prints. At first, I sold the clothing at flea markets; later, I listed on Etsy and promoted it on social media.\n\nSaks really gave my business a platform to grow. Now, it's going through bankruptcy and hasn't paid me for some of my inventory. I'm not sure how to trust the company going forward.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, someone found us on Instagram and, unbeknownst to me, dropped our name with a Saks buyer. When the department store initially reached out, I thought it was a scam, and I didn't respond. Then, a vice president from the company DM'd me on Instagram.\n\nI freaked out and was very scared. I thought: How are we going to do this? I even told them I needed time to figure it out because I didn't want to mess up this opportunity.\n\nSaks really walked alongside us, gave us guidance, and helped us dip our toes slowly into its world. It was rapid-fire learning, trying to understand all the vendor requirements, including shipping and routing guidelines.\n\nWe hired more artisans in Nigeria. We beefed up our production. We worked on our supply situation. Everybody was winning; it helped us help other people grow their own businesses.\n\nIn 2023, Saks selected us to join its New Wave program for emerging designers. We came to New York, connected with industry experts and the press, and the company gave us a grant.\n\nAt the end, we had our products placed in the window at Saks' flagship store in New York. That was a remarkable moment for me and my team in Nigeria, who are so proud of this work. It was nothing that I could even have imagined for Elisamama.\n\nThe exposure it gave us was significant and gave us confidence.\n\nWe signed with a showroom and started selling in retailers like Shopbop, Tuckernuck, and several specialty boutiques. Things were ramping up, and the more I did this work, the more joy I found in it. In 2024, I left my corporate job.\n\nSaks has been a great partner to us. It has placed orders with us every season since 2020. It's 50% or 60% of our business.\n\nThe problems started in February of last year, when Saks sent vendors a memo about paying in installments. Prior to that, we were consistently paid on the agreed-upon payment terms.\n\nI thought: We can wait a few months to get paid. They're important partners.\n\nWe got a check for a couple of hundred dollars in July, and in August, we were paid a more substantial amount. I thought we were back on track and kept sending inventory. Then, no other payments came in.\n\nWe fulfilled two additional orders after that, operating on faith that things would shake out properly. The company kept saying it would get back to us with updates.\n\nNow, Saks owes us six figures. I'm considering cutting half of our team to stay viable.\n\nI employ 20 people full time in Nigeria; we have some consultants and contractors, as well. The amount Saks owes us means a lot.\n\nWhen Saks' bankruptcy was announced in January, the ax dropped. Because of the proceedings, Saks said it'd prioritize debts incurred after January 13 and get back to us on other payments owed.\n\nI have been trying to expand my partnerships and sales channels to protect my business, as we've been hearing about Saks' struggles for a long time.\n\nI want to see Saks win, but I don't believe the company anymore. We're sitting on Saks' most recent order, given the situation.\n\nI've told the buyers that any future shipments would have to be paid for before we ship. I'm also considering asking them to send back the inventory they have on hand, so at least we can cut our losses.\n\nSaks is so powerful and significant in the fashion space that partnering with it is valuable. What's happened is a disappointment, but it's also grief and sadness.\n\nSaks needs to restore trust with its suppliers by putting money behind its orders. If it did that, brands would continue to send goods because it's that important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Saks? Email Madeline Berg at mberg@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Inside OpenAI's renewed push into robotics",
    "description": "OpenAI has rapidly scaled its robotics lab over the past year and plans to open up a second lab, insiders say.",
    "fullText": "Last year, Sam Altman posited that the world hadn't yet had its \"humanoid robots moment\" — but, he said, \"it's coming.\" In the background, his AI company has been gearing up to make that happen.\n\nOpenAI quietly built up a humanoid robotics lab over the past year, insiders with knowledge of the program told Business Insider. The lab operates out of the same building as the company's finance team in San Francisco, and employs around 100 data collectors. They're teaching a robotic arm how to perform household tasks as a part of a larger effort to build a humanoid robot.\n\nOpenAI explored robotics during its early years and built a robotic hand capable of solving a Rubik's Cube. The company closed the project in 2020; a company spokesperson said at the time that it had chosen to \"refocus the team on other projects.\"\n\nThe inner workings of the new robotics lab haven't been previously reported.\n\nOne person with knowledge of OpenAI's strategy said the company is working on several new hardware projects, including robotics, that are in the early phases of development, and so far, none are core to the company's mission.\n\nLast week, OpenAI put out a request for proposals from companies that manufacture in the US that could act as partners for the company's push into consumer devices, robotics, and cloud data centers. The company did not specify how much it intends to spend or provide a timeframe for the work.\n\nA representative for OpenAI declined to comment.\n\nThe lab has more than quadrupled in size since it launched in February 2025, insiders said.\n\nIn December, the company told employees it plans to open a second lab in Richmond, California. A December job posting for a \"robotics operator\" with the company's contracting agency lists Richmond as the location.\n\nThe lab has a humanoid robot that multiple people described as \"iRobot-like\" on display, but the bot is mostly collecting dust, and few have seen it in operation. The vast majority of the work in the lab is focused on teleoperating robotic arms.\n\nOpenAI has data collectors using 3-D printed controllers, called GELLOs, to operate two Franka robots. These metal arms have pincers at the end and perform household tasks like putting bread in a toaster or folding laundry.\n\nWhen the data collection program began in February, work focused on teaching the Franka robot how to put a rubber duck in a cup. Since then, it has shifted to increasingly more sophisticated tasks.\n\nOpenAI's lab offers a rare glimpse into how one of the world's most influential AI companies is approaching robotics.\n\nCompetitors like Tesla put on flashy demos and often train with full humanoid robots controlled by motion capture suits and virtual reality headsets. OpenAI is taking a quieter path, scaling contractor-driven data collection to train robotic arms on basic tasks.\n\nBoth approaches show how far leading AI companies remain from building functional household robots, and how much of that work still relies on human labor.\n\nWired reported last fall that OpenAI had begun hiring robotics engineers. The company has at least a dozen engineers on the project, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nIn December, a project supervisor said that the lab needed to increase productivity and efficiency to get more hours of functional data, people with knowledge of the program said. Over the past few months, the lab has nearly doubled expectations for data collection, they said.\n\nOpenAI has previously invested in other robotics companies, including Figure, 1X, and Physical Intelligence. Its 2024 partnership with Figure was designed to build \"next generation AI models for humanoid\" robots, but Figure CEO Brett Adcock said in February 2025 that the company was exiting the deal.\n\nWhen the first robotics project ended in 2020, it was widely believed that the company was focusing more intensely on ChatGPT. Now, OpenAI has indicated it plans to expand into devices, and it could use its ChatGPT knowledge base to teach a robot how to interpret and interact with the world.\n\nThe earlier program focused on reinforcement learning — a trial-and-error approach in which robots learn through a reward system. Now, the company is collecting large amounts of data to train the robots.\n\n\"Everyone is fighting for a way to develop large data sets,\" Jonathan Aitken, a robotics expert with the University of Sheffield, told Business Insider. \"We know we have AI algorithms that are capable of being trained to do stuff using big data sets. The issue has always been getting that data set.\"\n\nOpenAI's data collection strategy differs from the robotics efforts at companies like Tesla or Figure, where workers record full-body movement and use motion capture suits and virtual reality headsets to operate full-sized humanoid robots.\n\nOpenAI's data collection efforts mirror a study published in 2023 by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, that describes a low-cost and scalable system for collecting robotics data using teleoperated arms. One of the researchers joined OpenAI in August 2024 and works on \"Building the Robot Brain,\" according to LinkedIn.\n\nAlan Fern, an AI and robotics expert at Oregon State University, told Business Insider it's a standard setup that allows the robot to learn by mimicking its operator. Aitken said OpenAI's GELLO strategy could present an advantage over AI companies that use motion capture suits. It's cheaper, he said, and because each controller maps directly to a robot arm, the robot can more easily learn how specific human movements translate into its own motions.\n\nIn San Francisco, OpenAI runs three shifts and a few dozen workstations that collect data around the clock, people with knowledge of the lab said. Cameras record both the operator and the robot performing tasks, and workers are rated on how many \"good hours\" of functional training data they can generate.\n\nThe reliance on contract workers and performance metrics mirrors how AI companies, including OpenAI, have historically scaled data labeling for their large language models.\n\n\"A lot of companies are hoping if you collect enough of this data, you can translate it into robot motions, and they will get a scaling effect and have this ChatGPT moment,\" Fern said.\n\n\"That's something that hasn't been proven out yet,\" he added.\n\nThe company is setting up new robot stations with robotic arms that more closely mimic how a human moves, insiders said.\n\nOpenAI also uses some of the data to train robots in computer simulations and regularly tests the robot arms to see how well they perform, the people said.\n\nIt's unclear how quickly OpenAI plans to translate this data into a full humanoid robot, or how its low-cost, arm-based approach will fare against companies investing heavily in full humanoid systems.\n\n\"It does seem to be very early in the process,\" Aitken said. \"From a technical standpoint, it's a really beautiful and configurable interface to lots of different types of robots.\"\n\nDo you work for OpenAI or have a tip?

    "title": "Wall Street is losing its appetite for Oracle's data center debt",
    "description": "Appetite for loans tied to Oracle's data center partnership with OpenAI has diminished, reflecting concerns over credit risk and AI investment scale.",
    "fullText": "Oracle and OpenAI have aimed to build $500 billion of data centers by the end of the decade to power their artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nBut the massive initiative, called Stargate, may be exhausting the supply of available capital.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, the bank that recently led a pack of lenders to extend roughly $38 billion of debt for the construction of two planned Stargate data center campuses in Texas and Wisconsin, has encountered diminished interest as it has sold off pieces of the loan to other financial players, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe person said that the two projects are fully financed, the syndication effort by JPMorgan had been successful overall, and that the slowdown in new participants hadn't alarmed bankers given that it was at the tail end of such a large debt offering.\n\nBut the person acknowledged that banks and institutional investors had also grown wary in recent months of taking on too much exposure to Oracle, a tech giant whose credit rating sits below some of its peers in the AI race, including Microsoft and Google.\n\nThe reticence among lenders and investors to continue bankrolling Stargate raises questions about whether the mega-project will meet its lofty objectives.\n\n\"We are hearing from market participants that in some cases, there may be banks that could be approaching the exposure levels they're comfortable with when it comes to certain data center projects,\" said Dhaval Shah, a director at S&P Global Infrastructure Ratings.\n\nThe current unprecedented data center development cycle has been dominated by just a handful of leading players, testing whether lenders and investors will remain willing to continue to accrue heavy exposure to borrowers like Oracle. Oracle declined to comment.\n\nIn November, credit default swaps that insure against losses on Oracle's corporate debt rose in cost, a reflection of the concerns around the company's enormous spending on AI.\n\nOpenAI, the AI chatbot maker that will anchor the Stargate facilities, meanwhile, produces revenue that is just a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars annually that would be necessary to justify the cost of its infrastructure.\n\n\"Oracle has become a proxy for OpenAI's ability to raise significant amounts of capital,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson. \"It's a very precarious position.\"\n\nOpenAI announced Stargate a year ago, stating that it would partner with Oracle and others, to build a total of 10 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2029 — roughly the equivalent power footprint of New York City on a day of peak electrical consumption.\n\nIn October, OpenAI announced that it had arranged for the construction of six Stargate sites with a total planned capacity of roughly 7 gigawatts, stating that the pipeline \"puts us on a clear path to securing the full $500 billion,10-gigawatt commitment\" it had announced at the beginning of 2025.\n\nMuch of the financing for the project, so far, has been provided by major financial institutions that have banded together to share its immense costs — as well as its risks — in what are known as syndication deals. JPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group led the syndication effort for the two Stargate projects in Shackelford, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin. Both banks declined to comment.\n\nBank of America is leading a syndication to finance another Stargate data center campus in Michigan. A person familiar with that effort said that it has attracted interest from syndication takers.\n\nAnother group of lenders provided about $18 billion of financing for another Stargate facility in New Mexico, according to Bloomberg.\n\nInitial players in large syndication deals often seek to sell off portions of their loan commitments to other players, including other banks and institutional investors.\n\nBut the sale of these positions, which is done to reap quick profits and lower exposure, has become trickier in the case of Stargate.\n\nTwo bankers and a financing executive who are familiar with the syndication market said that the rising perception of risk around Stargate meant that lenders now wanted higher yields to lend to it. That has placed recent Stargate syndicators in a position where they can no longer profitably sell off debt that was arranged at tighter spreads just a few months ago.\n\nStargate borrowing rates may not come down any time soon.\n\nIn September, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Oracle's rating at BBB but said it was considering a cut due to the company's enormous planned spending on AI infrastructure. A downgrade below BBB minus would place a junk rating on Oracle debt, raising its borrowing costs significantly.\n\n\"I am very surprised these loans were even underwritten at the time,\" Luria said. \"The market has indicated this is not investment-grade debt.\"\n\nHowever, Luria said one scenario in particular could make the loans less risky. OpenAI is now in the process of trying to raise as much as $100 billion, according to reports, giving the Stargate venture a potential cushion of equity and making its debt easier to sell, he said.\n\n\"If that happens,\" he said, \"everybody's dreams come true.\"\n\nOther bankers who spoke with Business Insider said the slowdown did not indicate acute trouble in the syndication market, but acknowledged that the pool of investors who still have an appetite for the Stargate debt has shrunk.\n\n\"Do we have enough digestive capacity\" in the market for investors to buy all of the debt that will be required, said David Tawil, a partner at transaction insurance advisory firm Castle Harbour. \"That's the market's real concern: the size of this whole movement.\"",

    "description": "AI isn't yet impressive enough to replace the core work done in the finance industry, but Wall Streeters are still using AI to streamline their day.",
    "fullText": "For all the hand-wringing about what AI will do to the white-collar workforce, the technology might not be impressive enough to replace the core work done in the finance industry yet, but Wall Street pros say it definitely has its uses.\n\n\"If you're doing it for self-education, it's one thing, but I think it's quite hard to rely on a chatbot for fiduciary purposes if you're facing clients,\" said Maurits Pot, the founder of Tema ETFs.\n\nOther cite issues with AI \"hallucinations,\" which can be a headache if you need to be precise with figures and data.\n\n\"You don't use AI to do sophisticated things,\" said David Trainer, the founder of New Constructs, adding: \"It's more trouble for me to use something and find out later that it's hallucinated than it is for me to just go get it from the source to begin with.\"\n\nAnd yet, a lot of people are using AI, and there are some creative ways Wall Street pros are deploying the technology.\n\nHere's how Wall Streeters say they are using chatbots to save them time and get an edge.\n\nOne of the more interesting examples I heard comes from Lance Roberts, the CIO at RIA Advisors, which oversees around $2 billion. His team programmed 14 different AI agents to think like top investors, including Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, Benjamin Graham, John Bogle, Cathie Wood, and others.\n\nThese agents provide insights on anything from their views on the S&P 500 to individual stocks, Roberts said, and can help provide different perspectives when thinking about an investment case.\n\nAnother use case comes from Rob Arnott, the famed investor and founder of Research Affiliates. Last year at around this time, he was going to have his team read Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" to prepare for Trump's second term. Trump has cited it as one of his favorite books, with one of its main takeaways being to find a way to get what you want without fighting. Instead, Arnott figured he'd send them a ChatGPT summary to ensure they'd get the main takeaways without having to take too much time out of their busy schedules.\n\nArnott has also said he uses AI for detailed feedback on his papers, with his preferred chatbot being Perplexity.\n\n\"Perplexity is my preferred search engine, and has been for a couple of years now,\" he said in an email. \"I try the other LLM's from time to time. The nice thing about Perplexity is that it's an AI of AIs: it chooses which AI is best suited to whatever question I have.\"\n\nIts biggest use case, however, seems to be administrative tasks, or assignments that lower-level staffers might have once tackled. As Seth Klarman, the CEO of Baupost Group, described it last summer: \"essentially a capable assistant, a summer intern.\"\n\nDavid Elder, a wealth manager at Merit Financial Advisors, gave an example of a smaller task he might use a chatbot to save time on.\n\n\"I'm doing a presentation right now on intellectual property,\" Elder, who uses multiple chatbots including ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gamma, said. \"I can have an interview with me and an intellectual property or business attorney, talk about it from multiple angles, dump that kind of recording into an AI, and turn that into a presentation.\"\n\nFor Chase Doyen, who works in business development for the London Stock Exchange Group in New York, it's an organizational tool. His firm has a subscription to Claude, Anthropic's chatbot.\n\n\"I use it for administrative tasks mostly,\" Doyen said. \"I use it for organizing and planning out my day. I use it for organizing my notes. If I write down a lot for a presentation I'm in or a meeting, Claude cleans it up very well.\"",

    "description": "Dr Pepper worked with TikToker Romeo Bingham to feature a viral jingle in an ad during the College Football Playoffs. Social media users are loving it.",
    "fullText": "The power of TikTok propelled one user's content to primetime television, and people are loving it.\n\nTikToker Romeo Bingham, 25, is receiving an outpouring of support after their viral Dr Pepper jingle was picked up by the brand and used in a commercial that aired during Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship game. Social media users quickly caught onto the audio and praised the partnership.\n\nSO proud of you @Romeo!! Well deserved! 🥹❤️ #drpepper #goodandnice #drpepperjingle #nationalchampionshipgame #espn\n\n\"Dr Pepper, baby, it's good and nice,\" Bingham sang in a TikTok video posted December 23.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the post had over 44 million views and 50,000 comments from users and brands alike. Bingham's video gained traction on TikTok before the jingle was featured in a TV commercial, prompting some users to predict a collaboration was on the horizon.\n\n\"I am waiting for Dr Pepper to offer a massive contract,\" one commenter said on December 29.\n\n@Dr Pepper please get back to me with a proposition we can make thousands together. #drpepper #soda #beverage\n\nBingham and Dr Pepper did not reveal the terms of their deal and did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeveral companies, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera Bread, and Hyundai, have also pounced on Bingham's comments and requested jingles for their brands.\n\nBingham created a song for Vita Coca, which the beverage brand posted on TikTok on January 16.\n\n@Romeo jingle stays on repeat #vitacoco #fyp #coconutwater #jingle #vitacocotreats\n\nThe partnership between Bingham and Dr Pepper appeared to be in the works for a few weeks leading up to the game, which ESPN reported attracted over 20 million viewers in 2025. On December 31, Dr Pepper commented under Bingham's video, telling them to check their DMs.\n\nSupport for Bingham has continued, with users sharing videos and comments congratulating them on the collaboration. Others have chimed in, saying they hoped Bingham got a good payday.\n\nI hope that girl who did the Dr. pepper jingle got paid very well. Cause I just saw the commercial.\n\nAnd the marketing strategy seems to be working for Bingham. As of Wednesday, Bingham is operating a website offering the Dr Pepper effect to brands.\n\n\"I'm buying a Dr Pepper just because,\" one user wrote on TikTok.",

    "description": "Tesla's Elon Musk is asking job applicants to share their biggest tech wins via three simple bullet points.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to see your results, not your résumé.\n\nThe Tesla CEO this week requested that people who want to work on the company's Dojo3 AI chip email three bullet points describing the \"toughest technical problems you've solved.\"\n\nMusk's just-the-facts approach, outlined in a post on X, reflects a focus on problem-solving over fancy résumés or cover letters.\n\n\"He's basically just trying to cut through the noise of the job market,\" said Michelle Volberg, a longtime recruiter who is the founder of Twill, a startup that pays tech workers to recommend peers for key jobs.\n\nShe said that résumés or LinkedIn profiles don't always make it clear to employers where a person's skills lie. Asking a job seeker to lay out a trio of battles won can help hiring managers get to the meat of someone's abilities, Volberg told Business Insider.\n\nIt's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt.\n\n\"Elon is showing the way that the job market is going to go,\" she said.\n\nAlready, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas.\n\nVolberg said that hiring managers at large companies have told her that they're sick of relying on résumés so tailored to a job opening that they reveal little about candidates themselves. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said.\n\n\"They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT,\" Volberg said.\n\nBullets over bona fides is, of course, a departure from the conventional approach of stuffing a résumé with bolded job titles, years of experience, and skills.\n\nAsking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call \"skills-based hiring.\"\n\nMusk's no-frills call for applicants appears to build on his prior statements about being open to candidates from nontraditional backgrounds. For years, the billionaire has said that people didn't need a college degree to work for Tesla. Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of \"exceptional\" ability or achievement.\n\nHe also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking \"world-class\" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles.\n\nAn application portal linked to the post contains a field instructing applicants to include two or three bullets \"showcasing exceptional ability,\" and to upload a résumé.\n\nVolberg said the bullet method is similar to guidance that her company already gives job seekers: Focus less on adjectives and more on outcomes.\n\nFrom a hiring manager's perspective, she said, the central question is whether a candidate can make their job easier by solving real problems.\n\nThe corollary, Volberg said, is fakers beware: \"If you say that you've solved these three things, you'd better be able to talk about them in detail.\"\n\nShe said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said.\n\nBeyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews.\n\nAsking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work.\n\nMurray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.\n\n\"What he is asking people to do is to market themselves,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "description": "Cisco's chief people officer said companies should encourage AI adoption by framing it as a tool that will help workers get part of their day back.",
    "fullText": "Has using AI meant you've ended up with more work on your plate?\n\nAt this early stage of adoption, Cisco's chief people officer, Kelly Jones, told Business Insider that the \"worst thing\" companies can do when trying to encourage AI adoption is to pile additional work on employees once they've freed up time.\n\n\"When you get into the space of AI experimentation, one of the most important things to do is not kill innovation when you're starting it,\" Jones said.\n\nJones is touching on the reality of AI adoption at many companies. Even as firms report productivity gains from AI tools, employees' days haven't necessarily gotten any shorter.\n\nOne Microsoft manager previously told Business Insider that AI tools cut his coding time — which used to make up the overwhelming majority of his workload —by 70%, yet his overall workload didn't shrink. Many leaders have also said that AI will free up employees' time, so they can focus on more \"deep work,\" rather than suggesting that workers might get more free time overall.\n\nJones said that when leaders push AI adoption, they need to make it \"really relevant\" to the day-to-day work of employees, rather than making it another ask from their manager. It should be framed as a tool that helps employees reclaim a percentage of their day, the CPO said.\n\nMost employees would be glad to save time spent on work, and she said companies get it wrong by saying, \"here's three new things that we need you to do.\"\n\nWhile the traditional 9-to-5 workday may not be undergoing a drastic overhaul, some employees have found ways to shave hours off their schedules using AI tools, freeing up time for other pursuits — whether or not they tell their employers. For instance, one worker told Business Insider he used AI to complete about half of his software engineering tasks and spent the rest of his day on Reddit and YouTube.\n\nJones said that if employees are doing better work in less time, \"there's no negative to that.\" At this point in the innovation cycle, people should use AI to get work tasks done more rapidly if they can, she said.\n\nWhile Jones discouraged automatically adding more to employees' plates, she said that figuring out what to do with reclaimed time is a more complicated question. Determining how work changes, how it should be redistributed, and how companies and employees make those calls is what HR is likely to focus on over the next year or two, she said.\n\n\"We are really at this precipice where we're going to be moving from managing jobs to redesigning work,\" Jones said.\n\nShe said the role of HR will shift into helping organizations figure out what work is allocated to humans and what work is done by AI — and how the two work together.",

    "title": "How Netflix's stock lost its FANG-era mojo",
    "description": "The streaming giant is putting a lot of cash to work, and it's not growing as quickly as investors want.",
    "fullText": "The last decade in the stock market has been dominated by two distinct eras.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, \"FAANG stocks\" were all the rage. The elite crew of Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) represented the big winners of the mobile and cloud-computing explosion.\n\nIn more recent years, the Magnificent 7 — populated by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — has taken the reins. Driven by immense optimism over the future profitability of AI, the group has become a market-moving behemoth.\n\nSomewhere, during that transition, one piece of the FAANG cohort lost its elite status and did not roll over into the Mag 7: Netflix.\n\nThe exclusion makes sense. Netflix isn't known as an AI stock, so it doesn't naturally fit with the Mag 7. And based on the relative underperformance of Netflix shares over the last five years, compared to every stock in the group but Amazon, it's clear investors have accepted its spot away from the \"cool table\" in the cafeteria.\n\nSo what exactly is up with Netflix lately? Its latest earnings report from this week offers a good encapsulation of the company's recent issues:\n\nNetflix's pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery is expected to add hundreds of millions in costs in 2026. This comes alongside plans to boost TV-show and film spending by 10%.\n\nThe company is forecasting revenue growth of roughly 13% this year, down from 16% in 2025. And it's going to get more expensive to sustain that growth if Netflix continues its push into pricier new areas like live sports — a key push in its battle with YouTube over viewer eyeballs.\n\nThe $11 billion of free cash flow forecasted by Netflix missed analyst estimates.\n\nShares dropped as much as 6% before finishing 2% lower, at a one-year low. The prolonged decline can be traced back to mid-2025.\n\nNetflix's two prior earnings reports, in July and October, were among the main culprits. The company faced many of the same issues as its elite Mag 7 peers — namely sky-high expectations, sensitivity to heavy spending, and surprise tax charges.\n\nThe main difference is that Netflix doesn't have the backstop of the AI trade. It hasn't been given the same benefit of the doubt that its big spending will translate into gold-plated earnings growth.\n\nStill, on the heels of Netflix's multimonth slump, analysts are predominantly bullish. 65% of analysts have a \"buy\" on the stock at current levels, while just 4% have a \"sell.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley says the company's progress towards quickly building a $3 billion-plus advertising business is being underrated by the market. Other firms, meanwhile, simply think the stock has fallen so much that its valuation looks attractive.\n\nThe question now becomes if investors will buy in and start pushing Netflix back to the great heights it once enjoyed.",

    "description": "Ina Garten swears by her easy yet delicious avocado and fried egg tartine. The dish, an elevated avocado toast, is simple enough to make on a weekday.",
    "fullText": "To make Garten's recipe for four, you'll need:\n\nI preheated the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and placed my prosciutto on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.\n\nGarten recommends roasting the prosciutto for seven to nine minutes, until it starts to brown. So I set a timer and popped the pan into the oven.\n\nI was able to get 2 tablespoons of juice from a small lemon.\n\nGarten's recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of Kosher salt and ½ teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.\n\nI pressed down on the mixture with the fork's prongs to get that chunky texture that's perfect for avocado toast.\n\nGarten recommends frying all four of your eggs over medium heat in a 12-inch sauté pan, cracking each egg on opposite sides of the pan.\n\nI decided to fry two eggs at a time instead, sprinkling each one with some salt and pepper. Per Garten's recipe, I cooked the eggs for one minute, until the whites started to set, then turned the heat to medium-low and covered the pan. (Pro tip: Garten says you can use a larger pan or even a sheet pan if you don't have a lid.)\n\nI cooked the eggs for three more minutes, until the whites were completely set but the yolks were still runny. This trick made my fried eggs look perfect and was worth the minimal extra effort.\n\nI evenly spread the avocado mixture on the bread slices before I began cooking my eggs, so they'd be ready to go.\n\nThen I carefully placed each egg right on top.\n\nWhat I love about Garten's elevated twist on avocado toast is the amount of color the tartines bring to the breakfast table. You've got the bold green from the avocado, the sunshine yellow of the egg yolk, and that burst of crimson from the roasted prosciutto.\n\nThey just look so fresh and healthy, and are definitely Instagram-worthy.\n\nGarten's fresh spin on avocado toast is so simple to make, but she adds those special touches that make the recipe taste elevated.\n\nThe roasted prosciutto adds some great crunch, the eggs are cooked to perfection thanks to her special frying trick, and the lemon juice and Sriracha give the avocado both a lift and a kick. Each bite is full of flavor, and the tartines somehow have the freshness of a summer dish while still being comforting enough to get you through winter.\n\nWho doesn't love a recipe that's perfect for any time and season?",

    "title": "Chipotle's new PAC signals a change in how the company engages in politics",
    "description": "Ahead of the midterms, Chipotle has filed to form a political action committee, in a departure from its prior \"Government Affairs Engagement Policy.\"",
    "fullText": "Chipotle Mexican Grill has filed paperwork to form a political action committee, marking a shift in how the burrito chain engages in US politics.\n\nThe filing, a Statement of Organization submitted to the Federal Election Commission early this month, establishes a corporate PAC, a vehicle that allows companies to collect voluntary political donations from employees and executives and give that money to federal candidates.\n\nTwo corporate governance and political campaign finance experts said that, for a consumer-facing brand that has previously kept its distance from direct campaign giving, the move signals a more formal and proactive approach to federal politics — just as the 2026 midterm elections are heating up.\n\nThe decision also represents a departure from Chipotle's prior stance. In versions of its Government Affairs Engagement Policy dating from 2021 and 2024, the company said it did not operate a PAC, though it noted that it could form one in the future.\n\n\"As Congress debates critical issues in 2026, the PAC is a meaningful way to give our 130,000 employees a voice in the political process that impacts their lives, communities, and our business, on a day-to-day basis,\" Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe timing of Chipotle's move is notable. The 2026 midterm elections are expected to be exceptionally competitive, in part because several states have undertaken mid-decade redistricting — a move that can make races more unpredictable and more expensive.\n\n\"When elections are heavily contested, they tend to cost more money,\" Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor of law at Stetson University College of Law and a Brennan Center fellow, told Business Insider. \"Candidates for Congress are subject to hard money limits, so they may want money from corporate PACs to run their campaigns.\"\n\nCorporate PACs can also serve longer-term strategic goals. Companies may give to lawmakers with influence over issues that affect their business, or to candidates they believe will appoint regulators aligned with their interests.\n\n\"Rather than just lobbying, a PAC allows a company to directly influence the election of officials, ensuring that legislators understand the company's specific business interests,\" Anat Alon-Beck, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, whose research focuses on corporate law and governance, said.\n\nWhile corporate PACs are common across many sectors, restaurants have historically been smaller players in federal campaign finance. Trade groups like the National Beer Wholesalers Association and companies like American Crystal Sugar have been among the more active PACs in the food and drink space, but restaurant brands themselves have not ranked among the top corporate PAC spenders.\n\nThat context makes Chipotle's filing less about joining a dominant political force and more about signaling a shift in posture.\n\nSome clues can be found in Chipotle's previous government affairs contribution reports, which outline the company's contributions to political organizations and in support of state and local ballot measures.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, Chipotle as a company gave $50,000 each to both the Democratic and Republican Governors Associations and $25,000 to the Democratic Mayors Association. It also made annual contributions of $150,000 to the National Restaurant Association, in addition to $625,000 in 2024 and $408,000 in 2023 to Save Local Restaurants, a coalition led by the National Restaurant Association to lobby for pro-restaurant legislation.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association has its own PAC that has historically donated primarily to Republican candidates, according to OpenSecrets data.\n\nCorporate PACs — formally known under federal law as \"separate segregated funds\" — exist because corporations are barred from donating money from their own treasuries directly to federal candidates.\n\n\"That ban comes from the Tillman Act of 1907,\" Torres-Spelliscy said. \"To avoid that ban, corporations ask people who are associated with the company, typically executives, to donate up to $5,000 to the corporate PAC.\"\n\nThose funds can then be donated directly to candidates within federal contribution limits — $5,000 per candidate per election if the PAC contributes to at least five candidates, or a maximum of $3,500 if the PAC supports fewer than five candidates.\n\nOne advantage of corporate PACs, Torres-Spelliscy said, is transparency. \"Everyone who donates knows that the money is going into politics,\" she said. \"And the public can see who has given to the corporate PAC and who the corporate PAC has donated money to.\"\n\nSince 2010, corporations have also been able to spend money through Super PACs, which can accept unlimited funds — including corporate treasury money — as long as they operate independently of candidates. Creating a Super PAC requires a separate filing with the FEC, which Chipotle had not submitted at the time of publication.\n\n\"The catch is a Super PAC spends money independently of a candidate,\" Torres-Spelliscy said.\n\nThat independence can be a drawback for companies that want a more direct relationship with lawmakers. While Super PACs allow for far larger sums, they can't coordinate with campaigns or give directly to candidates.\n\nIn practice, the biggest corporate donors to Super PACs in recent election cycles have come from industries like cryptocurrency and fossil fuels — not restaurants or food companies, according to data from OpenSecrets.\n\n\"A corporation may still want to have a corporate PAC if it wants to make donations directly to federal candidates,\" Torres-Spelliscy said.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 61-year-old Tina Woods, the CEO and founder of Collider Health, an organization developing public-private partnerships for healthy aging and longevity. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a 61-year-old CEO moonlighting as DJ \"Tina Technotic\" I am not one of those executives with a strict bedtime or daily routine.\n\nA few years ago, as I was finishing writing my book, \"Live Longer with AI,\" and starting hormone replacement therapy for menopause, I decided to enact some lifestyle changes aimed at improving my longevity. I learned how to DJ, to keep me in the groove while recovering from foot surgery, and I also started practicing a low-key form of intermittent fasting. Now I enjoy more all-night dance parties than I did before surgery!\n\nBiohacker Bryan Johnson would probably not approve of my all-night raves, but they bring me such joy and are a big part of my own personal longevity protocol. While stepping out of the routine energizes me and fuels my creativity, there are still a few things I do just about every day to help anchor me and drive results.\n\nMy morning ritual usually starts with a cup of Earl Grey tea followed by a proper oat milk latte. I like to turn on BBC Radio 4 and listen to what's happening in the world while I'm caffeinating. Even though a lot of what we hear every day is bad news, I think it's important to feel connected to what is reverberating around the world and tap into the zeitgeist.\n\nMost people in my circle have a house cleaner, but I consider housecleaning an integral part of my morning, and I usually do a bit right after the coffee hits.\n\nI have a schedule for which rooms get cleaned every day, with special emphasis on high-use areas like the bathrooms and the kitchen. I enjoy it, the physicality of polishing a window or scrubbing something — and I find the movement provides a great time to get new ideas, because my mind is able to free-associate more than when I'm at my desk.\n\nDuring the day, I am on a lot of scheduled Zoom calls, chatting with interesting folks around the world, cementing partnerships, or planning longevity events like the recent JoyScore experiment I piloted in San Francisco in December, alongside my DJ partner and Longevity Rave cofounder Yukari Takehisa. We are partnering with wearable brands, longevity spaces, in talks with The PlayaAI Foundation (from Burning Man) and also various resorts around the world to see how we might better measure how joy, longevity, and health are so interconnected.\n\nIn the old days, I would say yes to a meeting at four in the morning, knowing it was important for my job advancement. But now I can afford to be a little bit more ruthless, and I try to avoid any and all pointless meetings — of which there are many in this world. If someone invites me to a meeting that's an hour long, I say, \"Well, listen, I've got half an hour.\"\n\nOf course, being a good business leader is also about knowing when you do need the time to have a more expansive meeting, and creating that flex in your schedule. Even though I have a packed schedule, I always make time for people with interesting ideas. I'm intrigued by the unusual and the underdogs, the people who are the mavericks, and so I will always make time for those people, whether they be students with new and unusual proposals, someone wanting to start a new company, or another entrepreneur asking me to join their board.\n\nI use a ton of technology to help me get through the day: databases, mail mergers, accountancy software, website design, and ChatGPT. This is a way that I've created space for myself.\n\nIn the old days, you would have assistants doing all your stuff. You spend a lot of time getting people, recruiting people, training people, and then briefing people and checking on their work, taking up a huge amount of time. I've got rid of all that, and now with what spare time I have, I try and build in a little time each day for exploration and learning.\n\nMy day-to-day typically involves me trying out some kind of new technology related to longevity. Last year, I did a biological age workup at a clinic in Poland where one measure of biological aging, the Glycan Age test, put me at 35 years old. But I didn't stop there, knowing that one biological age measurement is only a snapshot at best, a single measure that looks at how I'm aging in certain ways, but not others. Just the other day, I went to a London skin clinic and got my skin age measured. After analyzing wrinkles, UV damage, and the like, my biological \"skin age\" was clocked at 54. Another immune age measurement I took recently had me at 51, a full decade lower than my real age, and an aging rate on par with centenarians.\n\nThe great thing about being your own boss is that you get to set your schedule. I don't mind taking a late-evening call or an early-morning conference with people in other time zones, but I am vigilant about making my schedule work for me.\n\nI am writing a new book chapter on the future of work, and have found that one of my best times to write is after a Saturday mid-morning Zumba class.\n\nI don't mind having work calls on Saturdays either, because the reverse of that means that I can go out for a run any time I want. I can build a calendar around what works best for my work life and health.\n\nI generally I'm not a real purist about this, though. I don't make it absolutely rigid that I do not have a single element of food between the time I wake up and the first meal of the day, which is generally dinner in the evening. I might have a handful of nuts and seeds or a little bit of lean meat as a snack. By mid-afternoon, I may enjoy a cup of miso soup to tide me over until dinner.\n\nI make it a priority to get in an hour of exercise six days a week. I typically work out between 5 and 8 p.m., doing a mix of running, rowing, and strength training. My mind travels off in all sorts of different directions when I'm running and listening to music, so it's a great time to get bright ideas.\n\nI find that the hour just before and just after my workout is a great time to let my brain free roam and do creative work, free from distractions.\n\nI generally give myself one day off a week — especially if I was out raving the night before.\n\nDinner is a great time to unwind and connect after a long day. Sitting down with my husband, having a good old chat about our day, that's probably the thing that I do most religiously. You'll often hear longevity experts advising people to eat dinner early, aiding digestion, but because of our schedules, dinner usually ends up being between 8 and 9 p.m., and I'm fine with that.\n\nAs I age, I am focusing more on protein in my meals, with plenty of chicken, fish, seeds, and nuts. I still indulge now and then with a piece of beautiful dark chocolate, and I won't turn down a good glass of Champagne on special occasions. I think that's part of the fun and the joy in life.\n\nThe idea of having a rigid sleep hygiene schedule is crazy for me — it just doesn't work for the life that I lead, and I want to lead. That being said, I do make sure to get enough rest. I try to listen to my body when it's tired, and allow myself to sleep in if I've been out dancing the night before. I usually get about six hours of sleep, and that feels great for me.\n\nSome people would consider getting on the dance floor an indulgence. I see that as an absolutely essential part of my schedule. That feeling that you get on the dance floor, the connection, the power of the music, the synchrony, the euphoria, those are very, very powerful things.\n\nMy husband is my chief raving partner, which is absolutely fantastic. In general, we both have a thirst for adventure: climbing mountains, traveling to new places, getting out into the wild and natural world. Surrounding yourself with an energy that is bigger than you is such an important and sustaining part of my longevity routine.",

    "fullText": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.\n\nThe device – which uses an approach called trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) - was cleared for use by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to treat ADHD in 2019 based on a small study. These new findings from a larger multicentre trial, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggest authorities should revisit the original evidence that supported the FDA clearance. Notably, TNS is currently not recommended for use in the UK by NICE guidelines.\n\nThe trial was run in collaboration with University of Southampton and funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC), with further support from the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects five to eight per cent of school-age children worldwide and is associated with age-inappropriate problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that can impair everyday functioning. Stimulant medications improve symptoms in 70 per cent of those who take them in the short term but there is less evidence of their long-term effects.\n\nTo provide an alternative to medication researchers have developed and trialled approaches that use non-invasive stimulation of the brain, working on the regions that have been identified as influential in ADHD.\n\nOne of these approaches involves stimulating the trigeminal nerve (TNS), targeting a branch of this facial nerve which is thought to activate the brainstem and from there other brain regions that may be relevant to ADHD, in particular the locus coeruleus, which plays a role in arousal which is typically diminished in people with ADHD. TNS is thought to stimulate other brain regions associated with attention such as frontal and thalamic areas via the brainstem in a bottom-up manner.\n\nA previous small trial in the US with 62 children diagnosed with ADHD has shown that when TNS is applied every night for eight hours for one month it is effective in reducing symptoms – this research led to its clearance by the FDA for use in the US. However, the control condition involved no stimulation, and blinding was not tested after one month, raising questions about a potential placebo effect.\n\nThis new UK clinical trial across two sites in London and Southampton tested TNS in a wider range of 150 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD aged between eight and 18 years old and applied a more rigorous placebo condition. Half of the sample received real TNS for about 9 hours every night for four weeks through battery-powered electrodes applied to the forehead. The other half of the sample received the ‘sham’ condition where electrodes were still applied to the forehead every night for four weeks but participants only received 30 seconds of stimulation every hour at a lower frequency and pulse width, which are thought to be non-effective and hence act as a “control” condition.\n\nOur study shows how important it is to design an appropriate placebo condition in clinical trials of brain therapies. There is a large placebo effect with high-tech brain therapies, in particular for patients and families that have an expectation that they can adjust brain differences associated with ADHD. It is hence paramount to control for placebo effects in modern brain therapies to avoid false hopes.\n\nDr Aldo Conti, postdoctoral researcher at IoPPN and at Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London and first author on the study said: “This multicentre trial was designed to address key limitations of the previous pilot study that informed FDA clearance of TNS for ADHD, particularly by using a rigorously controlled sham condition that supported successful blinding across the treatment period. Unlike the earlier study, which was limited to younger children, we also included adolescents, a clinically important group given well-documented challenges with long-term medication adherence. These design choices enabled a more robust and clinically relevant evaluation of TNS.”\n\nThe trial showed that TNS was safe with no serious adverse events and most participants considered it a mild or no burden to use. However, the results showed no significant change in ADHD symptoms, objective measures of hyperactivity, attention and associated behaviours around mood and sleep.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at University of Southampton and study lead for the Southampton site, stated: “Rigorous evidence, such as that generated by this study, is essential for supporting shared decision-making regarding interventions for ADHD. It empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to make informed choices about the treatment of ADHD. Clinicians, individuals with ADHD, and their families need to know which treatments work, and which do not based on the best evidence.”\n\nThe trial was run by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and recruitment involved the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinics within the following NHS trusts: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (previously known as SOLENT NHS Trust), Central and North-West London NHS Foundation Trust, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and South-West London and St. George’s Mental Health NHS Trust.\n\nExternal trigeminal nerve stimulation in youth with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled, phase 2b trial by Conti, A.A. et al was published in Nature Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04075-x\n\nProfessor of Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate",

    "fullText": "The New York Knicks ended their four-game losing streak in emphatic fashion with a record-breaking 120-66 win over local rivals the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nThe 54-point margin of victory is the biggest since the Knicks were founded in 1946 and eclipses 48-point winning margins achieved in 1968, 1972 and 1994.\n\n\"Seeing us play the way we're capable of playing, to put it together for 48 minutes was a lot of fun,\" said Knicks coach Mike Brown.\n\nThe victory at Madison Square Garden followed a poor run that culminated in a 114-97 defeat by Dallas on Monday.\n\nBut the Knicks snapped out of that form against the Nets, roaring into a 38-20 lead in the first quarter and extending that to 59 points at one stage in the match.\n\nJalen Brunson, who scored 20 points, said the win was a huge boost as the Knicks approach the midpoint of the season in third place in the Eastern Conference, behind the Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics.\n\n\"We just had to refocus and get back to who we are,\" Brunson said.\n\n\"This is a good step for us, but we've got to continue to press the issue of getting better every single day.\"",

    "fullText": "Everton forward Kelly Gago \"is free to go\" if another club offers the release clause fee in her contract, says manager Brian Sorensen.\n\nGago, 27, told French newspaper L'Equipe, external last week that Everton were blocking a move to Paris St-Germain.\n\nShe also described their treatment of her as \"unfair\" and claimed that an incident involving one of Sorensen's coaching staff during a training session left her in tears.\n\nThe France international has two and a half years remaining on her contract at Everton after signing an extension in June 2025.\n\nIt is understood the release clause fee for Gago is about £500,000 and that Paris St-Germain made an offer of 50,000 euros (£43,000) this month.\n\nNo other bids are believed to have been made for Gago.\n\n\"She's out for the minute. She's not fit or available to play. She wants to go,\" Sorensen said before Everton's match against Brighton (Friday, 19:00 GMT).\n\n\"She has a release clause in her contract so the club that wants her can just pay that and she is free to go.\n\n\"From my understanding, it's like 10% of that release clause that has been submitted, so I don't think she's going anywhere.\"\n\nAsked if there is a chance Gago will play for Everton again this season, Sorensen added: \"I don't know at this point. We have to see how everything plays out.\"\n\nClub sources say an internal investigation following up on Gago's claims cleared staff of any wrongdoing.\n\nThey also believe claims that meetings were missed and that Gago was forced to sign a contract extension last year are false.",

    "description": "FPL managers will be worried about Erling Haaland's recent form - is it time to move away from the Manchester City striker as a captain choice?",
    "fullText": "What should FPL managers do with Erling Haaland?\n\nThe one-time perma-captain has just 14 points and one goal from his past five games.\n\nIn his 17 games before that, the Norwegian netted 19 times, and a closer look at his underlying data shows a bit of a decline too\n\nA home fixture versus Wolves would normally be a prime time to captain Haaland and potentially play a Triple Captain chip.\n\nBut his form is worrying, and there's always the threat he gets a rest - the striker has played every league game for City and started on Tuesday in the Champions League too.\n\nEgypt striker Omar Marmoush is back from the Africa Cup of Nations and could take Haaland's place.\n\nThere's no benefit from benching Haaland - more than three in four FPL manager own him - but this is definitely the time to consider handing the captain's armband to someone else.\n\nAnd that's what I've done in this team of the week.\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nDon't miss our FPL special Q&A with expert Holly Shand, live on the BBC Sport website on Friday, 23 January at 15:30 GMT.\n\n'Ridiculous amount of games' - has Haaland played too much football?\n\n'Battered in Bodo' - is this more than just a blip for Man City?\n\nA low-scoring week for most managers but returns from Florian Wirtz (10 points), Gabriel (8), Nordi Mukiele (6) and Enzo Fernandez (6) led the team to 45 points, five higher than the average score.\n\nJordan Pickford, Everton, keeper, £5.6m - Leeds (h)\n\nPickford is the top-scoring FPL keeper again, with 100 points already.\n\nIn the past five games, Everton have a league-high three clean sheets and, while they've struggled a bit at their new stadium, they face a Leeds side who are low scorers on the road, with just 11 goals in 11 games.\n\nJames Tarkowski, Everton, £5.6m - Leeds (h)\n\nAnother Everton asset worth the investment is Tarkowski, who has the second-most defensive contribution points (defcon) this season (32) and is fourth in the defender rankings with 108 points.\n\nA decent pick in any Toffees home game.\n\nGabriel, Arsenal, £6.8m - Manchester United (h)\n\nUnited's attacking performance in the Manchester derby last week doesn't exactly fill you with confidence of an Arsenal clean sheet - they were mighty impressive and could have scored five or six.\n\nBut Arsenal at home is a different matter, with just five goals conceded.\n\nAnd Gabriel is probably the most reliable FPL asset right now, with goal threat and a chance of defcon.\n\nMarc Guehi, Manchester City, £5.2m - Wolves (h)\n\nNew City defender Guehi is likely to be a popular choice, given his price and the attacking returns he has had so far this season.\n\nWolves have only scored five goals on the road - this is a huge clean sheet chance.\n\nNathan Collins, Brentford, £5m - Nottingham Forest (h)\n\nContinuing a theme of centre-backs with high defcon and attacking return potential, Collins has been an FPL gem recently with 10-point and 13-point hauls in his past three games.\n\nHe is worth a shot in another nice home fixture.\n\nFlorian Wirtz, Liverpool, £8.3m - Bournemouth (a)\n\nThe German has three 10-point performances in his past five games and only Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes has more points (38) than his 36 in that time.\n\nBournemouth have only conceded 11 in 11 home games, so this isn't an easy game for Liverpool.\n\nHowever, Wirtz leads all Liverpool players for xG (2.31) and expected assists (1.45) in those five games - he is bang on form.\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Manchester City, £7.6m - Wolves (h)\n\nCity have just three points from their past four league games but at some point they are going to put that right and a team is going to be on the receiving end of a hiding.\n\nIf you were going to handpick an opponent to give City a \"get-right\" game, it would be bottom-of-the-table Wolves.\n\nWith doubts over whether Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki start, Semenyo is the safest City bet from midfield.\n\nHarry Wilson, Fulham, £5.9m - Brighton (h)\n\nWilson has 10 FPL returns in his past 10 games and is probably the best-value pick in the game.\n\nHe's been very efficient, with five goals from 11 shots on target and five assists from three big chances created.\n\nA bit like Chris Wood last season, he's in a category of players where you shouldn't even worry about looking at statistics.\n\nWilson is a fine pick for the rest of the season given the price.\n\nErling Haaland, Manchester City, £15.1m - Wolves (h)\n\nHaaland still makes the team but the fear of a benching, Wolves' improved form and his recent blanks put me off captaincy.\n\nIgor Thiago (captain), Brentford, £7.2m - Nottingham Forest (h)\n\nOnly Haaland (8.18) has more FPL points per home start among strikers than Thiago (6.09).\n\nThe Brazilian has has five double-digit hauls this season, with four of those coming at home.\n\nAnd Sean Dyche is yet to turn Forest into a water-tight defence.\n\nYes, they have produced some fine performances, such as beating Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield and holding Arsenal to a 0-0 last week at home.\n\nBut they've also been whalloped by the likes of Aston Villa and Everton on the road and only the Gunners and Manchester City have scored more at home than Brentford.\n\nThierno Barry, Everton, £5.7m - Leeds (h)\n\nHe took a while to get going but the big Frenchman now has three goals in four games and is emerging as a solid budget forward choice, especially for those of you thinking of wildcarding.\n\nMartin Dubravka, Burnley, keeper, £4m - Tottenham (h)\n\nEnzo Fernandez, Chelsea, midfielder, £6.5m - Crystal Palace (a)\n\nJoachim Andersen, Fulham, defender, £4.6m - Brighton (h)\n\nGranit Xhaka, Sunderland, midfielder, £5.2m - West Ham (a)\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "fullText": "Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.\n\nAs industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.\n\nIn part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.\n\nMeta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.\n\nFast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.\n\nAccording to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire.\n\nAnd last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.\n\nThe news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.\n\nUnlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit.\n\nIn total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.\n\nBesides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.\n\nThat model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.\n\nMeta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers.\n\nSpecifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.\n\n“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”\n\nHe proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.\n\nMeta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.\n\nThough there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.\n\nFrom a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.\n\nFor comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\n\nOf course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)\n\nBut this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.\n\nEven before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.\n\nAs bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.\n\nIn May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.\n\nAt the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.\n\nThese types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”\n\nAlso around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)\n\nAnother nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week.\n\nWith an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)\n\nWith other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass.\n\nCombined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.",

    "fullText": "Morgan Rogers refuses to be labelled - and while the Aston Villa star is talking about his positional flexibility, rather than boasting about his quality, his confidence is well-placed.\n\nThe 23-year-old is third-placed Villa's top scorer this season during their surprise Premier League title challenge.\n\nAnd Unai Emery's side are also third in the league phase of the Europa League, having won five of their six games, before Thursday's trip to Fenerbahce.\n\nRogers' fine form has meant he has been picked ahead of Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham for England, with Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel clearly a fan.\n\nAnd regardless of who he is competing against for a spot in England's XI at this summer's World Cup, Rogers feels he has an edge.\n\n\"I think I'm a bit different to everyone that plays in my position. I like to see myself as someone that can do different things on the pitch,\" he said.\n\n\"When asked, I can be a number 10, I can be a winger, I can be a striker.\n\n\"If you ask me to do it and you give me the instructions to do it, I think I've got the capabilities to offer something different to maybe what other people don't have, which is a nice thing.\"\n\nRogers is expected to be a key member of Tuchel's squad at the World Cup, with England playing Croatia, Ghana and Panama in the group stage in the USA.\n\nThe 12-cap attacker scored his first senior goal in the win over Wales in October, when Bellingham was left out of the squad.\n\nTuchel argued it was not right for his side to change their structure to accommodate Bellingham, but the pair can play together - and the England boss will need both at the World Cup.\n\n\"It's the pinnacle of football. Everyone growing up as a kid wants to play in the World Cup,\" Rogers told BBC Sport's Betty Glover.\n\n\"They want to represent their country and being in the pool of players that could potentially do that is exciting.\n\n\"It's so motivational, especially going into this season.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it's in the forefront of my mind. I'm thinking about it, you can't help but know that at the end of the season England are competing in the World Cup to try and win a World Cup.\n\n\"You get that excitement, that buzz, as it gets closer. I want to just focus on my performances every week playing here and then see where it takes me, really.\"",

Maple syrup. Lovely. First of all, I always have, for example, pancakes before a match. I just like pancakes and I always need to have maple syrup. Honestly, I eat this with everything.\n\nAlex: When was the last time you were actually at home in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Oh - probably in the summer, as I spent my Christmas here.\n\nAlex: What do you think of home? Can you build a picture for me of what life was like for you growing up back home?\n\nOlivia: I have a younger sister, so we grew up together. My family were all kind of goofballs I would say. So just playing games a lot, we're always outside, we have dogs as well. So I've grown up with dogs and just go to the park, play football, play with the dogs. That's kind of like what a typical day would look like.\n\nAlex: So your sister plays football?\n\nAlex: What position does she play?\n\nOlivia: Midfielder, winger, striker.\n\nAlex: So does she look up to you and want to follow in your footsteps?\n\nOlivia: I hope so, but she claims she's better than me!\n\nAlex: Does she literally watch your games and say \"You should have been doing this\" or \"You should have scored that goal\"?\n\nOlivia: Yes - she sends me snapchats of my game and says \"Why did you do that?\" I'm like, well, \"What would you have done?\"\n\nAlex: What did she think when you made your move to Arsenal?\n\nOlivia: She was so excited. I mean she also looks up to a team like Arsenal, she loves watching me play so then for me to get the opportunity and really be a role model for her playing with girls like Alessia [Russo] and Leah [Williamson], it's amazing. She's really excited for me.\n\nAlex: Who do you look up to back in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Christine Sinclair. She's a huge legend in the game of course, and also Marta. Then I love watching the men's game as well, so I was always looking up to Neymar, Ronaldinho, Messi, players like that.\n\nAlex: What did your family make of you playing football?\n\nOlivia: I think my dad really grew me into football and he kind of paved the way for me. He made so many sacrifices for me to be where I am today. I also wanted it and he could see that.\n\nAlex: How would your family and friends describe you?\n\nOlivia: Oh, ambitious, crazy... just attacking-minded. My dad always described me whenever I'd play as I'd just take the ball off my own team-mates to go score a goal!\n\nAlex: What was it like for you to make that transition when you finally moved away from Canada playing football?\n\nOlivia: It was quite tough, although I had been away from home for a bit before that. But going to Portugal, for example, it's a whole new world. Different language, different style of football. So having to learn that really on my own was quite tough. But the support system that I had around me was great, so I was able to adapt, I'd say, quite quickly, which is nice.\n\nAnd then, obviously, coming over to England, then that's a whole other environment, style of play, different kinds of people. And obviously it just takes a little bit [of time] to get comfortable. Once you make friends and you're happy, it makes a world of difference on the pitch and off the pitch.\n\nAlex: What would you say is the biggest thing you've learned about yourself?\n\nOlivia: I would say I always thought I was quite independent, but coming here and my ability to make relationships with people on my team and outside of football as well, it has really helped me to acclimatise to what life is like here.\n\nAlex: So we need to explain your background. The Jamaican food - your dad - Jamaican roots, right? And I learned your mum has Chilean and Peruvian roots. What was dinner like at home?\n\nOlivia: Dinner looks different pretty much every day and especially when my grandparents would come by to cook. That's when you know it's on top. So we'd have jerk chicken and my grandpa would make oxtail and my grandmother would make something called seco.\n\nOlivia: It's like a [Peruvian] meat stew and rice, and it's in a green sauce - it's really nice.\n\nAlex: And your grandads played football?\n\nAlex: So when they come round, were there football matches? Were you watching them?\n\nOlivia: I was always playing with them when we went on vacation to the Dominican - we always found a pitch and then we would play pick-up games with random people. My grandparents would join, I would join, my dad and my sister - it was always fun.\n\nAlex: What's your typical day off looking like?\n\nOlivia: It depends on the day and how I feel, but I do pretty much like to stay at home. I like to watch movies, binge watch, I also play video games as well. So, yeah, games, probably a little bit of shopping because I love to shop.\n\nAlex: Right. So if you're not playing football, you are..?\n\nAlex: If one song could be playing when you score a goal, what would it be?\n\nOlivia: I'm going to go with A Milli [by Lil Wayne] because I have that on my pre-match playlists. I think every game.\n\nAlex: The last thing you wrote in your phone notes was?\n\nOlivia: Oh. A bunch of numbers. I was playing an escape room game, so I needed to write down all these numbers so I could put it into a code.\n\nAlex: Since moving to England, what's one thing that you're just like \"I absolutely love this\"?\n\nOlivia: I fell in love with Yorkshire puddings and a Sunday dinner. It's my favourite thing - I absolutely love them now.\n\nAlex: Not many people love Yorkshire puddings.\n\nOlivia: Well, initially I wasn't sure. I was very hesitant because I had in my mind, like gravy on bread. And when I tried it for the first time I thought - how do you even describe Yorkshire puddings?\n\nAlex: Let's think about when we're looking ahead to the season, what are your goals and ambitions?\n\nOlivia: Ultimately, I want to become a better version of myself as a player. I know there's a lot of things I need to develop on, and being at Arsenal that will definitely help me. And ultimately I want to win things.\n\nAlex: Do you feel that you've settled in and the reasons that made you want to come to the club are starting to open up to you?\n\nOlivia: Yeah, 100%. I think the first couple of months it was a lot to really take in, but the girls have been amazing making me feel comfortable.\n\nAlex: Talk me through that first day when you arrived at Arsenal.\n\nOlivia: I was absolutely terrified, yeah, because every time we played Arsenal it was just a massive game. Obviously you never know what the environment is like from the outside, and I didn't know what to expect. And walking in, it was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be - everyone was just so welcoming.\n\nAlex: Who's the MVP, the person that if they weren't there tomorrow you'd be thinking \"this feels strange\"?\n\nOlivia: Less [Russo] really. She just has that personality and that vibe that you can feel at the training ground. It's just very comfortable and you can speak to her about anything. She's just very sweet.\n\nAlex: Renee [Slegers] has just signed a new three-year contract. In terms of the other managers that you've played for, how is she different?\n\nOlivia: She's just very ambitious and I feel like that goes for all around the club. Her values match [the club] and match the players as well, so I think that's just a really great thing to have, and also stability - knowing that she's going to be here for the next three years. To have a female empower us - I think that's her big thing as well, that she wants the players to feel empowered and use our voices - which every time that I've spoken to her I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.\n\nAlex: Do you know about my history with Renee? I used to be her teacher when she first came over. I was a teacher at the Arsenal Academy at the time so it's kind of full circle to see her go on to manage the team. She knows what being at the club means for everyone.\n\nAlex: Talking of the next thing, when you're looking at you and your career, what is it that you want to tick off? What do you want to achieve?\n\nOlivia: Oh, there's plenty of things I want to achieve. I want to win everything, ultimately. And again, the biggest thing is I just want to keep developing and growing as a person and a player. I think that's really important to me, just continue to develop my character, meeting more people and just learning.\n\nAlex: You said meeting more people. How have the Arsenal fans embraced you?\n\nOlivia: They've been amazing. I attended the [Arsenal Women fan engagement project] Block by Block, external consultation a couple of weeks ago where we discussed how we can make matchdays better.\n\nIt was really fun because I got to interact with the fans more on a personal level rather than them being up in the stands and just clapping - actually having a conversation and seeing what we can do to make the experience better for them, but also for us as players. Whether that's music, fireworks, just making it more fun.\n\nAlex: I bet the fans must have been buzzing. Did they know that you were turning up?\n\nOlivia: I'm actually not sure, but they seemed quite shocked when I pulled up!\n\nWatch: Arsenal v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Saturday, 24 June (12:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Quake Brutalist Jam began as a celebration of old-fashioned shooter level design, but its latest version is one step away from being a game in its own right",
    "fullText": "Quake Brutalist Jam began as a celebration of old-fashioned shooter level design, but its latest version is one step away from being a game in its own right\n\nA lone concrete spire stands in a shallow bowl of rock, sheltering a rusted trapdoor from the elements. Standing on the trapdoor causes it to yawn open like iron jaws, dropping you through a vertical shaft into a subterranean museum. Here, dozens of doors line the walls of three vaulted grey galleries, each leading to a pocket dimension of dizzying virtual architecture and fierce gladiatorial combat.\n\nWelcome to Quake Brutalist Jam, the hottest community event for lovers of id Software’s classic first-person shooter from 1996. First run in 2022, the Jam started out as a celebration of old-school 3D level design, where veteran game developers, aspiring level designers and enthusiast modders gather to construct new maps and missions themed around the austere minimalism of brutalist architecture.\n\nThis third iteration of the Jam goes much further. In an intense six-week session, contributors designed 77 brutalist-themed maps where players fight new enemies with new weapons. For context, the original Quake, built by legendary game designers such as John Carmack, John Romero, Tim Willits and American McGee, featured 37 levels when it was first released.\n\nBen Hale is the event’s concierge, a professional game developer working as seniorenvironment artist on the forthcoming survival game Subnautica 2. As a child, Hale learned to build Quake levels with the encouragement of his older brother. “He was very supportive, despite how often I bluescreened his computer,” Hale recalls.\n\nThe idea for a brutalism-themed “jam” – a hobbyist term for an intensive, community game development session that takes place over several days or weeks – came from another Quake mapper named Benoit Stordeur, inspired by a set of concrete textures Hale designed for Quake. “I posted a poll [of themes] for the community to vote on, with brutalism as a choice. Brutalism won by a wide margin,” Hale says.\n\nThe first Quake Brutalist Jam captured the community’s imagination, with participants producing 35 levels in two-and-a-half weeks using Hale’s concrete textures. In a game that already features oppressive gothic and industrial environments, the moody stylings of brutalism proved powerful creative fuel. “So many brutalist buildings look like cool sci-fi structures or evil lairs,” Hale says. The second jam ran in 2023, spawning 30 more proudly grey levels for players to blast through.\n\nBut as he began planning a third jam, Hale ran into some health issues. “I pitched to my friend, Fairweather, to be my cohost this year,” Hale says. “They made the suggestion that we do something a little different this time.”\n\nFairweather is Lain Fleming, a veteran modder who has led numerous community Quake projects including Dwell, Remix Jam and the Coffee Quake series. Rather than simply make new levels for Quake, Fleming suggested giving the Jam’s participants some new tools to work with. “When we began, we simply wanted to visually overhaul some weapons and monsters. But as we did more and more, ideas began to grow,” Fleming says. “We analysed mechanical gaps in the arsenal and enemies, which resulted in many new enemy paradigms you rarely see in Quake.”\n\nThis type of mod, known as a total conversion, proved far more ambitious than Hale or Fleming anticipated. “What was supposed to be a quick six-month mod to host a jam in became a two-year monstrosity. The list of people contributing grew bigger over time, with a team of about 15 near the end,” Hale says.\n\nDespite the challenges, the team ultimately produced an almost entirely new toolset for Quake. Virtually every available weapon is new or heavily modified, including a shotgun with bouncing projectiles, a gun that launches iron rebars, and a cluster-missile launcher. Enemies, meanwhile, mix redesigned Quake staples with entirely new foes.\n\nThe overhaul proved hugely successful. Quake Brutalist Jam 3 had more than double the number of participants for previous jams – so many that Hale had to radically alter his plans for the Start map, the playable mission-select screen that’s something of a Quake tradition. “I opted for a museum or gallery approach,” Hale says. “We had to pack the maps very tightly, which I struggled with a lot.”\n\nThe range of levels contributed by the community is enormous. There are quickfire experiments that last a matter of minutes, high-intensity “slaughtermaps” designed to test player reflexes, ambitious, narrative-driven exploration levels that pay tribute to the form and shape of virtual architecture, and gargantuan gun-fests that last an hour or longer.\n\nIndeed, the featured map, Escape from KOE-37, is almost a game in its own right – an epic three-hour affair heavily inspired by Half-Life with its own storyline and more than 1,000 enemies to fight. Its creator, who goes by the online handle Mazu, is a veteran of the Quake mapping community who spent about 400 hours building it. “Environmental puzzles and set-pieces are just really fun to do. [I] really wanted to have interactive environments for players to explore,” he says. “I just allow my creativity to put ideas into my map without axing too many of them. Doubts would lead to slower progress.”\n\nMaps such as KOE-37 highlight the remarkable work that community members have been doing for years in a space that professional game design has long since abdicated. Once the most popular genre around, linear, single-player first-person shooters have become relatively rare in mainstream game development, pushed to one side in favour of sprawling open worlds and multiplayer experiences. As such, the particular level design that games like Doom and Quake specialise in – complex 3D mazes where navigation is as much a part of the challenge as combat – is at risk of becoming a lost art.\n\nYet events such as QBJ3, alongside other Quake mods such as Arcane Dimensions and The Immortal Lock are not only keeping this style of virtual architecture alive, they often surpass the achievements of the old masters, twisting and warping and spooling out 3D geometry in ways that wouldn’t have been possible 30 years ago: “With these games, you have such a rich, decades-long history of levels to play that you can refine your own designs to a razor’s edge,” Fleming says.\n\nQuake Brutalist Jam 3 isn’t just for hardcore Quake fans and shooter addicts. This year’s Start map has a section dedicated to newcomers with little to no mapping experience. At the other end of the spectrum, it has also seen contributions from industry professionals such as game designer and former teacher at New York University’s Game Centre, Robert Yang.\n\n“It’s the underground Met Gala of concrete murderzone design, the biggest event on the Quake calendar,” Yang says. “Everyone shows off, everyone nurtures the new faces, everybody eats. I love it.”\n\nFor his contribution, One Need Not Be a House, Yang created an open-ended map that, were it not for all the heavily armed soldiers milling about, wouldn’t look out of place in an adventure game like Myst. “My map started as a study of the architect Louis Kahn’s ‘brick brutalism masterpieces – the National Assembly complex in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad [in India],” he says.\n\nOpen-ended levels can be tricky, and highly unusual for a Quake map. To help solve this problem, Yang looked to one of the most famous levels from Halo: Combat Evolved – The Silent Cartographer. “I wanted to make a similar non-linear map but with many branching paths, so you can mix and match your own route, get powerups out of order, and feel like you’re getting away with something.”\n\nYang says he doesn’t particularly like playing Quake as a shooter, but he admires how Quake Brutalist Jam 3 hints at a potential alternative way of making games, one that is driven by community rather than profit. “Brutalism, especially in the UK, is about building for the public. You don’t need to add beautiful ornaments because building and nurturing the future is already beautiful,” he says. “And that’s what Quake Brutalism is about too, a socialist utopia where handcrafted video games are a free public good that brings people together.”\n\nIt may not be long before Hale, along with Fleming and the other organisers, put such an idea into practice. Their next planned project is their own video game, one that’s fully independent of id Software’s shooter. “After this jam, we’re taking a bit of a break from modding and mapping for Quake,” Hale concludes. “We love the community and the continuous celebration of each other’s work and aren’t going anywhere. But also, we want to just make a game. We’ve been wanting to do that for so long it’s starting to hurt.”",

    "fullText": "Deadly ‘reverse’ cells can destroy us unless scientists stop them\n\nResearchers are close to making “reversed” cells that may wipe us off the planet\n\nLet’s say it’s 2036, and scientists are working on a new class of drugs. These medications are mirror-image versions of the molecules your body uses to fight disease. Their big advantage is that reverse compounds last longer in the body because destructive enzymes don’t recognize them and rip them apart. Yet the compounds are still effective against invading microbes. Clinical trials have been promising, and the team is eager to scale up production.\n\nThe researchers turn to engineered mirror bacteria—single cells made of reversed molecules—for the job. Bacterial factories aren’t a far-fetched idea. Today, for instance, pharmaceutical companies use bacteria to manufacture synthetic insulin for diabetics. Curious about whether mirror cells could be used in a similar way, the scientists experiment on a mirrored version of the common bacterium Escherichia coli.\n\nUnfortunately, a researcher with a small cut on her thumb from dry skin forgets to put on her gloves and touches a surface contaminated with just a few of these cells. The bacteria get into her blood.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nHer immune cells, which usually kill off intruders, don’t recognize the mirror proteins on the novel bacteria and fail to react. The mirror microbes multiply and spread within her. Defensive antibodies never appear. After a few days at home, the scientist falls gravely ill. She’s taken to a hospital, where she’s loaded with antibiotics that can’t make up for the massive failures of her immune system. Three days later she dies.\n\nBut while in her house, she had already spread the bacteria around. Her cat carries some into the garden, where they grow in the soil. Worms and insects become infected and transmit the mirror microbes throughout the neighborhood. Her children bring the bacteria to school. More and more people fall ill and begin to die. New outbreaks start in other locations as people and animals travel. A process of exponential and irreversible growth has begun—one that could quickly cover the world.\n\nThe scenario sounds like a sci-fi movie. But it is much closer to reality.\n\nScientists have been making rapid progress on technologies that could make it possible to build mirror organisms in the coming decades. Already biochemists can create increasingly complex mirror molecules, including enzymes that build mirror RNA. In the near future, similar enzymes could make reversed DNA. At the same time, synthetic biologists are getting closer to building regular bacterial cells from scratch. If progress in these two fields converges, it will be possible to build mirror bacteria.\n\nA little more than a year ago I and 37 of my colleagues published a warning about this potential catastrophe in Science, insisting on a halt to this work. But how do we stop or control research that can take place in dozens of laboratories in many countries all over the world? This is the story of that challenge—and our plan to prevent a terrible future.\n\nThe first glimpse of that future emerged in 1848, when a young Louis Pasteur took the podium at the French Academy of Sciences in Paris and announced a remarkable discovery. Pasteur had been looking closely at the crystals of an acid found in wine. These compounds could take one of two forms that, despite being chemically identical—made of the same chemical building blocks and bonds—had opposite configurations. Hold your two hands in front of you, palms up. Their components are equivalent (four fingers, a thumb, a palm, etcetera), but they point in two different directions.\n\nIt turns out that almost all the basic molecules of life can exhibit this intriguing duality, as if one is the mirror image of the other. This property is called chirality. Other molecules, in contrast, are perfectly symmetrical; those are called achiral. Most large biological molecules are chiral, like our hands. No matter how you turn and twist molecules that are chiral opposites, you cannot make them overlap completely. But if a large group of people stacked their identically chiral left hands on top of one another, in the same orientation, the hands would overlap. Groups of chiral molecules are usually referred to as “left-handed” or “right-handed,” depending on which orientation they have in common. All life on Earth—everything that has descended from our last primordial common ancestor, which lived four billion years ago—builds its classes of molecules from only one of these two possible forms. Nineteen of the 20 amino acids that make up proteins are left-handed, for instance, whereas DNA and RNA twist to the right.\n\nThese microbes would have a strong claim to be the most dangerous biological threat ever known.\n\nBut there’s no reason that mirrored versions of these building blocks can’t exist, and indeed, many are found in nature. Although almost all amino acids are left-handed, right-handed amino acids D-alanine, D-methionine and D-leucine (the D prefix comes from the Latin dextro, meaning “right”) appear in bacterial cell walls. Some others are being made in labs: right-handed versions of short amino acid chains are being synthesized as candidates for new drugs. As noted, their unusual orientation renders them resistant to enzymes that would otherwise latch on and destroy them. Astrobiologists have long thought life could have conceivably evolved in the opposite configuration—and, intriguingly, both left- and right-handed amino acids were found on the asteroid Bennu in approximately equal quantities.\n\nScientists have already made a few mirror components. In 1993 researchers then at Johns Hopkins University reported making a right-handed version of the typically left-handed protein rubredoxin. More incremental work of this type has continued in the ensuing decades. Then, in 2022, other researchers announced they had built parts of a mirror-image enzyme that made a reverse RNA molecule. RNA is the essential template for most proteins, and it also plays crucial roles in numerous other processes essential to life. This engineering feat brought us much closer to making mirror components and assembling them into a functional mirror bacterial cell.\n\nBut it would be a killer mirror. Microbes like these would have a strong claim to be the most dangerous biological threat we’ve ever known. They could survive and grow on a range of naturally occurring nutrients in the environment. Yet they would probably be resistant to the many predators—viruses and protozoans—that keep populations of bacteria in check in the natural world. Such predators, after being selected during millions of years of evolution to recognize one protein shape, would not detect the opposite configuration. For the same reason, mirror cells could evade many parts of the immune system, causing infections likely to be fatal in people, animals and plants. They could spread and evolve rapidly in the environment, acquiring mutations that would enable them to grow on other nutrients, which would make them even more dangerous. And they could be impossible to eradicate, becoming a perennial source of infections that no human, plant or animal could fight.\n\nWhen I first heard of this idea, about two years ago, I thought it must be science fiction. I figured the initially constructed mirror organism would be too fragile to live and reproduce. The closest things we have to synthetic life today are flimsy and delicate: test-tube-bound, not suitable for natural ecosystems and environmental pressures. Surely the mirror versions of artificial life-forms would be doubly so. For instance, what would they eat? Most of the molecular food sources that power life on Earth are chiral, too—wouldn’t mirror bacteria need similarly oriented nutrients when they first escaped into the wild and starve if those nutrients didn’t exist?\n\nWhen some colleagues and I started to look into it, I learned that we were dangerously wrong. There are indeed many nutrients that mirror bacteria could digest, including many achiral symmetrical ones. Experiments have shown that populations of some natural bacteria, such as E. coli, can grow on only achiral nutrients, and mirror bacteria would be able to do the same.\n\nNor would a mirror organism necessarily be as fragile as the highly modified, close-to-synthetic cells we have today—cells like the ones my colleague John Glass’s team at the J. Craig Venter Institute has constructed with a minimal number of genes or organisms like those that George Church’s group at Harvard University has “recoded” with slight alterations in their DNA. These are the product of thousands of engineering steps that make them much more delicate than bacteria that thrive in the environment. In contrast, mirror bacteria could be identical to robust natural bacteria in all ways but one, confounding our intuitions about the fitness of engineered life outside the lab.\n\nWhat would happen if mirror bacteria got even a tiny foothold in the natural environment? The result could look a lot like the work of my mentor, evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski of Michigan State University. He has conducted experiments in which a dozen cultures of naturally chiral lab-grown E. coli are given a fresh glucose meal every morning. He found that even genetically identical microbes would quickly evolve and diversify, becoming distinct communities.\n\nMy work with infectious bacteria has shown that permanent and meaningful diversification may require only hundreds of generations. Mirror bacteria could evolve in the same way. It wouldn’t be a one-and-done event: you’d create a second tree of life that would trace its own evolutionary paths through diverse ecosystems, finding niches wherever it could. An accidental release could cross an irreversible threshold.\n\nPeople would be on the wrong side of that passage. Ordinarily, the trillions of bacteria living in our gut provide an early defense against normal-chirality pathogens: some produce antibacterial molecules that directly inhibit or kill pathogens, and some help to trigger immune responses such as the production of antimicrobial peptides or antibodies. But if you ingested mirror bacteria, many of these defenses would likely fail.\n\nYour gut’s microbiome probably wouldn’t be able to spot mirror bacteria’s reversed molecules, so it won’t trigger the production of antibacterial compounds. Even if they were produced, these substances almost certainly wouldn’t be able to bind to mirror molecules, just as a left glove doesn’t fit on a right hand. Perhaps worst, the failure of these early defenses means it’s unlikely your body would trigger the downstream immune responses required to successfully fight off an infection.\n\nOur immune systems have evolved complex and layered immune responses to bacteria, recognizing the molecular signatures (called pathogen-associated molecular patterns) that are common to many of them and triggering immune responses to limit their invasion. Our bodies would be unlikely to spot invaders with reversed molecular structures. Even if they did, they wouldn’t be able to attack the microbes with their full arsenal of immune defenses, many of which also rely on chiral interactions.\n\nFor example, one critical early part of the immune response is the activity of cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, which “eat” bacterial threats and digest them by attacking chiral bacterial molecules with a chiral enzyme. Their digestive enzymes wouldn’t be able to break the chemical bonds of mirror cells, because they have evolved to grab and break those cells’ opposites. It’s likely that macrophages and other immune cells would be less effective at killing mirror bacteria.\n\nThat’s only one problem. Your immune system also has an adaptive system of specialized immune cells and antibodies that attack and destroy invading microbes. This system remembers what those intruders look like so it can mount a stronger response if the threat returns.\n\nSuch adaptive immune memories rely on chiral molecules. We can’t directly study what a mirror-bacterial infection would look like, but the diseases of people born with genetic defects in parts of the immune system provide clues. One such group of patients has a dysfunctional form of a receptor called MHC-II. Normally this receptor captures fragments of pathogens and signposts them for T cells, but the receptor doesn’t work properly in these patients. Similarly, mirror proteins could not be broken down into those fragments, so MHC-II would not be able to signpost them. Mirror infections therefore might resemble the infection of an MHC-II-deficient patient.\n\nThe comparison is not reassuring. These people often die in childhood, overwhelmed by infections caused by the common bacteria and viruses all around us. And this is a case study of failure in just one part of the immune system. Mirror bacteria would probably evade several parts at the same time.\n\nThe concern is that, freed from the pressures of immune constraints and the competition of the natural microbiome on our skin and in our gut, mirror bacteria could replicate faster than they are cleared and then, riding the bloodstream, deposit bacterial cells throughout the body. The inside of the human body has enough achiral nutrients for mirror bacteria to grow. A mirror bacterium engineered to use a natural-chirality diet would fare even better. The body would then become a petri dish, like a cadaver—unprotected by living immune cells. What this strange infection would look like precisely is unclear, but the expected result is sepsislike inflammation and death.\n\nAs the danger of mirror cells became more apparent, a team of scientists began working on what to do.\n\nAstonishingly, it gets worse. The natural world is full of bacteria—a million cells in a gram of seawater, a billion in a gram of soil. They don’t overwhelm the planet, because they have predators that rely heavily on chiral processes. Viruses called bacteriophages enter bacteria by latching onto surface proteins that they match the configuration of like a key fitting into a lock. The phages kill bacteria, limiting their threat. But if there is no match between a phage and a surface protein, the phage can’t get in. Even if one did get inside a mirror bacterium, none of its replication machinery or genetic material would work there. The bacteriophage would be stuck, alone and isolated, incapable of replicating inside the cell.\n\nAmoebas and other microbial predators, meanwhile, track and swallow bacteria and digest them whole. They’d face the same problems as macrophages in the human immune system: they would be less able to detect mirrored molecules, and even if they managed to swallow one, they’d probably struggle to digest it and use the mirror component parts as nutrients. Even at larger scales—those of plants and other animals—immunity consistently relies on chiral interactions. As a result, many animal and plant species might be unable to fend off mirror bacteria.\n\nThere could also be enormous environmental consequences. Cyanobacteria are simple organisms that derive nutrition directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide, and they often don’t require any chiral nutrients. The same would be true for mirrored versions if any were built. But because they would probably be resistant to viruses, there would be much less downward pressure on their populations. As they grew in number, they would compete with other bacteria for scarce ocean nutrients such as iron or phosphorus, significantly reducing the population of natural-chirality bacteria, which would leave species such as marine krill with much less to feed on. If krill populations collapsed, that could in turn drive many larger species such as whales to extinction.\n\nHow do we stop this? As the steps toward danger became more apparent in the past several years, a team of more than 150 scientists in different disciplines assembled from around the world and began working to figure out what to do. We gathered in Paris last June to make a plan.\n\nThe agreement among researchers in Paris was widespread: mirror organisms should never be created. Laws will be needed to ensure they aren’t, and we must draw red lines around the most dangerous technologies that could enable their synthesis. In the meantime, research funders can help by confirming they won’t support work aimed at building mirror cells—much as they have already committed to not funding research into human cloning.\n\nI started out confused and dubious about this threat, and then I became very concerned. But today I find myself invigorated about our ability to ward off catastrophe—because we’ve spotted this threat so early.\n\nYes, scientists have made small chiral molecules. But making a complete, functional mirror cell would take extraordinary effort: synthesizing longer and longer biomolecules, making a bacterial chassis from scratch, and creating all the component parts of cellular life, such as ribosomes. Then everything would have to be assembled into a living, working cell. Despite decades of work since the early 1990s, nobody has built an entire standard cell from scratch. We estimate it would require the kind of effort and resources of scientific megaprojects such as the Human Genome Project—which has cost billions of dollars—to make a completely new entity such as a mirror microbe. Building mirror bacteria is a bit like building a skyscraper twice the height of today’s tallest structures: we know technically what needs to be done, but it would be an extremely complex feat of engineering. This fact gives us a golden opportunity to tackle the risk long before it materializes.\n\nActing now is our leverage. There aren’t many examples of scientists identifying issues with the development of technology before issues emerge. Chlorofluorocarbons were retired from use only after they’d torn a hole in the ozone layer. Thalidomide stopped being prescribed for pregnant women only after thousands of infants were born with birth defects. But we have identified this problem.\n\nIn addition to a moratorium on mirror-cell work, we can develop strong modes of governance with international entities that identify and control the chemical constituents of mirror molecules and cells. These agencies could spot whether a lab or a country was accumulating unusual amounts of these compounds, just as they sound the alarm today if a country is stockpiling the components of chemical or nuclear weapons.\n\nYet we don’t want to limit science in this area completely. Some research in synthetic biology could help with the design and manufacture of novel drugs that could benefit the world. For instance, it may be a good idea to allow scientists to work with certain small mirror molecules but ban the stockpiling of mirror compounds that exceed a certain length. The longer ones can be more easily used to assemble an entire mirror cell.\n\nWe won’t figure out where to draw the line or how to solve all these challenges in one go. We can’t make any final decisions on an issue of this importance at any single conference. Much more work is needed to understand the best governance methods that will ensure that the risks can be avoided. But I’m tremendously encouraged by how quickly a large group of scientists and biosecurity experts—more than 300 people attended the Paris meeting either in person or virtually—recognized there was a huge problem and agreed on the urgency of finding a solution.\n\nThe risks of this technology are great, but it’s easy to see the people who are working hard to eliminate them. All we have to do is look in the mirror.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

Blue Origin said the network would be meant to serve a maximum of roughly 100,000 customers.\n\nThe reveal of TeraWave coincides with a space industry rush to build data centers in space that can meet the soaring demand for large-scale AI data processing, which on Earth requires immense energy and resources as adoption of the technology expands.\n\nThe planned network adds another satellite constellation linked to Bezos, executive chairperson of Amazon, which is in an early phase of deploying Leo – a network formerly called Project Kuiper – involving 3,200 satellites providing internet to consumers and businesses.\n\nMusk’s Starlink network of roughly 10,000 satellites is farthest ahead in a global push to put internet infrastructure in space, where swarms of low-orbiting satellites offer more security and higher connection speeds than traditional, unitary satellites farther out in space.\n\nThe SpaceX CEO has said he plans to build data centers in space, complementing the Starlink network, while Bezos has predicted such space-based centers will be commonplace in orbit within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nStarlink, which has reported more than 6 million customers across at least 140 countries, targets individual consumers, businesses, governments and, with its Starshield variant, US national security agencies. Amazon Leo, with 180 satellites in space so far, has a similar customer strategy.\n\nA handful of Chinese companies are swiftly deploying similar satellite networks to get up to pace with Starlink, which has proved key for remote communications and geopolitical conflicts. China is developing new reusable rockets that can loft thousands of these satellites over the next several years for lower costs, a playbook first written by Musk’s SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nBlue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, which has launched twice but has been slow to achieve a rapid flight rate, will likely be a vital part of TeraWave’s deployment.\n\nUnlike Starlink, the planned network appears off-limits to individual consumers, according to Blue Origin’s statement.\n\nBlue Origin’s statement said: “TeraWave enterprise-grade user and gateway terminals can be rapidly deployed worldwide and interface with existing high-capacity infrastructure, providing additional route diversity and strengthening overall network resilience,” leaving unclear what types of existing infrastructure the network can work with.",

    "description": "Luke Abrahams died on Jan. 23, 2023, just days after medics said he didn't need to be taken to the hospital",
    "fullText": "An amateur soccer player from England died from sepsis and a flesh-eating disease in January 2023\n\n20-year-old Luke Abrahams had his symptoms dismissed as tonsillitis and sciatica by several medical professionals in the days leading up to his death\n\nAhead of a court investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death, Abrahams' parents remembered him as a kind man who \"got on with everyone\"\n\nAn amateur soccer player was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics just days before his death from a bacterial infection and a flesh-eating disease.\n\nAn investigation into his death was opened at Northampton Coroner's Court in England on Tuesday, Jan. 20, following the death of 20-year-old Luke Abrahams on Jan. 23, 2023, per a post on the North Northamptonshire Council website.\n\nThe BBC reported that the inquest was opened after Abrahams, from Northampton, which is about 70 miles north of London, died of sepsis and necrotising fasciitis.\n\nPer the Cleveland Clinic, \"Necrotizing fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating disease, is a bacterial infection that affects the tissue under your skin called fascia.\"\n\nThe site adds that the infection can be \"treated with antibiotics and surgery to remove damaged tissue.\"\n\nIn the week before his death, Abrahams was in contact with numerous doctors, as well as the emergency room and paramedics, per ITV. He also called 111 [the U.K.'s non-emergency medical number].\n\nAfter Abrahams was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics, his condition deteriorated and leg pain left him unable to move, according to the BBC. Three days before his death, Abrahams had a video consultation with an out-of-hours doctor on Jan. 20, 2023, with the medic diagnosing sciatica. Per Mayo Clinic, sciatica refers to pain that travels along the path of the sciatic nerve from the buttocks and down each leg.\n\nAlthough Abrahams had a high temperature and high blood sugar levels, an ambulance crew said he didn't need to go to the hospital when his family called them 12 hours after his sciatica diagnosis. He was admitted to the hospital two days later, but died the following day, the BBC added.\n\nBefore his death, attempts had been made to save Abrahams by amputating his leg, ITV reported.\n\nSpeaking before the court investigation into his death, Abrahams' father, Richard, said, \"It’s so frustrating — they know they could have treated him better than they did,\" per ITV.\n\n\"We want justice and accountability. Someone has to be held responsible,\" he added.\n\nAbrahams' mother, Julie, said, \"We would just like to know where they went wrong, how they let Luke down, and for them to be honest and to show accountability, so we can properly grieve and let Luke rest in peace properly,\" ITV reported.\n\nSusan Jevons, head of patient safety and coroner services for East Midlands Ambulance Service, admitted during the court investigation that Abrahams should've been taken to the hospital, per the BBC.\n\nJevons said, \"If you look at Luke's presentation, it was not normal. Blood sugar and pain score warranted a transfer to [the] hospital,\" she said, adding, \"He was an unwell man.\"\n\n\"He'd been treated and it wasn't working. Leaving him at home wasn't going to get the treatment he required,\" she concluded.\n\nIt was confirmed during the court investigation that a paramedic involved had since left the ambulance service after being supervised for some time after the incident, the BBC stated.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn a November 2024 article, the BBC noted that an investigation into Abrahams' death had been opened, but the coroner had adjourned the court hearing until May 2025 after stating he had died of \"natural causes.\"\n\nThe previous report stated that a serious incident investigation at the East Midlands Ambulance Service Trust had found that the crew failed to follow guidelines and policies before Abrahams' death, the BBC reported, adding that his symptoms should have indicated a life-threatening condition and resulted in a transfer to the hospital.\n\nThe investigation also said that the fact that Abrahams wasn't taken to the hospital meant there was a \"missed opportunity\" for him to get medical help, which could have prevented \"deterioration,\" per the outlet.\n\n\"He just got on with everyone, he had a second for everyone,\" Abrahams' parents told the BBC of their son before Tuesday's court investigation. \"He used to go out at 11 at night because his friend needed a chat. He would make time for everyone, just bringing everyone together. That was Luke,\" they added.\n\nNHS Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE for comment and additional information.\n\nAn East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesperson told PEOPLE in an email, \"With the [investigation] underway, and we believe currently planned to continue until Thursday, we will be waiting until the Coroner has concluded before sharing a statement.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Northampton Coroner's Office confirmed to PEOPLE that the [investigation] may conclude on Thursday, Jan. 22, or Friday, Jan. 23.",

    "title": "Kyle Rittenhouse hit with call for arrest after posing with gun in Minneapolis post",
    "description": "Rittenhouse returned to social media December and it has been a rough go for him there since.",
    "fullText": "When Kyle Rittenhouse returned to social media back in December, he promised there were big things to come.\n\nA month later, those big things don’t seem to have materialized for him, yet. Instead, Rittenhouse who is famous for shooting three people, killing two, during a racial injustice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 2020 before claiming self-defense and being acquitted of all charges, appears to be using his time on social media mostly posting slurs and teasing the idea of going to Minnesota as ICE is met with protestesters there.\n\nHis latest version of that came Tuesday as he shared a photo posing with a High Ground Defense M134HG Minigun on X.\n\n“Thinking of taking this to Minneapolis,” Rittenhouse wrote. “Thoughts?\n\nFolks were quick to respond, and it didn’t go well for him.\n\n“@FBI lock him up,” one person replied.\n\n“We get it your schtick is ‘I murdered a guy and got away with it, so let me joke about murdering more Americans,’” Skyler Shuler replied on X.\n\n“You look dumber every year!” another wrote. “Congrats dude.”\n\n“You take way too much joy in killing human beings — that’s not a compliment,” Colorado Mick wrote on X.\n\n“You should repent and save your soul while you still can,” Jesse Brenneman suggested.\n\n“Take it and keep it to yourself,” Michael Woods commented. “Bad karma to be agitating like this.”\n\n“Dude, no,” Braden Pace replied. “You got a W with that acquittal. As you should have. But don’t do this. You’re making responsible gun owners look bad.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Rittenhouse has joked about the scene in Minnesota.\n\n“FAFO — don’t try and hit a ICE agent with your vehicle and you won’t end up in the forever box,” he wrote on X after ICE office Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis. “It’s pretty simple.”\n\nHe followed that up with another post that read, “After thinking about it, should I travel across the state line to Minnesota?”\n\nThat, of course, kicked up a social media stir then, too.\n\n“How do you even look yourself in the mirror in the morning?” one person replied.\n\n“Someone was murdered you (expletive) (expletive),” another wrote. “There is nothing to laugh about you (expletive) truly are evil and I can’t wait for karma to catch up.”\n\nRittenhouse announced in December that he was returning to social media saying that the assassination of Charlie Kirk convinced him he “couldn’t sit on the sidelines anymore.”\n\n“So I’m back,” he wrote. “Not quietly. Not halfway. I’m coming back in a big way.”\n\nBut just a week into his return he found himself getting ripped online by a Republican Sheriff from Florida.\n\nThat came after he filmed a video of himself standing in front of the Walton County Jail while claiming that Michael Rediker “used Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law to lawfully defend himself when his life was put in jeopardy.”\n\n“Michael did nothing wrong, and he deserves all our support,” Rittenhouse said in the video which he pinned to his X page.\n\n“We are expecting an outright not guilty under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law,” he added.\n\nWalton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson did not take kindly to Rittenhouse’s claims. He reshared the video via the Walton County Sheriff Office’s official X account, and issued a video of his own scathing response.\n\n“I don’t normally do this,” Adkinson said. “I don’t normally take the time to speak to public comments on cases, certainly not open cases. But in this particular situation, a murder that occurred yesterday in Walton County, I feel compelled to respond to what I can only call wildly irresponsible. I would say motivated by many factors, none of them in the interest of justice in which individuals, particularly Kyle Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, are attempting to frame the murder here in Walton County on Thursday of Mr. Keen as a Stand Your Ground case or wrapping it in the Constitution or that it is Second Amendment case.”\n\n“After 30-something years of doing this, I very rarely get personally offended, but I’m actually just kind of disgusted with them,” the sheriff continued. “There was a man who lost his life yesterday. A father, a husband with two small children, who was murdered, unarmed on his own property, unprovoked by an individual who drove a tractor over a half a mile onto the victim’s property. Once there, batters his wife in front of eyewitnesses. When the husband, whom there had been no confrontation with, gets out to come over and help pick his wife up off the ground the suspect shoots him in the face. He was unarmed. There was no fight between them. There was no attack, and as he is laying dying on the ground, this suspect, Michael Rediker, stood over him and made some comments for which he is going to answer to in court. At the same time, he committed aggravated assault on multiple other people because he murdered this man in front of witnesses that watched this as this man was murdered. Again, unarmed, on his own property, after his wife had been battered, and no confrontation.\n\n“Now, somehow out of that, Mr. Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, have determined that this is the great Stand Your Ground case,” Adkinson continued. “Well, I’ll tell you this. I’ll bet my badge on this. Not only is that not a stand your ground, Mr. Rediker will face either the ultimate penalty in the state of Florida or God willing the rest of his natural life in prison. Because, come Christmas morning in two weeks, there are two little boys elementary school age, two children, that are not going to have their father, and there’s a wife whose not going to have her husband all so these two idiots can get more likes on their Facebook and call it a Constitutional issue.”\n\n“I think both of you are jokes, and I don’t think you should make a damn cent off the suffering of someone else,” he said. “So, if you don’t like that, well you can file that under I don’t really give a damn. I know people aren’t’ going to like this, and I don’t care about that either. I’m so disgusted and sad for the Keen family and their loss and the fact that these two yo-yos are going to try to make money and news on it. And I probably shouldn’t give them this, but I think the public deserves to know this doesn’t have a damn thing to do with the Second Amendment or Stand Your Ground. So, I hope that many of you will reach out and tell these two jack-wagons what you think about what they are doing to this family suffering.\n\n“Don’t let them make on penny off a like.”",

    "fullText": "For decades, McDonald's customers have complained that the fast-food giant reserves its most fun and innovative menu items for international markets, leaving its home country with the same predictable seasonal releases.\n\nAs frustrating as that may seem, there is a deliberate strategy behind this madness.\n\nMcDonald's tailors its menu in each country based on cultural preferences, ingredient availability, and what can be executed efficiently at scale. The same applies to limited-time and seasonal items.\n\nWhile menus vary around the world, a small set of core products remains consistent, including the World Famous Fries, the classic Hamburger and Cheeseburger, the Big Mac, McNuggets, and the Vanilla Cone.\n\nThis localization strategy reduces operational risk and improves return on investment, which is why each country maintains its own lineup with exclusive offerings.\n\nHistorically, McDonald's has taken a cautious approach to bringing international items to the U.S., testing them selectively and tailoring availability based on regional preferences and past performance. In most cases, localized items had stayed local.\n\nMcDonald's has revealed an entire lineup of international menu items coming to U.S. restaurants nationwide in 2026, marking one of the company's most ambitious cross-market rollouts in years.\n\nHere is the full list, with all items set to launch within the next few days.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) first introduced its Hot Honey Sauce in Australia in March 2025, aiming to capitalize on what it described as \"the hottest trend everyone is talking about,\" according to a company press release. The sauce was later rolled out in New Zealand and Canada, each for a limited-time run.\n\nNow, less than a year later, it is headed to the U.S.\n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce blends honey with red bell peppers and cayenne peppers, finished with a hint of tangy vinegar. Alongside it, McDonald's is debuting three new menu items featuring the trendy sauce.\n\nHot Honey Bacon McCrispy: A crispy chicken filet topped with thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, crispy jalapeños, shredded lettuce, creamy mayo, and Hot Honey Sauce, served on a toasted potato roll \n\nHot Honey Snack Wrap: A McCrispy Strip topped with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, and Hot Honey Sauce, all wrapped in a tortilla \n\nHot Honey Sausage Egg Biscuit: A pork sausage patty and a folded egg, topped with Hot Honey Sauce, on a biscuit brushed with real butter \n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce and all three new menu items will be available for a limited time beginning January 27 at participating U.S. locations and can be added to any menu item, according to the Snackolator Instagram page.\n\nAlthough the new products have not officially launched, they already appear on the McDonald's website.\n\nThe Big Arch burger debuted in Portugal in July 2024 and quickly gained traction, prompting McDonald's to expand it into Canada, Germany, Australia, the UK, Ireland, and France.\n\nDuring an earnings call in mid-2024, McDonald's acknowledged the burger's strong performance and universal appeal, which led it to accelerate its expansion.\n\n\"The pilot of our larger burger offering, Big Arch, now in three international markets, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, shows that we're listening to consumer tastes and delivering,\" said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings call.\n\n\"We'll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster into more international markets in 2025.\"\n\nFollowing its positive reception abroad, McDonald's tested the Big Arch in the U.S. at its headquarters restaurant in Chicago for a limited time.\n\nThis massive burger features two quarter-pounder patties, three slices of white cheese, crispy onions, slivered onions, pickles, lettuce, and Big Arch Sauce, all sandwiched between a sliced sesame and poppy seed bun.\n\nWhile the Double Quarter Pounder comes close, it's not the same. McDonald's is positioning the Big Arch as a more premium, value-driven option.\n\nIn Canada, a Big Arch meal costs about $12.59, or roughly $9 in the U.S. Despite the higher price, the company says the burger delivers greater value, an increasingly important selling point as consumers grow more cautious of their spending.\n\nMcDonald's credits the Big Arch as a key traffic driver in several markets, helping boost global comparable sales by nearly 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAfter extensive testing, the Big Arch will make its nationwide U.S. debut in early March 2026, according to The Street.\n\nLike much of the fast-food industry, McDonald's has faced mounting pressure in recent years, particularly in the U.S. Slower foot traffic, rising food costs, and weaker spending have weighed on results.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nMcDonald's making major drive-thru change\n\nMcDonald’s expected to bring back beloved childhood favorite in 2026\n\nFive Guys debuts alcohol and all-day breakfast\n\nDuring the quarter ending June 2025, foodservice traffic declined 1%, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana. However, value menu traffic rose 1%, marking the first positive growth in three years.\n\nCircana also found that value-focused diners are 33% more likely than non-value buyers to purchase value menu items when visiting other restaurant chains, underscoring how aggressively consumers are hunting for savings and deals.\n\nIn response to consumers' cautious spending, McDonald's has rolled out several value-focused initiatives, including the Extra Value Meals, McValue menu, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\nIn March 2025, the company launched the Restaurant Experience Team, combining operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency. It also created three new global Category Management teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts to further specialize innovation within its food products.\n\n“Value is rarely defined only by price,” said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. “Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.”\n\nThose efforts are beginning to pay off. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, U.S. comparable sales increased 2.4%.\n\nDespite improvement, McDonald's remains cautious.\n\n\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" said McDonald's CEO Christopher J. Kempczinski in an earnings call.\n\n\"It’s a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.\"",

    "description": "Can it become the next biotech leader?",
    "fullText": "Viking Therapeutics' price target implies a juicy upside from its current levels.\n\nThe stock's most important catalysts will likely have to wait until next year.\n\nThe drugmaker is somewhat risky, but it could deliver massive returns.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Viking Therapeutics ›\n\nLast year was a challenging one for Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX), a mid-cap biotech. The company made little clinical progress and, in fact, one of the major data readouts it released was not well received by the market, leading to a sell-off. Over the trailing 12-month period, Viking Therapeutics' shares have lagged the S&P 500. But could Viking perform much better this year?\n\nPlenty of analysts on Wall Street think so. The company boasts an average price target of $93.39 (according to Yahoo! Finance), implying an upside of 175% from its current levels. Can Viking Therapeutics soar by that much in 2026?\n\nViking Therapeutics' leading candidate is VK2735, an investigational GLP-1 medicine it is developing for weight management. A subcutaneous version of this therapy is currently in a 78-week phase 3 study. Viking's phase 3 results for VK2735 will be the most significant event for the company in a long time, potentially leading to its share price soaring overnight, provided the results are strong.\n\nHowever, considering the trial completed enrollment in late 2025, we are unlikely to see full results anytime soon. The biotech will likely reveal those in 2027. Could we see an interim analysis in 2026? Maybe, but it's not clear. Viking Therapeutics is also running a phase 1 maintenance study for VK2735, testing daily oral, weekly oral, and monthly injection regimens in a small number of patients who have already achieved weight loss with VK2735.\n\nWhy is this important? Losing weight and keeping it off are two different things. Many GLP-1 patients regain much of what they lose, and drugmakers are increasingly developing strategies to help with that. If Viking can show that continuing VK2735, in a different formulation (oral) or at different intervals (monthly versus weekly), can help keep the weight off, that would be an interesting differentiator for the medicine.\n\nIt would take a lot for Viking Therapeutics' shares to jump by 175% this year. The maintenance study is unlikely to get it there, since phase 1 studies tend to prioritize safety and tolerability (things that won't significantly jolt the stock price even if they are strong) over efficacy. So, even if this maintenance study goes well, it won't help Viking's shares more than double this year.",

    "description": "The dispute began after the couple defended their right to heat palak paneer in a campus microwave.",
    "fullText": "A dispute that began over heating a dish in a microwave has ended with two Indian students winning a $200,000 settlement from a US university.\n\nAditya Prakash and his fiancee, Urmi Bhattacheryya, told the BBC they filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of Colorado, Boulder, after they faced a series of \"microaggressions and retaliatory actions\" following the microwave incident.\n\nThe harassment began, the lawsuit alleged, after a university staff member objected to Prakash heating up his lunch of palak paneer - one of northern India's most popular dishes, made of pureed spinach and paneer (considered an Indian equivalent of cottage cheese) - in a microwave on campus, because of the way it smelled.\n\nIn response to the BBC's questions, the university said it could not comment on the \"specific circumstances\" surrounding the students' claims of discrimination and harassment due to privacy laws, but added it was \"committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all students, faculty and staff regardless of national origin, religion, culture and other classes protected under US laws and by university policies\".\n\n\"When these allegations arose in 2023, we took them seriously and adhered to established, robust processes to address them, as we do with all claims of discrimination and harassment. We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.\n\nPrakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\"\n\nThe lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.\n\nSome have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.\n\nAnd it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.\n\nPrakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.\n\nPrakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months.\n\nIn May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a \"pattern of escalating retaliation\" against them.\n\nIn September, the university settled the lawsuit. Such settlements are usually arrived at to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles for both parties.\n\nAccording to the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to give the students their degrees but denied all liabilities and banned them from studying or working there in future.\n\n'Indian food is terrible' tweet sparks hot debate\n\nIn its statement shared with the BBC, the university added: \"CU Boulder's Anthropology Department has worked to rebuild trust among students, faculty and staff. Among other efforts, department leaders met with graduate students, faculty and staff to listen and discuss changes that best support the department's efforts to foster an inclusive and supportive environment for all.\"\n\n\"Individuals who are determined to be responsible for violating university policies preventing discrimination and harassment are held accountable,\" it added.\n\nPrakash says that this isn't his first brush with discrimination over food.\n\nWhen he was growing up in Italy, his school teachers would often ask him to sit at a separate table during lunch breaks because his classmates found the smell of his food \"off-putting\", he says.\n\n\"Acts like isolating me from my European classmates or stopping me from using a shared microwave because of how my food smells are how white people control your Indianness and shrink the spaces you can exist in,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that there is a long history of food being used to put down Indian and other ethnic groups.\n\n\"The word 'curry' has been conflated with the 'smell' of marginalised communities who toil in kitchens and peoples' homes and has been turned into a pejorative term for 'Indian',\" he says.\n\nBhattacheryya says that even someone like former Vice-President Kamala Harris isn't immune to being insulted over food.\n\nShe points to a 2024 social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer saying that if Harris became president, the White House \"will smell like curry\". Loomer has denied being racist.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context.\n\nDuring the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone.\n\nBhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the \"systemic racism\" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024.\n\nBelow the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, \"go back to India\", \"decolonisation was a mistake\" and \"it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know\".\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being \"othered\" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way.\n\nThey claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this.\n\nThey have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US.\n\n\"No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time. The precarity is acute and our experience at the university is a good example of this,\" Prakash says.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "fullText": "Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK will not yet be signing up to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.\n\nCooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but \"won't be one of the signatories today\" at a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nThe board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.\n\nCooper described the board as a \"legal treaty that raises much broader issues\" than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and critics say the board appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations.\n\nSome of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.\n\nThe UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.\n\nBut launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.\n\nTrump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".\n\n\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"\n\nTrump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\".\n\n\"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nPresident Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.\n\nBut the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.\n\nPutin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nLive: World leaders sign Trump's Board of Peace papers\n\nTrump to meet Zelensky as US envoy says ending war with Russia down to one issue\n\nPutin invited to join US-led Gaza 'Board of Peace', Trump says\n\nWho is on Trump's 'Board of Peace' overseeing Gaza's reconstruction?\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\n\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.\n\nBut she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.\n\n\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"\n\nShe said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".\n\n\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.\n\nBut Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.\n\nCooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.\n\nBut when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.\n\nAs talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are due to meet in Davos on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump repeated his often-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.\n\nTrump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.\n\nBut the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.\n\nThe text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".\n\nThe leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.\n\nThe charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.\n\nLast Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nMore have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nThe Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.",

Not only does it give your employer time to manage the transition and hire a replacement, but it also gives you plenty of time to get your personal finances in order.\n\nBut what happens if, shortly after you announce your retirement, your employer decides to show you the door ahead of your official end date?\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nIf you've already announced your retirement, it can be a frustrating and disorienting experience to suddenly get fired after years of service. It's also natural to wonder if your employer is breaking the law.\n\nSurprising as it may sound, your employer is not typically under any legal obligation to let you keep working once you’ve announced your plans to retire.\n\nAn AARP analysis of data examined by the Urban Institute and ProPublica from a Health and Retirement Study (HRS) report found that 13% of older workers entered retirement unexpectedly, which the researchers say suggests workers were likely forced out of their jobs (1).\n\nThat's because most states have at-will employment laws. An at-will employee can be fired at any time for any reason and without warning — no “just cause” required.\n\nBut you may have some legal recourse if you have evidence that your employer fired you to stop your pension from “vesting” or as a direct result of age-base d discrimination. These would violate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and you may have a case on your hands.\n\nYou have a few options if you're terminated before your official retirement date.\n\nYour company may offer severance pay as a way to get you to waive your right to file certain lawsuits against your former employer. Aim to negotiate the fairest possible severance package, including asking your employer to continue subsidizing your health coverage. Otherwise, you may be forced to get private health insurance to cover an employment gap.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) traded higher on Thursday as global risk sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump walked back his plan to impose new tariffs on European allies amid his push to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation (BTC-USD) rose about 1% over the past 24 hours to hover near $90,000 (£66,902), moving in tandem with equities in Asia and Europe. The broader cryptocurrency market cap climbed 2.7% to $3.18tn over the same period, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signalled a diplomatic shift on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying he would not pursue military action to acquire Greenland and had reached “the framework of a future deal” on the Danish territory with NATO allies.\n\nThe remarks injected fresh volatility into crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to an intraday low near $87,300 before rebounding back toward $90,000 as traders reassessed US trade policy risks and broader macro conditions. More than $625m in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated over 24 hours, split roughly evenly between longs and shorts across about 150,000 traders, according to Coinglass market data.\n\nAnalysts said the episode underscored how digital assets are reacting more directly to geopolitical and macro headlines.\n\n“Today’s sharp price swings highlight how closely crypto markets are tracking geopolitical and policy developments,” said Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, noting that Trump’s signals on Greenland negotiations and a pause on potential EU tariffs “briefly improved global risk sentiment, prompting a rapid rebound in bitcoin alongside US equities”.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance UK, Lin added that while the move was headline-driven, “they reflect a deeper shift in market structure”, describing bitcoin (BTC-USD) as “increasingly behaving like a macro asset, reacting to changes in policy expectations and broader risk appetite”.\n\nOver the longer term, she said, institutional participation is supporting bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) evolution as “a maturing and globally relevant asset class, even amid elevated volatility”.\n\nGlobal equities rallied as Trump withdrew his threat to impose additional 10% tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK, after receiving what he called the “framework of a future deal” in NATO discussions regarding Greenland.\n\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei gained nearly 2%, while South Korea’s Kospi broke above the 5,000 level for the first time. European markets opened higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.7% at the open.",

Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, called Spanberger “a Bond villain.”\n\nRepublican Arizona Congressman Abe Hamadeh posted on X that “What’s happening in Virginia should be a lesson to all Congressional Republicans. If Democrats regain power, they will unleash the most radical and transformative legislative agenda in our nation’s history.”\n\n“We won’t even recognize our country, and we may never get it back,” Hamadeh, who is known for introducing a bill that would mandate states only provide English-language voting ballots, claimed.\n\nSpeaking on Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News, Josh Holmes, co-host of the Ruthless podcast, said of Spanberger, “She’s there for a cup of coffee, and all of a sudden, we have a Communist manifesto in front of us. This is going fast and furious, but it is how Democrats govern, regardless of what they say.”\n\nConservative nepo-baby Meghan McCain came under fire for posting a photo of Spanberger during the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection attempt, during which she was wearing an emergency escape hood.\n\n“Virginia is f---ed,” the post, which she deleted, said.\n\n“Screw any and all of you who lied to low information voters and sold Abigail Spanberger as some kind of moderate,” McCain said in a follow-up post. “She’s been in office like 6 hours and is already trying to turn Virginia into Minneapolis.”\n\nOther MAGA figures went further with their criticism of Spanberger, firing off theories about the Democrat governor and calling for certain Virginia counties to secede.\n\nMichelle Maxwell, a self-described “Proud Virginia Constitutional Conservative,” claimed that the Democratic Party is “grooming” Spanberger to run for president and that she would be the “new Hillary.”\n\n“Being governor is just a stepping stone. So while everyone is distracted with Gavin [Newsom] she is the plan,” she posted to her more than 330,000 followers, adding “Spanberger is the country’s problem now&we better not take her lightly.”\n\nMaxwell also claimed that New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill, who is seen as comparable to Spanberger in terms of policies and demeanor, was also being groomed by the Democratic Party.\n\n“The fact that its 3 counties outside of DC that decide for the entire state should be grounds for the rest of the state to secede. We have no representation,” a producer for the far-right TimCast posted, adding, “Many aren’t even born in America. They’re trying to enshrine foreign control with that degradation of voting integrity.”\n\nThat claim was quickly slapped down as another user pointed out that even if Northern Virginia counties, where a significant portion of Virginia’s population lives, had not voted in the 2025 election, Spanberger still would have won the race.\n\nSpanberger beat her opponent, former Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, by over 15 percentage points, or more than 520,000 votes, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control in the commonwealth’s 2025 gubernatorial election.\n\nDespite their current outrage over Spanberger, Virginia Republicans heavily doubted Earle Sears’ candidacy, as she frequently unraveled during interviews, and Trump snubbed her in the high-profile race, withholding his endorsement.",

    "fullText": "A major, widespread winter storm will lash much of the South, Midwest and Northeast on Friday, Jan. 23 through Monday, Jan. 26 with heavy snow likely for tens of millions of people from New Mexico to New England, according to Weather.com.\n\n\"It’s not hyperbole to call this storm a monster,\" said Washington Post meteorologist Ben Noll on X on Jan. 21. \"At its peak on Sunday (Jan. 25), 55 percent of all people in the United States are forecast to simultaneously experience snow, sleet or freezing rain. That’s more than half the population, at the same time,\" he said.\n\nWidespread travel disruptions are likely across the country this weekend, according to AccuWeather. \"Icy and snow-covered roads could force highway closures lasting for hours,\" said Jonathan Porter, AccuWeather chief meteorologist, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Key east-to-west interstates that are critical for travel, commerce, and deliveries, including Interstates 20, 30, and 40, could experience closures around the same time, compounding challenges for travelers and supply chains.\"\n\nAs for snowfall totals, heavy snow of 6-12 inches is likely in the heart of the Plains, with over 2 feet possible in parts of the Appalachians, AccuWeather said in an online forecast.\n\nHow much snow falls in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will depend on the storm's exact track, but a significant and plowable amount − likely up to or over a foot − is possible.\n\nThe heaviest snow, potentially up to a foot, is expected across central Oklahoma on Friday, Jan. 23 and Saturday, Jan. 24, according to AccuWeather. Lesser amounts, likely 3-6 inches, will fall in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nIn Arkansas, there is a 30-50% chance of exceeding 6 inches of snow over central and northern parts of the state, the weather service said. In Tennessee, the highest probabilities for at least 6 inches of snow favor areas north of Interstate 40, the weather service said.\n\nSnow, sleet and ice could sink even a bit farther south in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, while it picks up in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia and parts of the Carolinas, said Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman in an online forecast.\n\nWintry precipitation will end in Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Mississippi Valley by midday Sunday, Jan. 25, but will persist from the Ohio Valley to the piedmont of Virginia and the Carolinas into the Northeast, according to Weather.com. Some areas of heavy snow are also possible in parts of the Ohio Valley.\n\nThe winter storm \"has the potential to bring widespread heavy snow to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast this weekend,\" according to Weather.com.\n\nMaps posted by Weather.com showed totals of as much as 2-3 feet of snow in southern Virginia, with widespread 1-2 feet across a wide swath of the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\"Latest model trends show the higher snow totals shifting north into Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. The heaviest snow looks to fall Saturday night, Jan. 24 into Sunday, Jan. 25, making travel difficult to impossible. Snow may even linger across New England on Monday Jan. 26, depending on where the storm is positioned,\" Weather.com said.\n\nUpdate 01/21/2026 AM forecast for Winter Storm Fern. This is the forecast at this point and it shifted north some. \n\nPlease understand this forecast will likely change again and for who gets what and how much but understand this will be a huge winter storm and if you live in… pic.twitter.com/kf0pf4jScK\n\n— Charles Peek (@CharlesPeekWX) January 21, 2026\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, \"confidence is high that a significant storm will occur, but not on specific details for the storm track, timing and precipitation amounts.

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nThe Suns entered Wednesday’s matchup coming off a 113-108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors on Monday. With rookies Rasheer Fleming and Khaman Maluach, along with two-way player Jamaree Bouyea, assigned back to the team, the Valley hoped the trio would provide the spark needed to get back on track.\n\nFleming and Maluach had been traveling with the Phoenix Suns throughout the six-game road trip, earning minutes whenever the team needed them. Bouyea is coming off concussion protocol and has not played since early January.\n\nHowever, Wednesday’s game allowed the rookies to flourish with increased playing time.\n\nOct 24, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers center Yanic Konan Niederhauser (14) defends Phoenix Suns center Khaman Maluach (10) in the second half at Intuit Dome.

Maluach added eight points and six rebounds but dealt with foul trouble, picking up three fouls before halftime. Bouyea struggled early but found a rhythm late in the half, finishing with nine points, two rebounds, and two assists at the break.\n\nDespite limited minutes, Bouyea’s strong finish to the first half suggested he was simply shaking off rust.\n\nThe Suns opened the second half on an 18-0 run, partly by Bouyea’s eight points. He finished the night with 27 points, while Fleming finished with 19 points and Maluach finished with 23.\n\nNov 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Rasheer Fleming (20) against the Houston Rockets at Mortgage Matchup Center.

Head coach Paul Jesperson acknowledged their earlier game struggles, especially Bouyea, as Wednesday was his first official night in a Valley Suns uniform.\n\n“We knew there was probably going to be a little fatigue there and a little bit of those guys just having to feel the game out a little bit as it progressed,” he said post-game. “I think [Bouyea] did exactly that. Kind of found his spots, got comfort level [and] got a little energy to him.”\n\nThe Suns finish out the week with a matchup against the Texas Legends on the road on Friday, Jan. 23, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWM Phoenix Open brings golf to streetwear with Samba shoe collab",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEver since the Nets decided to end an era in Brooklyn by trading away Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, the team has consistently been around the same area of the standings.\n\nThey're in lottery pick territory, but not quite top-pick territory, and it hasn't allowed them to get a breakthrough player that can put the franchise back on track.\n\nThey have some promising rookies from the most recent draft, but Wednesday night's game was a clear sign that the team has a lot to work on before they can even become a fringe playoff team.\n\nIn today's NBA, offense and pace are the name of the game.\n\nIt's common and frankly expected to see teams score north of 100 points each night, and it's almost shocking when teams fail to hit the century mark.\n\nThings were different even a decade ago, as defense, a slower pace, and an emphasis on the two-point shot were more prominent than they are now.

    "fullText": "Defending champion Madison Keys continues her Melbourne run, but not without a reminder of how quickly momentum can shift at a Grand Slam. The American booked her place in the third round of the AO with a 6-1, 7-5 win over compatriot Ashlyn Krueger, later opening up about the pressure and privilege that comes with returning as the titleholder.\n\nLast year, after her historic AO triumph, Keys admitted she would be lying if she said she never had doubts about whether she would ever have another shot at realizing her Grand Slam dream. She did it at 29. Now, a year later, it’s time to see if she can defend her crown in Melbourne. Her recent win against Krueger was her ninth consecutive win at AO. How does she feel to be back in Melbourne and continue her incredible winning streak? “It feels amazing being back as defending champion, and you know, I always had amazing memories here. It was my first SF of a Grand Slam here. So it felt very fitting to win my first Grand Slam here in front of all these amazing people.”\n\nMadison Keys admitted she loves coming to Melbourne, and to be able to lift that trophy last year was amazing. But coming to all the expectations surrounding her 2026 AO campaign, she added, “Everyone keeps asking if I’m gonna do it again – hopefully – but at the same time, that was such an amazing experience, and no one can ever take that away from me. So, whether or not I do repeat it, I still get to keep Daphne [the Australian Open trophy] at home.”\n\nEven earlier this week, after her 7-6(6), 6-1 win over Ukraine’s Oleksandra Oliynykova, Keys spoke about a wide range of topics. And one of them was, obviously, her title defense.\n\n“I was talking with Lindsay Davenport yesterday. She reminded me that few players get the chance to defend a Grand Slam title and that I should fully enjoy it. Despite my initial nerves, I’m thrilled to be back and to have won this match.”\n\nMadison Keys‘ love affair with Australia continues to deepen. She’ll now face the former world number one and a two-time finalist at the majors, Karolina Pliskova, in her next match. Pliskova’s best record at the AO has been reaching the SF in 2019. Both these players have faced each other only once before in their careers. It was at the 2020 Brisbane International where the Czech star took down Keys in a three-set thriller.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see who gets the edge in their second meeting on the Tour. But what did Keys say about her performance in the second-round match against Ashlyn Krueger?\n\nMadison Keys looked in complete control early on at John Cain Arena, racing through the opening set in just 23 minutes. She struck seven winners, converted all three break points, and barely allowed Krueger a foothold. But the match took a turn in the second set as the ninth seed fell behind 2-5, plagued by a string of double faults that handed the 21-year-old two service breaks.\n\nJust when doubts appeared to creep in, Keys responded with the calm authority of a champion. She reeled off five straight games, rediscovered her aggression, and closed out the contest in straight sets to keep her title defense on track.\n\n“I think I started really well, and Ashlyn started a little bit slow. And then I was fully expecting her to raise her level, which she did. It just kind of got away from me a little quickly. I just wanted to, even if I lost the (second) set, make sure I tried to get back in the set and try to figure out where my game kind of went and be able to get a few more points on the board. Once I kind of got back momentum, I just tried to sink my teeth into the set and do whatever I could to get back into it.”\n\nMadison Keys’ run at the AO last year included four wins over top ten seeds. Now, with the action coming thick and fast in Melbourne, fans are waiting to see how many she gets this year.\n\nWith confidence growing and perspective firmly in place, Keys appears determined to enjoy every step of her title defense. Whether the Melbourne story ends with another trophy or not, the defending champion is once again reminding everyone why Australia has always brought out the very best in her.\n\nThe post Madison Keys Admits Reality of Defending Her Australian Open Title After a Strong Start in Melbourne appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

They’re going to lose a lot of guys, but I trust Ohio State to be back in the Top 5.”\n\nLuckily for Pollack, every player he mentioned is projected to return to Columbus. The Buckeyes are only a year removed from winning a national title, so it certainly isn't out of the question for them to be back in the mix again this fall and for years to come.\n\nSimilar to other teams around the league, the Buckeyes are now trying to live up to the blueprint the Hoosiers have set for themselves after completing an undefeated season.\n\nEven though it's unclear if the Hoosiers can maintain this level of dominance, the Buckeyes certainly want to prove they can return to the top of college football.\n\nCome August, they'll have a clean slate to make it happen.

    "title": "Mets' trade for Freddy Peralta completes whirlwind week that changes offseason perception and outlook",
    "description": "In a span of a week, David Stearns reshaped the Mets roster into a contender with the signing of Bo Bichette and the trades for Luis Robert Jr. and Freddy Peralta.",
    "fullText": "From the depths of December to the jolt of activity over the last five days here in January, David Stearns turned a disappointing offseason into one that offers reason for even the most disgruntled fans to believe 2026 could be a good year, after all.\n\nWith the trade for top starter Freddy Peralta from the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday night, Stearns made what is likely to be his last high-impact acquisition of the winter, and in doing so obtained the top-of-the-rotation starter the Mets desperately need to be considered genuine contenders again.\n\nOn the heels of the signing of Bo Bichette and the trade for Luis Robert Jr., the Peralta deal completes a whirlwind week for Stearns that changes the perception of the offseason and presumably makes it safe for him to go out for dinner in the big city without being heckled by Mets fans.\n\nHey, I get it, there are still going to be fans out there who aren’t happy with Stearns, and to some degree Steve Cohen, for essentially cleaning house and allowing Pete Alonso and Edwin Diaz to walk away while also trading Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil.\n\nIn the case of Alonso, especially, it will be fascinating to see whether Stearns was right in choosing not to offer him more than a three-year deal, as well as how much the Mets will miss his power bat in trying to win a championship over the next few years.\n\nBut what’s more relevant at the moment is that, after a seemingly endless wait this offseason, at least Stearns made the big-splash moves that should ensure the Mets of being contenders next season. Actually, they should be talented enough to battle the Philadelphia Phillies and the Atlanta Braves for the NL East title if they get some key turnarounds from veteran pitchers to go with Peralta and Nolan McLean.\n\nSo why now? Why the sudden flurry of activity? Was it simply the market moving to an inevitable conclusion for the likes of Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger that led to the signing of Bichette and the trade of Robert Jr.?\n\nOr, to put it another way, was this always the plan, waiting to mid-January to throw huge money at the likes of Tucker and Bichette, or did the outrage of Mets fans over losing Alonso and Diaz reach such a crescendo that Cohen, in particular, decided he needed to react and flex his financial muscle to stem the tide?\n\n“Steve can certainly be reactive to situations like that,” said one person who knows Cohen on a personal level, more as the hedge-fund billionaire. “He’s very aware of public perception in everything he does.”\n\nSo it’s possible he ordered the Code Red, if you will, that finally jump-started the Mets’ offseason. Yet, to be fair, it’s also possible that the timing of the big moves coincided with Stearns’ plan to wait for the prices on both free agents and trades to fall enough to warrant sudden activity.\n\n“The offseason has a life of its own,” was the way an executive from another team put it Wednesday night. “I’d lean toward believing the Mets waited until they felt the time was right, and then one move leads to another move and so forth.”\n\nWhatever the impetus, the additions of Bichette, Robert Jr., and Peralta all filled important needs for the Mets and are impactful enough to make the case that the Mets now have a better team than they did before this offseason began.\n\nFor that matter, with Bichette being introduced at Citi Field on Wednesday, some 12 hours after Stearns swung the deal to gamble on Robert Jr.’s high ceiling in center field, Stearns decided to have a Michael Corleone kind of day and settle all family business of sorts by making the trade for Peralta on Wednesday night.\n\nAgain, why now? Was it because he decided Framber Valdez wasn’t going to settle for a high-AAV, three-year deal?\n\nWere the Brewers running out of suitors and thus lowered their asking price on Peralta?\n\n“The Mets weren’t giving up (Brett) Baty, I can tell you that,” one person close to the deal said. “That may have been a sticking point at least for a while.”\n\nWhatever, in giving up Brandon Sproat and Jett Williams, the Mets still paid a high price, considering they’re only guaranteed one year of Peralta, who can be a free agent next winter -- though they also received Tobias Myers, who should be a useful bullpen arm.\n\nAnd while it could give the Mets a chance to lock up Peralta to a long-term deal if he adapts to New York and is pitching well next season, he could also be something of an afterthought in that regard if the Mets decide they’re going all-in on Tarik Skubal.\n\nStill, I think Stearns made the right move. Jonah Tong has a higher upside than Sproat and was likely more desired by the Brewers, and while Williams is a blue-chip prospect, he doesn’t have anywhere to play in the Mets’ infield, where he is considered best-suited. Especially since the Mets see Baty as a valuable utility man, having proven athletic enough to play second base last season, even while blossoming into a very good third baseman.\n\nAnd finally, while Stearns surely was all business in making the trade, you couldn’t blame him if he has a soft spot for Peralta. In his first trade as Brewers GM, in December of 2015, Stearns dealt veteran first baseman Adam Lind to the Seattle Mariners for a package of young players, including Peralta, then a 19-year-old in rookie ball.\n\nHe was a lottery ticket then who paid big dividends for the Brewers, and now Stearns brings him to the Mets with high expectations. At age 29, turning 30 next June, Peralta is coming off the best season of his career, as he pitched to a 2.70 ERA and threw a career-high 176.2 innings over 33 starts.\n\nThat averages out to 5.1 innings a start, which is the only knock against him, according to one scout I spoke to.\n\n“His fastball is electric and he can dominate any lineup when he’s commanding his off-speed stuff to go with it,” the scout said. “But he needs to go deeper into games to really be an ace. He tends to be a little too fine at times and because of that, his pitch count elevates. But he’s also a guy you feel good about putting out to start a postseason game.”\n\nA week ago, many Mets fans were bracing for the worst next season, convinced Stearns’ value-driven approach would doom them to fourth place in the NL East.\n\nAnd there are still plenty of questions about the ’26 Mets, to be sure. But I have to believe most fans are now willing to give Stearns -- and Cohen -- credit for turning the offseason of dismay into at least some level of success.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea struggled past minnows Pafos last night in the Champions League, beating the Cypriot side 1-0 at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt wasn’t a great Chelsea performance as they struggled to break down a defence low block, and the first half was particularly poor from Chelsea in attack despite controlling the possession.\n\nIt needed a very late Moises Caicedo header for Chelsea to finally get the goal in order to go on and win the game, after they huffed and puffed all game long but to no joy.\n\nFans were complaining about the same thing they have seen time and time again under Enzo Maresca with inverted full backs, lack of overlapping full backs, and an isolated striker. It’s no different to watching Maresca’s Chelsea so far under Liam Rosenior, but perhaps even worse!\n\nBut thank god for Moises Caicedo hey? In the end he popped up to grab the crucial goal and stop any boos at the end of the game from the home fans.\n\nMoises Caicedo in Fulham draw. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nJoe Cole believes Caicedo is now Chelsea’s most important player and to be honest, I think he probably has been for a while now anyway. At least in terms of consistency and regular form, he’s been the best.\n\nCole told TNT Sports that he now thinks the honourof most important player at Chelsea belongs to Caicedo after watching him dominate in midfield against Pafos, as well as find the only goal.\n\nHe said: “He’s fast becoming the most important player at this club, and that £100m looks like a snip now.”\n\nA shout out for Enzo Fernandez as well, he is playing some consistent stuff lately and becoming very important for the team.",

Home court, recent form, and injury updates all play a role in shaping how these games may unfold. So, let’s have a look around each game of the night. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nOrlando enters this game with a strong home record. The Magic are 14-7 at home and sit near the top of the Southeast Division. Free throw scoring is their biggest strength. They lead the league with 22 made free throws per game, which often keeps them ahead late.\n\nCharlotte has struggled with consistency. The Hornets are 16-28 and have dropped multiple road games this season. Three-point shooting remains their main weapon, ranking third in makes per game. Defensive issues continue to hurt them, especially allowing high shooting percentages.\n\nOrlando’s defense limits perimeter shots well, allowing under 12 threes per game. That directly challenges Charlotte’s main scoring path. The Magic also hold an edge in recent form despite a rough loss to Memphis.\n\nPredicted winner: Orlando Magic\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nHouston has quietly been one of the better road rebounding teams. They lead the West in offensive rebounds, which helps offset shooting slumps. Even with key injuries, the Rockets control the glass well.\n\nPhiladelphia remains dangerous at home but has been inconsistent. Tyrese Maxey continues to carry the scoring load, averaging 30 points. Joel Embiid is listed day to day, which impacts interior defense and scoring balance.\n\nThe Rockets shoot nearly 48 percent from the field, which is slightly above what Philadelphia usually allows. Houston also comes into this game on a three-game winning streak, while the Sixers are hovering around .500 at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nWashington has one of the weakest defenses in the league. They allow over 123 points per game and struggle to contain efficient offenses. Home games have not helped much, as they remain below .500 in Washington.\n\nDenver has been excellent on the road. The Nuggets are 17-7 away from home and average over 121 points per game. Even with Nikola Jokic sidelined, Jamal Murray has stepped up in recent games.\n\nThe Nuggets already beat the Wizards earlier this month. That win came by six points and featured strong perimeter shooting. Washington has also dropped eight of its last ten games, which points to ongoing problems.\n\nPredicted winner: Denver Nuggets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center\n\nGolden State is on a four-game winning streak and scoring at a high level. Over the last ten games, the Warriors average more than 123 points per night. Ball movement and three-point volume remain elite.\n\nDallas has talent but remains injury-hit. Several key rotation players are out, including Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis. Cooper Flagg has played well, yet the Mavericks struggle defensively against strong shooting teams.\n\nGolden State already beat Dallas earlier this season by double digits. The Warriors also rank near the top in made threes per game, while Dallas allows one of the highest three-point totals in the West.\n\nPredicted winner: Golden State Warriors\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nMinnesota has been dominant at home with a 15-6 record. The Timberwolves score heavily in the paint and have multiple scoring options. Anthony Edwards continues to average close to 30 points per game.\n\nChicago scores well but struggles defensively on the road. The Bulls allow 120 points per game, which becomes a problem against high-tempo teams. Minnesota already beat Chicago by 35 points earlier this season.\n\nThe Timberwolves are also trying to stop a three-game losing streak. That adds urgency to their performance at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nSan Antonio has been one of the most balanced teams in the West. They move the ball well and rank high in assists per game. Victor Wembanyama continues to anchor both ends of the floor.\n\nUtah allows the most points in the league. Defensive issues remain a constant problem. Even after a strong scoring night from Keyonte George, the Jazz still struggle to close games.\n\nThe Spurs already beat Utah earlier this week by double digits. San Antonio also holds a clear edge in efficiency and defensive rating.\n\nPredicted winner: San Antonio Spurs\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nThis matchup remains tight every season. The Clippers won the last meeting by 15 points. Home court has helped them recently, winning three straight in Inglewood.\n\nThe Lakers rely heavily on Luka Doncic and LeBron James. They perform well in close games, staying undefeated in contests decided by fewer than four points. Injuries remain a concern, especially in the backcourt.\n\nThe Clippers score less overall but defend better at home. That balance explains the narrow line.\n\nPredicted winner: Los Angeles Clippers\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nPortland has won eight of its last ten games and plays well at home. Rebounding has been a major strength, led by Donovan Clingan. The Trail Blazers also limit opponent scoring better than earlier in the season.\n\nMiami struggles on the road with an 8-14 record. Shooting efficiency has dipped over the last ten games. Tyler Herro remains out, which reduces scoring punch.\n\nPortland already lost a close game to Miami earlier this season. Recent form suggests a different outcome this time.\n\nPredicted winner: Portland Trail Blazers\n\nJanuary 22 is packed with games that could quietly shift the standings. Some favorites look steady, while a few underdogs have enough momentum to keep things close. Home floors matter tonight, especially in Minnesota, Denver, and Orlando. Late games in Los Angeles and Portland may come down to execution in the final minutes. It is a slate where smart matchups matter more than big names.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 22: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Thanks to recent football and men’s basketball matchups which all resulted in losses, BYU fans have learned to really loathe Texas Tech.\n\nThus, Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.\n\nBYU scored a 73-61 upset victory over the No. 19-ranked Lady Raiders at the Marriott Center, toppling the Big 12’s top team for Lee Cummard’s first ranked win at the helm of the Cougars’ program.\n\n“I’m just really proud of the group and glad to see their hard work paying off and be rewarded for how close of a group it is, and how hard they work and prepare for these games,” Cummard told reporters after the win. “(We) had a great couple days of practice, great shoot around this morning. I just want (the players) to know that, you know, they’re a really good team and they’re rewarded for that tonight.”\n\nBYU trailed for less than a minute to open the night before quickly pulling ahead and never looking back, leading by as many as 17 points against a Texas Tech team that had yet to lose on the road and was 19-1 prior to arriving in Provo.\n\n“I felt like at least tonight, regardless of who they have, our five were more connected and tighter as a group, and we were the better five on the court,” Cummard said.\n\nThe Cougars shot a collective 47.3% from the field and 44.4% from 3-point range — a far cry from their previous season average of 29.7% — while feasting down low for 36 paint points.\n\nshots are fallin' ☔️\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/HaKZkEFic9\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\nBest exemplifying BYU’s fight was center Lara Rohkohl, who finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and a game-high plus/minus of +15, refusing to let the ultra-physical Lady Raiders push her around in the post.\n\n“They were a little aggressive down there, but you know, we stood against it and we did a good job down there,” Rohkohl said. “The guards were giving me perfect passes into my hands, and I just had to go up and finish it.”\n\nFeeding Rohkohl often was star sophomore point guard Delaney Gibb, who fought through double teams for 18 points, five rebounds and six assists while swiping four steals on the defensive end of the floor.\n\nAutomatic🔥\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/E5ruG3c7mP\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“I know that if I’m getting hounded and double-teamed, I can kick to shooters and pass to Lara and they’re gonna make plays out of it,” Gibb said. “And so I think we played super connected tonight and just moved the ball really well, which opened up great looks for us.”\n\nSome of that ball movement came from Rohkohl, who cashed in two assists by kicking outside to Gibb for a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nBullseye Delaney🎯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Dn4lsb6UJ6\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“Being in the paint and kicking out to a 3, in my opinion, is the best shot that there is,” Gibb said. “It’s really easy to make, all your momentum is going to the hoop. (Rohkohl) was fighting hard in the paint, and so for her to unselfishly spray out to shooters on the outside is never going to go unnoticed.”\n\nBYU’s leading scorer was freshman guard Olivia Hamlin, who put up the best performance of her young career — especially considering the competition — by posting 20 points of 9 of 15 shooting with four rebounds and two steals.\n\nEleven of Hamlin’s 20 points came in the first quarter to set the tone for the remainder of the contest, and she ended the night with six fourth quarter points to help bury Texas Tech for good.\n\n🤯🤯🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/XSatpyvczA\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“She was on it from the jump,” Cummard said of Hamlin. “... Tonight it was hard to keep her off the court. She was hugely impactful on the defensive end with those steals early, but even late, just with constant pressure.\n\n“People have a really hard time going around her, and people have a really hard time keeping her in front. (She is a) huge, huge asset to the group every game, but tonight she just brought it, you know, played with force and made plays for the group.”\n\nDefensively, BYU was outstanding, holding the Lady Raiders to 33.3% shooting and scoring 24 points off of 21 forced turnovers. The Cougars clamped down hardest in the fourth quarter, allowing just three makes on 16 field goal attempts.\n\nROBBED 'EM🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Jl3Aw4Ioyr\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“It was the most connected we’ve been all year defensively,” Cummard said. “We’ve been a pretty good defensive team, you know, visually, but also metrically speaking.\n\n“... I just thought that we minimized some of the lapses that we’ve had in some of our losses. ... It shows growth in what we’re doing, but just overall, the connectivity on that (defensive) end was really, really good as a group.”\n\nWith the win, BYU is now 15-4 on the campaign and has already matched last year’s mark of four victories in Big 12 play — a number Cummard’s Cougars will certainly increase given their 11 remaining conference contests, along with the newfound confidence from toppling a team such as Texas Tech.\n\n“I feel like we’ve had a pretty tough schedule thus far, and so it’s kind of like a breath of air (to win),” Gibb said. “I feel like this game is going to bring so much confidence to our team. We have a ton of young players, some of which this is their first year of college basketball, and so I think this kind of just reminds us that we can compete at the highest level. I think going into our next conference games, we’re going to be hungry to do the same thing every single night.”\n\nWIN CAM👐 pic.twitter.com/0H7qG1QNUo\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026",

    "description": "The concept of natsukashii permeates Japanese culture, from traditional alleyways in Tokyo to the popularity of stores selling film cameras.",
    "fullText": "The concept of natsukashii permeates Japanese culture, from traditional alleyways in Tokyo to the popularity of stores selling film cameras.\n\nDuring my childhood summers spent in Yokohama, Japan, my obaachan (grandmother) would take me on afternoon strolls through her neighbourhood and teach me the names of all the flowers we came across. The cicadas would shriek over her soft voice and the humidity would cling to my body like a second layer of skin. When we returned home, the two of us would cool off over ice-cold glasses of mugicha (barley tea). “Am I your favourite grandchild?” I would ask her. My obaachan would smile and whisper, “Yes.”\n\nMy obaachan passed away in April 2019, and last summer was my first one without her. Now the taste of mugicha takes me back to our precious summer strolls. “Natsukashii,” I always think as the taste hits my tongue.\n\nNatsukashii is a Japanese word used when something evokes a fond memory from your past. It’s a word you exclaim as a smile creeps across your face. For instance, when you hear a song you loved as a teenager, or when you come across an old train ticket stub in your pocket.\n\nIn some cultures, nostalgia is often full of sadness. But natsukashii – which derives from the verb “natsuku”, which means “to keep close and become fond of” – indicates joy and gratitude for the past rather than a desire to return to it. In Japan, natsukashii is a reminder that you are fortunate to have had the experiences you’ve had in life. The fact that you cannot return to those experiences makes them all the more poignant.\n\n• Is this the world's cleanest culture?\n\n• China's strange and baffling quirk\n\n• Why Japan values 'naked communion'\n\n“A positive frame put around longing is the essence of natsukashii,” said Christine Yano, professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii, whose research focuses on Japanese popular culture. “It’s part of the emotional foundation of Japan. A glass half empty is a glass that’s full and beautiful.”\n\n“I think in Japan, nostalgia has to do with an aesthetic,\" she continued. \"This is the aesthetic that sees beauty in imperfection, in something not being quite complete, in longing, in yearning, in evanescence, in impermanence, wistfulness, in melancholy. It is an aesthetic invested with emotion and beauty at the same time.”\n\nAesthetic concepts in the traditional Japanese arts were developed in pre-modern Japan. One of the earliest to emerge was wabi-sabi, a Japanese philosophy rooted in Buddhism that finds beauty in imperfection and impermanence; examples include deliberately misshapen bowls used in tea ceremonies and bonsai trees displayed even after they’ve shed their leaves. Yano suggests that Japan’s approach to nostalgia is akin to wabi-sabi – but it’s life, rather than objects, that’s being celebrated for its imperfections.\n\nSumie Kawakami, a writer who teaches liberal arts at the International College of Liberal Arts (iCLA) at Japan’s Yamanashi Gakuin University, echoes that sentiment. She describes natsukashii as a bittersweet form of reminiscing. “We miss the time – but it’s better that way,” she said.\n\nIn today’s digital age, people seem to be more obsessed than ever with nostalgia. But in Japan, paying tribute to the past goes far beyond sharing the occasional #ThrowbackThursday post on social media or binge-watching an ‘80s TV show reboot.\n\nOn any given night of the week, Tokyo businessmen can be found blowing off steam in yokocho, traditional alleyways containing bars and restaurants. These cramped, cash-only establishments surrounded by glowing lanterns and cigarette smoke are a portal to another era, as they were originally part of black markets that cropped up in the city following World War Two.\n\nAnd last summer, Japanese Twitter went wild after someone shared a video they made using an app that replicated the VHS camcorder recording quality of the 1980s. Tens of thousands of people rushed to find out what the app was (VHS Cam), then share their own videos using it.\n\n“It always surprises me, the degree to which natsukashii comes up,” Yano told me. “One could say, ‘Oh, that’s mainly for old people.’ But it’s amazing how quickly a young person becomes ‘old’ in terms of natsukashii. An 18-year-old may feel natsukashii for kindergarten days.”\n\nKawakami compares the sentiment to the English phrase \"the good old days”. \"But there may be a slight difference,\" she noted. \"When Japanese say 'natsukashii’, they want to confirm that togetherness, rather than simply being nostalgic to a particular event or person. [It's like] 'Yeah, we were together on this!'\"\n\nThe demand for natsukashii experiences is so strong throughout Japan that there are companies that specialise in creating them. In 2002, Masahito Itami founded Dousoukai Net, a company that organises reunions for alumni across the country. High school and university reunions are commonplace in many parts of the world, but Itami also runs events for former elementary school peers and co-workers from defunct businesses.\n\n“Even if it’s getting together with people you used to work with, there is a sense of intimacy and connection you get from being with the people who’ve shared the same experiences as you,” Itami explained. “Whether they’re good or bad experiences, they all blossom into great stories to look back on together.”\n\nYumi Hisano, an Osaka native who has attended not one, but four high school reunions organised by Dousoukai Net over the past 20 years, agrees.\n\n“It was so meaningful to meet with people I hadn’t seen since getting married and leaving Osaka,” she recalled of the first reunion, which got her hooked. “I wanted to hear their stories and find out how they’d lived since the glory days when so many possibilities lay before us.”\n\nJapan’s love affair with the past, however, goes far beyond people occasionally reuniting with their classmates. This is a culture where people actively seek out natsukashii experiences to add meaning to their lives. An important part to the start of the year is to send nengajo (New Year's greeting cards) to not only close family and friends, but to people they’ve encountered briefly in their lives.\n\nAnother nostalgic tradition falls on New Year’s Eve, when most Japanese stay at home and watch Kōhaku Uta Gassen, an annual TV special featuring musical performances. Even as the show increasingly focusses on contemporary pop idols, it always saves room for enka artists, who sing sentimental ballads about traditional Japanese life and are generally thought of as musicians for older generations. As Yano notes, “In Japan, the past is always kind of a constant hum.”\n\nThat hum even influences consumer behaviour. Despite Japan’s love for modern technology, Bellamy Hunt, a Tokyo-based British camera broker who goes by the nickname “Japan Camera Hunter”, has made a living tracking down, repairing and selling rare film cameras. He says that there’s even been a recent increase in demand for black-and-white film and darkroom rental services in the country.\n\n“To give you a sense of how popular film camera lifestyle is in Japan, there is a major national magazine called Film Camera Style, and it’s just really fancy pictures of [old] cameras and how they’re used and how to use them,” Hunt said.\n\nBut it’s not that the Japanese are shunning their smartphone cameras. Hunt says that about 90% of his clients live abroad, and that part of the reason they’re drawn to Japan is because the culture places such an emphasis on the past and its relics.\n\n“People here look after their stuff,” he said. “I think we’ve lost track of that in the West a little bit.” We’ve taken things for granted and not seen the true value of them.”\n\nThe concept of natsukashii is, ultimately, a reflection of how ingrained gratitude is as a value in Japanese society. The past, whether it’s full of joy or pain, is valuable. It is to be remembered and appreciated. It should comfort us. It should strengthen our relationships. As Kawakami told me, “Sharing something precious from the past can connect me, as a person, to others.”\n\nWeeks after my obaachan passed away, my family sifted through her belongings and found a small notebook containing beautiful sketches of flowers and trees. It also included meticulous notes about their characteristics.\n\n“Did you know that obaachan used to take me on walks in the summer and teach me the names of all the flowers?” I asked my mother after examining several of the journal entries.\n\nMy mother, who has an aversion to Japan’s relentlessly hot summers, replied in amusement, “Kurushisou [seems painful].”\n\n“It was. We would drink mugicha afterwards though,” I replied.\n\nMy mother laughed with delight. “Mugicha in the summertime!” she cried. “Natsukashii.”\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or \n\nIf you liked this story, com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

    "description": "Image by Carl Van Vechten, via Wikimedia Commons\r\n“How did Faulkner pull it off?” is a question many a fledgling writer has asked themselves while struggling through a period of apprenticeship like that novelist John Barth describes in his 1999 talk 'My Faulkner.' Barth “reorchestrated” his literary heroes, he says, “in search of my writerly self... downloading my innumerable predecessors as only an insatiable green apprentice can.” Surely a great many writers can relate when Barth says, “it was Faulkner at his most involuted and incantatory who most enchanted me.",
    "fullText": "“How did Faulkn­er pull it off?” is a ques­tion many a fledg­ling writer has asked them­selves while strug­gling through a peri­od of appren­tice­ship like that nov­el­ist John Barth describes in his 1999 talk “My Faulkn­er.” Barth “reorches­trat­ed” his lit­er­ary heroes, he says, “in search of my writer­ly self… down­load­ing my innu­mer­able pre­de­ces­sors as only an insa­tiable green appren­tice can.” Sure­ly a great many writ­ers can relate when Barth says, “it was Faulkn­er at his most invo­lut­ed and incan­ta­to­ry who most enchant­ed me.” For many a writer, the Faulkner­ian sen­tence is an irre­sistible labyrinth. His syn­tax has a way of weav­ing itself into the uncon­scious, emerg­ing as fair to mid­dling imi­ta­tion.\n\nWhile study­ing at Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­si­ty, Barth found him­self writ­ing about his native East­ern Shore of Mary­land in a pas­tiche style of “mid­dle Faulkn­er and late Joyce.” He may have won some praise from a vis­it­ing young William Sty­ron, “but the fin­ished opus didn’t fly—for one thing, because Faulkn­er inti­mate­ly knew his Snopses and Comp­sons and Sar­toris­es, as I did not know my made-up denizens of the Mary­land marsh.” The advice to write only what you know may not be worth much as a uni­ver­sal com­mand­ment. But study­ing the way that Faulkn­er wrote when he turned to the sub­jects he knew best pro­vides an object les­son on how pow­er­ful a lit­er­ary resource inti­ma­cy can be.\n\nNot only does Faulkner’s deep affil­i­a­tion with his char­ac­ters’ inner lives ele­vate his por­traits far above the lev­el of local col­or or region­al­ist curios­i­ty, but it ani­mates his sen­tences, makes them con­stant­ly move and breathe. No mat­ter how long and twist­ed they get, they do not wilt, with­er, or drag; they run riv­er-like, turn­ing around in asides, out­rag­ing them­selves and dou­bling and tripling back. Faulkner’s inti­ma­cy is not earnest­ness, it is the uncan­ny feel­ing of a raw encounter with a nerve cen­ter light­ing up with infor­ma­tion, all of it seem­ing­ly crit­i­cal­ly impor­tant.\n\nIt is the extra­or­di­nary sen­so­ry qual­i­ty of his prose that enabled Faulkn­er to get away with writ­ing the longest sen­tence in lit­er­a­ture, at least accord­ing to the 1983 Guin­ness Book of World Records, a pas­sage from Absa­lom, Absa­lom! consist­ing of 1,288 words and who knows how many dif­fer­ent kinds of claus­es. There are now longer sen­tences in Eng­lish writ­ing. Jonathan Coe’s The Rotter’s Club ends with a 33-page long whop­per with 13,955 words in it. Entire nov­els hun­dreds of pages long have been writ­ten in one sen­tence in oth­er lan­guages. All of Faulkner’s mod­ernist con­tem­po­raries, includ­ing of course Joyce, Woolf, and Beck­ett, mas­tered the use of run-ons, to dif­fer­ent effect.\n\nBut, for a time, Faulkn­er took the run-on as far as it could go. He may have had no inten­tion of inspir­ing post­mod­ern fic­tion, but one of its best-known nov­el­ists, Barth, only found his voice by first writ­ing a “heav­i­ly Faulkner­ian marsh-opera.” Many hun­dreds of exper­i­men­tal writ­ers have had almost iden­ti­cal expe­ri­ences try­ing to exor­cise the Oxford, Mis­sis­sip­pi modernist’s voice from their prose. Read that one­time longest sen­tence in lit­er­a­ture, all 1,288 words of it, below.\n\nJust exact­ly like Father if Father had known as much about it the night before I went out there as he did the day after I came back think­ing Mad impo­tent old man who real­ized at last that there must be some lim­it even to the capa­bil­i­ties of a demon for doing harm, who must have seen his sit­u­a­tion as that of the show girl, the pony, who real­izes that the prin­ci­pal tune she prances to comes not from horn and fid­dle and drum but from a clock and cal­en­dar, must have seen him­self as the old wornout can­non which real­izes that it can deliv­er just one more fierce shot and crum­ble to dust in its own furi­ous blast and recoil, who looked about upon the scene which was still with­in his scope and com­pass and saw son gone, van­ished, more insu­per­a­ble to him now than if the son were dead since now (if the son still lived) his name would be dif­fer­ent and those to call him by it strangers and what­ev­er dragon’s out­crop­ping of Sut­pen blood the son might sow on the body of what­ev­er strange woman would there­fore car­ry on the tra­di­tion, accom­plish the hered­i­tary evil and harm under anoth­er name and upon and among peo­ple who will nev­er have heard the right one;

    "description": "The vaccines are tailor-made to target each patient's unique cancer.",
    "fullText": "In a small clinical trial, customized mRNA vaccines against high-risk skin cancers appeared to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death by nearly 50 percent over five years when compared with standard treatment alone. That’s according to Moderna and Merck, the two pharmaceutical companies that have collaborated on the experimental cancer vaccine, called intismeran autogene (mRNA-4157 or V940).\n\nSo far, the companies have only reported the top-line results in a press release this week. However, the results align closely with previous, more detailed analyses from the trial, which examined rates of recurrence and death at earlier time points, specifically at two years and three years after the treatment. More data from the trial—a Phase 2 trial—will soon be presented at a medical conference, the companies said. A Phase 3 trial is also underway, with enrollment complete.\n\nThe ongoing Phase 2 trial included 157 patients who were diagnosed with stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma and were at high risk of having it recur after surgical removal. A standard treatment to prevent recurrence after such surgery is immunotherapy, including Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab). This drug essentially enables immune cells, specifically T cells, to attack and kill cancer cells—something they normally do. But, in many types of cancers, including melanoma, cancer cells have the ability to bind to receptors on T cells (called PD-1 receptors), which basically shuts the T cells down. Keytruda works by physically blocking the PD-1 receptors, preventing cancer cells from binding and keeping the T cells activated so they can kill the cancer.\n\nIn the trial, all 157 patients received Keytruda, a standard treatment. But they were randomized in a 2:1 ratio so that some would also get the customized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines were tailored specifically to each patient’s melanomas, carrying genetic instructions to build up to 34 unique markers of their mutated cancer cells. Once in the patient, healthy cells produce those markers and use them to train T cells to identify and attack the cancer cells.\n\nPrevious data from the trial reported that 107 participants received the mRNA vaccine and Keytruda treatment, while the remaining 50 only received Keytruda. At the two-year follow-up, 24 of the 107 (22 percent) who got the experimental vaccine and Keytruda had recurrence or death, while 20 of 50 (40 percent) treated with just Keytruda had recurrence or death, indicating a 44 percent risk reduction. The companies did not report the breakdown of the two groups in the press release this week for the five-year follow-up, but said the risk reduction was 49 percent, which is also what the companies reported for the three-year follow-up.\n\nAs for side effects, the companies reported that little had changed from previous analyses; adverse events were similar between the two groups. The top side effects linked to the vaccine were fatigue, injection site pain, and chills.\n\nThe results “highlight the potential of a prolonged benefit” of the vaccine combined with Keytruda in patients with high-risk melanoma,” Kyle Holen, a senior vice president at Moderna, said.\n\nThey also “illustrate mRNA’s potential in cancer care,” he said, noting that the company has eight more Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials going for mRNA vaccines against a variety of other cancers, including lung, bladder, and kidney cancers.\n\nMarjorie Green, a senior vice president at Merck, called the five-year follow-up data a “meaningful milestone” and “encouraging.”\n\n“[W]e look forward to late-stage data from the INTerpath clinical development program with Moderna, across a range of tumor types where significant unmet needs remain,” she said.\n\nWhile the top-line results appear positive, conclusions can’t be drawn until the full data from the trial are published. The vaccines are also being developed amid a political environment hostile to mRNA vaccines. Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has railed against mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, making false claims about their safety and efficacy. In August, Kennedy unilaterally canceled $500 million in grant funding for the development of mRNA-based vaccines against diseases that pose pandemic threats.",

    "description": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting...",
    "fullText": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting tidbit on a possible change in the company’s cloud strategy. Specifically, Mark Gurman says Apple and Google are discussing running the next-generation Siri models directly on Google’s servers, not Apple’s.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple is set to launch the first new LLM Siri features, using models running in Private Cloud Compute based on an older generation of Gemini. But the Siri chatbot coming in the iOS 27 cycle will apparently be based off the newer, smarter, Gemini 3 models. Running these latest-gen models seemingly requires higher performance servers than what Apple can deliver right now through its own Private Compute cloud infrastructure …\n\nAs such, Apple user conversations with the new Siri chatbot experience would be trafficked through Google’s (much larger) cloud infrastructure for every request.\n\nThat would represent a big departure philosophically for Apple, which talked up Private Cloud Compute as a way to extend the privacy bubble of the personal data on your iPhone into Apple’s cloud. However, the Private Cloud Compute idea was designed under a prior regime. When Apple was promoting Private Cloud Compute at WWDC 2024, it had not conceived needing to license Gemini models from Google at all.\n\nAs such, it’s not unthinkable that other elements of its AI plan may be in flux. While Apple would probably like to keep as much of its processing running on its cloud, rather than a third-party, the new heads of Siri — Craig Federighi and former Vision Pro exec Mike Rockwell — seem to be choosing practicality over idealism. There is clearly pressure to ‘catch up’ and deliver modern Siri features to users as soon as possible, even if that means reneging on some parts of their prior published vision.\n\nAfter all, the company was also previously downplaying the premise of a chatbot experience altogether, but plans change and Apple is clearly responding to the proven market success of services like ChatGPT. It’s also probably safe to assume that Apple would negotiate the Google cloud server arrangement such that sensitive user data is not logged or retained by Google, sufficiently siloed from Google’s advertising and data collection units.\n\nBehind the scenes, parts of iCloud have depended on providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform since its inception. These third-party data storage partners enable features like iCloud Photos to operate and scale, all the while Apple holds the encryption keys. Back in 2021, it was reported that Google’s cloud hosted an enormous 8 exabytes of iCloud content.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

John Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh went so far during his questioning to suggest that if the court found in Trump’s favor, it would mean the president could fire all independent agency officials “at-will” – ending the “for cause” legal requirement.\n\nKavanaugh argued “the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029 if there’s a Democrat president…then we’re really at-will removal.”\n\nBelow is a transcript of that exchange:\n\nKavanaugh: For present purposes, you accept the constitutionality of the for-cause removal provision for the Federal Reserve, and that is what protects the independence of the Federal Reserve. What, in your view, is the purpose of that independence?\n\nSauer: It protects the governors. Exactly reflecting the plain text of the statute, it protects the governors from removal for policy disagreement or for no reason at all.\n\nKavanaugh: What is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: To preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nKavanaugh: And what is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: Well, there are a number of reasons that are discussed by the amici, and I think not disputed by us, which is that there is, you know, a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of, you know, executive influence, and we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing in that statute. And again, we are not disputing the validity of the for-cause removal restriction here.\n\nKavanaugh: And why is that independence important in your view?\n\nSauer: We don’t dispute the importance of that for many of the reasons that the amici say, but we emphasize that there’s a balance struck here. This is not an ironclad “you can never be removed.” There is a cause removal authorization.\n\nKavanaugh: But on that, in your position that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines—that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve that we just discussed.\n Sauer: We disagree with that, and I would point to the point you made that this is a low bar for cause. In a sense, it’s a very high bar.\n\nIt is a very strong protection, because it does protect them from the one thing that Congress was apparently most worried about, which is—\n Kavanaugh: But it would be in the view of the president—the president who might have a policy disagreement—and there’s no judicial review, and the president can just define it on his or her own.\n\nSauer: One of the strongest traditions in this court’s jurisprudence is the sort of presumption of regularity to the president’s actions that has applied to this provision, I think, effectively for 112 years, and it continues to do so.\n\nKavanaugh: Let’s talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033. And then we’re really at at-will removal. So what are we doing here? What is—you know, we started—that’s why I started with what’s the purpose of the independence and the for-cause removal. If we accept all these—no procedure, no judicial review, no remedy—you know, that’s what’s going to happen, I think. And then where are we? So do you dispute that that is, you know, the real-world effect?\n\nSauer: I can’t predict what future presidents may or may not do, but the argument strikes me as a policy argument.\n\nKavanaugh: Well, history is a pretty good guide. Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides, and usually more the second time around. And I think that’s what we have to make sure we’re—again, that can’t drive the decision necessarily. We have to be aware of what we’re doing and the consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Kavanaugh Warns ‘What Goes Around Comes Around’ If Court Lets Trump Have ‘At-Will Removal’ Power first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A tasty invasive species population has exploded in the Chesapeake Bay area, and Maryland officials are encouraging people to add it to their diet.\n\nAccording to The BayNet, blue catfish have become a serious problem in Maryland's waters. Once believed to be just a freshwater fish, the species has proved to be resilient enough to inhabit saltwater as well.\n\nThe fish was introduced into Virginia's river systems in the 1970s for recreational fishing and to increase the food supply. However, by 2000, they were present in the Chesapeake Bay and the Patuxent and Potomac Rivers.\n\nIn 2024, an estimated 4.7 million blue catfish were harvested from the area, per the publication.\n\nBlue catfish prey on blue crabs, American eels, white perch, and almost anything else they can swallow, reminiscent of other ravenous invasive species, such as American bullfrogs. This harms the native ecosystems of the rivers and bay, depleting resources and pushing out local species.\n\nA 2025 study found that blue catfish consume thousands of pounds of blue crab annually, and they hunt them year-round. They also eat juvenile crabs that have yet to reproduce, further restricting the crab populations.\n\nBlue crabs are a staple food in Maryland, and more than a third of the country's blue crab supply comes from the Chesapeake Bay. Fishermen rely on them for their livelihood; people rely on them as a food source; the state relies on them as a cultural symbol.\n\nMany other species in these bodies of water also prey on the crabs. When blue catfish hoard them, other species suffer from food shortages.\n\nBut there's a silver lining. Since the species are overrunning the rivers and bay, people are strongly encouraged to buy or catch them, and eat them.\n\nBoth commercial and recreational fishermen can, potentially by law soon, go all out on reeling them in. It also means fried catfish and other catfish dishes should be on everyone's menu.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nBranson Williams, the invasive fishes program manager and freshwater biologist with the Department of Natural Resources, told The BayNet, \"We're fortunate that blue catfish taste good. … They're a mild, white-fleshed fish, and there's definitely a market for them.\"\n\nInvasive species are destructive and must be mitigated. Thankfully, controlling this species means plenty of fish for everyone, helping the local economy and ecosystems at the same time.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "\"It's a really important opportunity for sheep farmers.\"",
    "fullText": "Sheep farmers in Britain are finding an unexpected lifeline through solar grazing, where flocks feed on grass growing under energy panels, reported the Guardian.\n\nThe arrangement works like this: solar installations need the vegetation under their panels controlled. Traditionally, operators spend up to $67,000 per year on mowing and herbicide treatments.\n\nSheep do the job for far less. Unlike heavy machinery, the animals can access tight spaces and keep working regardless of weather conditions.\n\nFor farmers, the deal is even sweeter. Many solar operators offer grazing rights at no cost, opening doors for producers who would otherwise be priced out of the industry.\n\nHannah Thorogood, who started her Lincolnshire farm from scratch, has experienced this firsthand.\n\n\"When I first started out, 18 acres and 20 sheep was as much as I could afford,\" she told the Guardian. \"Now, because I can graze this land for free, I have 250 acres and over 200 sheep. Solar grazing has given me a massive leg-up.\"\n\nUK sheep populations have hit record-low numbers as producers face rising input costs, volatile markets, and shrinking margins. Free grazing access gives struggling farmers room to expand without shouldering land expenses.\n\nDr. Liz Genever, who farms in southeastern Lincolnshire, grew her flock threefold after gaining access to nearby solar land.\n\n\"If I could increase my flock to the full potential offered by the local solar site, I could potentially increase my income from sheep from £20,000 to £60,000,\" she told the Guardian. \"It's a really important opportunity for sheep farmers.\"\n\nGrazing sheep enrich the soil and encourage a wider variety of plants to grow, and they eliminate the need for chemical treatments. Solar sites offer added security through on-site cameras, and the panels themselves block harsh sun and winter storms for the animals below.\n\nIf you live near a solar installation with grazing programs, connecting with local operators could open doors for your own agricultural ambitions.\n\nIf you were to install home solar panels, which of these factors would be your primary motivation?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Jeff Bezos' space venture, Blue Origin, has unveiled a satellite network aimed at challenging Elon Musk's SpaceX dominance in orbit.",
    "fullText": "Jeff Bezos has unveiled his plans for a massive satellite network, mounting a direct challenge to Elon Musk's grip on internet infrastructure in orbit.\n\nThe project, called TeraWave, would deploy 5,408 satellites into orbit to serve data centers, governments, and businesses worldwide, Bezos's space venture, Blue Origin, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nLaunches are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027.\n\nTeraWave is designed to deliver \"data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second anywhere on Earth,\" enabled by advanced optical communications between satellites, the company said.\n\nThe network is \"optimized for enterprise, data center, and government customers\" and would serve up to 100,000 customers, it added.\n\nThe announcement comes after Bezos' other company, Amazon, rebranded its consumer satellite network Leo in November. Formerly known as Project Kuiper, the initial constellation design includes more than 3,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites providing standard broadband service.\n\nThe launch of TeraWave raises the stakes in a billionaire-led fight over space-based internet infrastructure. Starlink, led by Elon Musk, dominates the field with roughly 10,000 satellites in orbit. The subsidiary project of SpaceX targets consumers, businesses, and governments, and serves more than 6 million users globally.\n\nIn a reply to an X user on Monday, Musk said \"Starlink space to ground laser links will exceed this,\" referring to the data speeds touted by TeraWave.\n\nSpaceX has also begun laying the regulatory groundwork to scale its satellite operations. In a January filing with the US Federal Communications Commission, the company said satellite systems should be treated as essential infrastructure for future wireless networks as the US seeks to maintain leadership in next-generation space-based services.\n\nBeyond internet access, the satellite race is increasingly tied to the future of computing, as tech leaders point to satellite networks as potential infrastructure for future data centers in space.\n\nResponding on X to an article about building data centers in space, Musk said in October that \"simply scaling up Starlink V3 satellites, which have high speed laser links would work.\"\n\n\"SpaceX will be doing this,\" he added.\n\nMusk has also discussed the idea internally. During an xAI all-hands meeting in December, he said he sees data centers eventually moving off Earth, raising the possibility of space-based facilities that could be operated by Tesla Optimus robots, people with knowledge of the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nJeff Bezos has voiced a similar long-term view, predicting that data centers could shift to space within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November that the concept may sound \"crazy,\" but \"when you truly step back and envision the amount of compute we're going to need, it starts making sense and it's a matter of time.\"",

    "description": "Ukrainian interceptors on the market can typically fly at speeds of up to 200 mph, but they'll need to be faster to catch Russia's newer Gerans.",
    "fullText": "As the Ukraine-Russia drone arms race rages, hobbyists far from the war are pushing the limit for how quickly these small quadcopters can fly.\n\nA father-son duo in South Africa set a new Guinness World Record by reaching a ground speed of 408 mph with their custom, battery-powered remote-controlled quadcopter, the Peregreen V4.\n\nLuke and Mike Bell performed the record-breaking flight on December 11, 2025, the Guinness World Records organization said in a statement in January.\n\nWhile drones built for war are constrained by additional factors, the Bells' achievement expands the possibilities of how these devices might one day perform on the battlefield.\n\nIt also lays bare how accessible new war-relevant technology is becoming for civilians. The Bells documented their design and build process on YouTube, filming themselves using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts to create the Peregreen V4.\n\nTheir drone's design features a dome-shaped head and four propellers extending from the lower body — much like many of the interceptor drones available on the Ukrainian market today.\n\nThese drones, developed primarily as a low-cost way of countering Russian Shahed-type loitering munitions, have become a pillar of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nSome of the fastest interceptors available to Ukrainian forces can reach 200 mph, which is also the typical velocity of a bullet train.\n\nUkrainians are trying to push their quadcopters to fly even faster. Flight speed is key for these interceptors because they're designed to chase and crash into Shaheds, and Russia has been continually ramping up the speeds of its attack drones.\n\nThe Geran-2, a Shahed-type drone that Russia launches more commonly, can carry an explosive warhead for hundreds of miles at top speeds of 115 mph. Newer, jet-powered versions of Shaheds are estimated to fly up to 230 mph in some conditions.\n\nA major issue with faster drones is that their components tend to overheat when pushed to the limit — whether it's the propeller motors, wiring, or batteries.\n\nIn their YouTube videos, the Bells repeatedly recorded their drone or its individual parts catching fire during tests.\n\nDrone makers also have to juggle other design factors, such as the drone's aerodynamics and propeller efficiency.\n\nUkrainian war manufacturers face additional constraints: Their drones need to carry an additional payload — often 200 grams to 1 kg of explosives. They must also be maneuverable enough to pivot and catch a flying enemy target, and be mass-produced.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was already producing 1,000 interceptor drones a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bells' flight record involved a single drone that flew largely in a straight line.\n\nThe duo's latest certification is the third time they've attained the fastest-drone record. The previous holder of the achievement was Australian drone maker Ben Biggs, who built a drone that reached 389 mph late last year.\n\nBefore Biggs' record, the Bells' earlier quadcopter, the Peregreen V3, had flown at up to roughly 363 mph in the summer of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the pair set a record of 298 mph with a similar drone design.\n\nGuinness World Records requires aspiring drone record-breakers to fly their device in two opposing directions and then calculate the average speed to account for wind.",

    "description": "The Big Four firm is giving its US employees a new job title, according to an internal presentation seen by Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "In the consulting industry's era of AI upheaval, even job titles aren't safe.\n\nThe Big Four firm Deloitte is rolling out a sweeping overhaul of how it refers to its US workforce and introducing a new class of leader.\n\n\"All professionals will receive a new title that we will start to use internally and externally on June 1, 2026,\" said a presentation shared with employees during a meeting on Wednesday morning, which Business Insider has seen.\n\nDeloitte plans to tell employees their new job titles on January 29, before they take effect at the start of the firm's next financial year in June.\n\nThe meeting, hosted by Mo Reynolds, Deloitte US's chief people officer, was held for the consulting division, but the changes apply to all Deloitte's US divisions, the presentation said. Deloitte had 181,500 employees in the US as of May 31, 2025.\n\nThe firm also announced a new leadership role during Wednesday's meeting.\n\nCurrently, the most senior titles at the firm are partners, principals, and managing directors — known as PPMD. Starting in June, a role titled \"leaders\" will join the group, according to the presentation.\n\n\"We are modernizing our talent architecture to provide a more tailored experience reflective of our professionals' broad range of skills and the work they do,\" a Deloitte spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe overhaul of titles comes as Deloitte and its peers face existential questions posed by AI in the consulting industry. The technology is changing what it means to be a consultant, affecting long-held talent structures, pricing models, and the work that clients want from their consultants.\n\nIn the internal presentation, Deloitte frames the changes as a necessary modernization for a changing market.\n\nAfter a slide titled \"why now?\" the firm explains that its current talent architecture is \"outdated\" and unable to \"support our business of tomorrow.\"\n\nThe current structure was designed for \"a more homogenous workforce of 'traditional' consulting profiles,\" according to the presentation. \"But so much has changed.\"\n\nDeloitte's workforce and business have grown, employees are seeking more tailored talent experiences, and \"our clients are demanding new skills and capabilities,\" the presentation said.\n\nDay-to-day work, leadership, and the firm's \"compensation philosophy\" will all stay the same, according to the presentation.\n\nConsultants at Deloitte have traditionally followed a progression path of analyst, senior analyst, consultant, senior consultant, manager, and senior manager, before promotion to the top echelons of the firm.\n\nUnder the new system, these titles will become more specific and include reference to a \"job family\" and \"sub-family,\" which are another new feature introduced in the talent overhaul.\n\nIn an example from the presentation, an employee with the current job title of \"senior consultant\" could become \"senior consultant, functional transformation,\" \"software engineer III,\" or \"project management senior consultant\" on June 1.\n\nInternally, employees will also be assigned an alphanumeric reference to indicate their job level, such as L45 for what is currently a senior consultant and L55 for current managers.\n\nThese more specific titles will \"drive greater clarity and market relevancy,\" according to the presentation.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Federal prosecutors charged a man with wire fraud, alleging a \"Catch Me if You Can\"-reminiscent scheme.\n\nUS Attorney Ken Sorenson said in a Tuesday press release that a Canadian man was charged over allegations that he pretended to be a pilot and a flight attendant to get hundreds of free trips.\n\nAccording to court documents, 33-year-old Dallas Pokornik from Toronto was arrested in Panama earlier this month and extradited to the US.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty Tuesday after being arraigned in federal court in Hawaii, where he was indicted last October on wire fraud charges. A magistrate judge ordered him to remain in custody.\n\nPokornik's public defender did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe indictment filed at the District Court of Hawaii alleged that Pokornik worked as a flight attendant for a Toronto-based airline from 2017 to 2019. After leaving the job, prosecutors alleged he used fake employee identification from that carrier to obtain tickets reserved for pilots and flight attendants on three other airlines.\n\nThe indictment also alleged Pokornik \"used and presented a false and fictitious identification\" as a current pilot or flight attendant to claim travel benefits typically offered to airline staff when seats are available.\n\nProsecutors alleged in the complaint that the airline companies are based in Honolulu, Chicago, and Fort Worth, Texas, but did not name them. They also did not name the Toronto-based airline they alleged he worked for.\n\nRepresentatives for Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nProsecutors also said Pokornik at times requested access to the cockpit \"jump seat,\" which is generally reserved for off-duty pilots, trainees, or inspectors. Court filings do not indicate whether any of those requests were granted, and the US Attorney's Office did not comment.\n\nThe indictment includes two counts of wire fraud tied to tickets issued in Hawaii in 2024. If convicted, Pokornik could face up to 20 years in prison, fines of up to $250,000, and supervised release.",

Living alone in Cape Town, South Africa, I was holding out for a partner and children while my friends moved through weddings and baby showers without me.\n\nMy parents and sisters (including my twin) lived in another province, freelance writing work was drying up, and as 40 approached, I felt stuck — single, lonely, and unsure what came next.\n\nSo I made a deal with myself: If the picket-fence dream hadn't happened by 40, I'd leave. I didn't have a family of my own, but I had freedom, English, and nothing to lose. I packed up my life and accepted a yearlong EFL teaching job in Vietnam.\n\nI took a one-way flight to a city I'd never heard of in a country I'd never visited.\n\nVietnam's humidity, population density, and traffic overwhelmed me. In Haiphong, the industrial port city in northern Vietnam that I now call home, foreigners are rare, and not many locals speak English. Some older locals don't take kindly to outsiders, so I had a few terse encounters with taxi drivers and traders.\n\nBut after three months, the adventure took hold. I went from living and working alone to having housemates, socializing the way I had back at university, learning a new language, and connecting with kids and teens.\n\nWhen COVID hit halfway through my contract, some younger coworkers left, many were urged by their parents. I stayed.\n\nIn my time here, I've seldom been lonely. I'm surrounded by younger expat friends who are mostly single. I started a book club and a foodie club. There are daily moments of laughter across language divides with strangers.\n\nBeing a middle-aged woman with no husband or children is an anomaly here, but becoming \"Teacher Dee\" has helped me put aside some of the sadness of being childless — not by choice, but by circumstance.\n\nI've gone from lamenting not having children to being surrounded by them. Neighborhood children shout \"Helloooo!\" as they whizz past on their bikes. In shops, parents nudge their kids to practice English with me. I get happy high-fives from spunky students.\n\nEarly on, I often directed my interior monologue to my twin sister, narrating my new life to her in my head. These days, I connect with other South African friends who feel similarly torn. We even support our country during rugby matches, something I rarely did back home.\n\nVietnam has been good to me. I've gained teaching experience, become more sociable, and feel less financially stressed.\n\nNow, nearing seven years of what began as a \"break\" from life back home, I'm contemplating what's next. Friends and family often ask, \"When are you coming back?\" The question looms larger as I edge closer to 50.\n\nHome is no longer one place, but two. I pay for storage in Cape Town while accumulating more than I can fit into two suitcases in Haiphong. I exist in a constant state of longing for one place while living in the other.\n\nI miss the nature, familiarity, and diversity of Cape Town, but I know I'd grieve the freedom, safety, and financial security I've found here. People say, \"It'll always be there, waiting.\" I worry instead, \"Has that door closed?\"\n\nI panic at the thought of missing all that's uniquely Vietnamese — a place that pulses with energy and possibility. Life spills out through open front doors, down alleys, onto sidewalk stools, into food markets and coffee shops, and onto the backs of zippy scooters. Most of all, I'd miss the people — especially the children.\n\nI see myself eventually settling back in Cape Town, but not yet. For now, I'm betwixt and between — juggling two career paths, with my head and heart stretched across continents.\n\nAfter enough time abroad, returning can feel as daunting as leaving once did. My belongings are split between two homes, and so am I.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad? Contact the editor at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Granted New Zealand citizenship last year, James Cameron says part of the country's appeal is that it 'believes in science.'",
    "fullText": "James Cameron says he had talked about moving to New Zealand for years before finally following through in 2020.\n\nOn Wednesday's episode of \"In Depth with Graham Bensinger,\" the filmmaker said he first fell in love with the country in the '90s, but the US response to the pandemic ultimately pushed him to make the move.\n\n\"I went to New Zealand for the first time in '94. I was on my way to the South Pole, and we wound up getting stuck there because the flights were grounded because of ice conditions,\" Cameron, 71, told podcast host Graham Bensinger.\n\nThe flight delay gave him time to explore the Christchurch area, and he ended up falling in love \"with the country, the scenery, the people, the kind of way of life there,\" he said.\n\n\"I made myself a promise. I'm going to come live here someday,\" he said.\n\nCameron added that when he and his now-wife, Susie, were first getting serious, she was also open to the idea of eventually moving to New Zealand. However, life got in the way as they went on to have kids and settled down in Malibu and Santa Barbara.\n\n\"That conversation, you know, had to be amended slightly, but we did say, you know, after 'Avatar,' let's make this happen,\" Cameron said.\n\nThe couple bought a farm in New Zealand in 2011 and spent years traveling back and forth between the two countries.\n\n\"We were shooting in New Zealand. We came back for Christmas, then COVID-19 hit, and we didn't get back down there,\" Cameron said. \"So then I had to move mountains to get our production unit back up and running in New Zealand, and we just decided at that point in time that it was time to make the move as a family.\"\n\n\"This is why I love New Zealand. People there are, for the most part, sane as opposed to the United States,\" he said, pointing to what he described as stark differences in attitudes toward vaccines and public health.\n\n\"Are you kidding me? Where would you rather live?\" Cameron said. \"A place that actually believes in science, and is sane, and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody's at each other's throats, extremely polarized, turning its back on science, and basically would be in utter disarray if another pandemic appears?\"\n\nWhen Bensinger said New Zealand had beautiful natural landscapes, Cameron replied, \"I'm not there for the scenery. I'm there for the sanity.\"\n\nIn February, the filmmaker told New Zealand outlet Stuff that the US under Donald Trump was \"a turn away from everything decent.\"\n\n\"There's something nice about the New Zealand outlets — at least they'll put it on page three. I just don't want to see that guy's face anymore on the front page of the paper. It's inescapable there, it's like watching a car crash over and over and over,\" he said.\n\nCameron was granted New Zealand citizenship in August, a spokesperson for the filmmaker told The New Zealand Herald.\n\nHe isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has left the US for political reasons.\n\nRosie O'Donnell said in a TikTok video in March that she moved from the US to Ireland with her youngest daughter just days before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country,\" she said. \"And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that's when we will consider coming back.\"\n\nDuring a July public appearance at a theater in the UK, Ellen DeGeneres said she and Portia de Rossi moved to England following the 2024 election results.\n\n\"We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, 'He got in.' And we're like, 'We're staying here,'\" she said, per the BBC.",

    "fullText": "Lululemon's founder said the athleisure company's recall of its sheer \"Get Low\" leggings was a \"new low\" for the brand.\n\nChip Wilson, Lululemon's founder and former CEO, said in a Wednesday LinkedIn post that the pullback of the leggings was a \"total operational failure,\" and the fault of the company's board.\n\n\"I've believed that Lululemon has lost its cool for some time, but it is now evident to me that the Company has completely lost its way as a leader in technical apparel,\" Wilson said on LinkedIn.\n\nHe slammed the board, calling them inexperienced and shortsighted.\n\n\"It is clear that persistent failures like this are born out of this Board's lack of experience in creative businesses, disinterest in product development and quality, and focus on short-term, self-interested priorities,\" Wilson said.\n\nLululemon said in a statement to Bloomberg on Wednesday that the collection was still available in stores, but its online sales had been temporarily paused because of guest feedback.\n\nThe recall took place less than two years after its \"Breezethrough\" product line was pulled from the market in July 2024, following customer complaints about unflattering seam lines.\n\nAnalysts took note of the \"Get Low\" recall.\n\n\"LULU's withdrawal of a new legging line underscores ongoing execution issues in its core and raises further concerns about the durability of its innovation engine and premium positioning,\" Jefferies analysts wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\nLululemon's stock price is down about 10% over the past five days and has dropped more than 50% over the past year.\n\nHowever, Lululemon had another sheer leggings fiasco more than a decade ago, when Wilson was still on the company's board.\n\nIn 2013, Lululemon recalled 17% of all its pants for being too sheer. At that point, the company blamed the manufacturing error on an incomplete testing protocol.\n\nThis is not the first time Wilson has publicly criticized the brand since he left the company's board in 2015.\n\nHe slammed the company's succession plan after CEO Calvin McDonald, compared its trajectory to a \"plane crash\" and a \"sinking ship.\"\n\nIn December, he launched a proxy fight to shake up the company leadership. As the largest shareholder, he nominated three new board members of his choosing.",

    "description": "The Microsoft CEO said current competition is intense, but that's not a bad thing.",
    "fullText": "The AI race doesn't need to be a zero-sum game, says Satya Nadella.\n\nOn an appearance of the \"All-In\" podcast recorded in Davos on Wednesday, the Microsoft CEO said current competition is intense — but that's not a bad thing.\n\n\"The way I always think is it's always helpful when you have a complete new set of competitors every decade because that keeps you fit,\" he said. He added, \"It's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.\"\n\nNadella said that when he joined the computer giant in 1992, Novell, a Utah-based software and services company, was the \"big, existential competitor\" Microsoft had.\n\nNovell's dominance declined in the late 1990s, and it was acquired in 2011.\n\nNadella said that the tech industry as a whole will continue to dominate economically.\n\n\"At the end of the day, when I look at it as a percentage of GDP, five years from now, where will tech be? It will be higher,\" he said, referring to gross domestic product. \"So we're blessed to be in this industry. It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum as some people make it out.\"\n\nNadella said that his approach is a different take on Peter Thiel's advice. He said Microsoft avoids competition by understanding what customers really want from the company rather than treating everybody like a competitor.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO's embrace of competition matches the approach one of his predecessors, Bill Gates, and top rival, former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, took toward competition.\n\n\"Competition is always a fantastic thing, and the computer industry is intensely competitive,\" Gates said in a 2005 interview. \"Whether it's Google or Apple or free software, we've got some fantastic competitors, and it keeps us on our toes.\"\n\nJobs famously shifted his perspective on competition after returning to Apple in 1997. He went from dismissing Microsoft's taste and originality to saying that Apple needed to focus on its own success rather than Microsoft's failure.\n\n\"If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose,\" he said at the 1997 Macworld Expo.",

    "description": "Subaru's decision is part of a broader industry trend.",
    "fullText": "Subaru has unveiled a new all-electric vehicle that could help lower the barrier to EV ownership for drivers on a budget.\n\nAccording to CarScoops, the automaker confirmed that its 2026 Uncharted crossover will be in U.S. dealerships early next year with a starting price of $34,995, making it the most affordable EV Subaru has ever offered.\n\nThat price places the Uncharted well below Subaru's current electric model, the Solterra, and undercuts several competing compact EVs.\n\nIt's part of a broader industry trend, as more automakers roll out lower-cost electric and hybrid models in response to rising consumer demand for EVs.\n\nThe entry-level Uncharted Premium FWD is also the brand's first front-wheel-drive vehicle sold in the U.S. in decades.\n\nThe 74.7-kilowatt-hour battery is paired with a 221-horsepower electric motor, delivering an estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge. Fast-charging allows the battery to jump from 10% to 80% in less than half an hour, making longer trips more practical.\n\nInside, the Uncharted features a streamlined cabin with a 14-inch touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, heated front seats, and Subaru's EyeSight driver-assistance suite.\n\nFor drivers, the benefits of making your next car an EV are compelling. EVs cost far less to fuel than gas-powered cars and require less routine maintenance since there are no oil changes, spark plugs, or fuel systems to worry about.\n\nThey also run quietly and produce no tailpipe pollution, helping improve local air quality and public health.\n\nCharging at home can be cheaper than relying on public chargers, saving drivers hundreds of dollars per year. Companies like Qmerit help homeowners install Level 2 EV chargers with free, instant installation estimates.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nPairing your EV with rooftop solar can boost those savings even further by reducing electricity costs. If you're interested in exploring solar options, check out our Solar Explorer to compare vetted installers and save up to $10,000.\n\nMeanwhile, services like EnergySage help simplify the process by connecting homeowners with competitive solar quotes.\n\nCommenters were mostly excited about the reveal.\n\n\"This EV move is right for them because making Boxer engine forever and Nissan transmissions don't cut it anymore,\" one said.\n\n\"It looks great and the Toyota sibling got very good reviews in Europe....very capable and very well fit and finish,\" added another.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "description": "Wilson was convicted of the 2019 murders of Kristine Melton and Diane Ruiz",
    "fullText": "Wade Wilson killed Kristine Melton and Diane Ruiz in October 2019\n\nWilson confessed his crimes to his biological father, who alerted authorities\n\nWilson and the murders are the focus of the Paramount+ docuseries Handsome Devil: Charming Killer\n\nIn June 2024, Wade Wilson was found guilty of killing two women within hours of each other in Cape Coral, Fla.\n\nWilson — who has been referred to as the “Deadpool Killer” because of their shared name — already had a few run-ins with the law by that point. But he escalated to murdering on Oct. 7, 2019, when he killed Kristine Melton, 35, in her sleep and Diane Ruiz, 43, on the street while on the way to her job.\n\n“The evidence showed both murders were heinous, atrocious and cruel,”  20th Judicial Circuit Court Judge Nicholas Thompson said during Wilson’s 2024 sentencing hearing in Florida. “And that the second murder was cold, calculated and premeditated.”\n\nNow, Wilson’s crimes and the subsequent online attention are explored in the Paramount+ docuseries Handsome Devil: Charming Killer. The three-part show, which premiered on Jan. 20, investigates why Wilson committed the murders and how his mugshot spurred an online frenzy.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Wade Wilson’s crimes and arrest.\n\nWilson was born to teenage parents in Florida on May 20, 1994, according to The News-Press. He was adopted by a couple named Steve and Candace Wilson shortly after and was raised in Tallahassee, where he attended Chiles High School, Newsweek reported.\n\nDuring Wilson’s murder trial, his biological father, Steven Testasecca, testified that the pair reconnected when Wilson was 18 and remained in “sporadic” contact, per The News-Press.\n\nPrior to his conviction in Melton and Ruiz’s murders, Wilson amassed a criminal record by the time he was in his 20s, including for offenses including burglary and battery.\n\nIn early 2019, about nine months before his arrest for the murders, his ex-girlfriend accused him of stealing her laptop and cellphone, kidnapping and raping her.\n\nHowever, they were under a no-contact court order and authorities ultimately chose not to investigate the kidnapping and rape allegations, according to The News-Press.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 2019, Wilson killed Melton and Ruiz within hours of each other in separate incidents.\n\nMelton was living and working as a waitress in Cape Coral, Fox 4 reported. After meeting Melton at a local Fort Myers bar the night prior, Wilson returned home with her, where he later strangled her to death in her sleep, according to the outlet. Wilson then stole Melton’s car and fled the scene.\n\nWhile driving around, Wilson spotted Ruiz walking to work and stopped to ask for directions. A mother of two and engaged to be married, Ruiz was working as a bartender at a local Cape Coral eatery.\n\nAfter luring her into his car under false pretenses, Wilson beat and strangled Ruiz before pushing her out of the vehicle and running her over multiple times, according to USA Today.\n\n“This case was about killing for the sake of the killing,” Assistant State Attorney Andreas Gardiner said during the closing arguments of Wilson’s trial in June 2024, per Fox 4. “Strangulation is the epitome of life slipping through someone’s hands.”\n\nWilson was arrested on Oct. 8, 2019, after confessing to the murders in a series of phone calls with his biological dad, Testasecca, The News-Press reported.\n\n\"The first time, he said he needed help. He had done something that he couldn’t take back,\" Testasecca recalled, per Fox 4. \"There was two people gone that would not be back. He said I'm a killer.\"\n\nAfter Wilson described the murders and aftermath, Testasecca contacted authorities and alerted them to his son’s confessed crimes. He then convinced Wilson to surrender \"peacefully.\"\n\nFollowing a lengthy trial, Wilson was found guilty by a Florida jury in June 2024.\n\nHe was convicted of six charges, including battery, burglary and two counts of first-degree murder, according to USA Today. In August 2024, he was subsequently sentenced to death.\n\nAfter Wilson was found guilty, Cape Coral Police Chief Anthony Sizemore released a statement regarding the Ruiz and Melton families’ reaction to the verdict.\n\n“This afternoon in the Lee County Courthouse, I sat with the families of Diane Ruiz and Kristine Melton as the verdict was read: Wade Wilson was found guilty on all counts,” Sizemore said. “The families expressed to me their gratitude for the hard work of our team.”",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 21 (Reuters) - China rejected speculation on Wednesday that it would compete for influence in the West as a U.S. bid to ​take control of Greenland threatens to reshape the power dynamics of a ‌decades-old transatlantic security alliance.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from Denmark has rattled ‌NATO members and prompted a rethink of Europe's traditional security dependence on the United States.\n\nAsked if Beijing welcomed the \"chaos\" over Greenland, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry, told a regular news briefing, \"We have no intention of competing for influence with ⁠any country, nor would we ‌ever do so.\"\n\nTrump has also threatened to rain trade tariffs on Europe if it resists his demand to acquire the Arctic ‍island.\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, cautioned that transatlantic tariffs would play into the hands of China and Russia, both of which would benefit from \"divisions among allies\".\n\n\"We engage in friendly ​exchanges with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and equality, ‌and remain committed to being a positive, stabilising and constructive force,\" Guo said.\n\nYet Chinese state media did not hold back comments this week, urging Europe to reassess its dependence on the United States for security.\n\nEurope has grown excessively dependent on the United States while sidelining cooperation with partners such as China and Russia, the Global ⁠Times tabloid backed by the ruling Communist Party ​said in an editorial.\n\n\"The situation underscores the necessity ​for Europe to review the nature of transatlantic relations and reduce its reliance on the United States as a pillar of support for ‍its security,\" an ⁠editorial in the state-run China Daily added.\n\nThe Greenland crisis is a call for Europe to bolster strategic autonomy and diversify partnerships, it said.\n\n\"By doing so, Europe ⁠can ensure that its future is not dictated by the diktats of a bully, but is instead ‌shaped by its collective interests.\"",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico sent 37 cartel members to the United States at the request of the U.S. Justice Department, with President Claudia Sheinbaum saying Wednesday that it was a “sovereign decision” by her government.\n\nSheinbaum responded to criticism from analysts and opponents who said that the transfers on Tuesday were the result of mounting pressure from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action on cartels.\n\nSheinbaum said that although the transfers were made at the request of the U.S. government, the decision was taken by the National Security Council after analyzing what was “convenient for Mexico” and in terms of its “national security.”\n\n“Mexico is put first above all else, even if they ask for whatever they have to ask for. It is a sovereign decision,” she said at her regular morning news briefing.\n\nSheinbaum, who has been praised for her level-headed management of relations with Trump, has been forced to walk a fine line between making concessions to the Trump administration and projecting strength both domestically and internationally.\n\nObservers say that the Mexican government has used the transfers as a sort of pressure valve to offset demands by Trump and show authorities are cracking down on criminal groups. Tension has only mounted since the U.S. carried out a military operation in Venezuela to capture then President Nicolás Maduro to face charges in the United States in an extraordinary use of force that set leaders across Latin America on edge.\n\nThose sent to the U.S. on Tuesday were alleged members of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, known by its Spanish acronym CJNG, and the Sinaloa Cartel, which Washington has designated as terrorist organizations, and a number of other groups. It’s the third such transfer of capos over the past year. Mexico’s government said it has sent 92 people in total to the U.S. in total.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday said that the transfer was a “landmark achievement in the Trump administration’s mission to destroy the cartels.”\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said that the move was an “important step” by Mexico's government and that collaboration was in both countries' shared interest.\n\n“These 37 cartel members — including terrorists from the Sinaloa Cartel, CJNG, and others – will now pay for their crimes against the American people on American soil,” Bondi said in a statement with other U.S. Justice Department officials.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had already indicted at least one of the people transferred, Armando Gómez Núñez, who was accused of being a senior leader of CJNG. He is charged with drug offenses and the possession of weapons like machine guns and “explosive devices.”\n\nIn August, Mexico's security minister acknowledged that some of the cartel leaders sent to the United States at that time were continuing criminal operations from prison and that their transfer was agreed upon because there was a risk they could be released because of judicial rulings.\n\nMatthew Lee contributed to this report from Washington.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "Forecasters say it could be one of the most significant winter events this season.",
    "fullText": "A major winter storm is forecast to bring heavy snow, sleet, freezing rain and frigid temperatures from Texas to Massachusetts through the weekend, according to meteorologists. It’s expected to affect more than 180 million Americans and could become one of the most significant storms of this winter season.\n\nMajor metro areas in the storm’s path include Dallas, Austin, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, forecasters say.\n\nImpacts from the snow and ice could cause power outages, widespread travel shutdowns and school closures. Following the storm, frigid temperatures will prolong the impacts of the snow and ice. “Potentially hundreds of thousands of people may go without electricity and heat for days,” AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter said.\n\nWinter storm watches have been issued for at least 70 million people from New Mexico to North Carolina and as far south as Texas, according to the National Weather Service. The agency advises people to “start preparations now for an impactful and prolonged winter storm.”\n\n“Expect heavy snow for the Southern Rockies and the south-central Plains eastward through the mid-Atlantic,” the weather service said. “Snow-covered roads and low visibility will cause widespread travel disruptions.”\n\nIn the Central Plains, 6 to 12 inches are forecast, with over 2 feet possible in parts of the Appalachians. Snow totals in the Northeast will depend on the storm's exact track, but a significant and plowable amount is possible, meteorologists say.\n\n“Broad swaths of freezing rain and sleet are expected south of the all-snow zone over the Southern Plains, Mid-South and Carolinas,” the NWS said. “Treacherous travel conditions, prolonged power outages and tree damage are likely.”\n\nIn the South, a thick glaze of ice will sweep across Texas to the Carolinas, which will weigh down trees and power lines.\n\nThe Plains will be impacted by snow, sleet and freezing rain by late morning or early afternoon, according to the Weather Channel. This includes parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and northern and western Texas and could extend as far east as western Tennessee and northern Mississippi.\n\nSnow, sleet and freezing rain could dip farther south in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi while the storm heads toward the Northeast, affecting Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and parts of the Carolinas.\n\nMore than 4,000 flight cancellations are to be expected nationwide this weekend due to the heavy snow and ice buildup, according to AccuWeather. School closures are also likely across multiple states as the storm lingers in some areas.",

    "description": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.",
    "fullText": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.\n\nTrump spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday after he spent weeks demanding that Denmark hand over Greenland. The president cited “national security” reasons even though a 1951 treaty allows the U.S. to expand its military presence on the island, where it already maintains a base.\n\nIn his address, Trump said he wants “right, title, and ownership” of the territory. Afterward, the president announced he and European leaders had arrived at a “framework” and a “concept of a deal” regarding Greenland. He gave no specifics, but conservative commentators hailed the mystery agreement as the stuff of a modern-day Metternich.\n\nOn Wednesday’s AC360, Haberman said signs indicate that the deal in question is “something that is already in existence.”\n\n“So, Maggie, is it clear to you what, if anything, President Trump is getting from Denmark in Greenland that the U.S. doesn’t already have de facto control over?” Anderson Cooper asked.\n\n“No. And look, Anderson, we don’t know the answers to these questions,” Haberman replied. “There’s a lot left unsaid. The president didn’t answer this.”\n\nHaberman went on to say that based on what little information has been provided about the “framework,” it appears to be a reflection of the preexisting arrangement among the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland.\n\n“As of now, based on what they’re talking about, it looks as if they’re talking about something that is already in existence,” she continued. “And in fact, the U.S. used to have a greater military presence in Greenland. It got scaled back after the Cold War.”\n\nShe noted that in his Davos speech, Trump maligned NATO and questioned if it would ever come to the defense of the U.S. In fact, the only time NATO’s collective defense provision was invoked was on behalf of the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n“Article 5 [of the NATO treaty] was invoked once, and it was after 9/11,” Haberman said. “And someone who is from New York, it’s surprising that they don’t recall that. And so, he is speaking about this completely in transactional terms. And you can see that this is not over. I understand that [NATO Secretary-General] Mark Rutte is trying to calm things down, but European leaders are still very alarmed. And leaders in Denmark have been very alarmed for weeks and weeks now before this really became much more public.”\n\nThe post Maggie Haberman Says Trump’s Greenland ‘Deal’ Appears To Be ‘Something That Is Already in Existence’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A woman has been found guilty of keeping another woman with learning difficulties captive for 25 years and using her as a slave.\n\nMother-of-10 Mandy Wixon made the vulnerable woman clean her squalid and overcrowded home in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and forced her to live off scraps.\n\nWashing-up liquid would be squirted down the victim's throat, bleach splashed on her face, and she had her head repeatedly shaved against her will.\n\nAt Gloucester Crown Court, Judge Ian Lawrie said there was a \"Dickensian quality\" to the case as Wixon was found guilty of false imprisonment, requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\n\nThe BBC has only now been able to report details of the case due to reporting restrictions.\n\nThe court heard that the woman - who the BBC is calling K - was born into a troubled family and, when she was about 16 in 1996, was given to Wixon, who had a loose connection to her family.\n\nNow in her 40s, K was found by police on 15 March 2021 after one of Wixon's sons raised concerns for her welfare.\n\nThe court heard K was regularly beaten and also hit with a broom handle, knocking out her teeth.\n\nHer food was limited by Wixon and she could not leave the house and was forced to secretly wash at night.\n\nOfficers described K's bedroom as looking like a \"prison cell\", with other bedrooms also untidy and dirty.\n\nAt times, there were at least 13 people living in the house.\n\nLike many in the home, K had lost many of her teeth due to poor dental hygiene.\n\nWhen she was discovered by police, she had scarring to her lips and face from being splashed with bleach, and large calluses on her feet and ankles from being constantly on her hands and knees cleaning floors.\n\nK told officers: \"I don't want to be here. I don't feel safe. Mandy hits me all the time. I don't like it.\"\n\nDoctors found the victim was malnourished, while a dentist noted she would have been in agony for years due to untreated infections and abscesses.\n\nDet Sgt Alex Pockett said: \"When the police arrived, the victim had her head held down, it was clear she was extremely scared.\"\n\nSam Jones, prosecuting, told the jury: \"By the late 1990s it appears the woman disappeared into a black hole. Not a single meeting that left a record or a single sighting of her outside the house.\"\n\nSince being rescued, K is now living with a foster family, attending college and has been on holidays abroad.\n\nWixon was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on 12 March.\n\nAs she left court she was asked what she had to say to her victim and replied: \"Not a lot.\"\n\nAsked if she was sorry, she said: \"No. I never done it.\"\n\nReporters asked if she was a \"monster\", as she stopped to light a cigarette, and she replied: \"Say what you think.\"\n\nSince being rescued, K is now living with a foster family, attending college and has been on holidays abroad.\n\nDet Con Emma Jackson from Gloucestershire Police said she was \"flourishing\" and living a healthy life.\n\nLaura Burgess, a senior prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, added: \"The progress she has made since being removed from this oppressive environment is a testament to her strength.\n\n\"Our thoughts remain with her as she continues to rebuild her life, and I hope she can find some comfort in seeing justice delivered today.\"\n\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "fullText": "Joe Walsh rocked the stage for the grand opening show in 2012.\n\nOver the years, Luke Combs, The Lumineers, Trey Anastasio of Phish and countless other rock, country and metal acts also captivated audiences there.\n\nBut almost a decade and a half after its debut, the Revolution Concert House and Event Center is on its way to closing in Garden City. That revelation from owner Creston Thornton — made on his Facebook page — is the result of an expansion to Meridian.\n\nThe Revolution Concert House is moving — to a new, modern facility at 1170 S. Silverstone Way in Eagle View Landing, city documents show. It will be near Topgolf and three hotels, and have access to over 1,000 shared parking spaces, Thornton wrote on social media.\n\nThe original Revolution venue, 4983 N. Glenwood St., will remain open “while we build the next generation and final home for the Revolution Center,” Thornton posted. Construction has not begun on the Meridian project known as Revolution 2.0.\n\nThornton, a longtime Eagle resident who co-founded The Big Easy in 2000 — now called the Knitting Factory Concert House in downtown Boise — is the president of promoter Live Nation’s mountain region.\n\nLike Garden City’s Revolution Concert House, the new Meridian venue will have a capacity of 2,200: 1,900 in the main concert area downstairs, Thornton wrote, and 300 upstairs in a VIP area with reserved seats on three levels.\n\nThere also will be a 120-capacity “Box Office bar” open daily and for smaller shows, he added.\n\nHiring for the new Revolution Concert House is expected to begin in the third quarter of this year, according to Thornton.",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — In two decades of kicking in doors for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Joseph Bongiovanni often took on the risks of being the “lead breacher,\" meaning he was the first person into the room.\n\nOn Wednesday, he felt a familiar uncertainty awaiting sentencing for using his DEA badge to protect childhood friends who became prolific drug traffickers in Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I never knew what was on the other side of that door — that fear is what I feel today,” Bongiovanni, 61, told a federal judge, pounding the defense table as his face reddened with emotion. “I've always been innocent. I loved that job.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo sentenced the disgraced lawman to five years in federal prison on a string of corruption counts. The punishment was significantly less than the 15 years prosecutors sought even after a jury acquitted Bongiovanni of the most serious charges he faced, including an allegation he pocketed $250,000 in bribes from the Mafia.\n\nThe judge said the sentence reflected the complexity of the mixed verdicts following two lengthy trials and the almost Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of Bongiovanni's career, in which the lawman racked up enough front-page accolades to fill a trophy case.\n\nBongiovanni once hurtled into a burning apartment building to evacuate residents through billowing smoke. He locked up drug dealers, including the first ever prosecuted in the region for causing a fatal overdose.\n\n“There are two completely polar opposite versions of the facts and polar opposite versions of the defendant,” Vilardo said, assuring prosecutors five years behind bars would pose a considerable hardship to someone who has never been to prison.\n\nDefense attorney Parker MacKay noted the judge had acknowledged Bongiovanni as a “beacon” of the Buffalo community. The government's request for a 15-year sentence, he added, was “completely unmoored to the nature of the convictions.”\n\n“As Mr. Bongiovanni told the judge at sentencing, he is innocent, and we look forward to continuing to work with him to prove that,” MacKay told The Associated Press.\n\nA jury in 2024 convicted Bongiovanni of four counts of obstruction of justice, counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's “little dark secret” caused immeasurable damage over 11 years. They likened him to Jose Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent serving a 12-year federal sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels.\n\nBongiovanni upheld an oath not to the DEA, they argued, but to organized crime figures in the tight-knit Italian American community of his North Buffalo upbringing. During sentencing, Bongiovanni’s family dissolved into tears on the front row of the packed courtroom in downtown Buffalo.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's corruption involved as much inaction as calculated coverup. They pointed to a turning point in 2008 when Bongiovanni could have acted on intelligence about traffickers he knew whose operation would evolve into a large-scale organization with links to California, Vancouver, and New York City.\n\nHe also was accused of authoring bogus DEA reports, stealing sensitive files, throwing off colleagues, outing confidential informants, covering for a sex-trafficking strip club and helping a high school English teacher keep his marijuana-growing side hustle. Prosecutors said he brazenly urged colleagues to spend less time investigating Italians and focus instead on Black and Hispanic people.\n\n“His conduct shook the foundation of law enforcement — and this community — to its core,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi told the judge. “That's what a betrayal is.”\n\nThe ex-agent's downfall came amid a sex-trafficking prosecution that took sensational turns, including an implicated judge who killed himself after the FBI raided his home, law enforcement dragging a pond in search of an overdose victim and dead rats planted outside the home of a government witness who prosecutors allege was later killed by a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\nIt also involved the Pharoah’s Gentlemen’s Club outside Buffalo. Bongiovanni was childhood friends with the strip club’s owner, Peter Gerace Jr., who authorities say has close ties to both the Buffalo Mafia and the violent Outlaws Motorcycle Club. A separate jury convicted Gerace of a sex trafficking conspiracy and of paying bribes to Bongiovanni.\n\nThe prosecution also cast a harsh light on the DEA after a string of corruption scandals prompted at least 17 agents brought up on federal charges over the past decade. Last month, prosecutors charged another former agent with conspiring to launder millions of dollars and obtain military-grade firearms and explosives for a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nFrank Tarentino, the DEA’s northeast associate chief of operations, said Bongiovanni’s sentence “sends a powerful message that those who betray their badge will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”",

    "description": "Atleti pick up just one point in Turkey.",
    "fullText": "Atlético Madrid’s horrid away form continued Wednesday, as the Rojiblancos now have won just one of their last five away matches in the Champions League. Atlético squandered a golden opportunity to all but secure a top eight-position in the final Champions League table. “Squandered” may actually be an understatement based on what I witnessed. If you can think of more extreme adjectives to describe the performance, feel free to drop them in the comments.\n\nAtletii looked far and away the better side for the first hour of the match. Giuliano Simeone was rewarded for his relentless energy and effort with a lovely headed goal, Marc Pubill kept Victor Osimhen firmly in his pocket, even while playing on a yellow card for most of the match, and the midfield played with cohesion and confidence. Los Colchoneros were unfortunate to concede an own goal that deflected in off Marcos Llorente. The Spaniard ultimately redeemed himself, however, clearing away a wide open chance for the Turkish club in the dying moments that would have seen Atleti return to Madrid empty handed.\n\nLet’s dive into some takeaways.\n\nYou could make the argument that Atleti’s chances of finding a winning goal ended the moment Robin Le Normand replaced Pablo Barrios. Over the course of the 2025 26 season, it has become abundantly clear that Barrios is Atlético Madrid’s most important player, and the match changed entirely once he left the pitch.\n\nThe decision to remove Alexander Sørloth for the final 30 minutes while continuing to send long crosses toward the 5’9” pairing of Antoine Griezmann and Álex Baena was head scratching, to say the least. With Julián Alvarez enduring a slump in form, Atléti are unfortunately reliant on Sørloth to consistently generate goal scoring chances.\n\nAnd with Alvarez, it is becoming glaringly obvious that he is not anywhere close to the level he showed last season. However, substituting him for a still-recovering Nico González is simply not a sound tactical decision. Alvarez has been poor, but he remains Atlético Madrid’s best attacking option. In a situation where a goal is needed, you have to live and die with La Araña.\n\nWhen you’ve built your attacking system around a very limited #9 your problems run very deep. https://t.co/lJ2AiOZmHT\n\n— Into the Calderón (@intothecalderon) January 21, 2026\n\nBetween the poor form of Baena and Alvarez, the growing dependence on Sørloth, Thiago Almada failing to become the signing many had hoped for and prime Griezmann feeling like a distant memory, Atlético Madrid have a serious problem in attack.\n\nToday’s match saw Baena and Almada turn in uninspired 45-minute halves. The former has struggled to find his place in the team over the past several months, while the latter continues to be linked with a move away from the club.\n\nWith Baena, the quality is clearly there, and it is hard to believe that two unfortunate injuries earlier in the year suddenly stripped him of it. Prior to donning the red and white stripes, Baena ranked among the league leaders in chance creation. Simeone simply cannot seem to unlock that same style of play for him. The flashes are there, but time is starting to run out and Atleti need answers.\n\nAlmada possesses excellent skill on the ball, but the fundamentals are lacking. The signing did not make much sense at the time and was met with mixed reviews from supporters, despite the player’s obvious talent. Personally, I do not see a clear path forward for the Argentina international.\n\nOn the topic of Argentines, Julián Alvarez has extended his goalless games streak to seven. We’ve talked about this countless times on this website. The world is starting to take notice. What can be done to pull Julián out of this slump?\n\nMy admittedly-novice take is that Simeone appears to be deploying Alvarez in more of a 10 role rather than the 9 position where La Araña is most comfortable. The intent seems to be for Alvarez to replicate the late 2010s Antoine Griezmann role, when the Frenchman was competing for Ballon d’Or honors and Atlétic0 were challenging for LaLiga and Champions League trophies. Perhaps a tactical adjustment could see Baena drop into the 10 role, a position in which he truly excels. Simeone needs to explore every option.\n\nI laugh as I type this, but Alexander Sørloth has become Atlético Madrid’s primary attacking option, and the club has grown far too dependent on the Norwegian, particularly during Alvarez’s slump. In the first five matches of 2026, Atléti have scored just five goals. Who has accounted for four of them? You guessed it.\n\nBarring a masterful Griezmann free kick against Deportivo La Coruña, that tally very easily could have been four goals in four matches and an elimination from the Copa del Rey. Sørloth is a fine player who has shown his quality, but he cannot be the main option if Atlético Madrid expect to compete for trophies.\n\nLos Colchoneros currently sit 12th with 13 points in the Champions League table. A win against Galatasaray would have seen them climb into the top five. The top eight is far from guaranteed at this stage, even with a victory against Bodø/Glimt.\n\nWhat are the scenarios in which Atlético qualify for the top 8? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nFirst, Atlético Madrid need to win their match against Bodø/Glimt to reach 16 points.\n\nA win by multiple goals is a necessity, as Atlético have just a plus-3 goal difference after seven matchdays.\n\nFour teams from the group PSG, Newcastle, Chelsea, Barcelona, Sporting and Manchester City will need to lose or draw. PSG face Newcastle, which guarantees at least one drop, possibly two if they draw.\n\nChelsea clash with Napoli, Barcelona face Copenhagen, Sporting take on Athletic Club and Manchester City play Galatasaray.\n\nNapoli, Copenhagen, Athletic, and Galatasaray all have Champions League play-off qualifying positions to fight for.\n\nAre Atlético out of contention for the top 8 in the Champions League? Absolutely not. Is it going to be easy? Absolutely not. Is anything with this team ever easy? Absolutely not.\n\nNext up for Atlético Madrid is an early afternoon Sunday kickoff at home against Mallorca, who are battling relegation.",

Tate would be an intriguing addition to an offense that already boasts a star receiver in Malik Nabers, and those two could cause matchup nightmares for opposing defenses.\n\n\"The Giants have a lot of needs, but similar to Tennessee, they have a second-year quarterback looking for help,\" Kiper wrote. \"Yes, wide receiver Malik Nabers (knee) and running back Cam Skattebo (ankle/leg) will be back on the field, but wideout Wan'Dale Robinson is a free agent, and Nabers can't be the target on all of Jaxson Dart's throws.\n\n\"Taking a first-round wide receiver wouldn't be new to recently hired coach John Harbaugh; in Baltimore, he used four Day 1 picks starting in 2015 on the position (Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman, Hollywood Brown and Breshad Perriman).\"\n\nThe Giants went all-in for former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. With Tate, New York's offense could be a threat to go along with a defense that should improve in 2026 under Harbaugh.\n\nHarbaugh took the job with the Giants in part because he believes Dart can be an elite passer in the league.\n\n\"It starts with the quarterback for sure,\" Harbaugh said, via the Giants' website. \"You build your team around your quarterback. You build your team around your players and what they do well. I like the way (Dart) plays.\n\n\"I like his talent, skill set, all the things he's accomplished, but more than that, I like who he is and what he's about. To me, he's about football. This young guy loves football. He wants to talk football all the time and that's kind of what I like doing too.\"\n\nTate would certainly help accelerate Dart's development.\n\nIf Tate goes at No. 5, he'd join Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka as former Buckeyes to go in the first round.\n\nThose players are making big impacts on their respective teams.",

    "description": "Titans opt for another candidate, keeping Nagy in Kansas City amidst offensive struggles and potential Mahomes absence.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs won’t need to go looking for another offensive coordinator, at least for now, as current OC Matt Nagy lost out to Robert Salah to become the next head coach of the Tennessee Titans on Tuesday.\n\nNagy interviewed with the Titans over a week ago, causing many rumors of a departure to Tennessee that’d force the Chiefs to find a new OC in 2026. Perhaps that wouldn’t be the worst outcome for Kansas City, however, as the last couple of seasons haven’t been great in Kansas City on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nWe've completed in-person interviews with the following candidates. pic.twitter.com/Mctvgl2U5K\n\n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) January 20, 2026\n\nThere was no sign of the same dominant offense in Kansas City this past season. The Chiefs finished the season with 320.6 yards per game, only enough for 20th in the NFL. It’s only the second time the Chiefs haven't finished with at least 350 yards per game since Mahomes took over at QB.\n\nIt becomes even more alarming with the fact that the other season under 350 yards per game was in 2024, meaning the offense hasn’t been great in Kansas City for two consecutive seasons now. There’s no denying that the Chiefs, despite their dominance in the early 2020s, no longer instill the same fear into opponents from the offensive side of the ball.\n\nIt’s unfair to say the offensive troubles last season were entirely the fault of Nagy, however. In 2025, injuries and suspensions played a big role in the Chiefs’ failures. It’s why Nagy has garnered a lot of interest this offseason as a name to fill the head coaching vacancies around the league.\n\nNagy has been with the Chiefs for several years, first starting with the team back in 2013. After his stint as the head coach for the Bears, Nagy immediately returned to Kansas City, playing a role in its last three Super Bowl appearances.\n\nIt looks like he’ll be returning once again in 2026 despite the interest from the Titans, who ultimately chose Salejh, the defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. With Mahomes likely out for at least a portion of the 2026 season and several other question marks surrounding the offense, Nagy will certainly have his hands full come fall. In an offseason where there are looking to be several huge changes to the team, the Chiefs being able to keep Nagy will come as a breath of fresh air for the front office.",

Yes, it's absolutely, absolutely the goal,\" the Briton said after avoiding the question from host Greg James. \"Certainly, winning one gives you a lot more confidence. It's different for everyone, right? You've got to find your own way of doing things, and you have people with more confidence, people with less.\n\n\"I've never been the one to have the most confidence in myself. I certainly have more of it now, that's for sure. I've always been a seeing-is-believing kind of guy, but that's even for myself. So I've always had to see myself on the top step, see myself winning to finally believe that I can do it. But certainly last year, I managed to realise that before I achieved it.\n\n\"Already halfway through the season, I felt like I had everything I needed. The people around me, the team, the car, and my own ability to go out and win the championship. So that first time I really had the belief in myself was last year, and it turned out to be the correct thing to have. So, that was the beautiful thing, too.\"\n\n2026 brings in a new wave of regulations to the championship, allowing the grid to level itself as each team once again starts from zero. No one knows which teams will rise to the top, but Norris is hopeful.\n\nThere have been predictions that Mercedes-powered cars - the power unit McLaren uses - are likely to perform well given the Brackley outfit's dominance during the previous hybrid era from 2014 to 2021. But we won't know until the cars hit the track at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

There is hope.\n\nHowever, you have to look really hard to find it.\n\nWhich is what Sports Illustrated's Gilberto Manzano has done.\n\n\"There’s too much focus on Bo Nix not being available due to injury and not enough attention on the advantages that could come from having a stout defense and getting to call Mile High Stadium home,\" Manzano wrote.\n\n\"Those two reasons are why I’m confident the Broncos will hang with the Patriots, but Stidham is also no slouch. Let’s not be so quick to punch the Patriots’ ticket to Santa Clara for Super Bowl LX.\"\n\nMore:Bo Nix injury update: Broncos QB suffers season-ending ankle fracture in win over Bills\n\nOf course he can, but will he?

    "fullText": "LSU football extended a scholarship offer to BJ LaFell, the son of LSU legend Brandon LaFell, on Wednesday.\n\nThe younger LaFell is a part of the 2029 recruiting class, coming off an impressive do-it-all freshman campaign at Shadow Creek High School. According to MaxPreps, he attempted nine passes in the 2025 season, completing five for 72 yards. He also saw 10 carries, rushing for 151 yards and four touchdowns. Lastly, LaFell did a fair amount of work as a receiver, with four catches for 82 yards and a touchdown.\n\nLSU isn’t the only SEC team racing to build a relationship with the young talent, as Ole Miss and Missouri have already extended him offers. It’s a surprise that the Tigers weren’t first in line, though, given the talent his father was during his time in Baton Rouge.\n\nAlthough LSU football has long been known as “Wide Receiver University,” with names such as Malik Nabers, Justin Jefferson, Ja’Marr Chase, Odell Beckham Jr., and Jarvis Landry in recent history, LaFell was one of the school’s first elite receivers. He’s one of the most productive pass-catchers in program history, ranking fourth all-time in receptions (175), sixth in receiving yards (2,517), and second in receiving touchdowns (25).\n\nAfter his four seasons as a Tiger, LaFell carved out a nine-year NFL career, recording 406 catches, 5,398 receiving yards and 31 touchdowns during his time as a pro.\n\nLaFell’s impressive playing career certainly sets a high bar for his son, but Tiger fans should hope that BJ is up to the challenge of trying to exceed the expectations that come with his last name -- and if so, that he plans to do so in Baton Rouge.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football offers scholarship to son of program legend",

    "description": "Davante Adams reached the NFC championship game four times during his eight seasons with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.  Every time, Green Bay came up just short of the Super Bowl — and Adams still feels the pain.  “It just feels almost like a mythical thing to me at this point,” Adams said Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Davante Adams reached the NFC championship game four times during his eight seasons with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.\n\nEvery time, Green Bay came up just short of the Super Bowl — and Adams still feels the pain.\n\n“It just feels almost like a mythical thing to me at this point,” Adams said Wednesday. “You do everything you can to get there, and it’s been so hard. Been working so hard at it.”\n\nAfter an ensuing three years spent nowhere near a Super Bowl, Adams is back for his fifth shot when his Los Angeles Rams (14-5) visit the Seattle Seahawks (16-3) on Sunday for another NFC title game.\n\nThe 33-year-old Adams is still going strong as the league leader in touchdown receptions and a key component of the NFL's top offense. But when the decorated receiver says he craves that final, ultimate team success far more than individual accolades, it's clear he's among the rare athletes who absolutely mean it.\n\n“Forgive me if I’m not smiling ear-to-ear after the first win or the second (playoff) win, having been here so many times and understanding what it takes to get where we’re ultimately trying to go,” Adams said. “We’re close, and we’ve just got to finish it off.”\n\nAlthough Adams has been waiting the longest, he's far from the only Rams player who will be playing for a chance at a Super Bowl debut when they face the top-seeded Seahawks for the third time this season.\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a championship four seasons ago, but only a handful of players are left from that team — just two on defense.\n\nMatthew Stafford, tight end Tyler Higbee and cornerback Darious Williams are the only players left who made major contributions to that Super Bowl title run and also played extensively for the current team. Williams left and returned to the Rams, as did linebacker Troy Reeder and center Coleman Shelton.\n\nReeder now plays mostly special teams, while Shelton and starting left tackle Alaric Jackson were backups in 2021. Receiver Tutu Atwell was injured as a rookie and right tackle Rob Havenstein is injured now.\n\nBut nobody has been waiting longer than Adams for his first shot at a championship ring. He is one of the most consistent receivers of his generation, posting eight seasons with at least 997 yards while moving up to 26th in NFL history with 12,633 yards.\n\nHe almost certainly would have recorded another 1,000-yard season with Los Angeles, but Adams injured his hamstring in December. The Rams fell out of the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC during his three-game absence to close the regular season, most notably blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in Seattle.\n\nAdams has been vocal about the rejuvenating effect of working with Stafford and McVay, but he also knows his career is closer to its end than its beginning. After struggling along with his entire offense during an OT victory last week at Chicago, he's hoping to play a major role in what's likely to be a career-defining game in Seattle.\n\n“I started off with a great experience with the Packers and didn’t have anything else to compare it to, so you kind of, in a sense, take it for granted,” Adams said. \"I don’t think I was taking it for granted, but you go to a situation where you struggle a little bit \n\n“Being back in a position where you’re with a great team and a great situation, you definitely have a greater appreciation for times like this, for sure.”\n\nNOTES: The Rams only held a walkthrough practice at their training complex. ... LB Byron Young (knee soreness) wouldn't have practiced if the Rams had a full workout, McVay said. But Young, the Rams' sacks leader, is still expected to play Sunday. ... S Quentin Lake stayed home with an illness.",

    "fullText": "Liam Delap toiled up front for most of last night’s game against Pafos, again coming off without having found the net.\n\nAfter the game, his manager Liam Rosenior had to field questions about the striker. He’s been a big backer of the youngster in his early days as coach, but the pressure is on after the summer signing drew another blank.\n\nWhen asked if the striker was low on confidence, Rosenior denied that as an issue:\n\n“I wouldn’t say so. Liam’s an outstanding player,” the manager said after the game.\n\n“It’s very difficult for a centre-forward to find spaces when a team defends as deep as Pafos did. I think Liam prefers open spaces to run into and use his speed and his pace. But no, he did a lot of really good things today with and without the ball. I wouldn’t say he’s lacking confidence at all.”\n\nChelsea’s team to fact Pafos, fairly generic group. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWe’d largely agree with that – there have been times when we’ve seen the striker lacking belief, but recently we’ve seen him looking better, just not getting the service he needs. The way the team plays just doesn’t seem to suit anyone who plays up top. The issues of Enzo Maresca’s game style have continued here.\n\nDelap seems trusted ahead of Joao Pedro as the first choice 9, which is giving him more confidence. If he can score against Crystal Palace this weekend, we could see him finally break out.\n\nMoises Caicedo was the hero once again for Chelsea, scoring a crucial header to win the Blues the game and put them back into the Champions League top 8.\n\nLiam Rosenior has continued to use Malo Gusto inverted as a number ten in this game – something fans don’t love. We’re with them on that one.",

    "title": "Israel Adesanya bemoans 'bland' state of UFC middleweight division: 'It just doesn’t feel the same'",
    "description": "The two-time champ hopes to re-inject some excitement into the landscape at UFC Seattle.",
    "fullText": "Israel Adesanya isn’t chasing ghosts anymore. Not belts, not validation, not the version of himself that once ruled the UFC middleweight division with theatrical dominance and cultural gravity.\n\nAt this stage of his career, the former two-time UFC middleweight champion speaks like a man who has already climbed the mountain twice, seen the view from the top, and now understands the terrain in ways few ever will. The hunger still exists. The artistry still matters. But any entitlement is gone. So is the illusion, which, from his vantage point, clears up a less-than-stellar 185-pound landscape.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday's edition of \"The Ariel Helwani Show,\" Adesanya assessed his division at present.\n\n\"I [was champion] twice. It can happen again. I'm still me,\" Adesanya told Uncrowned. \"The middleweight division right now is not really the same as when I was in the game. I know they like me as champion, but it's not really my main focus. When it comes, it comes.\n\n\"What was the last exciting thing at middleweight? Where people were talking about it. It's good to have Khamzat [Chimaev] as champion — that was the last exciting thing. Since then, there's not really been anything that feels [interesting].\n\n\"It just doesn’t feel the same as when I was in the game,\" Adesanya added. \"I gave people someone to love, I gave some people someone to hate — I gave people something to feel, whether they loved me or hated me. But right now it just feels bland. Other divisions are way more exciting.”\n\nAdesanya’s critique isn’t rooted in bitterness; it’s more observational, almost clinical. He understands the business, the cycles of star power and the vacuum that forms when a division loses its gravitational pull. During his reigns, middleweight wasn’t just competitive — it was emotional. Rivalries carried narratives. Fights carried consequences. The division moved because Adesanya moved it.\n\nNow, he returns not as a savior or new superstar atop the weight class, but as a dangerous variable dropped back into the ecosystem of 185 pounds.\n\nThat variable meets Joe Pyfer in UFC Seattle's main event on March 28 — a matchup that feels intentionally volatile. Pyfer brings raw physicality, a knockout threat and the hunger of a rising contender looking to make his name. Adesanya recognizes exactly what the assignment represents.\n\n“It is just what I need to come back to — a dangerous opponent that they’re trying to feed me to,\" Adesanya said.\n\n\"This is a game. This is what happens. I’ve watched this game for years. I just know how they try and succeed, they try and fail, but this is just how the nature of the beast is.”\n\nAdesanya, 36, has been the hunter, the champion, the hunted, the measuring stick, and now — perhaps most intriguingly — the litmus test for the next wave. He doesn’t resist that role. He understands it.\n\nMore than anything, his perspective reflects a fighter who has shed the pressure of legacy-building and replaced it with presence. Time away has recalibrated him.\n\n\"I'm tainted because I've seen the game from the inside now, so I don't have the rose-colored glasses, obviously, but I love the pure art. The pureness of fighting,\" Adesanya said. \"This is one thing; I've taken a lot of time off. This is the biggest hiatus of my career.\n\n\"The end is always around the corner. F***, we could all go outside and get run over by a f***ing bus. The end's always around the corner, so I just try and live in the moment and take each moment as it comes. Enjoy the moment, really soak it in. I can do that now. There's no pressure to worry about other people. I just worry about myself.\"\n\nThat freedom — mental, emotional, competitive — may lead to the most unpredictable version of Adesanya yet. No chasing. No proving. No forced urgency. Just clarity.\n\n\"I feel freer than I ever have,\" Adesanya said. \"I know the game — I can’t be mad at the game, and you can’t be jaded. I’m just tainted, but I’m also blessed that I got to see the game from the inside, and I got to see it at the very top. The tippy, tippy, tippy top. I'm still right there, but I understand how the game is played, so I play accordingly, and I play it very well. This is just a new level that I haven't hit yet. So, just play my part.\"\n\nWhether that part leads back to gold or simply to moments worth savoring, Adesanya has already shaped an era. Now he’s navigating the next chapter with open eyes and a rare sense of peace. He'll step into Seattle not to reclaim the throne, but to remind the division that the artist is still very much alive.",

Even though I wasn’t able to return to play due to my knee injury, I’m incredibly thankful for the unwavering support from the club throughout this whole process the past two years. While this chapter is coming to an end, the people and experiences will stay with me forever. And I can’t wait to see all of the accomplishments this team achieves this year.”\n\nWright was the 13th overall selection in the 2021 NWSL Draft from Texas Tech University.\n\nDue to a knee injury suffered in the 2024 preseason, Wright has not been able to play in the past two seasons.\n\n“It’s devastating that KD has to step away from the sport like this. She had great talent and we hoped she would have a much longer career in Louisville,” Racing general manager Caitlyn Flores Milby said. “That said, we’re so happy that she’s taking this next step in her journey. She is a fantastic person and a wonderful mother and we’re proud to say she will always be a member of the Racing family.”\n\nOverall, Wright earned 39 NWSL appearances (25 starts) for Racing. She scored six goals and recorded two assists.\n\nWright gave birth to her first child in October 2025.\n\n“KD has given so much to this club over the years and has worked tirelessly to come back. She’s been an incredibly positive presence within our environment for a long time,” Racing head coach Bev Yanez said. “While we’re sad to see her step away from the game, we know she leaves at peace, having given everything she had. We’re so grateful to have been part of her journey and wish her nothing but the very best always. She’s an amazing person and truly deserves it all.”",

    "title": "Bo Bichette explains why Mets were ‘obvious’ choice in free agency",
    "description": "Bo Bichette was introduced by the Mets at Citi Field on Wednesday after signing with New York in free agency.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — The image of the Dodgers pouring out onto the field at Rogers Centre, celebrating a victory over the Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series last fall, will be ingrained in Bo Bichette’s mind forever.\n\nHe still hasn’t gotten over the end of that game — and the Blue Jays’ remarkable playoff run — in the months since.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bichette was in a new jersey, introduced to his new team, in a new city. And, in some ways, he was able to relieve that pain from November.\n\nHe firmly believes that his new team, the Mets, will give him an opportunity to get back to that stage again, as early as this year, with a real chance to finish the job this time around.\n\nThat, Bichette said, was part of what tipped the scales in his negotiations with multiple teams in free agency. It’s what made it “very obvious” that he wanted to be a Met.\n\n“My first priority is winning,” Bichette said, donning his No. 19 Mets jersey for the first time. “This organization is doing everything they can to do that.”\n\nBo Bichette was asked today how long it took for him to get over Game 7 of the World Series with the Blue Jays:\n\n\"I don't know if I have yet. This is probably helping. But yeah, to be that close, you never know when you're gonna get that opportunity again, but I think this team…\n\n— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) January 21, 2026\n\nBichette signed a three-year deal with the Mets last week, a $126 million pact that contains opt-outs after both his first and second seasons. It was reported that Bichette was close to a seven year, $200 million deal with the rival Phillies, but he chose the Mets hours later.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday if he is treating his contract with the Mets as a one-year deal, one of Bichette’s agents — Greg Genske — chimed in.\n\n“His commitment is to the Mets,” Genske said. “His desire is to be here. His desire is compete for championships here.”\n\nMany fans will question that logic. The Mets missed the playoffs in 2025 and seemingly took steps back during the first half of this offseason. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were two outs away from winning the World Series in the ninth inning of Game 7 less than three months ago. They won their division last season and advanced to the Fall Classic without Bichette, who was sidelined by a left knee sprain that kept him out until the World Series. Toronto has been active in bolstering their roster this winter. Plus, other high-spending contenders — like the Phillies — were contenders in the Bichette sweepstakes.\n\nBichette’s reasoning is rooted in the actions of owner Steve Cohen and Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns. He thinks the Mets have a roster that supports their offseason initiative to turn this franchise into a true perennial championship contender.\n\n“Mr. Cohen and David have put together an organization that is looking to win every single year, has an opportunity to win a World Series every single year and a roster that backs that up,” Bichette said. “It’s very exciting to be a part of this city, one of the best cities in the world — maybe the best city in the world. The fans, some of the best fans in the world. All of that is something I’ve always wanted to be a part of.\"\n\nThat’s part of the calculus in Bichette’s willingness to change positions heading into the 2026 season, too. He’ll be moving from shortstop to third base with the Mets, something he was open to throughout his dip into free agency, so long as he was signing with a team that gave him a good chance to win.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge,” Bichette said. “It’s just like anything else, it’s gonna take work to be good at something. I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it.”\n\nBichette will land in the middle of a formidable lineup that includes Fransisco Lindor, Juan Soto, Marcus Semien and Luis Robert, Jr., whom the Mets acquired Tuesday night in a trade with the White Sox.\n\nStearns isn’t concerned about Bichette being used at the hot corner for the first time in his professional career. He trusts that Bichette’s range at shortstop will translate to third and that he can handle the longer throws. Stearns has been prioritizing run prevention and defensive improvements all winter. Even with Jorge Polanco making a similar transition this year to now starting at first base for the Mets, Stearns is confident in this new-look group (with Semien at second and Lindor returning at shortstop).\n\n“There are going to be certain days this season, probably a lot of days this season, where we’re playing four shortstops on the infield, and that’s a pretty distinct advantage,” Stearns said. “The majority of that learning curve is going to be where to be on certain plays. Frankly, some things that may not be completely perceptible. We’re probably going to make a mistake or two. But we’re also going to have elite range around the infield and that’s pretty exciting.”\n\nBichette singled out positioning, bunt plays and a new type of throw across the diamond as the biggest challenges of this transition. Mets manager Carlos Mendoza, who will play a key role in helping Bichette with his defense this spring, has faith that the 27-year-old can pull it off.\n\n“It’s a different angle that you could take from there,” Mendoza said, “But he’s athletic and has work ethic, a lot of the things that will make the transition hopefully a lot smoother.”",

    "description": "The 2A Greater St. Helens League initially rejected the merger proposal, a coach told The News Tribune.",
    "fullText": "Winning the Class 2A Greater St. Helen’s League football title just got harder. Tumwater is coming to town.\n\nThe 2A Evergreen Conference (EvCo) is merging with the 2A GSHL for football beginning in the 2026 high school football season, The News Tribune has learned. The merger will include the 2027 season, as well.\n\nFor competitive reasons, Centralia High School was granted to play a 1A schedule in the 1A Evergreen, leaving the 2A EvCo with four schools: Tumwater, W.F. West, Black Hills and Aberdeen.\n\nAside from the comical optics of having a tiny four-team league, the larger issue for the 2A EvCo’s members is scheduling, forcing the remaining programs scrambling to find non-league games for over half of the season — a challenge when most teams around the state are getting into the league portion of their schedules by Week 3, and in some cases even earlier.\n\nTumwater High School football coach Willie Garrow told The News Tribune the 2A EvCo petitioned to join the GSHL for the 2026 and 2027 seasons last December and initially was rejected. The 2A EvCo resides in the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association’s (WIAA) “District 4,” one of the six geographic districts in the state.\n\nDirectors from District 4 reversed the decision on Tuesday, mandating the merger.\n\nGarrow told The News Tribune the 2A GSHL didn’t provide an official reason for initially rejecting the merger proposal.\n\n“There are lots of potential things that could be cited,” he said. “I’m sure travel was one of those concerns, the potential for travel changes. Aberdeen to Washougal, for example, that’s a trek. Sub-varsity games, that could be long and expensive. That kind of thing.”\n\nThe new 12-team league will consist of:\n\nTumwater, a perennial state tournament contender in Class 2A, has played in the 2A state championship game each of the past three seasons, falling to Anacortes in 2023 and 2024 and losing to Archbishop Murphy last fall. Tumwater won the 2A title in 2019, beating the Emeka Egbuka-led Steilacoom Sentinels.\n\nW.F. West also has been a regular state tournament contender. It reached the state semifinals in 2011 and 2022.\n\nFor Garrow and the other 2A EvCo schools, it solves the issue of having to schedule six non-league games.\n\n“They were really, really, really hard to fill,” he said. “It’s extremely difficult to find six non-league opponents. Most leagues in the state are eight or so teams, so they don’t have byes in Weeks 4, 5 and 6. Then the number of schools that do have byes, you have to convince them to play you.\n\n“From a high school football perspective as a head coach over the next two years, I enjoy the fact that we’re gonna have league stability, we know we’re gonna have opponents.”\n\nThe format of the league has yet to be determined. As a 12-team league, not every team will be able to play each other during the regular season. Multiple formats are being considered: two six team divisions, as well as a “pod system” with three pods of four teams.\n\nThe league merger will remain in place through the 2027 season, before the WIAA’s next four-year reclassification cycle, which will begin in the 2028-29 school year.",

    "title": "Broncos Stars Have Full Confidence In Backup QB Jarrett Stidham Ahead Of AFC Championship",
    "description": "Broncos players rally behind backup QB Jarrett Stidham, confident he's prepared to lead Denver to AFC Championship glory after starter's injury.",
    "fullText": "There isn’t as much optimism as you’d expect from the fanbase of a team playing in the AFC Championship for fans of the Denver Broncos, but they’re under unique circumstances this week. All of the luck and good fortune that helped the Broncos to the No. 1 seed in the AFC has gone out the window after quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle in the final moments of the divisional round win against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWith Nix out, backup Jarrett Stidham will be under center on Sunday as Denver takes on the New England Patriots. It’s not ideal by any stretch of the imagination, but success in such a situation has been achieved several times before.\n\nNick Foles was the most recent success story to lead his team to a Super Bowl after stepping in for the injured starter. He won multiple playoff games for the Philadelphia Eagles and ended up winning Super Bowl LII.\n\nThe greatest quarterback of all time, Tom Brady, also got his first shot in the NFL after replacing starter Drew Bledsoe in 2001. He went on to lead the Patriots to a great regular season record and all the way to the Super Bowl, where he also earned a win.\n\nNot that Stidham is going to be the next Brady by any means, but just because Denver is relying on their backup doesn’t mean Sunday’s outcome has already been decided. The Broncos’ players have their full confidence in Stidham, who has been in Denver under head coach Sean Payton’s system for three years now. Defensive edge Zach Allen has full confidence in the 29-year-old.\n\n“He's the first guy in the building every day, and he prepares like a starter, so we're really excited to see what he does,” Allen said on Monday. “And obviously, he goes against the defense in practice all the time, and he's great. He's definitely a really good quarterback in this league. So excited to see what he does this week.\"\n\nRight tackle Mike McGlinchey is also confident in Stidham’s ability heading into the biggest game of his career.\n\n“He's been ready for his opportunity, whenever that may come,” he told reporters. “He stays in his routine every single day for three years straight, not knowing when that opportunity is going to come around. I know that our team and our staff and everybody has got the utmost confidence in Jarrett to play well and lead our team forward.\"\n\nThe Broncos will be hoping for an early return from running back J.K. Dobbins, who has had his 21-day activation window opened. If Stidham can lead Denver to a win this week, Dobbin’s possible return for the Super Bowl would be a huge bonus to a squad without its starting quarterback.\n\nFocusing on this Sunday, however, Stidham is the type of backup you’d hope for in this situation. Though his play style is a bit different from Nix’s, he’s very familiar with how Payton operates and what he expects from his quarterback. All the eyes of the football world will be on Stidham and the Broncos this weekend, waiting to see if Stidham can become the next backup QB to lead his team to glory.",

    "fullText": "ESPN made surprising Paul Finebaum decision after national championship game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe college football national championship game pitted the Big Ten's Indiana against the ACC's Miami.\n\nIt's something that has been discussed plenty by ESPN's college football czar, Paul Finebaum, himself an SEC guy.\n\nAnd that representation may have shown itself most in the days following the natty.\n\nAwful Announcing analyst Matt Yoder wondered if ESPN was partaking in \"a changing of the guard.\"\n\nAfter Indiana won the title, Finebaum didn't appear on First Take the next day.\n\nInstead, it was E.J. Manuel, who played at the ACC's Florida State, and Desmond Howard, who played at the Big Ten's Michigan.\n\n\"Of course, given the title game represented both conferences, it made all the sense in the world to showcase two analysts who know them well,\" Yoder wrote. \"But given that First Take has highlighted SEC loyalist Paul Finebaum all year, it was also quite the statement for where ESPN might go from here.\"\n\nESPN's decision to use Manuel might suggest they have a bigger role for him in the future.\n\nBut it'd be surprising to see Finebaum go too far away.\n\n\"Finebaum has been a ubiquitous presence on ESPN’s college football coverage over the last few years and for good reason,\" Yoder wrote. \"Love him or love to hate him, he is a dynamic personality who has been around the sport for decades. But while he and the SEC have had to eat a lot of crow this postseason, the end of their dominance over the sport might represent an opportunity for others to make their voices heard.\"\n\nHoward isn't as much of a surprise, as he's already on College Gameday.\n\nWe'll see if this translates to the offseason and the season ahead.\n\nMORE: Toosii's plans to play college football at Syracuse take a twist",

    "description": "Maye has fumbled six times in their first two playoff games.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his first two career playoff starts, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye has experienced his share of growing pains. Still, Maye has delivered key plays that have helped New England reach the AFC Championship Game.\n\nWith a trip to the Super Bowl now on the line, Maye’s teammates continue to express confidence in the young quarterback despite some recent mistakes.\n\n“Our quarterback continues to show up, especially in those moments where things can go left or right,” wide receiver Stefon Diggs said. “He’s making the right reads. He’s making the right throws. He’s rolling with the punches.\n\n“Playoff ball — it’s not going to be pretty. I’ll take an ugly win any day.”\n\nMaye has fumbled six times and lost three over the Patriots’ first two postseason games. Nonetheless, he has shown a short memory, bouncing back to make pivotal plays — such as fourth quarter touchdown passes to Hunter Henry against the Chargers and Kayshon Boutte versus the Texans — in order to secure a pair of wins.\n\n“I think none of his plays are really bad plays. It’s just part of football. I watch him, and his demeanor and his temperament throughout the game, it never changes. I think he’s consistent,” Diggs said. “The more people that band behind him, you see it. Once he gets rolling, he’s real scary. He’s a young quarterback but he has had a maturation process second to none in my opinion.”\n\nAs Maye and the Patriots now prepare for a Denver Broncos defense that led the league in sacks, ball security will be a major point of emphasis. That focus extends beyond Maye, as well, as the quarterback has not always been the primary cause of the fumbles.\n\n“We have to be able to not get careless with the football. We can’t be reckless,” head coach Mike Vrabel said. “A lot of it is operation. We had two turnovers where we all weren’t on the same page. Not only is that a negative play if you don’t have everybody on the same page, but even worse, you lose the football or if you don’t have somebody on the same page and they blitz, somebody gets hurt. Those are the things we talk about when we’re not on the same page. I think that the operation is going to be critical.”",

His three-year deal ran through the end of the 2025 regular season.\n\nThe Vikings were confident Flores would stay, if he didn't get a head-coaching job elsewhere.\n\n“Brian has a unique ability to connect with players, understand their skill sets, and put them in positions to maximize their impact on the field,” coach Kevin O'Connell said in a release. “The identity of our defense is a reflection of his leadership and preparation. On a personal level, I’ve really valued the relationship we’ve built over the last three years, and that shared trust, alignment and high standard will continue to be critical to our success.”\n\nFlores interviewed with both the Ravens and Steelers for their head-coaching vacancies. The Pittsburgh interview happened on Wednesday. It's unclear whether the Vikings' announcement means he has withdrawn from consideration for either job.\n\nFlores, who coached the Dolphins from 2019 through 2021, also interviewed for the vacant defensive coordinator position in Washington.\n\nThe Vikings believed the Cowboys might make a run at Flores for their vacant defensive coordinator job. He was never interviewed, which possibly means the Cowboys knew what he wanted financially, and weren't willing to pay it.\n\nRegardless, the silence has been broken. The Vikings have a new deal with Flores. They presumably wouldn't have announced it if they thought he may be leaving.",

    "fullText": "After losing starting quarterback Bo Nix to a season-ending ankle injury, the Denver Broncos are set to start backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham against the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game on Sunday.\n\nPatriots defensive lineman Milton Williams may have inadvertently given Stidham some bulletin board material ahead of the matchup. Williams was asked by New England media members on Wednesday what he knows about Stidham. Williams gave a blunt response.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Williams said, via CLNS Media Boston Sports Network. \"I ain't gonna lie, nothing. We're gonna watch the tape on him and figure out what he like to do.

    "fullText": "Ex-Deion Sanders five-star Sa’vell Smalls: Playing at Colorado nearly left me paralyzed originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSa’vell Smalls did everything football ever asked of him, and more.\n\nHe was a five star recruit, a consensus national prospect, and a player once spoken about as a future star at the highest level. His path took him from Washington to Colorado in 2023, following opportunity, belief, and the promise of a fresh start under Deion Sanders.\n\nInstead, the game nearly took his life.\n\nIn a deeply personal message shared publicly, Smalls revealed that he has medically retired from college football after learning he was born with spinal stenosis, a condition that dangerously narrows the spinal canal. The diagnosis came only after a series of terrifying moments that no athlete expects to experience.\n\n🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/2fYpWQLfaN\n\n— Sav’ell Smalls 🧬 (@SavvySmalls_9) January 21, 2026\n\nSmalls described episodes of transient quadriplegia, temporary paralysis in his arms and legs, occurring during routine plays he had executed thousands of times. At first, he did what many athletes are conditioned to do. He stayed quiet. He pushed through numbness. He told himself it would pass.\n\nMORE: Meet Abella Danger—The one Miami celebrity fan Curt Cignetti won't tell you to Google\n\nEventually, the symptoms became impossible to explain away. Medical evaluations revealed the seriousness of the condition. Spinal fusion surgery was discussed, but even that came with no certainty. Doctors warned that continuing to play football carried a real risk of permanent paralysis.\n\nFor Smalls, the choice became brutally clear.\n\nSanders has not publicly responded. However, the decision dates back to last fall, when Smalls was advised that continuing to play carried serious risk.\n\nMORE: Malachi Toney admits he’d be playing in the SEC if not for a coaching change\n\nWhat stood out just as much as what was said was what was not.\n\nIn a message filled with gratitude for family, doctors, and those who supported him through the hardest decision of his life, Smalls did not mention Coach Prime or the Colorado coaching staff. That absence is notable, especially in a sport where public thanks are often extended even in far less personal moments.\n\nOnce viewed as an immediate impact defender and a future NFL prospect, Smalls exited the game quietly. There was no press conference. No farewell moment. No orchestrated goodbye. Just a decision made privately, months earlier, with life itself hanging in the balance.\n\nMORE: D’Angelo Ponds’ father sends 'BTA' message to Michael Irvin after Indiana's title win\n\n“I medically retired,” Smalls wrote. “Ending my athletic career for good.”\n\nThe words are simple. The weight behind them is not.\n\nFootball gave Smalls structure, identity, and opportunity. It also put him in danger he did not fully understand until it was almost too late. Walking away was not weakness. It was awareness of the life ahead of him.\n\nFormer Ohio State Buckeyes star makes shocking transfer portal decision\n\nCurt Cignetti slams Big 12 refs over Miami's 'dirty' play in title game\n\nNational Championship parking prices are so high, getting towed could cost less\n\nCarson Beck goes viral for roasting reporter who asked about going to class",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — From hitting in the clutch to testing free agency, Bo Bichette has soaked up plenty of baseball advice from his big league dad over the years.\n\nDante Bichette doesn't have much to offer about handling the hot corner, though.\n\nAfter signing a $126 million, three-year contract with the New York Mets, the younger Bichette was formally introduced by the team Wednesday and pulled on a No. 19 jersey at a packed Citi Field news conference.\n\nA two-time All-Star shortstop with the Toronto Blue Jays, Bichette will shift to third base with the Mets, who have Francisco Lindor entrenched at shortstop. Bichette said he hasn't played third since travel ball as a teenager.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge. I mean, it’s just like anything else: It’s going to take work to be good at something, and I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there’s different positioning, different plays you have to deal with at third base that I’m going to have to get used to and learn, but I think that’s all attainable.”\n\nDante Bichette, in attendance Wednesday along with other family members, was a four-time All-Star outfielder from 1988-2001. Known much more for his bat than glove, he played one inning at third base for Milwaukee in 1991.\n\n“I didn’t know he did that. I had no idea,\" Bo Bichette said with a grin. \"That would be interesting to watch.”\n\nHousehold jabs aside, the new-look Mets are confident Bichette can make the switch successfully.\n\nHe didn't grade well at shortstop last year, and Bichette entered free agency this offseason willing to move to second or third. He plans to call former Toronto teammate Matt Chapman, a five-time Gold Glove winner at the hot corner, to get some thoughts about manning third.\n\n“This is a player who is universally respected for his aptitude and his work ethic on the field,\" Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said about Bichette. \"And so when you combine those two things it generally gives you comfort that they can make adjustments, make changes, and Bo is very confident that he’s going to be able to do this, and everything we’ve seen backs that up.”\n\nBichette spurned the NL East rival Philadelphia Phillies to sign with the Mets and gives them a proven hitter with a potent right-handed bat to help complement lefty slugger Juan Soto.\n\nBichette batted .311 with 18 home runs, 94 RBIs and an .840 OPS in 139 games last year for the Blue Jays, who fell one win short of a World Series title.\n\nHe hit a three-run homer off Shohei Ohtani in Game 7 of the Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and is a .330 career hitter with runners in scoring position — the third-best mark in the majors among qualified hitters since 2019.\n\nBichette batted .381 with RISP last season.\n\n“I don’t know if my eyes light up or anything like that, but definitely probably get a little bit more focus,\" he said. \"And my dad taught me a lot about it. That’s all I heard about growing up was driving in runs, so I’ve put a lot of work into it.”\n\nBichette, who turns 28 in March, gets a $40 million signing bonus payable March 15 and a $2 million salary this year. He has $42 million player options for 2027 and 2028. If he declines either option, he would receive a $5 million buyout, payable in $1 million installments each July 1 from 2036-40.\n\n“We had a lot of conversations about the different structure of the deal, and Bo had his choice of long-term deals, shorter-term deals, opt outs,\" agent Greg Genske said. “His priority was finding a place where he felt like he could get better as a player and have a chance to compete for championships.”\n\nNew York signed right-handed reliever Luis García to a $1.75 million, one-year contract. He can earn $1.25 million in performance bonuses for games pitched: $100,000 for 25, $150,000 each for 30 and 35, $175,000 for 40, $200,000 for 45, $225,000 for 50 and $250,000 for 55.\n\nGarcía, who turns 39 this month, went 2-2 with a 3.42 ERA and two saves in 58 combined appearances last season with the Dodgers, Nationals and Angels. He is 28-30 with a 4.07 ERA and 17 saves in 13 major league seasons.\n\nTo open a spot for García on the 40-man roster, infielder Tsung-Che Cheng was designated for assignment.\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS – Umar Nurmagomedov has clarified a comment made by his cousin Khabib pertaining to his feelings toward UFC bantamweight champion Petr Yan.\n\nKhabib recently told Russian channel Kanal Udar that there is tension between Umar and Yan and that two fighters don't like each other. At a UFC 324 news conference Wednesday ahead of Saturday's event at T-Mobile Arena, Umar confirmed what Khabib said – but indicated the feelings he has toward Yan are not different than the ones he has toward any other potential opponent.\n\n\"It means we're not friends,\" Nurmagomedov told MMA Junkie and other reporters. \"We're not enemies, but we're not friends. It's going to be big fight for our country, two guys fighting for the title. Just that's it. ... I look at that spot where I am, looking at guys like my opponents in the cage. It's the most important things. I don't have problems with them outside the cage. One of the reasons why we don't like each other is because if we fight we're going to smash each other. If someone would retire, we won't have issues to be in conflict. I think that position (is the one) taken by all fighters. Nobody will fight with friends.\"\n\nDespite his eagerness to take a crack at the current UFC titleholder, Nurmagomedov doesn't appear in a rush. Even should he get through former UFC flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo on Saturday, Nurmagomedov said he has a hunch he'll have to fight one more time before a title shot is awarded to him.\n\n\"I don't feel (Sean O'Malley) is even going to be next,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"Maybe after this fight, we're going to fight for the title. Merab and Petr will maybe fight in a rematch. But for me, it doesn't matter. Any option, I will be ready.\"\n\nShould he beat Figueiredo, Nurmagomedov has already penciled in the event and location on his calendar in which he could punch his ticket to a UFC title fight.\n\n\"It's going to be good, (if I fight in October in Abu Dhabi),\" Nurmagomedov said. \"I can fight main event five rounds. If it's going to Sean O'Malley, for example, it's going to be a big fight.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Umar Nurmagomedov clarifies Khabib's comments about Petr Yan",

I would go with brain fart because I would say I know the Seahawks won a Super Bowl. I was writing for Grantland at the time. I was doing podcasts and writing about that Super Bowl year. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them kick Peyton Manning’s a--. If I had thought about it for a split second, I would have remembered they won. But I think I brain-farted and mixed them up with the Mariners. So I’m here to ask for forgiveness.”\n\nMORE: Bills have no choice but to trade Keon Coleman now\n\nHis brain very likely mixed them up with the Mariners, which is fair given they nearly made the World Series in October. The Mariners have never even made it to the World Series, let alone won one.\n\n“My standard response for this stuff is, it is hard to host a pod. You’re not going to bat a thousand,” Simmons said. “…I was thinking afterwards, I was like, ‘Why did I say that? What happened to my brain?’ But then I realized the Rams, Bears, and the Bills game probably broke my brain.”\n\nMORE: Could the Raiders trade the No. 1 pick and Fernando Mendoza?\n\nThose games were pretty wild. It broke a lot of brains.\n\nStill, though, the Seahawks won pretty recently. Simmons won't make this mistake again.\n\nBrowns can draft the brother of a Cavs' NBA star\n\nThe 2027 Super Bowl is on Valentine's Day\n\nNew perspective on Tua Tagovailoa and his head injuries\n\nThe lastest on how Travis Kelce's wedding to Taylor Swift impacts retirement\n\nJohn Harbaugh should already have a $100 million regret\n\nThis throw is why the Bears drafted Caleb Williams 1st overall",

    "fullText": "One of the fellow contenders for the Big Ten title will be without a key player for at least a month.\n\nIllinois will be without their star guard Kylan Boswell for \"at least a month\" after fracturing his right hand. Fighting Illini head coach Brad Underwood shared the tough injury news on Boswell earlier this week.\n\nBoswell has been one of the best guards in the Big Ten so far this season, averaging 14.3 points and 3.4 assists per game this year. He is a big reason for why Illinois is among the elite Big Ten teams this year, with an overall record of 15-3 and 6-1 mark in conference games.\n\nMichigan State is set to host Illinois on February 7 as the lone regular season meeting between the Spartans and Fighting Illini. That game would be within the expected window of time Boswell will be out, so his injury certainly could impact that game in a few weeks. Illinois is a well-rounded team this year, but we will see how they handle this unfortunate injury news.\n\nDamn tough break. IL has to go on the road to Purdue/Nebraska/MSU the next four weeks. https://t.co/wG9BTOKG31\n\n— DK (@SpartanHoops_DK) January 20, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "With the brutal news after the Denver Broncos divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills of Bo Nix being done for the year with an ankle injury, the need to get healthy for the AFC Championship Game became a critical need. Two names are on that list for us to watch for: J.K. Dobbins and Luke Wattenberg. With Nix out, those first two are probably code red needs for this game. Surprisingly, both wide receivers Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant were at practice today as well.\n\nGreat news there on all injury fronts. First, Dobbins was practicing today for the first time since injuring his foot in Week 10. The rehab time on that felt like a iffy maybe for the Super Bowl at the time, but he’s well ahead of schedule and seemingly back at the most critical time for this football team. Wattenberg’s status is a little more questionable as the team did open his 21-day practice window today, but I should note he was the only guy of the four who was a full participant.\n\nThough, when asked, head coach Sean Payton was adamant that he would not comment on any player’s expected return time from injury. So practicing is a good sign, but we won’t know if they are game-ready until Friday or even possibly until 90 minutes before kickoff with the gameday inactive report.\n\nHere is your full practice report for Wednesday.\n\nBOLD – Indicates change in status; NIR­- Indicates not injury related; *- Team conducted a walk-through / report is an estimation\nSTATUS DEFINITIONS: Did not participate (DNP); Limited: means less than 100 percent of a player’s normal repetitions; Full—100 percent of player’s normal repetitions; Out: will not play; Doubtful: Unlikely to play; Questionable: Uncertain to play",

    "description": "Eddie Howe says Yoane Wissa came to Newcastle \"for these nights\" after his first Champions League goal at St James' Park.",
    "fullText": "Yoane Wissa does not have to look too far for inspiration.\n\nAlan Shearer, Jackie Milburn, Andy Cole, Malcolm Macdonald and Les Ferdinand are just some of the prolific strikers who have worn Newcastle United's iconic number nine shirt.\n\nWissa is the latest in a long line to inherit it, and he offered a reminder why in his side's 3-0 Champions League win against PSV Eindhoven at St James' Park.\n\nOn a night supporters unfurled a banner urging their side to \"write the next headline\", Wissa certainly did so.\n\nNot only did he open the scoring after just eight minutes, the forward also set up his side's second goal with the aggressive manner in which he pressed slack PSV defender Yarek Gasiorowski.\n\nNo wonder the man of the match left the field to a standing ovation after he was taken off by head coach Eddie Howe midway through the second half.\n\nThe prospect of sampling such moments under the lights had long served as inspiration after Wissa suffered a knee injury while on international duty with DR Congo back in September.\n\n\"It's been a tough start for him here,\" Howe said. \"For any new player to come and get a serious injury, having not even done a training session, that's really tough mentally.\n\n\"So it's taken us a while to get him to a level that's close to his best, and I still feel he's got some more to come.\n\n\"A big night for him tonight because in part that's why he came to the club - for these nights - and I'm just pleased that he's made a positive impact.\"\n\nIt has taken Wissa time to deliver such performances.\n\nWissa, who had already had a disrupted pre-season, following his protracted departure from Brentford, has only scored three goals since making his debut for Newcastle last month.\n\nThe forward has looked rusty at times, failing to take a big chance to open the scoring in the defeat against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-finals last week.\n\nBut Wednesday night showed what he can bring to this side.\n\nHowe had called on Wissa to \"max out\" before the game, and he led the press effectively against a naive PSV side, who repeatedly played out from the back.\n\nThat certainly did not go unnoticed by fellow goalscorer Harvey Barnes.\n\n\"He's had a tough start since he's come here,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"Obviously injured for a long time. I had a similar start here. I know how tough it is just watching from the stands, so I know how delighted he will be.\n\n\"A first Champions League goal. I thought he played really well so I'm buzzing for him.\"\n\nThe challenge for Wissa, of course, is to start scoring more regularly.\n\nBut he is a poacher in a differing mould to the towering Nick Woltemade, who likes to come in deep.\n\nOf those forwards to have played a minimum of 250 minutes in the Premier League this season, Wissa ranks first for cross option runs per game.\n\nThese are defined by Opta as runs to get into the penalty area to make yourself available for a cross while your team-mate has the ball in a wide area.\n\nWissa also ranks 15th for runs in behind.\n\nGiven their differing qualities, Howe felt it was \"transformative\" to have Wissa available after Woltemade had to shoulder the burden up front in his absence.\n\nIt had always been the plan for the pair to share the load after Newcastle lost top scorer Alexander Isak to Liverpool last summer, and Wissa's Premier League experience helps explain why Newcastle paid such a hefty £55m fee.\n\n\"Yoane's career at Brentford was brilliant to watch from afar because I thought he was outstanding for them, scoring a number of massive goals,\" Howe said.\n\n\"I loved his attitude and the way that he played, the determination and aggression that he played with.\"\n\nSuch aggression is one of the reasons Wissa is likely to line up from the off against holders Paris St-Germain next week.\n\nNewcastle are in a strong position going into that final game of the league phase, and sit in seventh place in the standings.\n\nNewcastle have already secured a last 16 play-off spot, and still have the chance to reach the knockout stages automatically with a landmark result in the Parc des Princes next week.\n\nWhile Howe refuted talk of \"revenge\" after a controversial stoppage-time penalty was awarded against his side on their last visit to the French capital in 2023, the visitors certainly won't need any added motivation.\n\n\"We know what we can do when we turn up against teams,\" Barnes added.\n\n\"We had a sour taste after the game a couple of years ago, and it's one we will want to go and put right.\n\n\"It's a massive challenge - they're a quality side - but why not?\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

Indianapolis' unique setup, though, allows for maximum efficiency and accessibility.\n\n\"Indianapolis and the NFL Combine have built a proud legacy together, and we're pleased to extend our partnership with Visit Indy, the Colts and the local community,\" said Peter O'Reilly, the NFL's executive vice president, club business, international and league events. \"For over three decades, Indy has delivered an exceptional environment for our football evaluation operations, and we're excited to continue improving the prospect and club experience while enhancing the fan moments that create opportunities for tens of thousands to engage with the league's future stars.\"",

And while there's apparently nothing to it, the 49ers won't shrug it off.\n\n“What I would tell you, because it deals with allegedly the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,\" G.M. John Lynch told reporters on Wednesday. \"So, our guys have been — we've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and by coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means. That's what we know exists. We've heard that debunked. So yes, we will look into it. We have. The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pour into it. Our ownership, [CEO] Jed [York], tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened. We aren't going to turn a blind eye. We'll look into everything.”\n\nThe 49ers have practiced in the same facility since 1988, winning three Super Bowls in the first seven years there. And even if there's nothing to the electricity angle, the 49ers have had too many injuries in recent years.\n\n\"The health and performance of our players is at the utmost priority each and every year,\" Lynch said. \"You know, this year it was tough and it took a toll on our team. We'll continue to look. Now, having said that, we've spent a lot of time and effort in recruiting really quality people and I think being at the forefront of injury prevention. I think this year probably because the star players that that went down there was a lot of attention given on that. The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game. And so, what we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries, and I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. That process has begun. It never frankly stopped, but yes, we'll look at everything and we'll examine everything.\"\n\nA certain amount of injuries are unavoidable. Still, training and nutrition and flexibility can be factors in the ability of players to stay healthy. Whatever the reason for two straight years of too many injuries for the 49ers, they need to get to the bottom of the problem, and fix it.",

    "description": "For those wondering if the Houston Texans will be moving off another offensive coordinator this offseason, don't bet the house on it happening.",
    "fullText": "For those wondering if the Houston Texans will be moving off another offensive coordinator this offseason, don't bet the house on it happening.\n\nTexans general manager Nick Caserio said Wednesday that he anticipates first-year playcaller Nick Caley to get a second season running the offense when the Texans return to NRG Stadium next season.\n\n\"I think Nick learned a lot, [in his] first opportunity as a playcaller,\" Caserio said. \"I would say, offensively, probably the last two to three months of the year played pretty good football and did a lot of good things, so there was growth and improvement.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Texans coach DeMeco Ryan sparked a bit of controversy among fans when he said that he would be “evaluating everything throughout the week” when asked about Caley’s future, which echoed a similar feel to that of former coordinator Bobby Slowik in 2024.\n\nNick Caserio when asked if Nick Caley will return in 2026:\n\n“Yeah I would anticipate Nick being here next year. Nick learned a lot, first opportunity as a play caller. Offensively, probably the last 2-3 months of the year, played pretty good football.” pic.twitter.com/GnfmGoHv62\n\n— Houston Stressans (@TexansCommenter) January 21, 2026\n\nWhile Caserio did say that nothing was final about any coach's return, he mentioned that he and Ryans speak daily and felt he wasn’t speaking out of line when dicussing the long-term status of the former New England Patriots tight ends coach.\n\n\"All of us are just trying to improve and do what we can to make the team and the organization better,” Caserio said.\n\nCaley replaced Slowik after an underwhelming second year running the offense with quarterback C.J. Stroud. Much to Caserio's comments, the offense did improve after a vastly underwhelming start, which resulted in an 0-3 record and four-game stretch where Stroud never scored a red-zone touchdown.\n\nWhile Caley's offense never took a colossal leap forward, the unit went from 23rd to 20th in total yards (319.7 to 327.0) and 21st to 13th in scoring (21.9 points per game to 23.8). Perhaps the biggest win came in the team's turnover ratio, which rapidly diminished from 19 in 2024 to just 12 in 2025 during the regular season.\n\nBut the playoffs are where Stroud and the overall struggles really reached a low for Caley's faults in year one. Over a two-game stretch, Stroud tossed five interceptions, including four first-half turnovers in the divisional round loss to the New England Patriots. He also had five fumbles and three turnovers in a wild-card round win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n#Texans GM Nick Caserio said he does expect OC Nick Caley to be back next season as the play-caller pic.twitter.com/8Y86EmOcr7\n\n— SportsTalk 790 (@SportsTalk790) January 21, 2026\n\nStroud seemed to be on board with a reunion for Caley in 2026 after seeing regular-season improvements the team's first 12-win season since 2012.\n\n\"Yeah, definitely. I love Cales,\" Stroud said. \"I think there's growth in our relationship, there's growth in his ability to call plays, growth and DeMeco trusted him.\"\n\nThe Texans also expected to have offensive line coach Cole Popovich back for next season after his promotion led to major changes to the trench play. Behind a makeshift offensive line that saw 13 different combinations, the Texans only allowed 31 total sacks and 113 pressures, which ranked 20th in the league.\n\n\"Overall, I would say that group certainly improved,\" Caserio said. \"I think Cole did a phenomenal job with that group, him and Coach [Zach] Yenser.\"\n\nThe Texans own the No. 28 pick in the upcoming NFL draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: Texans GM Nick Caserio 'expects' OC Nick Caley to return for 2026",

    "title": "Why Are We Still So Afraid of Using the Grumpy Old Period?",
    "description": "Exclamation marks, ellipses and ‘haha’ can’t fix our growing inability to communicate.",
    "fullText": "“How Many Exclamation Points Are Too Many in an Email? A Psychologist Weighs In.” A psychologist! This article appeared in Parade last summer, but you could find the same question being asked, at varying levels of desperation, in any season over the past decade. It is widely understood that exclamation points must be inserted into the modern professional email at precise intervals — just enough to create a tone of eagerness and warmth without tipping over into sounding fake, sycophantic or batty. So people appeal to the internet, terrified they’re hindering their careers by striking the wrong balance; they seek advice from job coaches; they joke about their obsessive budgeting of exclamations. They fear seeming overexcited, yes — but they also know the risks of the plain old period. Too brusque. Too cold. Too testy.\n\nIt has been this way since soon after the smartphone arrived, when older Americans started getting the unwelcome news that ending their messages with periods was a grave faux pas. This must have been a baffling experience, like being called gross for drinking water or flossing. But a new tonal consensus really had emerged: The period seemed pointed, stern, passive-aggressive. By 2013, this shift was ingrained enough that The New Republic ran an article celebrating the period’s newfound role as a jerk.\n\nSince then, our anxieties about tone seem to have skipped right over the content of our messages to the characters that end them. There has been a long parade of replacements for the period. The writer of that New Republic piece thought ellipses were nice. (They’re not; younger people find them not only Boomerish but also horror-movie ominous.) For a while, young people preferred the nervous chuckling of a “lol” or “haha.” (“Why Do Millennials Feel Compelled to Write ‘Lol’ After Everything?” asked Huffpost last fall — to which one answered that it was “like a tension-breaking mechanism,” while another pointed out that texting “I think I love you, lol” allows you to pretend you were kidding if you don’t get a favorable response.) Emoji, too, had their turn as sentence-enders — all except that subset, like the thumbs-up and the “OK” hand signal, that came to be associated with the same passive-aggressive terseness as the period, the equivalent of a clipped verbal “fine.”\n\nSome of these habits are still considered informal or even immature, but they have also aged their way up into typical workplace communication, and some people would love to impose a new consensus around them, too. “It’s impossible to convey emotions through text, and this helps the reader understand your intent,” someone posted on Reddit years ago, regarding lols and hahas. “I have coworkers who sound dead inside when we IM, because they believe any kind of informal slang is reserved for childish teens.”\n\nOveruse has taken the shine off some tactics, with young men in particular getting mocked for reflexively haha-ing in an effort to seem coolly unbothered. (“Men are always communicating like this via text-based platforms haha,” Kelly Conaboy once wrote on the website The Hairpin. “Why? haha. You don’t have to haha.”) In the workplace, though, more upscale methods of period avoidance have thrived. Consider, for instance, the application of question marks to non-questions we’re hoping to advance gently — the same wheedling uptalk used when we fake-wince and tell a colleague “I don’t know if that will work?” As speech, this habit is so associated with corporate management that it’s mocked in comedies like “Office Space” and early stories by George Saunders, who once had a police officer explain an apparent grave-robbing with the line “Typically it’s teens?” And yet in text it has irresistible utility.\n\nTo monitor one’s tone is human, but why are we this scared of sounding brusque in routine emails? The usual explanations revolve around the difficulties of conveying tone in writing. It’s a bit much to say that it’s “impossible to convey emotions through text” — I mean, literature exists — but the lack of access to vocal inflections, facial expressions and listener feedback does create challenges.\n\nIf the issue were just writing, though, you’d expect the rise of short-form video to solve it. Making a TikTok or YouTube video restores all of the inflection and expression people claim to be lost without. And yet the people on these platforms are not exactly bringing back deadpan or disdain. For the most part, they evince a manic desire to be ingratiating, with everything from lulling hand movements to singsong speech designed to be immediately liked.\n\nThe issue, in other words, isn’t the writing. It’s the lack of context — the fact that more and more of what we communicate is aimed at somebody we don’t know or rarely speak to, with little base line of what we’re normally like. This is true of social media audiences, but it may be equally true of a colleague from accounts payable — someone with whom we might, in another time, have been forced to negotiate some in-person rapport, but now interact with largely via bursts of typing. No amount of tone-marking seems likely to resolve our worries over this arrangement. Even the habits we make socially mandatory will just become invisible obligations that have to be augmented with even friendlier signals. And if this level of social anxiety has infiltrated the act of typing a message, you might as well embrace the full experience: Walk over to accounts payable and say it directly, in whatever expressionless monotone you like. If nothing else, you won’t have to wonder how your new friend reacted.",

    "title": "Spotify Lawsuit Triggered Anna's Archive Domain Name Suspensions",
    "description": "Spotify and several major record label have taken legal action against the unknown operators of Anna's Archive.",
    "fullText": "Anna’s Archive is generally known as a meta-search engine for shadow libraries, helping users find pirated books and other related resources.\n\nHowever, in December, the site announced that it had also backed up Spotify, which came as a shock to the music industry.\n\nWhile Anna’s Archive initially released only Spotify metadata, and no actual music, the industry was on high alert. Over Christmas, Spotify and the major labels prepared a legal response in U.S. federal court.\n\nOn December 29, Spotify, UMG, Sony, Warner, and other labels filed their complaint at the Southern District of New York. They accuse Anna’s Archive of mass copyright infringement, breach of contract, DMCA violations, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Anna’s Archive “brazenly” circumvented Spotify’s DRM. The site scraped 86 million music files and metadata for 256 million tracks from Spotify, which would all eventually be released publicly.\n\n“…Anna’s Archive has threatened to imminently mass-release and freely distribute its pirated copies of the sound recording files to the public, without authorization from or compensation to the relevant rights holders. Such widespread and illegal infringement would irreparably harm the music industry..,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe complaint comes with a request for a preliminary injunction and a restraining order that aim to take Anna’s Archive offline. All these documents were filed under seal, as the shadow library might otherwise be tipped off and take countermeasures.\n\nThese documents were filed ex-parte and kept away from Anna’s Archive. According to Spotify and the labels, this is needed “so that Anna’s Archive cannot pre-emptively frustrate” the countermeasures they seek.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was unsealed recently, explains directly why Anna’s Archive lost several of its domain names over the past weeks. The .ORG domain was suspended by the U.S.-based Public Interest Registry (PIR) in early January, while a domain registrar took the .SE variant offline a few days later.\n\n“We don’t believe this has to do with our Spotify backup,” AnnaArchivist said at the time, but court records prove them wrong.\n\nThe unsealed paperwork shows that the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on January 2, which aimed to target Anna’s Archive hosting and domain names. The sealed nature of this order also explains why the .ORG registry informed us that it could not comment on the suspension last week.\n\nWhile the .ORG and the .SE domains are suspended now, other domains remain operational. This suggests that the responsible registrars and registries do not automatically comply with U.S. court orders.\n\nWhile the TRO was not public, a preliminary injunction that was issued by U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff on January 16th shows how broad the granted powers are.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, and without a defense, the court concluded that the music companies’ copyright infringement claim will hold up. Therefore, the court ordered that Anna’s Archive is enjoined from ‘hosting, linking to, [or] distributing’ the copyrighted works.\n\nSince it’s uncertain whether Anna’s Archive will comply, the injunction also targets many third-party intermediaries, including domain registries and registrars, hosting companies, and other service providers.\n\nThese companies should assist in stopping the infringing activity on Anna’s Archive.\n\nTo avoid uncertainty, the court explicitly mentions that the targeted companies include the Public Interest Registry; Cloudflare Inc.; Switch Foundation; The Swedish Internet\n\nFoundation; National Internet Exchange of India; Njalla SRL; IQWeb FZ-LLC; Immaterialism Ltd.; Hosting Concepts B.V.; and Tucows Domains Inc.\n\nThe addition of Cloudflare stands out because the company operates a proxy service, without hosting Anna’s Archive’s content permanently. However, that was sufficient for the court to issue the order.\n\nWhile the unsealed documents resolve the domain suspension mystery, it is only the start of the legal battle in court. It is expected that Spotify and the music companies will do everything in their power to take further action, if needed.\n\nInterestingly, however, it appears that the music industry lawsuit may have already reached its goal. A few days ago, the dedicated Spotify download section was removed by Anna’s Archive.\n\nWhether this removal is linked to the legal troubles is unknown. However, it appears that Anna’s Archive stopped the specific distribution of Spotify content alleged in the complaint, seemingly in partial compliance with the injunction’s ban on ‘making available’ the scraped files.\n\nWhether this will mean that all troubles are now over has yet to be seen. For now, the copyright infringement allegations and other claims remain unresolved in court.\n\nA copy of the unsealed complaint filed by Spotify and the labels is available here (pdf). The preliminary injunction can be found here (pdf).",

    "description": "Data centers are shifting from NTP to PTP for precise time synchronization, enabling real-time workloads but requiring complex network upgrades.",
    "fullText": "Data centers are shifting from NTP to PTP for precise time synchronization, enabling real-time workloads but requiring complex hardware and network upgrades.\n\nFor decades, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been the gold standard for synchronizing time across data center networks. But increasingly, that’s no longer the case. Modern networking demands greater precision than ever, and the venerable NTP often falls short.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, data centers are now migrating to alternative methods for maintaining network time, such as the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) – an approach that is more complex to implement but worth the extra effort, enabling a whole new level of timing synchronization accuracy.\n\nNetwork time refers to the synchronization of time across devices connected to a network.\n\nTo exchange data accurately and avoid errors, all devices on a network must be synchronized. Otherwise, issues can arise, such as one server mistakenly treating data it received from another server as late due to inconsistencies in each server's time settings.\n\nKeeping network time in sync is important on any network. But it’s especially critical in data centers, which are typically home to large numbers of network-connected devices, and where small inconsistencies in network timing could snowball into major network synchronization problems.\n\nSince the 1980s, the main approach to synchronizing time across networks has been the Network Time Protocol (NTP). NTP works in a simple, straightforward way: devices on a network periodically check in with an NTP server, which tells them the correct time. If the time on a device is not in sync with the “official” time according to the NTP server, the device updates its time settings.\n\nNTP works very well in situations where networks can tolerate timing inconsistencies of up to a few milliseconds (meaning thousandths of a second). But beyond this, NTP-based time syncing is less reliable due to limitations such as:\n\nPeriodic check-ins: With NTP, devices only check in with NTP servers periodically – and often, several minutes can go by between verification events. In the meantime, devices may drift out of sync because their local clocks deviate from NTP-based time.\n\nNetwork latency issues: Even if devices were to poll NTP servers very frequently, delays in the time it takes for the server to respond over the network could contribute to inaccurate time readings. They may be measured only in small fractions of a second, but that’s still a problem for data centers that require incredibly precise network timing.\n\nComputational delays: Polling an NTP server and polling time data also takes time because it requires computational resources – and here again, although the delays may be extremely small, they can still matter.\n\nThese challenges render NTP unsuitable for data centers hosting workloads that demand true real-time data exchange – such as those that support real-time financial trading, robotic process coordination or the management of autonomous vehicles. To support cases like these, data centers need to maintain time with microsecond-level accuracy. (A microsecond is one-thousandth of a millisecond.)\n\nFortunately for data center operators facing challenges like these, there’s an alternative to NTP: the Precision Time Protocol (PTP).\n\nUnlike NTP, PTP doesn’t rely solely on a server-client model for syncing time across networked devices. Instead, it uses time servers in conjunction with a method called hardware timestamping on client devices. Hardware timestamping involves specialized hardware components, usually embedded in network interface cards (NICs), to track time.\n\nCentral time servers still exist under PTP. But rather than having software on servers connect to the time servers, hardware devices optimized for the task do this work. The devices also include built-in clocks, allowing them to record time data faster than they could if they had to forward it to the generic clock on a server.\n\nThe result is that, in most cases, PTP is much faster and more reliable than NTP. While timing inconsistencies may still occur, they’re usually much smaller under PTP.\n\nComprehensive statistics about the use of PTP are elusive. But some sources suggest that in real-time financial trading, for example, 85% of workloads now rely on PTP. Others predict that the market for PTP solutions will grow by a CAGR of about 8.5% through 2031.\n\nWhile PTP is more powerful and accurate than NTP, it’s also more complex (and, in many cases, more expensive) for data centers to implement. This is mainly because – whereas data center operators can implement an NTP server using just freely available software – PTP requires two key types of hardware components:\n\nNICs with hardware timestamping capabilities. As noted above, these play a key role in enabling PTP-based time measurement.\n\nA centralized, highly accurate clock that can feed time data to the PTP server. This is important because PTP is only accurate if the PTP server’s time readings are also accurate – and to achieve highly precise time readings, it works best to deploy a local time-keeping device, such as an atomic clock, directly within a data center. It’s also possible to retrieve time from remote time servers, but doing so usually introduces microsecond-level networking delays – and if your time readings are a few microseconds out of sync, you’ve defeated the whole purpose of using PTP in the first place.\n\nOn top of this, small inefficiencies in internal data center networking, such as congestion or packet loss issues that delay PTP time polling, can also make PTP inaccurate. Thus, to use PTP effectively, data center operators must optimize their networks and deploy the necessary hardware components.\n\nNone of this is easy. But again, it’s increasingly necessary for data centers aiming to redefine the meaning of “real time” and support workloads that just can’t tolerate the syncing delays of a network timing protocol designed forty years ago.\n\nAs workloads demand ever-greater precision, PTP is becoming the new standard for data center time synchronization. While its implementation is complex and costly, the benefits of microsecond-level accuracy far outweigh the challenges for data centers supporting real-time applications.\n\nChristopher Tozzi is a technology analyst with subject matter expertise in cloud computing, application development, open source software, virtualization, containers and more.

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - An Uzbek man was handed a life sentence on Wednesday after a military court in Moscow found him guilty of killing top ​Russian general Igor Kirillov and his assistant in a Ukraine-backed bomb attack in ‌2024.\n\nLieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who was chief of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, and his assistant, ‌Ilya Polikarpov, were killed outside an apartment building in Moscow after a bomb hidden in an electric scooter was remotely detonated in December 2024.\n\nUkraine's SBU intelligence service said it was behind the high-profile hit, one of a string of targeted killings it has organised inside Russia ⁠to punish people it deems responsible ‌for Moscow's war in Ukraine. Russia says the killings amount to acts of state terrorism.\n\nUzbek national Akhmadzhon Kurbonov and three accomplices were found ‍guilty of various crimes related to the Kirillov killing, including terrorism and the illegal trafficking of explosives, Russian investigators said on Wednesday.\n\nThe three accomplices were given jail sentences in maximum security correctional prison ​camps ranging from 18 to 25 years, the Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, ‌said in a statement.\n\nKurbonov, who is now due to spend the rest of his life in a special regime correctional prison camp, pleaded guilty to the charges, while the others did not, Russian media reported. Reuters was not able to contact lawyers for the men.\n\nThe Investigative Committee said Kirillov's murder had been planned in Ukraine.\n\nThe perpetrators had smuggled the ⁠explosives into Russia from Poland, and one of ​the four men, Robert Safaryan, had stored the components ​at his home in Russia, it said.\n\nKurbonov had then assembled the bomb, planted it and remotely detonated it as Kirillov and Polikarpov stepped out of ‍the building.\n\nA string of ⁠senior Russian military figures have been killed since the start of the war in Ukraine nearly four years ago.\n\nThe latest was Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, head ⁠of the Russian General Staff's army operational training directorate, who died after a bomb planted under his car ‌went off last month.\n\nUkraine has not claimed responsibility for Sarvarov's death.",

    "fullText": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Canadian beef will be exported to China following the relaxation of an import ban that had been in ​place since 2021, the agriculture minister said, though analysts cautioned it will likely ‌be in small amounts.\n\nThe reopening of what could be a vital market for Canadian beef follows the visit ‌of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who reached an agreement with China's leadership to lower tariffs and do more business on a number of agricultural commodities, including canola.\n\n\"We know that there's a large company that's shipping its first load of beef to China next week,\" said Canadian ⁠Agriculture Minister Heath MacDonald on ‌Tuesday. Earlier on social media he said \"China has lifted market access for Canadian beef.\"\n\nChina's customs agency did not immediately respond to a request ‍for comment.\n\nThe move is not expected to have an immediate major impact on Canadian beef exports or prices because North America has a shortage of domestic beef and prices are historically high.\n\nSylvain Charlebois, a ​food market expert known as The Food Professor, said: \"China reopening or expanding access for ‌Canadian beef won't move food prices in Canada in any meaningful way.\n\n\"The volumes involved are relatively small, and Canada simply doesn't have the scale to divert large amounts of beef away from the domestic market without disrupting other exports first.\"\n\nHowever, China is an important market for certain cuts of beef, so the reopening is important for Canadian farmers and ⁠beef exporters.\n\nBeef market analyst Jerry Klassen said: \"It's very important ​for Canadian beef farmers to have access to as ​many markets as possible. The Chinese market is very important because it has potential for significant growth.\"\n\nKlassen and the Canadian Cattle Association said the ‍details on the reopening ⁠were not yet available, so the full implications would only be understood once they were. However the association celebrated the resumption of trade.\n\nChina was Canada's fourth largest ⁠beef market in 2021, before being suspended in December of that year.\n\nChina can be a vital export market ‌for Canada when North America has a beef surplus and domestic prices ‌are low.",

    "fullText": "A tense scene unfolded in Willowbrook after a federal agent opened fire during an immigration operation on Wednesday morning, prompting a large response from local and federal authorities.\n\nA federal agent opened fire while conducting an operation in the parking lot of an apartment building near the intersection of 126th Street and Mona Boulevard. No one was hit, but it triggered a large response from authorities as crowds of people gathered amid the chaos.\n\nShortly after 7 a.m., U.S. Border Patrol informed the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department that the agency was conducting an operation in the area, according to LASD. The shooting occurred shortly afterward.\n\nIn a statement provided to ABC7, the Department of Homeland Security said the targeted operation began in nearby Compton, \"to arrest a violent criminal illegal alien from El Salvador, William Eduardo Moran Carballo, who is involved in a human smuggling operation and has two prior arrests for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.\"\n\nAn immigration judge issued Carballo a final order of removal in 2019, according to DHS.\n\nDHS says Carballo tried to evade arrest around 7 a.m. on Wednesday and rammed his vehicle into law enforcement. That's when one of the agents fired at Carballo, missing him, and he was taken into custody.\n\n\"In a dangerous attempt to evade arrest, this criminal illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement,\" the Homeland Security statement read. \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots. The criminal illegal alien was not hit and attempted to flee on foot. He was successfully apprehended by law enforcement. The illegal alien was not injured, but a CBP officer was injured.\"\n\nFurther details on the officer's injury were not provided.\n\nVideo provided to Eyewitness News by a neighbor shows the man leaving the apartment building, getting into his car and driving away. Seconds later, neighbors say Border Patrol tried to take him into custody, and that's when the shooting occurred.\n\nAlong with several federal agents in tactical gear, sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers responded to the scene.\n\n\"This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming,\" DHS said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI told ABC7 that the agency was not a part of the operation and said that an evidence response team was being sent to the scene.\n\nA large group of residents and activists gathered near the scene late Wednesday morning as more agents arrived, denouncing their presence.\n\nIncredibly tense situation in #compton right now. Residents and activists are confronting agents performing immigration enforcement @ABC7 pic.twitter.com/s1C0JXGwWz\n\n— Josh Haskell (@abc7JoshHaskell) January 21, 2026\n\nSome were seen holding Mexican flags and filming videos on their phone. At one point, the group was yelling at members of the sheriff's department.\n\n\"I saw the car crash... it was just crazy,\" said one resident who lives in the area. \"It's just crazy how they're coming over here and interrupting everybody's livelihood and their lives... this is just their lives.\"\n\nSome of the people who showed up are TikTokers who said they're working to be a voice for those who may be afraid.\n\n\"The federal ones... they like to come and go,\" said Angie Vargas, a local TikToker and live streamer. \"They like to move quick, so the fact that they're here and this incident happened, I think honestly, they came to the wrong city. A lot of us are out against what's going on, but yes, they are around our city, and I think there's a lot of us out here... supporting the community, being an extra set of eyes for them. That's why we're here. We're filming. We're bringing everything... the truth of what's going on, because there's a lot of people that are scared to come out and see what's going on.\"\n\n\"People are not going to work. They're causing disruptions. It's heartbreaking. It hurts. Why are you all here?\" said neighbor Andre Smith. \"I heard this is border patrol. If this is border patrol, ya'll need to go and patrol the border.\"\n\n\"It brings a lot of chaos to the kids, to people that have no citizenship. They're just here to work. That's why we're here to support our people,\" said Eric, whose family lives nearby. \"They've been taking people with citizenships just because of the color of our skin. We're tired of it already. We need them out of here.\"\n\nThere were some tense moments between the federal agents and protesters, but it appears no less-than-lethal rounds were fired and no protesters were arrested.",

    "fullText": "NASA astronaut Suni Williams, who famously stayed in space for an extended nine-month visit because of problems with an experimental capsule, has retired after 27 years, NASA said Tuesday.\n\nWilliams retired effective Dec. 27, NASA said in a statement. Williams, a former Navy pilot, joined NASA in 1988.\n\n\"Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in the statement.\n\nWilliams went on three missions to the International Space Station, the first of which was in 2006 and in which she was carried aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA said.\n\nBut it was the most recent, in 2024, in which the planned one-week stay stretched from June until March 2025 because of concerns over Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, which was on a test mission.\n\nStarliner launched June 5, 2024, taking Williams and Butch Wilmore to the space station on its first crewed flight. But there were problems with the capsule's thrusters during the docking process, and eventually, in September, NASA decided to return the capsule with no one on board.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore spent 286 days aboard the International Space Station.\n\nA SpaceX Dragon capsule was then sent up to bring the pair, as well as two other astronauts who were wrapping up a six-month mission, back to Earth. The Dragon capsule left the space station on March 18 and splashed down in the ocean off Florida.\n\nOver her career, Williams logged 608 days in space, which is the second-longest cumulative time in space in NASA history, the space agency said.\n\nShe also logged the most spacewalk time of any female astronaut, at 62 hours and 6 minutes, which is the fourth-most time of any NASA astronaut, it said.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have said they enjoyed their extended time living and working at the orbiting outpost, even though it was longer than expected.\n\n\"The plan went way off for what we had planned, but because we’re in human spaceflight, we prepare for any number of contingencies,” Wilmore said in late March, after they returned to Earth. “This is a curvy road. You never know where it’s going to go.”\n\nWilliams said her recovery on Earth after the longer-than-intended space stay was helped by her previous space flights.\n\n“Though it was longer than any flight either one of us have flown before, I think my body remembered,” she told NBC News in an interview alongside Wil\n\nWilliams called her career and the opportunities to serve at NASA an \"incredible honor.\"\n\n\"Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,\" she said in NASA's statement.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "Packing for a cruise comes with a lot of considerations — from what you’ll need on board the ship and in ports of call to what you shouldn’t bring for lack of space in your compact cabin or due to cruise line rules.\n\nCruise lines prohibit an array of items on their ships to ensure safe sailings, but those aren’t the only items that could get you into trouble for bringing on a cruise. The destinations you visit on a cruise also have their own sets of rules that cruise passengers need to keep in mind. Laws can change at any time, so it’s important to always double check travel guidance for your ports of call before a cruise, even if you’ve visited the destinations in the past.\n\nPassengers who are visiting cruise ports in Mexico, including Cozumel, Costa Maya, and Cabo San Lucas, on 2026 cruises are being warned about a strict new law that just went into effect in the country that applies to something many cruisers may have in their bags when coming ashore in ports of call.\n\nDoug Parker shared more details on the new ban in Mexico that cruise travelers visiting the country need to know about, and more cruise news, on the Jan. 21 edition of Cruise News Today.\n\nWant the latest cruise news and deals? \n\nCruise News Today with Doug Parker.\n\nGood morning, here's your cruise news for Wednesday, January 21st.\n\nA cruise passenger is missing after jumping overboard from a ship in the South Pacific. A 66-year-old American man jumped off of Star Breeze, operated by Windstar Cruises, early Sunday while the ship was sailing in French Polynesia.\n\nLocal reports say the incident followed an argument with his wife. The ship conducted an immediate search, joined later by French Navy patrol boats. The man has not been located, and the investigation is ongoing. The ship has since continued its itinerary.\n\nThis is the second man overboard of 2026.\n\nAnd cruise passengers heading to Mexico are being warned: leave your vapes on the ship.\n\nAs of January 17th, Mexico has banned the import, sale, and marketing of vapes and e-cigarettes. That means bringing a vape ashore during a port stop, even for personal use, could be considered illegal importation. Penalties include confiscation, fines up to $12,500, or even jail.\n\nCruise lines say vapes are still allowed on board in designated areas, but not ashore in Mexican ports. It should be noted that this is for all cruise ports in Mexico, not just Cozumel.\n\nAnd a follow-up to that story we brought you Monday, where opposition is growing against a proposed cruise port near the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay.\n\nNow, a Change.org petition started just four days ago has already collected more than 6,300 signatures. Local residents and environmental advocates say the development threatens fragile marine ecosystems and could overwhelm area infrastructure.\n\nThe 328-acre site near Rattlesnake Key is still very much in the planning stages.

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during the medical crisis.\n\nDuring their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.\n\nNASA’s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.”\n\nIt was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. “It really helped,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"\n\nThe space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.\n\n“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”\n\nJoining them on what turned out to be a 5 1/2-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched last August from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off the San Diego coast last week.\n\nWelcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who aren't due to launch until mid-February. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.\n\n“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Shortly after his arrest in early October, Little Village construction worker Juan Espinoza Martinez was led by three federal agents into a windowless interview room, still dressed in a green work T-shirt and carrying a small bottle of water.\n\n“You’re probably a little confused about what’s going on today, so I’m gonna try to explain it all to you,” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Christopher Perugini told Espinoza Martinez at the outset of the Oct. 6 videotaped interview, which was played for a federal jury Wednesday. “Feel free to ask me any questions you want.”\n\nThen, the agents laid it on Espinoza Martinez, a 37-year-old father of three, why he was there.\n\n“Murder for hire?” Espinoza responded, holding up his hands questioningly.\n\n“Correct, so that’s what the charge you’re charged with,” Perugini said. “I’ll explain it to you as we’re going.”\n\nThe agents then confronted Espinoza Martinez with text messages he’d sent an acquaintance that included a photo of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who was then the face of Operation Midway Blitz, along with what agents characterized as cash bounties for Bovino’s kidnapping and murder.\n\nOver the course of the interview, the agents pressed Espinoza Martinez repeatedly on how he thought the messages looked. He said over and over he meant nothing by it, that they were nothing more than social media chatter, and that he had no intention of making any actual offer for Bovino’s killing.\n\n“I’m really confused about this,” Espinoza said at one point in the interview. “I have no gang affiliation…I’m not nowhere around there. I work for a living every day. I’m a union worker. I work concrete, so I don’t know.”\n\nPortions of the videotaped interview were played for jurors in court Wednesday as the trial of Espinoza Martinez got underway before U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who has lived in Chicago for years but is not a U.S. citizen, is charged in an indictment with a single count of solicitation of murder for hire, which carries up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Espinoza Martinez told an acquaintance from the construction business, Adrian Jimenez, after an immigration agent shot a woman in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood on Oct. 4 “that he had dispatched members of the Latin Kings” to the area of 39th Street and Kedzie Avenue in response to the shooting.\n\nJimenez, who had worked as a government informant on and off for years, called up Homeland Security and shared the Snapchat messages that Espinoza Martinez had sent him saying, “2k on information when you get him” and “10k if u take him down,” along with Bovino’s photo, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney Minje Shin said the case was not about someone charged with “expressing strong, even angry, views about immigration enforcement policy” or a hatred of Bovino.\n\n“Make no mistake – the evidence in this case will show that what the defendant did was not a joke, not just mouthing off, not just him blowing off steam behind a keyboard, not political discourse … what the defendant did was a solicitation of murder,” Shin said.\n\nShin said Espinoza Martinez was “fixated” on Bovino, who was “the face of the threat” to arrest, detain, and deport members of his community in Little Village, a threat that “hit close to home.”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s attorney, Jonathan Bedi, told the jurors in his opening remarks that the case was “riddled” with reasonable doubt because “the government cannot point to anything that shows Juan’s intent.”\n\n“When you cut through all of their words…all they have is their guesses and speculation,” Bedi said. “They are guessing.”\n\nBedi says there were no bags of money, no follow up, no recordings, no discussion of any plans. No location scouting, no escape route, no surveillance, no communication saying “Bovino’s here now would be a good time to act.”\n\n“Repeating neighborhood gossip is not a federal crime,” he said.\n\nBefore the Espinoza Martinez’s taped interview was played, jurors heard testimony from the informant, Jimenez, who walked slowly into court with a pronounced limp from a back issue he’s been suffering.\n\nDressed in a blue suit, with a salt-and-pepper beard, Jimenez said he’s been in construction for decades and recently started his own construction business. He also was convicted in 2000 of a felony and spent several years in prison.\n\nThough the jury did not hear details of that case, court records show Jimenez’s conviction was for an armed robbery and home invasion in Franklin Park that was charged in 2000. He was later sentenced to six years behind bars.\n\nJimenez told the jury he’s known Espinoza Martinez for “less than a year.” The defendant first reached out to him on Snapchat, looking for construction work, he said.\n\nJimenez testified he took photos of the Snapchat messages received from Espinoza Martinez on Oct. 2 and “almost immediately” contacted agents with HSI about them.\n\nJimenez testifies he had conversations about immigration with Espinoza Martinez “more than a few times.”\n\nBut when Shin attempted to ask what they talked about specifically, the defense repeatedly objected and the judge sustained it.\n\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Dena Singer asked Jimenez a series of questions: You have a family, right? You work? You want to continue working and you want to continue staying in the U.S.? And you take care of your kids?\n\nJimenez answered “Yes” to all of them.\n\n“And you’re not somebody who commits murder-for-hire, right?” Singer asked,\n\nSinger also got Jimenez to acknowledge that Espinoza Martinez never asked him to take any action against Bovino or share the message with any wider audience.\n\nDid he ever say “Here’s where Bovino is going to be next?” Singer asked.\n\n“Did he ever say “Here’s a picture of cash,” or “I have someone who can pay you all this cash?'”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s trial is the first criminal case to stem from Operation Midway Blitz to go to trial.\n\nThough limited in scope, the case is expected to offer an important litmus test as immigration-enforcement operations continue to roil Chicago and other Democrat-led cities long targeted by President Donald Trump, including Minneapolis, where the killing of a U.S. citizen by an immigration agent earlier this month has sparked nationwide protests.\n\nThe case was held up by top Department of Homeland Security officials as an example of the violence and threats immigration agents were facing from gang members and even international drug cartels.\n\nIn the months since, however, evidence of Espinoza Martinez’s supposed gang affiliations has not materialized. Prosecutors vastly toned down that aspect of the case, first dropping mention of gang affiliation in the indictment handed up by a grand jury, then saying in a pretrial hearing they only intended to prove Espinoza Martinez had an “affinity” for the Latin Kings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the defense objected to prosecutors introducing a text string where Espinoza Martinez told an unidentified contact: “It’s going down bro my guys are ready in the vill (Little Village). Saints sd and 2Six being bitches. Kings on they ass n they scared.”\n\nProsecutors argued the conversation showed Espinoza Martinez was disappointed other gangs weren’t fighting back.\n\nBut Lefkow sided partially with the defense, saying the comments on Little Village can be shown to the jury, but not the references to the Latin Saints or Two-Six gangs.\n\nShe also excluded later text by Espinoza Martinez about “Chapo” having the Latin Kings’ back — a reference to former Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.",

    "fullText": "The hairstylist for the film \"The Cleaning Lady\" has clarified her comments about executive producer Timothy Busfield.\n\nShe said she was unaware her conversation with a detective was recorded and stressed she aimed to speak truthfully about her observations.\n\nTimothy Busfield, 68, who faces charges of sexual abuse involving a child actor and his twin, has denied all the allegations.\n\nDanielle Vigil, the hairstylist for \"The Cleaning Lady,\" is clarifying statements she made regarding Timothy Busfield following his arrest on child sexual abuse charges.\n\nVigil stated her previous comments, in which she said she saw Busfield kiss two kids on their foreheads in a trailer on set, were \"misconstrued\" and emphasized that she never intended to accuse anyone or speculate about the case.\n\nIn a statement to Us Weekly, Vigil explained that she had been contacted by a detective about a child-related investigation, which caused her \"significant emotional distress\" due to her personal history, as her daughter was tragically murdered several years ago.\n\nVigil said she initially felt \"caught off guard and fearful\" that the investigation might involve her own children or grandchildren.\n\n\"During the call, I expressed discomfort with continuing the conversation,\" she wrote. \"However, due to my lived experience with my daughter's unsolved murder, and my belief that silence and lack of cooperation can sometimes prevent justice, I ultimately chose to answer questions about what I had personally observed.\"\n\nShe emphasized that her aim was \"never to speculate, accuse, or harm anyone, but to speak truthfully about my own perceptions as requested.\"\n\nVigil noted that she was unaware the call was being recorded, saying, \"Had I been aware that my words were being recorded or that the detective would use the conversation to fit his narrative, I would have chosen my language more carefully and ensured that my statements were fully contextualized.\"\n\nShe added that she did not anticipate her comments would be used as part of official testimony against Busfield.\n\nExpressing frustration over how her statements were reported, Vigil said portions of her conversation were \"selectively presented in a manner that does not reflect the full context\" and misrepresented her intentions.\n\nVigil described submitting her clarification in the \"interest of accuracy, fairness, and transparency,\" insisting her goal has always been to tell the truth responsibly.\n\n\"This statement is not intended to interfere with any investigation,\" she added about her remarks being used in the Busfield case. \"It is solely meant to clarify my position, my intentions, and the circumstances under which my statements were made.\"\n\nThe hairstylist then noted, \"I have always believed in telling the truth and acting in good faith, especially when the safety of children is involved. I also believe that truth must be handled responsibly and in full context.\"\n\nBusfield, 68, faces charges including two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and child abuse.\n\nAccording to reports, the allegations involve inappropriate behavior toward a child actor and his twin on the set of Fox's \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which Busfield directed several episodes of.\n\nBusfield has denied the allegations, maintaining he had no physical contact with the children. After turning himself in, he spoke to TMZ, asserting, \"I'm going to confront these lies. They're horrible. They're all lies, and I did not do anything to those little boys. I'm going to fight it. I'm going to fight it with a great team, and I'm going to be exonerated. I know I am because this is all so wrong and all lies.\"\n\nDuring a hearing on January 21, Busfield was released ahead of trial. The judge ordered him to maintain communication with his attorney, refrain from possessing firearms, and avoid contact with the alleged victims. His next court date has not been scheduled yet.\n\nProsecutors had requested that Busfield remain in custody until his trial, describing him as \"an ongoing and serious danger to children and the community.\"\n\nIn a pretrial filing, the Bernalillo County District Attorney's office referenced what they characterized as a pattern of \"sexual misconduct, abuse of authority, and grooming behavior\" to justify his continued detention.\n\nIn response, Busfield's legal team argued in a 237-page court document that the boys' mother, whose children were replaced during filming, was seeking revenge against the director.\n\nThey also noted that Busfield had successfully completed an independently administered polygraph test and that a professional psychosexual evaluation determined he \"does not appear to have a sexual attraction to prepubescent or adolescent males or females.\"\n\nThe defense also submitted numerous character reference letters to the court from friends and family members, including his wife, actress Melissa Gilbert, who had not previously commented publicly on the allegations against Busfield.",

Less in-person work may increase office vacancy rates and reduce foot traffic to other businesses located in office-dense areas,\" according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThat shift played out firsthand near my former office, where a Starbucks in the attached hotel closed after the pandemic.\n\nFor businesses, it's death by a thousand paper cuts. It's not the loss of any one customer, but thousands of them visiting less often.\n\nRestaurants, coffee shops, and bars have felt the pinch from hybrid work situations.\n\n“Even though you may be busy on Wednesday and Thursday, your Mondays and Fridays may be very slow,” Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance told CNBC. “If someone was to walk by a restaurant around lunch or dinner time on a Thursday, they may say, ‘Wow, that restaurant’s packed, they’re so busy,’ but it’s not like that every single day.”\n\n\"In cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta, the three-day in-person work week has posed challenges for hospitality businesses. With fewer workers in offices on Mondays and Fridays — which for some businesses were their strongest sales days — many businesses have been forced to shift work schedules or launch initiatives to pull in customers at the start and end of the week,\" CNBC reported.\n\nThis change in consumer behavior has forced an iconic Boston marketplace to close its doors forever.\n\nFood halls have been a growing trend in tourist areas, driven by the Covid shutdown of buffets. In Las Vegas, where there used to be buffets in nearly every hotel on the Strip, only a handful remain, and more food halls have opened.\n\nA modern take on the mall food court, food halls offer multiple restaurants under the same roof. Some even offer ordering via QR code, making it easy to have a meal where dishes come from multiple restaurants.\n\nThis concept has also been adopted in cities as a way to serve workers, and one of the best-known food halls, Time Out Market, located near Fenway Park, has decided to close its doors.\n\n\"Following the pandemic, we have seen the Boston Market recover and grow, and we have focused on initiatives driving further growth; however, footfall until today remains inconsistent in the area due to ongoing hybrid working and in addition, operating costs have increased — all of which prevents consistent profitability,\" Time Out Market CEO Michael Marlay said in a statement.",

    "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says ‘a lot’ of six-figure jobs in plumbing and construction are about to be unlocked because someone needs to build all these new AI centers",
    "description": "The AI boom is threatening white-collar entry jobs—but it’s creating a booming six-figure opportunity for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers.",
    "fullText": "The job market has been a tough sell for many Gen Z graduates, with tariffs, economic uncertainty, and artificial intelligence reshaping hiring plans across corporate America. But according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, the next wave of six-figure opportunities won’t be found in a Wall Street cubicle or Silicon Valley Slack channel. Instead, high-paying careers will partially come by picking up a wrench—literally.\n\nAs tech giants race to build sprawling data centers—totaling $7 trillion in global capital outlays by the end of the decade—Huang believes the world is on the cusp of what he calls the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” which will create “a lot of jobs.”\n\n“It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe hands-on skills needed to construct what he described as chip, computer, and AI factories are already facing shortages—even though many roles pay over $100,000 without requiring a college degree. One McKinsey report estimated that between 2023 and 2030, there will be a need for an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—in the U.S. alone.\n\n“Everybody should be able to make a great living,” Huang said. “You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Huang has expressed his optimistic outlook on new career paths emerging alongside AI.\n\n“The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom,” he told Channel 4 News in the U.K. last year. “You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.”\n\nThat optimism stands in contrast to warnings from leaders like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has repeatedly cautioned that AI is hollowing out traditional white-collar entry points—just as the education system continues to funnel students toward four-year degrees.\n\n“There’s more than one way to the American Dream, but our whole education system is focused on four-year [college] education,” Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year. “Hiring an entry worker at a tech company has fallen 50% since 2019. Is that really where we want all of our kids to go? Artificial intelligence is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”",

    "fullText": "AI czar David Sacks said California is taking a potentially \"scary direction\" if voters approve a wealth tax on billionaires.\n\n\"This is not a tax, this is an asset seizure,\" Sacks told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nSacks, a longtime venture capitalist, is just one of the many voices in the tech industry who have denounced \"The Billionaire Act.\"\n\nCraft Ventures, the firm Sacks cofounded with Bill Lee, previously announced that Sacks had relocated to the Austin area in December. According to Bloomberg, Sacks is a billionaire and thus could have been subject to the tax.\n\nWhile the proposal is limited, Sacks said it would just be the beginning.\n\n\"It's not a one-time. It's a first time,\" he said. \"And if they get away with it, there'll be a second time and a third time. And this will be the beginning of something very new and different in this country.\"\n\nIf passed, California residents with a net worth of over $1.1 billion would face a one-time tax totalling 5% of their assets. (Residents with a net worth between $1 billion and $1.1 billion would pay a smaller tax.)\n\nGoogle cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved entities tied to them out of California ahead of the deadline. Other billionaires, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have said they won't leave the state.\n\nThe tax has yet to be approved. Supporters are still gathering enough signatures to put the issue before California voters this November. If they meet that threshold, a majority of voters would then need to support it. It's likely legal challenges would ensue as well.\n\nSacks said Gov. Gavin Newsom deserves blame for the current situation for not opposing the tax sooner and \"vocally\" enough.\n\nTara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, pointed to the governor's history of questioning earlier wealth tax proposals going back to 2020.\n\n\"Clearly, David Sacks didn't know what he was talking about,\" she said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn recent weeks, Newsom has continued to step up his opposition to such a tax.\n\n\"I'll do what I have to do to protect the state,\" Newsom told The New York Times in an interview earlier this month.\n\nIn a separate interview, Newsom said the news that billionaires like Brin and Page were leaving the state was exactly the response he had feared. California is home to more billionaires than any other state.\n\n\"This is my fear. It's just what I warned against,\" Newsom told Politico. \"It's happening.\"",

    "title": "Brooklyn Beckham confirmed his family feud. PR experts are wincing — and say David and Victoria should stay silent.",
    "description": "Brooklyn Beckham recently confirmed long-standing rumors of a family feud. PR experts say David and Victoria Beckham should proceed with restraint.",
    "fullText": "If you're a publicist watching Brooklyn Peltz Beckham this week, you're probably wincing.\n\nOn Monday evening, the eldest in the Beckham brood confirmed long-standing rumors of a rift between himself and his parents, A-list power couple David and Victoria Beckham — although, through Brooklyn's lens, the rift appears closer to an impassable canyon.\n\n\"I do not want to reconcile with my family,\" Brooklyn wrote in a six-part Instagram Story. \"I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.\"\n\nWhile certainly juicy, Brooklyn's scathing accusations struck PR experts as less than shrewd.\n\n\"He didn't just light a match. He brought a flamethrower to the bridges,\" Mike Fahey, the founder and CEO of the PR agency Fahey Communications, told Business Insider.\n\nBrooklyn went on to accuse his parents of \"trying endlessly to ruin\" his relationship with his wife, Nicola Peltz Beckham, and soiling their 2022 wedding with \"anxiety and embarrassment.\" He also said his parents have planted unflattering stories in the tabloids about the couple, presumably referring to the frequent reports that painted Nicola as a controlling and all-consuming influence in Brooklyn's life.\n\n\"My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first,\" Brooklyn wrote.\n\nHe concluded the series of posts with an appeal that, given the extremity of his method, could be read as counterproductive: \"My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation.\"\n\nBrooklyn, Nicola, David, and Victoria did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. So far, no party has directly addressed Brooklyn's posts publicly.\n\nBrooklyn's statement immediately ignited a firestorm on social media, and an eruption of headlines followed suit. \"Brooklyn goes nuclear\" became a popular phrase, while some British tabloids framed the statement as an \"outburst\" or \"temper tantrum.\"\n\n\"It is wild to see that something that started as Deuxmoi posts and whispers on gossip sites has now gone so mainstream, and it's everywhere,\" Fahey said. \"Him doing this six-page Instagram Story takes this from speculation to, literally, a royal-family-style fracture — front-page news everywhere.\"\n\nIndeed, rumors of a Beckham family feud — Brooklyn and Nicola on one side, David and Victoria on the other — have been just that for years. Fans began to wonder if something was amiss when Nicola wore a Valentino wedding gown instead of a design by her fashionable mother-in-law, though Nicola repeatedly denied it was a snub. Still, tabloids ran wild with reports of unspecified \"tensions,\" sweeping accusations of narcissism, and unrealistic \"demands\" from one camp or the other, reaching a fever pitch when Brooklyn and Nicola were absent from his father's 50th birthday celebrations last year.\n\nNow, Brooklyn's communication strategy has shifted firmly away from off-the-record comments and anonymous sources who are \"familiar with the situation.\" In doing so, he's removed any option for plausible deniability. No longer can he or anyone in his orbit simply shrug off questions about their familial drama.\n\n\"This is obviously a drastic change,\" Fahey said. \"This isn't even a 180. It's like a 1,080.\"\n\nBrooklyn's bombshell comments contrast sharply with the Beckham family brand of elegant, unified self-promotion, which was honed over many years of public appearances, marketing campaigns, and, most recently, his-and-hers Netflix documentaries for David and Victoria.\n\n\"If this was vetted by a publicist, it wasn't a very good one, because the level of detail and the way it is written are not PR-savvy whatsoever,\" Fahey said of Brooklyn's statement. \"It comes across as unpolished. It is airing the family laundry.\"\n\nTara Goodwin, a crisis communications expert and author of \"Manage the Message, Change the Outcome: An Executive's Guide to Crisis Management,\" echoed Fahey's analysis, describing Brooklyn's approach as \"more emotional than strategic.\"\n\n\"He has the power to push the agenda and create a spectacle, and that's what he's trying to do,\" Goodwin said. \"What I would say to him if he were my client is, 'Take a breath.' Restraint gives you more choices, because once it's in the public domain, you think you're controlling the narrative, but you actually lose control of it.\"\n\nIf Brooklyn gave a crisis PR crash course in what not to do, his parents are more likely to take the safer route: silence.\n\nThe day after his son's complaints went live, David appeared on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" yet he smartly avoided mentioning Brooklyn by name. Instead, he advised general caution with social media, especially for kids.\n\n\"They make mistakes, but children are allowed to make mistakes. That is how they learn,\" David said. \"That is what I try to teach my kids. You sometimes have to let them make those mistakes as well.\"\n\nFahey described this comment as a masterclass in celebrity image management: \"That is a brilliant way of sending a message without saying anything of substance,\" he said.\n\nNot only would a direct public response to Brooklyn clash spectacularly with the established Beckham brand, but David and Victoria are famous and beloved enough that there's very little risk in staying mum.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to hurt the Beckham brand at this juncture,\" Goodwin said. \"If this is protracted and goes on, and he has more to say, there could be some reverberations, but at the moment, I think most people are going to see this for what it is. I​​t's a difficult family moment that probably should have remained private.\"\n\nMoreover, being the parents in this situation, meeting Brooklyn's energy would likely be perceived as petty or punching down. Even though Brooklyn is 26, he's still their son, and they stand accused of disrespecting his boundaries. Now that he's loudly and explicitly asking for space, David and Victoria would be wise to heed his wishes.\n\n\"If I'm their publicist, I'm like, 'Let's let this die down. Let's try to do something behind closed doors. Let's try to mend fences privately,'\" Fahey said. \"Having this play out in the court of public opinion is not going to benefit anyone.\"\n\nIf the goal here is neither fame (according to Brooklyn) nor money (Nicola is a billionaire heiress, and the Beckhams' net worth is nothing to scoff at, either), the only benefit left is narrative control. However, with a narrative as intimate and messy as this one, both Fahey and Goodwin agreed that it's not worth braving the internet's brutal jury.\n\n\"Maybe you air that out with your therapists and not millions of people online,\" Fahey said.",

    "fullText": "Bumble's chief product officer is out as the result of a recent leadership restructuring within the dating app company, Business Insider confirmed.\n\nMichael Affronti, Bumble's chief product officer and one of two executives who remained after Whitney Wolfe Herd was reinstated as CEO, has left the company after a year in the role.\n\nIn an end-of-year message to staff obtained by Business Insider, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd shared that she and Affronti, who was hired in January 2025, had \"mutually agreed that the best path forward for the company is to centralize Product, Engineering, and Design under one leader.\"\n\nVivek Sagi, previously the company's chief technology officer, now holds the new title of chief product and technology officer. A source familiar with the matter said that much of Bumble's engineering talent is based in Austin, where Sagi is based.\n\n\"I know this news will land differently across the organization,\" Herd wrote in the December note. \"Michael has been a strong leadership presence across Bumble, and I want to thank you all in advance for supporting one another as we move through this transition.\"\n\nAffronti was one of two remaining executives who worked under Lidiane Jones, who served as Bumble's CEO from January 2024 to March 2025. After Herd, who founded Bumble, announced her return as CEO in 2025, a string of executives left, including the company's CMO, CTO, CLO, and CBO.\n\nDavid Ard, Bumble's chief people officer, is the only C-suiter left at Bumble who was hired before March 2025, when Herd officially took over.\n\nIn her message to staff, Herd described a \"year of meaningful transformation for our company.\"\n\n\"Over the past several weeks, and in close partnership with our Board, we've taken a hard, honest look at where our business stands and what our members need from us right now,\" Herd wrote. \"What's become clear is that we need to sharpen our focus so we can stabilize our core, prioritize our product investments with intention, and set ourselves up for a confident return to growth.\"\n\nBumble had a rough 2025. The company's stock has fallen 52.35% in the last year.\n\nIn response to Herd's note, Affronti sent his own note to the company's staff.\n\n\"I have a strong, enduring belief in Bumble's mission and in our ability to return to growth and become a truly massive, category-defining business,\" Affronti wrote. \"I feel incredibly positive about the direction we're heading and the clarity we now have to operate in a way that lets our teams do their best work.\"\n\nBefore joining Bumble, Affronti served as a senior vice president and general manager at Salesforce. Jones, Herd's predecessor, came to Bumble from Salesforce as the former CEO of Slack.\n\nBumble announced Affronti's hiring on January 6, 2025. 11 days later, the company announced Jones' exit and Herd's reemergence as CEO.\n\nAffronti will now be \"cheering loudly from the outside,\" he wrote in his message.\n\nRead Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd's full message to staff:\n\nI want to share that, after thoughtful discussion, Michael and I have mutually agreed that the best path forward for the company is to centralize Product, Engineering, and Design under one leader. As a result, Michael will be departing Bumble today. We are incredibly grateful for the impact he has made during his time here and the care he brought to leading his teams, and we wish him the very best in what comes next.\n\nI know this news will land differently across the organization. For many of you who have partnered closely with Michael, it may feel especially significant; for others, it may feel less immediate. Michael has been a strong leadership presence across Bumble, and I want to thank you all in advance for supporting one another as we move through this transition.\n\nVivek will step in to lead Product alongside Engineering and Design.\n\nOver the past several weeks, and in close partnership with our Board, we've taken a hard, honest look at where our business stands and what our members need from us right now. What's become clear is that we need to sharpen our focus so we can stabilize our core, prioritize our product investments with intention, and set ourselves up for a confident return to growth.\n\nBringing these functions under one leader will provide clarity, tighter alignment, and a singular focus on what matters most: moving faster and delivering against our roadmap with more value to our members.\n\nMany of our cross-functional teams already know Vivek well - he has been deeply involved in our strategic and technical direction. Vivek has successfully led combined Product and Engineering teams at scale during his career and led them to deliver impact, giving us a proven model to build from. He brings a results oriented, steady, thoughtful approach that will continue to support our times through this next phase of work.\n\nIn the coming days, Vivek will connect with leaders across Product to ensure a smooth transition and to provide additional clarity when needed.\n\nThis has been a year of meaningful transformation for our company. Through it all, what continues to differentiate us is our talent: your resilience, your ambition, and your commitment to building products that impact our members in the most meaningful way possible. You've chosen to be here for our mission, every day, and I don't take that for granted. That is why we are building an environment where you can do the most impactful work of your career, and your engagement in this next phase is critical to our success.\n\nWe remain anchored in our three hubs - London, New York, and Austin - and now is the moment for focus. The path forward will require discipline, pace, and a shared commitment to outcomes. Let's channel our energy toward delivering for our members, our business, and each other.\n\nYou will hear more from me on our 2026 strategy during our Global All Hands on Wednesday.\n\nThank you for your partnership, your confidence, and the work ahead.\n\nDo you work at Bumble?

    "description": "Lindsay Kaplan, a former marketing exec and founder of Chief, is joining  consumer VC fund Bullish as a venture partner.",
    "fullText": "Startups don't just need cash to be successful. Like many of us, they also thrive on attention.\n\nLindsay Kaplan, a former marketing executive and cofounder of Chief, a networking company for women, wants to coach startup founders on what it takes to build culture-driving brands.\n\n\"You can have as much money as you want to pour into the algorithm and buy ads,\" Kaplan told Business Insider. \"But if you don't have the right founder who's able to build a community and the attention that you need to build a real product that people want, all of that money … is meaningless.\"\n\nAfter stepping away from her role as chief brand officer at Chief last year, Kaplan is pivoting her career to focus on working with startup founders. She's taking her own lessons as a founder, marketing exec, and investor in startups over to Bullish, a consumer-focused venture capital fund. She's joining the firm as a venture partner, the company exclusively told Business Insider.\n\nBullish has invested in several consumer hits, including Warby Parker, Harry's, Peloton, and Casper, Kaplan's former employer.\n\nBullish invests in early-stage startups, typically from pre-seed to Series A, Kaplan said. The categories she's most interested in span loneliness, dating, parenting, health, and identity and belonging.\n\n\"AI can be a tool to help those problems,\" Kaplan said, but she's acutely aware that not all AI is going to be a hit with real-life people.\n\nWhat does it take to get people to care about your product?\n\nCracking how to \"break through the noise\" helps, Kaplan said.\n\n\"What a consumer cares about is what is in it for them. What do we get out of it?\" Kaplan said. \"Founders are so used to pitching VCs that it's really hard to switch gears and start thinking about: Why should a customer care?\"\n\nWhen it comes to consumer-facing AI startups, brands need to think outside the box.\n\nKaplan said that \"contrarian\" plays can be useful when marketing a startup in a crowded space.\n\nFor instance, while so many tech companies are shouting AI from rooftops, some are strategically letting AI take a back seat.\n\n\"The best brands emerging are using AI, they're not necessarily making their startup fully based in AI,\" Kaplan said.\n\nKaplan pointed to Rocco, a smart fridge brand she angel invested in, as an example.\n\n\"It's a smart fridge, but the brand doesn't lead with 'AI-powered appliance,' it leads with design and functionality,\" Kaplan said. \"The AI makes the product better without becoming its identity, which is how they've managed to generate incredible buzz and traction in one of the most commoditized categories in consumer hardware.\"\n\nMarketing AI has been a tricky battlefield for brands.\n\nLook no further than the Friend AI ads across New York City. The ads promoting the startup's AI companion pendant were defaced by locals.\n\nOther marketing and advertising agencies, such as Day Job, are being tapped by AI companies specifically to help translate their brands to everyday people — in other words, potential customers.\n\nKaplan said startups trying to reach consumers have a unique tool at their disposal: creators.\n\nKaplan said the creator economy \"rewrote who controls distribution\" on social media by shifting who stirs buzz about brands and how people learn about them.\n\n\"Early adopters have really become the creators,\" she said.\n\nWhile startups previously toiled over customer acquisition cost (CAC), Kaplan said the big question now is: \"Who will carry the story out into the world and why will anybody listen?\"\n\n\"Distribution is no longer something you can buy,\" she said. \"You have to earn it.\"",

He said meetings with Swiss businesses, including watchmaker Rolex, influenced the decision.\n\nTrump said, \"all hell really broke out\" after he proposed the tariff rate.\n\n\"I was paid visits by everybody,\" he said. \"Rolex came to see me.\"\n\nTrump said that watch brands like Rolex had contributed to a trade deficit with Switzerland.\n\n\"But I realised, and I reduced it because I don't want to hurt people,\" he said of the tariff rate.\n\nAs it stands, there's a 15% cap on the tariff rate for Swiss imports.\n\nHowever, that rate could change again, Trump said. He said he initially planned a 30% tariff on Switzerland, then raised it to 39%, before lowering it to 15%.\n\n\"We brought it down to a lower level.

    "fullText": "The \"It Ends With Us\" press tour in the summer of 2024 was overshadowed by rumors and speculation of a feud between lead star Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, her costar and director.\n\nBut while the movie survived the backlash and went on to become one of the summer's biggest hits at the box office, grossing $350 million worldwide, the \"It Ends with Us\" drama didn't end there.\n\nIn December 2024, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, setting off a cascade of subsequent lawsuits brought by Lively, Baldoni, and even tangential characters like Baldoni's ex-publicist Stephanie Jones.\n\nIn June 2025, a judge threw out Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit. Baldoni was allowed to file an amended complaint, but in November, the judge formally ended the suit after the deadline for Baldoni to do so had passed.\n\nLively's original lawsuit against Baldoni is still ongoing with a trial set for May 18.\n\nIn January 2026, unsealed court documents revealed texts between Lively and her friend Taylor Swift, in which Swift called Baldoni a \"bitch\" and Lively referred to him as the \"doofus director of my movie.\"\n\nHere's everything we know about their feud and legal battle.\n\nEve Crosbie and Ayomikun Adekaiyero contributed to previous versions of this post.\n\nFans suspected something was amiss when Baldoni and Lively didn't interact during the press tour despite playing partners in the film.\n\nLively did press events with costars Brandon Sklenar and Isabela Ferrer and author Colleen Hoover, who wrote the book the film is based on. Baldoni did most of his press solo.\n\nWhen they both attended the New York premiere on August 6, they were not photographed together. Lively posed with her castmates, Hoover, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and Hugh Jackman, his \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" costar. Baldoni was photographed with his wife and some of the other producers who worked on the film.\n\nWhile speaking to Entertainment Tonight on the carpet at the New York premiere, Baldoni explained why he was stepping back from the limelight.\n\n\"This isn't my night — this is a night for all the women who we made this movie for,\" he said.\" This is a night for Blake, this is a night for Colleen. I'm just so grateful that we're here, five years in the making.\"\n\nOn social media, fans theorized about the potential drama between the two.\n\nThe speculation intensified after a user on the r/ColleenHoover subreddit noted on August 6, 2024 that Lively and Hoover did not follow Baldoni on Instagram. Fans also noticed that the film's other stars, including Sklenar, Ferrer, and Jenny Slate, did not follow Baldoni. Baldoni followed all of them except Hoover.\n\nBusiness Insider could not verify whether they previously followed Baldoni.\n\nAdding to this theory was a clip of Slate seemingly sidestepping a question about Baldoni at the movie's New York premiere. Asked about having Baldoni as both a scene partner and a director, she responded by not mentioning him and instead speaking about how \"intense\" it must be to do both jobs.\n\ni just found out about the whole 'it ends with us' cast drama and omg they asked her what it was like to work with justin and she completely ignored the question 💀 pic.twitter.com/2DdlmvxS4x\n\nMany fans began blaming Lively for the supposed feud, accusing her of trying to take over the film.\n\nThis theory was supported by Baldoni and Lively's interviews in the lead-up to the premiere.\n\nOn August 9, 2024, Baldoni told Today that Lively and Reynolds, who was not a producer on the film, contributed significantly to it.\n\n\"You can't summarize Blake's contribution in a sentence, because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,\" Baldoni said.\n\nBaldoni also said he struggled to balance allowing collaboration and having his voice drowned out entirely.\n\n\"You don't have to listen to everybody, and that didn't happen all the time, but there were just moments where I would get out of the way too much,\" he said.\n\nBaldoni said Lively should take over as director to adapt the sequel to the \"It Ends With Us\" novel, \"It Starts with Us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lively told E! News on August 7, 2024 that Reynolds helped pen the opening scene of \"It Ends With Us.\"\n\nThe film's screenwriter Christy Hal told People a day later that she wasn't aware that Reynolds had written some of the dialogue used in the final version of the script.\n\n\"When I saw a cut, I was like, 'Oh, that's cute. That must have been a cute improvised thing,'\" Hall said. \"So if I'm being told that Ryan wrote that, then great, how wonderful.\"\n\nFans also criticized how Lively promoted the movie, choosing to focus on its lighthearted and romantic elements instead of its heavy domestic abuse plot.\n\nBaldoni was the only cast member who consistently spoke about the domestic abuse element.\n\nAs online sentiment toward Lively turned increasingly negative, journalist Kjersti Flaa released an archival clip of an interview with Blake Lively on August 10, 2024 titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"\n\n\"It actually took me a while to get over the experience,\" Flaa told BI in an email on August 19, 2024 of the interview, which took place years earlier.\n\n\"Every time I entered a room after this I got nervous that something similar might happen again,\" she wrote.\n\nA post shared by Brandon Sklenar (@brandonsklenar)\n\nSklenar, who plays Lively's other love interest in \"It Ends With Us,\" spoke out about the backlash in an Instagram post on August 20, 2024.\n\n\"Colleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves. Vilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strongly in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about,\" he said.\n\n\"This film is meant to inspire. It's meant to validate and recognize,\" Sklenar added. \"It is not meant to once again, make women the 'bad guy,' let's move beyond that together.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Baldoni, Lively, Reynolds, Hoover, and Sklenar did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, inflicting \"emotional distress,\" and conspiring to damage her public reputation.\n\nLively's complaint also named Wayfarer Studios, Baldoni's production company, and Jamey Heath, the company's CEO, as two of the 11 defendants.\n\nIn the complaint, Lively said an all-hands meeting about Baldoni and Heath's behavior on set was held in January 2023. She accused him of showing her nude videos and images of women, improvising kissing scenes or intimate scenes, and entering her trailer while she was naked.\n\nLively said Heath and Baldoni responded by hiring Melissa Nathan, a crisis PR representative, and Jed Wallace, a Texas-based contractor, both defendants in the complaint, to orchestrate a \"multi-tiered\" plan to \"destroy\" her public reputation and stop her or anyone else from speaking out about what happened on set.\n\nShe also said that the cast agreed to a marketing plan created by the film's distributor, Sony Pictures Entertainment, to avoid talking about the sad parts of the movie, which Baldoni broke away from.\n\n\"What the public did not know was that Mr. Baldoni and his team did so to explain why many of the Film's cast and crew had unfollowed Mr. Baldoni on social media and were not appearing with him in public,\" the complaint said.\n\nBryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, told BI in a statement after the complaint was filed: \"It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to 'fix' her negative reputation, which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions.\"\n\nFreedman said Nathan was hired because Lively made multiple demands and threatened not to show up to set or promote the film if they were not met.\n\nWhen asked to respond to Freedman, a representative for Lively referred BI to a statement shared with The New York Times on December 21, 2024: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\"\n\nOn December 24, 2024, publicist Stephanie Jones sued Baldoni, his film studio, Melissa Nathan, and Jennifer Abel, a former employee of Jones' PR company, for breach of contract and defamation.\n\nIn the suit, Jones alleged Baldoni and the PRs orchestrated a smear campaign against Lively while her company was working with Baldoni. Jones said this was done behind her back until August 2024, when Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios stopped working with the company and worked directly with Abel.\n\nA post shared by Amber Tamblyn (@amberrosetamblyn)\n\nLively's costars from 2005's \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" — America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledel — shared a joint statement supporting Lively after she made the complaint.\n\nHoover and Sklenar, who worked on \"It Ends With Us,\" seemed to both throw their support behind Lively by sharing links to her allegations on their Instagram stories.\n\n\"@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient since the day we met,\" Hoover wrote in her story post. \"Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt.\"\n\nHoover has since deleted her Instagram, TikTok and Threads account.\n\nRepresentatives for Hoover did not immediately respond to a comment request from BI.\n\nOn December 21, 2024, The New York Times reported that Ari Emanuel, chief executive of the parent company that owns Baldoni's talent agency, William Morris Endeavor, said the agency had stopped representing him.\n\nOn December 9, 2024, before the complaint was released, Vital Voices, a nonprofit organization that supports women leaders, awarded Baldoni the Voices of Solidarity Award to honor his advocacy work for women.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Vital Voices said in a statement on their website that they had rescinded the award.\n\n\"The communications among Mr. Baldoni and his publicists included in the lawsuit — and the PR effort they indicate — are, alone, contrary to the values of Vital Voices and the spirit of the Award,\" the statement read.\n\nBaldoni, Wayfarer Studios, and others mentioned in a New York Times story that detailed Lively's accusations against Baldoni filed a lawsuit against the newspaper on December 31, 2024.\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by BI, said the Times' story published on December 21, 2024 \"relied almost entirely on Lively's unverified and self-serving narrative\" and accused the publication of \"disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, contained screenshots of messages that it said contradicted the Times' reporting.\n\nIn a statement provided to BI after the lawsuit was filed, a Times spokesperson said the newspaper stood by its reporting and would \"vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\"\n\n\"Our story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article,\" the statement said.\n\nThe outlet also published its full statement responding to the allegations.\n\nIn a statement provided to BI after Baldoni's lawsuit was filed, Freedman, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said Lively had orchestrated a \"vicious smear campaign\" and that the Times \"cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful 'untouchable' Hollywood elites.\"\n\nFreedman also said that they would also sue other individuals \"who have abused their power to try and destroy the lives of my clients.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to BI about Baldoni's suit, Lively's lawyers said: \"Nothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively's California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint.\"\n\nThe same day Baldoni filed his lawsuit against the Times, Lively filed a lawsuit against him, Wayfarer, and others in New York federal court.\n\nRepresentatives for Lively said the lawsuit, which was obtained by BI, was based on the legal complaint Lively previously filed with the California Civil Rights Department. The lawsuit accuses Baldoni and his PR team of engaging in a campaign to retaliate against her for speaking out about sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Ms. Lively's decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks,\" her lawyers said in a statement provided to BI. \"As alleged in Ms. Lively's federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Baldoni and Wayfarer did not address the lawsuit filed by Lively when reached by BI.\n\nOn January 7, Freedman told SiriusXM's \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" that his team planned to take further legal action.\n\nFreedman also alleged Reynolds used his influence to help Lively take over \"It Ends With Us\" and to mock Baldoni on \"Deadpool and Wolverine,\" via a new character in the film called Nicepool.\n\nIn the film, which premiered in July 2024 and was the second-highest-grossing movie of 2024, Nicepool, a version of Deadpool from an alternate dimension whose face has not been disfigured, jokes about a woman's pregnancy weight, claims to be a feminist and wears a man bun.\n\nFreedman alleged this was based on Baldoni, who has a reputation for being a feminist and has been known to wear his hair in a bun in the past.\n\nIn the movie, Nicepool is eventually killed by Ladypool, a female version of Deadpool from an alternate dimension played by Lively.\n\n\"What I make of that is that if your wife is sexually harassed, you don't make fun of Justin Baldoni,\" Freedman said. \"You don't make fun of the situation. You take it very seriously. You file HR complaints. You raise the issue and you follow a legal process. What you don't do is mock the person and turn it into a joke.\"\n\nOn January 16, 2025, Baldoni, his associates at his company Wayfarer Studios, and his publicists Nathan and Abel sued Lively, her publicist Leslie Sloane, and her husband Ryan Reynolds, alleging they orchestrated a smear campaign against him.\n\nBaldoni's lawsuit, which seeks $400 million in damages, alleges that Lively, with the help of Reynolds and Sloane, hijacked \"It Ends with Us\" by wresting creative control away from Baldoni, then worked to destroy his reputation and livelihood.\n\nThe suit, which contains many of the same details from Baldoni's defamation suit against the Times, also claims that Reynolds pressured the talent agency WME, which also represents Lively and Reynolds, to drop Baldoni.\n\nThe agency did so in December but a WME spokesperson previously denied Reynolds and Lively put pressure on the agency.\n\nFreedman told BI that their suit was \"based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team's duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni.\"\n\n\"Justin and his team have nothing to hide,\" the statement adds, \"documents do not lie.\"\n\nLively's legal team said Baldoni's team's suit is another attempt to \"shift the narrative\" from one about harassment claims to one around battles for creative control.\n\n\"This latest lawsuit from Justin Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios, and its associates is another chapter in the abuser playbook,\" Lively's legal team said. \"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim.\"\n\nIn Lively's complaint, Lively said Baldoni acted as himself instead of Ryle while filming a slow-dance sequence for the romance film.\n\n\"At one point, he leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, 'it smells so good,'\" the complaint read. \"None of this was remotely done in character, or based on any dialogue in the script, and nothing needed to be said because, again, there was no sound.\"\n\nHer team alleged Lively later objected to this behavior and said Baldoni replied, \"I'm not even attracted to you.\"\n\nOn January 21, Baldoni's production company and lawyer hit back by sending a nearly 10-minute behind-the-scenes footage of the cast filming the scene to outlets including the Daily Mail.\n\nBaldoni's team said in a statement at the beginning of the video that the footage contains three takes filmed on May 23, 2023, and said these were the only versions filmed of the scene.\n\n\"Both actors are clearly behaving well within the scope of the scene and with mutual respect and professionalism,\" they added.\n\nThe video also showed that the initial direction in the \"It Ends With Us\" script is that Baldoni and Lively's characters just dance together.\n\nIn the takes, Baldoni repeatedly moves in to kiss Lively, and Lively pulls away and says it would be better if they talked during the scene. At one point, Baldoni rubs his face on both sides of Lively's neck seemingly without warning, but the pair joke about it in the video.\n\nThe video has elicited a range of responses on social media. Some users thought Lively looked uncomfortable, while others believed Lively was attracted to her costar.\n\nLively's attorneys sent a statement to The Hollywood Reporter after the video was published, saying that the footage corroborated Lively's story because \"every moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\"\n\n\"The video shows Ms. Lively leaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk. Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively's discomfort,\" the statement said.\n\n\"They will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent.\"\n\nLively's attorneys also said that Baldoni's choice to release the video to the media instead of presenting it to court was an \"unethical attempt to manipulate the public\" and a \"continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign.\"\n\n\"While they are focused on misleading media narratives, we are focused on the legal process,\" her attorneys said.\n\nFreedman responded in a statement sent to Business Insider via email on Wednesday: \"Prior to filing her lawsuit in court, Ms. Lively went to The New York Times in an effort to publicly destroy Justin Baldoni. When Mr. Baldoni exercises his right to publicly defend himself by putting forth actual facts and evidence, for Ms Lively and team this instantly becomes morally and ethically wrong.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"Ms. Lively wants very different standards to apply to her but fortunately, truth and authenticity apply to everyone and can never be wrong. Looking at the video and the evidence to come, I can understand why Ms. Lively would now, not want this to play out in public.\"\n\nIn February 2025, Baldoni's lawyers launched a website containing two documents related to his legal battle with Lively.\n\nThe first is an amended version of Baldoni's $400 million counter-lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds.\n\nIn the amended complaint, Baldoni's team claims that the metadata on The New York Times' website shows that the publication had access to Lively's civil rights complaint at least 11 days before publishing its report on Baldoni's alleged smear campaign, titled \"'We Can Bury Anyone': Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\"\n\nAnother update in the lawsuit took aim at Lively's husband and accused him of using the character of Nicepool in \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" to bully Baldoni, saying that the \"caricature of a 'woke' feminist\" was a \"transparent and mocking portrayal of Reynolds' warped perception of Baldoni.\"\n\nThe second document on the new site is a 168-page \"timeline of relevant events\" related to the feud and the movie's production. The timeline dates from January 2019, when Baldoni approached Hoover about adapting her novel, to January 2025.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman said: \"The decision to amend our lawsuit was a logical next step due to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light.\"\n\nVariety reported that the Times has disputed \"inaccuracies\" in Baldoni's complaint.\n\nOn June 9, US District Judge Lewis Liman dismissed Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit, in which the actor and director accused Lively of taking creative control of \"It Ends with Us\" and damaging his reputation. The suit also alleged that Lively had falsely accused Baldoni of sexual harassment as a way to take control of the production.\n\nThe countersuit had previously been combined with a separate suit Baldoni had filed against The New York Times and Lively's publicist Leslie Sloane, which accused Sloane of planting rumors to smear Baldoni in the press and the Times of facilitating their circulation.\n\nJudge Liman ruled that Lively's claims of sexual harassment were legally protected and immune from a lawsuit. Liman is still weighing whether to dismiss Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni.\n\nOn October 31, Judge Liman officially ended Baldoni's lawsuit against Lively.\n\nLiman stated in his order that he contacted all parties on October 17 that his final judgment to conclude the case was coming soon. Only Lively responded. With Baldoni's side missing the deadline to continue to claim, the judge dismissed the lawsuit.\n\nLively's original lawsuit against Baldoni is still ongoing. A court date is set for May 18.\n\nOn January 20, 2026, following Judge Liman's ruling that both parties release evidence before a hearing to dismiss the May trial, Lively's team released documents, including depositions and text messages.\n\nThey included text exchanges between Lively and her friend Taylor Swift. In one, Swift referred to Baldoni as a \"bitch,\" writing to Lively before the New York Times story ran, \"I think this bitch knows something is coming because he's gotten out his tiny violin.\"\n\nA year prior to that text, Lively referred to Baldoni as the \"doofus director of my movie\" in a text to Swift.\n\nThe deposition of Lively's \"It Ends With Us\" costar Jenny Slate was also among the unsealed documents. In it, she describes an alleged incident on set where Baldoni said to her, \"I can say this because my wife is here, but you look sexy in what you're wearing.\"\n\nSlate said the comment was \"not appropriate\" on set or in \"any workplace.\"\n\n\"The comment was about me, not my character. It wasn't useful for my work. It wasn't anything I wanted. It was unwanted and had no place, in my professional experience,\" Slate said in her deposition.\n\nTexts by Slate were also released. In one, she described Baldoni as \"a fraud.\"\n\nIn another message, she called him \"the biggest clown and the most intense narcissist.\"\n\nBaldoni's team has yet to release its evidence.\n\nBryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, told Business Insider in a statement that \"the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law\" and pointed to messages from Sony discussing Lively's behavior.\n\n\"A simple read of the newly released message exchanges makes the truth abundantly clear. We remain confident in the legal process and clearing the names of all of the Justin Baldoni parties.\"\n\nReps for Lively, Swift, and Slate did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "description": "From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump touted his affordability agenda at Davos. The numbers are a mixed bag.",
    "fullText": "America's economy has never been stronger.\n\nAt least that's what President Donald Trump told the Davos audience on Wednesday. From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump framed his economic agenda as one centered on affordability.\n\nTrump repeatedly credited his policies for lowering everyday costs, and promised more savings in the future. But the reality is slightly different.\n\nAs Americans navigate a brutal job market and climbing cost of living, Business Insider dove into the data behind the president's Davos speech.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The price of gasoline is now below $2.50 a gallon in many states… Soon it will be averaging less than $2 a gallon.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The average price of gasoline in the US was $2.81 a gallon as of January 19, nearly half of what it was during a 2022 high. Gas prices haven't been below $2 since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAs of January 21, AAA reported that ten states have an average gas price at or below $2.50.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Homes are built for people, not corporations. America will not become a nation of renters. We're not going to do that. That's why I've signed an order banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump signed an executive order targeting institutional investors this month — but it's unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, largely in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The cost of prescription drugs is coming down by up to 90%.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The president is negotiating with some pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of drugs and has launched TrumpRx, a government-run, direct-to-consumer prescription platform aimed at connecting people with cheaper medications. Trump's healthcare plan, released last week, outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums while maximizing transparency for Americans.\n\nEnhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired in December because of Republican opposition in Congress, leading to a spike in premiums for millions of Americans on marketplace plans. January data shows that, with rising costs, at least 1.4 million Americans dropped their healthcare plans between 2025 and 2026.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that the enrollment decline is \"entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act also proposed changes to Medicaid, including stricter work requirements for enrollees and a federal funding reduction of $1 trillion over the next ten years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump has called on Congress to cap credit card rates that have \"ripped off\" consumers. In the third quarter of 2025, the most recently available data, American credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nThis proposal has received bipartisan support, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders pushing for a similar credit card cap. \"Trump even acknowledge the bipartisan appeal, telling CNBC's Joe Kernen Wednesday that the proposal sounds like something \"the mayor of New York maybe came up with.\"\n\nBank and business leaders are largely opposed, arguing that a 10% cap would prevent companies from adequately pricing subprime credit risk.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump knows he's aligning himself with the progressive left when it comes to credit cards.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen in Davos on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that his call for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates isn't a standard conservative policy.\n\nIn fact, he joked that it's something that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, might have come up with.\n\n\"I know it's sort of like… it sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nFollowing Mamdani's election in November, the two met in the Oval Office and appeared to share some common ground in remarks to the press afterwards.\n\n\"I'm conservative, but I think I'm common sense, you know?\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"People say, 'Are you a conservative?' I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "description": "Expect to see clips from \"Stranger Things\" and Pete Davidson's podcast sometime this year.",
    "fullText": "The funny thing about smartphone addiction is that it makes low-effort tasks feel totally productive. When I finally quit doomscrolling through Instagram and TikTok and watch an actual movie or TV show, I feel like I've just spent the afternoon studying physics. Platforms like Netflix, which could once be seen as time-wasting entertainment, now seem like antidotes to endless, useless scrolling.\n\nBut Netflix doesn't seem to appreciate its new role. Instead, the company apparently sees short-form video apps—and smartphones themselves—as a direct threat to its business, and is jumping on the bandwagon. It's not only that Netflix is reportedly now making content with phone scrollers in mind, encouraging creators to craft dialogue that makes their shows and movies easy to understand even if you're not actually paying attention.\n\nNo Netflix also wants to position its mobile app as an actual competitor to TikTok and Instagram, by introducing a short-form video feed directly within the app.\n\nThe company officially introduced its plans for short-form video during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters announced the company will roll out a new app later this year that will include its take on the vertical video feed. This isn't totally new, as the company has been experimenting with vertical video feeds since May. But it's the first time we've seen a larger announcement about how Netflix plans to integrate the short-form experience directly into its app.\n\nUnlike TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, you won't hop on the Netflix app to find short-form videos from independent creators. Instead, Netflix will serve users clips from Netflix-distributed shows and movies in a scrollable TikTok-style feed. You might swipe through this feed and see clips from Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, or His & Hers. Many of us already waste our time watching clips from shows and movies on other platforms—often cropped, slowed down or sped up, in low-quality, and besieged by artifacts meant to throw off copyright claims. Netflix obviously won't need to do this, so I expect the experience will be filled with high-quality videos (depending on how you define \"quality\" of course).\n\nIt won't just be TV shows and movies on the feed. Netflix also has big plans for its video podcasts, as evidenced by recent programs like The Pete Davidson Show and recent deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia to bring existing podcasts to its platform. Expect Netflix to sprinkle clips from these video podcasts into the short-form feed to create an experience that sounds not too far off from scrolling through other apps. How many clips you do see from video podcasts, TV shows, and movies on TikTok?\n\nAs Netflix inches closer to acquiring Warner Bros., you might soon be seeing a lot of official short-form content in the Netflix app. If and when the acquisition closes, I wouldn't be surprised to see clips from HBO shows like A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, The White Lotus, and Euphoria.\n\nI get the move from a business perspective: Netflix is likely losing subscribers' attention due to the addictive nature of vertical video apps. But do any of us really need another app to scroll through, especially when we're already paying for access to the full content to begin with? Maybe could be a helpful avenue to find new shows and movies to watch, but in all likelihood, it will just be be another addictive time-waster. I have too many of those in my life as it is.",

    "fullText": "A malicious ad-blocking extension on Chrome and Edge is using the ClickFix attack to infect devices with a remote access payload capable of spying on and taking over a system.\n\nNexShield pitched itself as a privacy-focused ad blocker from the developer of well-established and highly trusted uBlock Origin. However, as security firm Huntress found, the extension initiates a variation of the ClickFix attack that has been dubbed \"CrashFix\"—a reference to the browser crash that precedes the fake security warning and malicious command prompt.\n\nAs BleepingComputer describes, the NexShield extension creates a denial-of-service (DoS) loop that exhausts your device's memory, ultimately freezing Chrome or Edge and causing it to crash. When the browser restarts, the extension displays a pop-up with a \"Run Scan\" button to identify \"potential security threats that may compromise your browsing data,\" leading users to believe that the crash resulted from a security issue.\n\nIf you follow through, you'll see another fake window with instructions for executing commands in the Windows command prompt. This is the ClickFix attack: a form of social engineering that relies on fake error messages, CAPTCHAs, and command prompts to trick users into deploying malware onto their own devices.\n\nIn this case, the extension copies a command to the clipboard, and if users enter the keystrokes in the fake pop-up, downloads and executes a malicious script. After a 60-minute delay to avoid detection, NexShield delivers the payload that can run commands, fingerprint systems, and elevate privileges.\n\nNote that as of this writing, NexShield has been removed from the Chrome Web Store.\n\nIf you've installed NexShield, you should uninstall it and perform a full system cleanup to clear its payloads from your device. (We've got step-by-step guides to removing malware from your Mac and your PC.)\n\nAs general protection against similar attacks, only install browser extensions from trusted sources. This isn't a guarantee that you'll never encounter a malicious add-on in the Chrome Web Store or in other browsers, as hackers occasionally manage to sneak through the approval process and even get their extensions labeled as trusted or verified. Some extensions are only later injected with malicious code, essentially \"waking up\" their ability to attack.\n\nBefore installing a new extension, carefully check the creation date, reviews and ratings, and even the name, as malicious add-ons will often impersonate trusted ones (or, as in the case of NexShield, piggyback on legitimate brands like uBlock Origin). Watch for suspicious permissions—if the extension requests access to data or actions that seem excessive or are unrelated to its core function, it might be malware.\n\nFinally, never run codes or commands on your machine copied from websites or communication that you don't understand, and always verify instructions with an independent, trusted source. For this specific campaign, Huntress has other indicators of compromise you can look for on your system.",

    "title": "How to Follow Any Workout Video, Even If You're an Absolute Beginner",
    "description": "Including how to substitute easier exercises, and what to do when you just can't keep up.",
    "fullText": "A workout habit has a way of building momentum: Once you’re doing something, anything, it’s easy to build on that. Video workouts are a simple way to get started, but if you're having trouble following along, I'm here to help. Below are some ways to make common exercises more accessible, and what to do if you can't get through a whole video yet.\n\nLots of “easy” bodyweight programs ask you to perform a squatting motion without any added weight. But if that’s already more than you can do, try one of these instead:\n\nSit in a chair, and stand back up.\n\nLean your back against a wall and slide down until you’re in a sitting position (this is called a wall squat).\n\nHold onto a countertop or the back of a chair while you do a squat.\n\nFor any of these, it’s okay to squat as low as you can, even if that’s not all the way to parallel. You can work on going lower over time.\n\nPushups are another move you’ll find in simple beginner workouts, but not everyone can do a pushup on their first day. Pushups get easier the higher your hands are, and harder the higher your feet are. So for the easiest beginner version, put your hands on a wall around shoulder height. Lean into the wall, then push yourself back to a standing position.\n\nOnce those become easy, choose a lower surface, like a table or countertop. Then move to a chair, and so on. This progression is arguably better than doing pushups on your knees, because no matter which level you’re on, you are practicing holding your entire body straight in a plank position.\n\nDumbbells come in all sizes—and fortunately for beginners, the smallest ones are also the cheapest. If your gym doesn’t have dumbbells small enough, any store with a sporting goods section will likely have some one- and two-pound dumbbells you can pick up and add to your gym bag.\n\nBut if you’re not even ready for dumbbells, that’s okay. A half-liter water bottle weighs about a pound. Same with a can of soup. Larger water bottles, wine bottles, and milk jugs can take you up a bit further in weight; we did the math for you here. You can also hold books, roller skates, or tote bags full of literally anything. (Two water bottles in a grocery bag? That’s a two-pound weight.)\n\nNeed to start even lighter? It’s okay to do weight workouts using literally nothing. Make your hands into fists and go through the motions. If you’re following a video that does a million reps of bicep curls or tricep extensions, your arms will get tired even if they’re empty. Just move up to the water bottles as soon as you’re ready.\n\nWith these substitutions, you may feel ready to start following along with beginner level workout videos. But what if you can’t handle exactly what’s on the screen? Remember, your goal should be to do a workout at your current level of fitness, not to complete a certain number of reps that you theoretically could do if you were in better shape. So if the video asks for 30 seconds of pushups but you can only manage a few reps, do as many as you can and rest for the remainder of the time.\n\nIt’s fine to bounce from video to video until you find something at your level. Keep an eye out for one that seems like fun but is just out of your reach. Do it anyway, modifying it or resting as needed, and then bookmark it and come back to it next week. Chances are good you’ll be able to keep up a little bit better—and if you keep coming back to that same workout week after week, you’ll eventually master it. Consistency breeds momentum.\n\nLet’s say you want to do a workout from a Peloton-like cycling instructor. You’ve got your bike, you can pedal, but pretty quickly you’re out of breath and feel like you can’t keep going.\n\nThese workouts are easy to adjust: All you have to do is pay attention to the instructor’s voice and facial expressions and ignore any specific numbers. It doesn’t matter if she’s asking you for a “20” or a “50.” If the instructor looks and talks like she’s on an easy bike ride, adjust your resistance so you are on an easy bike ride. If she looks like she’s working hard but not dying, adjust your resistance so you are working hard but not dying.\n\nStart literally anywhere. There isn’t a wrong answer. Maybe you start doing cardio dance videos, but it turns out you hate dancing. Well, you’re already moving your body a couple times a week, so you can swap out the dancing for something else.\n\nOr maybe you start doing pushups every day, but after a while your wrists are aching. You can choose to address that problem and continue your pushups, or you can look back on how far you’ve come, congratulate yourself, and pick a different thing to try for the next chapter of your fitness journey. After all, you’ve already started, so why not keep going?",

    "description": "The statement comes about a week after OpenAI announced ads are coming to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "A week after OpenAI admitted it will soon start testing ads in ChatGPT, Google has promised that it's not planning to inject ads into Gemini anytime soon.\n\nThe statement was given to journalist Alex Heath during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the company doesn't have \"any plans\" for ads in Gemini. While the statement was fairly brief, it also jibes with a similar quote Hassabis gave to Axios, where he said he was \"a little bit surprised\" that OpenAI was already introducing ads to ChatGPT.\n\nThat surprise is understandable, especially because OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2024 that he considered ads a \"last resort for us as a business model.\" But looking at the numbers, it makes sense that ChatGPT is getting ads long before Gemini is even thinking of them.\n\nWhile Google makes most of its money through showing people ads, it's also able to rely on Search and YouTube to push ads to most of those eyeballs. Meanwhile, OpenAI is pretty much just ChatGPT. As the latter moves to a for-profit model, it now has to put moneymaking first, something it's had trouble doing without relying on traditional internet moneymakers like ads. Google, meanwhile, is already profitable elsewhere, and is able to take its time and use its sheer size to keep Gemini ad-free, at least while it continues to chase market share.\n\nDoes this mean Google's AI will never get ads? Well, never say never. But it does mean that they're probably not on the horizon—even if Google plans to more aggressively monetize Gemini over the long term, it isn't facing the same kind of time crunch as Altman's company.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the presence of ads will push users away from ChatGPT, but the move comes in the wake of significant wins for Gemini and one major loss for ChatGPT. First, Google's Nano Banana image editing model went viral on social media, winning over the general public. Then, Google struck a deal with Apple to put its AI into the iPhone, and it looks like Gemini will be powering Siri for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT reportedly saw a 6% dip in users early last month, following a model update from Gemini—and that was before the introdution of ads. While ChatGPT still seems to be in the lead on total user count, there's evidence that Google is catching up.\n\nThe divide in strategy seems clear: As OpenAI seeks ways to get more money out of its existing user base, Google can focus on growing its own with new integrations into the products we already use every day. I can't say what the limits of this growth are, but I can say that I rarely go out of my way use AI, yet I've still found myself accidentally relying on Google's AI overviews every now and then. If Google can get more people like me to casually integrate AI into our regular workflows, it's possible we could soon have a new AI leader on our hands.",

    "title": "I Tried Strava's New 'Instant Workouts' Feature, and It Isn't Great",
    "description": "The rollout leaves a lot to be desired.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month Strava unveiled its new Instant Workouts feature, a subscriber-exclusive tool that seems like a natural way to leverage its acquisition of Runna. In a Reddit post, Strava said this feature builds upon Runna's already successful Instant Workouts feature.\n\nInstant Workouts uses your activity history to generate personalized workouts across four intents (\"Maintain,\" \"Build,\" \"Explore,\" or \"Recover\"). The idea is that the more you upload, the more personalized your recommendations become. Another major selling point is the automatic route generation feature, which draws on Strava's massive database of billions of historical activities to suggest optimal paths for each workout.\n\nThe timing of this rollout seems deliberate as the company positions itself for its anticipated IPO. And on paper, it sounds like exactly the kind of innovation that would indeed justify a Strava subscription. In practice, however, the execution leaves a good bit to be desired.\n\nUnfortunately, the feature's current implementation falls far short of its potential. The most glaring issue: You cannot actually view your workout details once you've started the activity in the app. Strava generates solid, complex, multi-interval workouts—but provides no way to reference them on your watch during your run or ride. You'd have to screenshot the workout beforehand or print it out.\n\nFor the majority of us athletes who rely on our devices to guide interval training, pace targets, and recovery periods, this renders the feature practically useless. Strava has acknowledged this limitation in a Reddit post, promising that device integration for Garmin and Apple watches is \"coming soon.\" But the timeline for that \"soon\" is questionable at best.\n\nThe relationship between Strava and Garmin has reportedly grown frosty following a lawsuit last fall, and there's little incentive for Garmin to prioritize features that primarily benefit Strava's subscription revenue and investor appeal. Without Garmin's cooperation and swift implementation, a significant portion of Strava's serious athlete user base remains locked out of the feature's full utility.\n\nOn the bright side, in my opinion, the workouts themselves show promise—though others disagree. The training plans generated appear to take into account individual fitness levels reasonably well. From my testing, the prescribed intervals, pacing, and progression made sense given my current training status and recent activity history.\n\nThat said, user experiences vary considerably. Some athletes report receiving workouts that seem disconnected from their actual fitness or goals, while others note that the workout descriptions use non-standard terminology that doesn't align with how most training plans communicate intervals and pacing.\n\nThen there's the route generation. In a well-traveled area with dense activity heat maps like New York City, my suggested routes tend to be solid and sensible enough. As always, my personal preferences are to avoid extra crowded streets or sketchy areas, which Strava never seems to take into account. Ultimately, the algorithm benefits from years of crowdsourced data showing which streets, paths, and loops are actually popular with runners and cyclists.\n\nHowever, users in less densely populated areas or regions with sparser Strava usage report wildly inconsistent results. Some routes make no logical sense, sending athletes on inefficient paths or suggesting roads that aren't suitable for the prescribed workout type. The feature's quality appears directly tied to the richness of local Strava data, creating a drastic two-tier experience.\n\nAnd once again: Until I can push the workout and corresponding map to my watch, this feature doesn't mean much to me.\n\nIf you ask me, Strava's Instant Workouts feature feels rushed to market, likely timed to generate positive press ahead of the IPO rather than to actually serve athletes.

    "title": "Apple Might Turn Siri Into an AI Chatbot to Rival ChatGPT",
    "description": "It could be ChatGPT's next big competitor.",
    "fullText": "Last week, Apple finally admitted it will need to team up with Google to finally make good on that contextual Siri promise it made two years ago, which would have allowed the virtual assistant to integrate with content like your texts or emails to answer personal questions and take actions for you. Now, according to a new report, the iPhone company might actually go one step further and turn Siri into a full-fledged AI chatbot—one on par with the likes of ChatGPT, and perhaps even more sophisticated.\n\nCurrently, Siri has AI implementation, but only technically, and it's certainly underwhelming: You can use it to get tech support on Apple products or shunt questions off to ChatGPT, but otherwise, Siri basically works as it always has. But according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has reliably reported on insider information at Apple before, the company is finally not only looking to make Siri smarter, but also change the way you interact with it. Currently planned for iOS and macOS 27 under the name \"Campos,\" Siri's new chatbot interface will still be powered by Gemini, but will allow you to both type and talk to Siri, with full continuity between your conversations. This upgrade will be in addition to the overdue features that were already announced.\n\nIn other words, it'll look something like the chatbot interface from the ChatGPT app or the standalone Gemini app. Yes, you can technically type to Siri right now, but it mostly works like a separate input method, rather than as a full conversation. You can't scroll through your previous questions to Siri or peruse the assistant's previous answers, and if you ask Siri to reference a message you sent it two weeks ago, it'll have no idea what you mean. That's far behind what other AI chatbots offer right now.\n\nThe update will also apparently further expand Siri's capabilities even beyond the contextual or personalization upgrades that were already revealed. Gurman says that, while the contextual upgrades will be able to pull information from other apps like Messages, the chatbot-style Siri will be \"integrated into all of the company's core apps, including ones for mail, music, podcasts, TV, Xcode programming software and photos.\" Essentially, Siri will have more access to your iPhone than other AI chatbots, and those integrations will go beyond what was previously promised. That could make it more or less appealing to you, depending on your tastes in AI integration.\n\nWith the chatbot interface planned for iOS 27, it's likely to come after the contextual upgrades, rather than at the same time. That's because, as Gurman said previously, those upgrades are set for the spring. He predicts we'll learn more about it during this year's WWDC, which, if it follows the standard set by previous years, will take place in June.\n\nThe move to turn Siri into a chatbot could come across as a a much-overdue modernization, as Google has already done the same with Gemini over on Android, but it's also a bit of a surprise, as Apple had previously said it did not intend to turn Siri into a \"bolt-on chatbot on the side\" for Apple Intelligence.\n\nBut Apple was likely talking about quality of the experience rather than expressing any significant anti-chatbot bias among the development team, meaning the fact that Siri is turning into a chatbot could mean the company is finally happy with the direction it's headed. But it's also possible that the professed skepticism about turning Siri into a chatbot was meant to appeal to AI skeptics in general. Unfortunately, if you're still skeptical about AI, it currently seems like iOS 27 will be a boring update for you, as Gurman indicated the new Siri chatbot will be the \"primary new addition\" to the operating system.\n\nHowever you feel about it personally, Siri as a full-fledged AI chatbot could seriously upset ChatGPT's market dominance—ironic, given its early integration with Apple Intelligence. Currently, OpenAI has reportedly admitted it's in a Code Red situation, as it is losing market share to Google and introducing ads to bolster its bottom line. The new Siri, being powered by Gemini, is unlikely to hurt Google (although it will have more access to your phone than the standalone Gemini app), but its ease-of-access might make it the new go-to for iPhone users, and that could hurt pretty much every AI company Apple isn't in business with directly.",

    "title": "This Hydration App Tracks Your 'Output' Instead of Your Intake",
    "description": "This approach may be more accurate, anyway.",
    "fullText": "I’ve never managed to get on board with any hydration trackers. I’ll log the foods I eat, the exercise I do, but drinks just happen. Did I have one glass of water or two with lunch? Hell if I know. Not to mention that your hydration depends on all the H2O you take in, not just the glasses of plain water. You can hydrate with soup, with Diet Coke, or with slices of watermelon. Most hydration apps forget this, but even if they don’t, that just makes logging even more complicated.\n\nThat’s why I was intrigued by the P Water app for iPhone and Apple Watch. It tracks exactly what you’d expect from the name. I’ve been using it for about a week, and so far, I'm a fan. I tap a button on my Apple Watch when I’m heading to the bathroom, and between pit stops, I can drink whatever I want without measuring or logging any of it. If it’s been a few hours since my last bathroom trip, the app will prompt me to drink water.\n\nThis approach means that I get full credit for the water in my soup and Diet Coke, because it’s still hydrating me, and my internal hydration level is still triggering my bathroom trips. I spend a total of about 30 seconds each day thinking about the app, and I measure nothing. This is ideal for me.\n\nThe developers of P Water were not the first to think of tracking water output rather than input. You may have noted this approach is sometimes used in medical settings, and as a new parent I remember being asked how many wet diapers my newborn was producing each day.\n\nP Water cites research showing that counting up the number of times you urinate per day can give a reasonably good estimate of how hydrated you are. For example, this study on healthy young men concludes that “[Void frequency] is a reliable index of 24-[hour] hydration status” so long as bathroom visits come at a consistent “urgency”—in other words, if you sometimes go when you don’t really have to, but sometimes hold it a long time, your pee count will be less reliable as a hydration indicator. That much is pretty obvious.\n\nTracking output rather than input accounts for not just different sources of water in your diet, but also different hydration needs. For example, the “eight glasses of water a day” rule was never a particularly good one, especially when you consider that people come in different sizes and may have different activity levels.\n\nThat said, if you have a need to monitor your exact hydration, an app like P Water won’t necessarily do everything you need it to do. Medical providers often ask for specific amounts when they have people do what they call a “voiding diary.” But for a general sense of whether you’re hydrating enough that you’re peeing a normal amount, P Water seems to be a convenient tool.\n\nWhile it’s convenient to use P Water on an Apple Watch, it also works as a regular iPhone app. The full app has some convenient actions, like having a “log a pee” option when you long-press the home screen icon or when you swipe down to see Siri suggestions.\n\nI only used the app’s most basic features—logging bathroom visits, basically—but there’s",

    "title": "The Emergency Repair Supplies Every Homeowner Should Have on Hand",
    "description": "Home emergencies can happen at any time. Here are the tools and supplies you need to have ready to deal with emergency home repairs.",
    "fullText": "So many things can go wrong with your home at any given moment—and those problems won't exactly wait for you to be prepared to deal with them before they hit. Plus, they often happen when it’s difficult or impossible to get a professional to come help you—like during storms, or in the middle of the night.\n\nIf you wake up to a burst pipe or a leaking roof and you can’t get a pro to come for a while, you don’t want to be powerless in your efforts to stave off further disaster. Having a basic set of tools is a great start, but you need to keep a few more items on hand if you truly want to be able to respond with a quick fix. Here’s the short list of everything you should have in your home in case you need to do some emergency repairs.\n\nWater is incredibly destructive, and leaks that seem minor can do major damage to your house. Making sure you have basic tools like wrenches and knowing where the water shutoffs are in your house is essential, but here are a few more items that can hep you respond to emergencies:\n\nSnake auger. A plunger will take care of a clogged drain or toilet (and if you lack a plunger, don’t forget you can use a garbage bag on the toilet in a pinch), but if plunging doesn’t stop the water’s inexorable rise, you need to have a snake auger on hand. It’s a simple tool that anyone can operate, and it will break up most clogs pretty quickly, potentially averting disaster.\n\nBattery powered pumps. You may already have a sump pump installed to keep things dry in your basement and crawl space. If the power goes out, however, your sump won’t do you much good. And battery backup power typically doesn’t last long, so having a cordless transfer pump could be a lifesaver. Even something like a DrillPump (for $17) can stave off a flood long enough to get a professional in there.\n\nPipe clamps. Water pipes always seem to burst at the worst possible time—and shutting off the water to the whole house isn’t ideal if you have to wait a few days for a plumber. Having a few pipe repair clamps on hand will get you through those days. These clamps are pretty simple: You just slip them onto the pipe and tighten the clamp until the leak is sealed by the rubber backing. This fix won’t last forever, but it will probably let you keep the water on for a few days while you sort out a more permanent repair.\n\nRoof leaks often stay hidden until a bad storm suddenly reveals them—and roof repairs have to wait until the weather clears. Here’s what you need if your roof starts leaking at the worst possible moment:\n\nRoof cement. Roof cement (like the Henry 208R) can be a lifesaver. If you notice that your roof has obvious damage, or it has leaked recently, applying a layer of roof cement to the affected area is a fast, easy repair that will keep the water out until you can do something more permanent.\n\nTarp. A durable tarp is useful in a lot of emergencies, but essential for a surprise roof leak. Along with some plastic-cap nails, you’ll be able to quickly cover any damaged section of your roof and keep things as dry as possible until a roofer can make an assessment. Tarping a roof isn’t hard, though you should always use extreme caution when on your roof—especially if it’s raining.\n\nThere are a bunch more things you might not need every day, but should have on hand in case of emergency:\n\nSpray sealant. Clear waterproof sealant spray can be used to seal off cracked windows, minor roof damage, and anything else that suddenly starts leaking.\n\nZip ties. These plastic ties are incredibly useful because they’re easy to deploy quickly, can be linked together, and are strong enough for most temporary repairs when you need to hold things together. They can even be fashioned into a DIY drain cleanout tool in a pinch if you don’t have that snake auger.\n\nDuct tape and electrical tape. No, duct tape can’t fix everything, but this strong, sticky tape can temporarily fix tools, hold stuff together, stop minor leaks—and, yes, seal up broken ductwork. Electrical tape is essential if you’re going to attempt any DIY electrical repair, whether it’s braiding wires together, covering exposed wire when the insulation has worn off, or securing a loose connection.\n\nPlastic sheeting. Plastic sheeting is useful when a tarp is too heavy and cumbersome. It can be used in just about any application where you want to keep water or the weather out of a space, like covering a broken window in a storm or on the floors under a roof leak.\n\nSuper glue. Super glue is useful stuff—it can bond just about anything, and it can even be used to seal small leaks in pipes in a pinch.\n\nTwine. Having some strong twine rope will definitely come in handy. It can be used to lash things down, to reinforce repairs and connections, to tie down a tarp, or in a million other ways.\n\nBucket. The classic 5-gallon bucket has so many uses you probably already have one—but if you don’t, it’s time to pick one up. Catching leaks, hauling debris, water, or even tools, mixing—they can even be used as ersatz step stools in a pinch.\n\nMultitool. You have a whole set of hand and power tools, but when an emergency strikes, you don’t always have the time to gather everything you need. Having a high-quality multitool gives you a range of tools in your pocket, letting you get to fixing things immediately without delay.",

    "description": "Arne Slot praises the return of Mohamed Salah, with Liverpool's Champions League win in Marseille proving important for both.",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot has good memories in Marseille. It was here in 2022 when his Feyenoord side held on to secure a place in the Europa Conference League final.\n\nOn the eve of this week's game in the bowels of the Stade Velodrome, he was asked about those memories. He was also bizarrely and rudely asked about Xabi Alonso's links to the Liverpool job.\n\nAny noise surrounding the future of the Liverpool boss was quietened by a trademark European away performance from his side, who added Marseille to Eintracht Frankfurt and Inter Milan as the teams they have beaten on their travels this season.\n\nTheir unbeaten run of 13 matches (W7 D6) in all competitions may have been uninspiring for the large part but it is the longest ongoing streak of any team from Europe's big five leagues. In itself, credit must be due for that. Liverpool last lost a game in November.\n\nCrucially for Slot, it was a first win in a game that Mohamed Salah started for Liverpool since November 4, when they beat Real Madrid in the Champions League. It now looks like a line has been firmly drawn after Salah's interview at Leeds and both player and manager can move on for the betterment of the football club.\n\nThe reality is that both need each other. Pre-match, Slot told TNT Sports: \"The moments when I didn't play him, I was trying something different. We have missed goals from all the ball possession. If there's one player in the history of Liverpool that can score goals, it's Mo Salah.\"\n\nIt was a night where Salah did not add to his club record of 46 Champions League goals for Liverpool, even though he really should have when he fired wide in the second half, but the assurance with which Liverpool played in a 4-2-2-2 setup will leave Slot delighted and may well give him food for thought for the coming weeks.\n\n\"It says a lot about how big a professional he [Salah] is that he can be away for more than a month with a different team and be so fit to play 90 minutes for us after one day of training,\" said Slot. \"He was so close to a goal. It would usually be a goal from him, but it didn't harm us because we scored three.\"",
