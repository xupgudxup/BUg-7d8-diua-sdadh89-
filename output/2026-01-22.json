    "fullText": "Atlético Madrid’s horrid away form continued Wednesday, as the Rojiblancos now have won just one of their last five away matches in the Champions League. Atlético squandered a golden opportunity to all but secure a top eight-position in the final Champions League table. “Squandered” may actually be an understatement based on what I witnessed. If you can think of more extreme adjectives to describe the performance, feel free to drop them in the comments.\n\nAtletii looked far and away the better side for the first hour of the match. Giuliano Simeone was rewarded for his relentless energy and effort with a lovely headed goal, Marc Pubill kept Victor Osimhen firmly in his pocket, even while playing on a yellow card for most of the match, and the midfield played with cohesion and confidence. Los Colchoneros were unfortunate to concede an own goal that deflected in off Marcos Llorente. The Spaniard ultimately redeemed himself, however, clearing away a wide open chance for the Turkish club in the dying moments that would have seen Atleti return to Madrid empty handed.\n\nLet’s dive into some takeaways.\n\nYou could make the argument that Atleti’s chances of finding a winning goal ended the moment Robin Le Normand replaced Pablo Barrios. Over the course of the 2025 26 season, it has become abundantly clear that Barrios is Atlético Madrid’s most important player, and the match changed entirely once he left the pitch.\n\nThe decision to remove Alexander Sørloth for the final 30 minutes while continuing to send long crosses toward the 5’9” pairing of Antoine Griezmann and Álex Baena was head scratching, to say the least. With Julián Alvarez enduring a slump in form, Atléti are unfortunately reliant on Sørloth to consistently generate goal scoring chances.\n\nAnd with Alvarez, it is becoming glaringly obvious that he is not anywhere close to the level he showed last season. However, substituting him for a still-recovering Nico González is simply not a sound tactical decision. Alvarez has been poor, but he remains Atlético Madrid’s best attacking option. In a situation where a goal is needed, you have to live and die with La Araña.\n\nWhen you’ve built your attacking system around a very limited #9 your problems run very deep. https://t.co/lJ2AiOZmHT\n\n— Into the Calderón (@intothecalderon) January 21, 2026\n\nBetween the poor form of Baena and Alvarez, the growing dependence on Sørloth, Thiago Almada failing to become the signing many had hoped for and prime Griezmann feeling like a distant memory, Atlético Madrid have a serious problem in attack.\n\nToday’s match saw Baena and Almada turn in uninspired 45-minute halves. The former has struggled to find his place in the team over the past several months, while the latter continues to be linked with a move away from the club.\n\nWith Baena, the quality is clearly there, and it is hard to believe that two unfortunate injuries earlier in the year suddenly stripped him of it. Prior to donning the red and white stripes, Baena ranked among the league leaders in chance creation. Simeone simply cannot seem to unlock that same style of play for him. The flashes are there, but time is starting to run out and Atleti need answers.\n\nAlmada possesses excellent skill on the ball, but the fundamentals are lacking. The signing did not make much sense at the time and was met with mixed reviews from supporters, despite the player’s obvious talent. Personally, I do not see a clear path forward for the Argentina international.\n\nOn the topic of Argentines, Julián Alvarez has extended his goalless games streak to seven. We’ve talked about this countless times on this website. The world is starting to take notice. What can be done to pull Julián out of this slump?\n\nMy admittedly-novice take is that Simeone appears to be deploying Alvarez in more of a 10 role rather than the 9 position where La Araña is most comfortable. The intent seems to be for Alvarez to replicate the late 2010s Antoine Griezmann role, when the Frenchman was competing for Ballon d’Or honors and Atlétic0 were challenging for LaLiga and Champions League trophies. Perhaps a tactical adjustment could see Baena drop into the 10 role, a position in which he truly excels. Simeone needs to explore every option.\n\nI laugh as I type this, but Alexander Sørloth has become Atlético Madrid’s primary attacking option, and the club has grown far too dependent on the Norwegian, particularly during Alvarez’s slump. In the first five matches of 2026, Atléti have scored just five goals. Who has accounted for four of them? You guessed it.\n\nBarring a masterful Griezmann free kick against Deportivo La Coruña, that tally very easily could have been four goals in four matches and an elimination from the Copa del Rey. Sørloth is a fine player who has shown his quality, but he cannot be the main option if Atlético Madrid expect to compete for trophies.\n\nLos Colchoneros currently sit 12th with 13 points in the Champions League table. A win against Galatasaray would have seen them climb into the top five. The top eight is far from guaranteed at this stage, even with a victory against Bodø/Glimt.\n\nWhat are the scenarios in which Atlético qualify for the top 8? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nFirst, Atlético Madrid need to win their match against Bodø/Glimt to reach 16 points.\n\nA win by multiple goals is a necessity, as Atlético have just a plus-3 goal difference after seven matchdays.\n\nFour teams from the group PSG, Newcastle, Chelsea, Barcelona, Sporting and Manchester City will need to lose or draw. PSG face Newcastle, which guarantees at least one drop, possibly two if they draw.\n\nChelsea clash with Napoli, Barcelona face Copenhagen, Sporting take on Athletic Club and Manchester City play Galatasaray.\n\nNapoli, Copenhagen, Athletic, and Galatasaray all have Champions League play-off qualifying positions to fight for.\n\nAre Atlético out of contention for the top 8 in the Champions League? Absolutely not. Is it going to be easy? Absolutely not. Is anything with this team ever easy? Absolutely not.\n\nNext up for Atlético Madrid is an early afternoon Sunday kickoff at home against Mallorca, who are battling relegation.",

    "description": "Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate was predicted to be drafted into a good situation in NFL, per ESPN's Mel Kiper.",
    "fullText": "Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate shouldn't have to wait long to hear his name on draft night.\n\nTate recorded 51 catches for 875 yards and nine touchdowns on the Buckeyes, helping the program make it to the College Football Playoff quarterfinal.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper is projecting Tate to be a top-five draft pick. Most players drafted that early go to teams with bad situations.\n\nHowever, Tate might have luck in store for him in his rookie season.\n\nKiper thinks the New York Giants will take Tate with the No. 5 pick. Tate would be an intriguing addition to an offense that already boasts a star receiver in Malik Nabers, and those two could cause matchup nightmares for opposing defenses.\n\n\"The Giants have a lot of needs, but similar to Tennessee, they have a second-year quarterback looking for help,\" Kiper wrote. \"Yes, wide receiver Malik Nabers (knee) and running back Cam Skattebo (ankle/leg) will be back on the field, but wideout Wan'Dale Robinson is a free agent, and Nabers can't be the target on all of Jaxson Dart's throws.\n\n\"Taking a first-round wide receiver wouldn't be new to recently hired coach John Harbaugh; in Baltimore, he used four Day 1 picks starting in 2015 on the position (Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman, Hollywood Brown and Breshad Perriman).\"\n\nThe Giants went all-in for former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. With Tate, New York's offense could be a threat to go along with a defense that should improve in 2026 under Harbaugh.\n\nHarbaugh took the job with the Giants in part because he believes Dart can be an elite passer in the league.\n\n\"It starts with the quarterback for sure,\" Harbaugh said, via the Giants' website. \"You build your team around your quarterback. You build your team around your players and what they do well. I like the way (Dart) plays.\n\n\"I like his talent, skill set, all the things he's accomplished, but more than that, I like who he is and what he's about. To me, he's about football. This young guy loves football. He wants to talk football all the time and that's kind of what I like doing too.\"\n\nTate would certainly help accelerate Dart's development.\n\nIf Tate goes at No. 5, he'd join Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka as former Buckeyes to go in the first round.\n\nThose players are making big impacts on their respective teams.",

    "description": "Titans opt for another candidate, keeping Nagy in Kansas City amidst offensive struggles and potential Mahomes absence.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs won’t need to go looking for another offensive coordinator, at least for now, as current OC Matt Nagy lost out to Robert Salah to become the next head coach of the Tennessee Titans on Tuesday.\n\nNagy interviewed with the Titans over a week ago, causing many rumors of a departure to Tennessee that’d force the Chiefs to find a new OC in 2026. Perhaps that wouldn’t be the worst outcome for Kansas City, however, as the last couple of seasons haven’t been great in Kansas City on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nWe've completed in-person interviews with the following candidates. pic.twitter.com/Mctvgl2U5K\n\n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) January 20, 2026\n\nThere was no sign of the same dominant offense in Kansas City this past season. The Chiefs finished the season with 320.6 yards per game, only enough for 20th in the NFL. It’s only the second time the Chiefs haven't finished with at least 350 yards per game since Mahomes took over at QB.\n\nIt becomes even more alarming with the fact that the other season under 350 yards per game was in 2024, meaning the offense hasn’t been great in Kansas City for two consecutive seasons now. There’s no denying that the Chiefs, despite their dominance in the early 2020s, no longer instill the same fear into opponents from the offensive side of the ball.\n\nIt’s unfair to say the offensive troubles last season were entirely the fault of Nagy, however. In 2025, injuries and suspensions played a big role in the Chiefs’ failures. It’s why Nagy has garnered a lot of interest this offseason as a name to fill the head coaching vacancies around the league.\n\nNagy has been with the Chiefs for several years, first starting with the team back in 2013. After his stint as the head coach for the Bears, Nagy immediately returned to Kansas City, playing a role in its last three Super Bowl appearances.\n\nIt looks like he’ll be returning once again in 2026 despite the interest from the Titans, who ultimately chose Salejh, the defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. With Mahomes likely out for at least a portion of the 2026 season and several other question marks surrounding the offense, Nagy will certainly have his hands full come fall. In an offseason where there are looking to be several huge changes to the team, the Chiefs being able to keep Nagy will come as a breath of fresh air for the front office.",

Yes, it's absolutely, absolutely the goal,\" the Briton said after avoiding the question from host Greg James. \"Certainly, winning one gives you a lot more confidence. It's different for everyone, right? You've got to find your own way of doing things, and you have people with more confidence, people with less.\n\n\"I've never been the one to have the most confidence in myself. I certainly have more of it now, that's for sure. I've always been a seeing-is-believing kind of guy, but that's even for myself. So I've always had to see myself on the top step, see myself winning to finally believe that I can do it. But certainly last year, I managed to realise that before I achieved it.\n\n\"Already halfway through the season, I felt like I had everything I needed. The people around me, the team, the car, and my own ability to go out and win the championship. So that first time I really had the belief in myself was last year, and it turned out to be the correct thing to have. So, that was the beautiful thing, too.\"\n\n2026 brings in a new wave of regulations to the championship, allowing the grid to level itself as each team once again starts from zero.

After previously noting his Heisman Trophy win, Mendoza updated his page again to reflect being named the 2025 College Football National Championship MVP.\n\nIt was a fittingly unconventional move for a quarterback known as much for his process-driven approach. Mendoza has said he deleted most social media apps during the season, keeping only YouTube and LinkedIn. He has described the professional networking platform as a “positive place,” one where he prefers to share milestones rather than scroll.\n\nOn Monday night, Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to the first national championship in program history, capping a perfect season. He completed 16 of 27 passes for 186 yards and repeatedly extended drives on critical fourth downs.\n\nNone bigger than his 12-yard touchdown run on fourth and 5 in the fourth quarter. It was a play that sealed Indiana’s victory over the Miami and became an instant highlight of the CFP era.\n\nTwo days later, Mendoza explained the moment in a LinkedIn post that blended sincerity with humor.

    "description": "LSU football extended an offer to the son of a program legend this week. The LaFell legacy could continue on in purple and gold.",
    "fullText": "LSU football extended a scholarship offer to BJ LaFell, the son of LSU legend Brandon LaFell, on Wednesday.\n\nThe younger LaFell is a part of the 2029 recruiting class, coming off an impressive do-it-all freshman campaign at Shadow Creek High School. According to MaxPreps, he attempted nine passes in the 2025 season, completing five for 72 yards. He also saw 10 carries, rushing for 151 yards and four touchdowns. Lastly, LaFell did a fair amount of work as a receiver, with four catches for 82 yards and a touchdown.\n\nLSU isn’t the only SEC team racing to build a relationship with the young talent, as Ole Miss and Missouri have already extended him offers. It’s a surprise that the Tigers weren’t first in line, though, given the talent his father was during his time in Baton Rouge.\n\nAlthough LSU football has long been known as “Wide Receiver University,” with names such as Malik Nabers, Justin Jefferson, Ja’Marr Chase, Odell Beckham Jr., and Jarvis Landry in recent history, LaFell was one of the school’s first elite receivers. He’s one of the most productive pass-catchers in program history, ranking fourth all-time in receptions (175), sixth in receiving yards (2,517), and second in receiving touchdowns (25).\n\nAfter his four seasons as a Tiger, LaFell carved out a nine-year NFL career, recording 406 catches, 5,398 receiving yards and 31 touchdowns during his time as a pro.\n\nLaFell’s impressive playing career certainly sets a high bar for his son, but Tiger fans should hope that BJ is up to the challenge of trying to exceed the expectations that come with his last name -- and if so, that he plans to do so in Baton Rouge.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football offers scholarship to son of program legend",

    "title": "After 4 NFC title game losses with Packers, Davante Adams resumes chase of 'mythical thing' for Rams",
    "description": "Davante Adams reached the NFC championship game four times during his eight seasons with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.  Every time, Green Bay came up just short of the Super Bowl — and Adams still feels the pain.  “It just feels almost like a mythical thing to me at this point,” Adams said Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Davante Adams reached the NFC championship game four times during his eight seasons with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.\n\nEvery time, Green Bay came up just short of the Super Bowl — and Adams still feels the pain.\n\n“It just feels almost like a mythical thing to me at this point,” Adams said Wednesday. “You do everything you can to get there, and it’s been so hard. Been working so hard at it.”\n\nAfter an ensuing three years spent nowhere near a Super Bowl, Adams is back for his fifth shot when his Los Angeles Rams (14-5) visit the Seattle Seahawks (16-3) on Sunday for another NFC title game.\n\nThe 33-year-old Adams is still going strong as the league leader in touchdown receptions and a key component of the NFL's top offense. But when the decorated receiver says he craves that final, ultimate team success far more than individual accolades, it's clear he's among the rare athletes who absolutely mean it.\n\n“Forgive me if I’m not smiling ear-to-ear after the first win or the second (playoff) win, having been here so many times and understanding what it takes to get where we’re ultimately trying to go,” Adams said. “We’re close, and we’ve just got to finish it off.”\n\nAlthough Adams has been waiting the longest, he's far from the only Rams player who will be playing for a chance at a Super Bowl debut when they face the top-seeded Seahawks for the third time this season.\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a championship four seasons ago, but only a handful of players are left from that team — just two on defense.\n\nMatthew Stafford, tight end Tyler Higbee and cornerback Darious Williams are the only players left who made major contributions to that Super Bowl title run and also played extensively for the current team. Williams left and returned to the Rams, as did linebacker Troy Reeder and center Coleman Shelton.\n\nReeder now plays mostly special teams, while Shelton and starting left tackle Alaric Jackson were backups in 2021. Receiver Tutu Atwell was injured as a rookie and right tackle Rob Havenstein is injured now.\n\nBut nobody has been waiting longer than Adams for his first shot at a championship ring. He is one of the most consistent receivers of his generation, posting eight seasons with at least 997 yards while moving up to 26th in NFL history with 12,633 yards.\n\nHe almost certainly would have recorded another 1,000-yard season with Los Angeles, but Adams injured his hamstring in December. The Rams fell out of the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC during his three-game absence to close the regular season, most notably blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in Seattle.\n\nAdams has been vocal about the rejuvenating effect of working with Stafford and McVay, but he also knows his career is closer to its end than its beginning. After struggling along with his entire offense during an OT victory last week at Chicago, he's hoping to play a major role in what's likely to be a career-defining game in Seattle.\n\n“I started off with a great experience with the Packers and didn’t have anything else to compare it to, so you kind of, in a sense, take it for granted,” Adams said. \"I don’t think I was taking it for granted, but you go to a situation where you struggle a little bit \n\n“Being back in a position where you’re with a great team and a great situation, you definitely have a greater appreciation for times like this, for sure.”\n\nNOTES: The Rams only held a walkthrough practice at their training complex. ... LB Byron Young (knee soreness) wouldn't have practiced if the Rams had a full workout, McVay said. But Young, the Rams' sacks leader, is still expected to play Sunday. ... S Quentin Lake stayed home with an illness.",

    "fullText": "Liam Delap toiled up front for most of last night’s game against Pafos, again coming off without having found the net.\n\nAfter the game, his manager Liam Rosenior had to field questions about the striker. He’s been a big backer of the youngster in his early days as coach, but the pressure is on after the summer signing drew another blank.\n\nWhen asked if the striker was low on confidence, Rosenior denied that as an issue:\n\n“I wouldn’t say so. Liam’s an outstanding player,” the manager said after the game.\n\n“It’s very difficult for a centre-forward to find spaces when a team defends as deep as Pafos did. I think Liam prefers open spaces to run into and use his speed and his pace. But no, he did a lot of really good things today with and without the ball. I wouldn’t say he’s lacking confidence at all.”\n\nChelsea’s team to fact Pafos, fairly generic group. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWe’d largely agree with that – there have been times when we’ve seen the striker lacking belief, but recently we’ve seen him looking better, just not getting the service he needs. The way the team plays just doesn’t seem to suit anyone who plays up top. The issues of Enzo Maresca’s game style have continued here.\n\nDelap seems trusted ahead of Joao Pedro as the first choice 9, which is giving him more confidence. If he can score against Crystal Palace this weekend, we could see him finally break out.\n\nMoises Caicedo was the hero once again for Chelsea, scoring a crucial header to win the Blues the game and put them back into the Champions League top 8.\n\nLiam Rosenior has continued to use Malo Gusto inverted as a number ten in this game – something fans don’t love. We’re with them on that one.",

    "title": "Israel Adesanya bemoans 'bland' state of UFC middleweight division: 'It just doesn’t feel the same'",
    "description": "The two-time champ hopes to re-inject some excitement into the landscape at UFC Seattle.",
    "fullText": "Israel Adesanya isn’t chasing ghosts anymore. Not belts, not validation, not the version of himself that once ruled the UFC middleweight division with theatrical dominance and cultural gravity.\n\nAt this stage of his career, the former two-time UFC middleweight champion speaks like a man who has already climbed the mountain twice, seen the view from the top, and now understands the terrain in ways few ever will. The hunger still exists. The artistry still matters. But any entitlement is gone. So is the illusion, which, from his vantage point, clears up a less-than-stellar 185-pound landscape.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday's edition of \"The Ariel Helwani Show,\" Adesanya assessed his division at present.\n\n\"I [was champion] twice. It can happen again. I'm still me,\" Adesanya told Uncrowned. \"The middleweight division right now is not really the same as when I was in the game. I know they like me as champion, but it's not really my main focus. When it comes, it comes.\n\n\"What was the last exciting thing at middleweight? Where people were talking about it. It's good to have Khamzat [Chimaev] as champion — that was the last exciting thing. Since then, there's not really been anything that feels [interesting].\n\n\"It just doesn’t feel the same as when I was in the game,\" Adesanya added. \"I gave people someone to love, I gave some people someone to hate — I gave people something to feel, whether they loved me or hated me. But right now it just feels bland. Other divisions are way more exciting.”\n\nAdesanya’s critique isn’t rooted in bitterness; it’s more observational, almost clinical. He understands the business, the cycles of star power and the vacuum that forms when a division loses its gravitational pull. During his reigns, middleweight wasn’t just competitive — it was emotional. Rivalries carried narratives. Fights carried consequences. The division moved because Adesanya moved it.\n\nNow, he returns not as a savior or new superstar atop the weight class, but as a dangerous variable dropped back into the ecosystem of 185 pounds.\n\nThat variable meets Joe Pyfer in UFC Seattle's main event on March 28 — a matchup that feels intentionally volatile. Pyfer brings raw physicality, a knockout threat and the hunger of a rising contender looking to make his name. Adesanya recognizes exactly what the assignment represents.\n\n“It is just what I need to come back to — a dangerous opponent that they’re trying to feed me to,\" Adesanya said.\n\n\"This is a game. This is what happens. I’ve watched this game for years. I just know how they try and succeed, they try and fail, but this is just how the nature of the beast is.”\n\nAdesanya, 36, has been the hunter, the champion, the hunted, the measuring stick, and now — perhaps most intriguingly — the litmus test for the next wave. He doesn’t resist that role. He understands it.\n\nMore than anything, his perspective reflects a fighter who has shed the pressure of legacy-building and replaced it with presence. Time away has recalibrated him.\n\n\"I'm tainted because I've seen the game from the inside now, so I don't have the rose-colored glasses, obviously, but I love the pure art. The pureness of fighting,\" Adesanya said. \"This is one thing; I've taken a lot of time off. This is the biggest hiatus of my career.\n\n\"The end is always around the corner. F***, we could all go outside and get run over by a f***ing bus. The end's always around the corner, so I just try and live in the moment and take each moment as it comes. Enjoy the moment, really soak it in. I can do that now. There's no pressure to worry about other people. I just worry about myself.\"\n\nThat freedom — mental, emotional, competitive — may lead to the most unpredictable version of Adesanya yet. No chasing. No proving. No forced urgency. Just clarity.\n\n\"I feel freer than I ever have,\" Adesanya said. \"I know the game — I can’t be mad at the game, and you can’t be jaded. I’m just tainted, but I’m also blessed that I got to see the game from the inside, and I got to see it at the very top. The tippy, tippy, tippy top. I'm still right there, but I understand how the game is played, so I play accordingly, and I play it very well. This is just a new level that I haven't hit yet. So, just play my part.\"\n\nWhether that part leads back to gold or simply to moments worth savoring, Adesanya has already shaped an era. Now he’s navigating the next chapter with open eyes and a rare sense of peace. He'll step into Seattle not to reclaim the throne, but to remind the division that the artist is still very much alive.",

Even though I wasn’t able to return to play due to my knee injury, I’m incredibly thankful for the unwavering support from the club throughout this whole process the past two years. While this chapter is coming to an end, the people and experiences will stay with me forever. And I can’t wait to see all of the accomplishments this team achieves this year.”\n\nWright was the 13th overall selection in the 2021 NWSL Draft from Texas Tech University.\n\nDue to a knee injury suffered in the 2024 preseason, Wright has not been able to play in the past two seasons.\n\n“It’s devastating that KD has to step away from the sport like this. She had great talent and we hoped she would have a much longer career in Louisville,” Racing general manager Caitlyn Flores Milby said. “That said, we’re so happy that she’s taking this next step in her journey. She is a fantastic person and a wonderful mother and we’re proud to say she will always be a member of the Racing family.”\n\nOverall, Wright earned 39 NWSL appearances (25 starts) for Racing. She scored six goals and recorded two assists.\n\nWright gave birth to her first child in October 2025.\n\n“KD has given so much to this club over the years and has worked tirelessly to come back. She’s been an incredibly positive presence within our environment for a long time,” Racing head coach Bev Yanez said. “While we’re sad to see her step away from the game, we know she leaves at peace, having given everything she had. We’re so grateful to have been part of her journey and wish her nothing but the very best always. She’s an amazing person and truly deserves it all.”",

    "title": "Bo Bichette explains why Mets were ‘obvious’ choice in free agency",
    "description": "Bo Bichette was introduced by the Mets at Citi Field on Wednesday after signing with New York in free agency.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — The image of the Dodgers pouring out onto the field at Rogers Centre, celebrating a victory over the Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series last fall, will be ingrained in Bo Bichette’s mind forever.\n\nHe still hasn’t gotten over the end of that game — and the Blue Jays’ remarkable playoff run — in the months since.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bichette was in a new jersey, introduced to his new team, in a new city. And, in some ways, he was able to relieve that pain from November.\n\nHe firmly believes that his new team, the Mets, will give him an opportunity to get back to that stage again, as early as this year, with a real chance to finish the job this time around.\n\nThat, Bichette said, was part of what tipped the scales in his negotiations with multiple teams in free agency. It’s what made it “very obvious” that he wanted to be a Met.\n\n“My first priority is winning,” Bichette said, donning his No. 19 Mets jersey for the first time. “This organization is doing everything they can to do that.”\n\nBo Bichette was asked today how long it took for him to get over Game 7 of the World Series with the Blue Jays:\n\n\"I don't know if I have yet. This is probably helping. But yeah, to be that close, you never know when you're gonna get that opportunity again, but I think this team…\n\n— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) January 21, 2026\n\nBichette signed a three-year deal with the Mets last week, a $126 million pact that contains opt-outs after both his first and second seasons. It was reported that Bichette was close to a seven year, $200 million deal with the rival Phillies, but he chose the Mets hours later.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday if he is treating his contract with the Mets as a one-year deal, one of Bichette’s agents — Greg Genske — chimed in.\n\n“His commitment is to the Mets,” Genske said. “His desire is to be here. His desire is compete for championships here.”\n\nMany fans will question that logic. The Mets missed the playoffs in 2025 and seemingly took steps back during the first half of this offseason. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were two outs away from winning the World Series in the ninth inning of Game 7 less than three months ago. They won their division last season and advanced to the Fall Classic without Bichette, who was sidelined by a left knee sprain that kept him out until the World Series. Toronto has been active in bolstering their roster this winter. Plus, other high-spending contenders — like the Phillies — were contenders in the Bichette sweepstakes.\n\nBichette’s reasoning is rooted in the actions of owner Steve Cohen and Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns. He thinks the Mets have a roster that supports their offseason initiative to turn this franchise into a true perennial championship contender.\n\n“Mr. Cohen and David have put together an organization that is looking to win every single year, has an opportunity to win a World Series every single year and a roster that backs that up,” Bichette said. “It’s very exciting to be a part of this city, one of the best cities in the world — maybe the best city in the world. The fans, some of the best fans in the world. All of that is something I’ve always wanted to be a part of.\"\n\nThat’s part of the calculus in Bichette’s willingness to change positions heading into the 2026 season, too. He’ll be moving from shortstop to third base with the Mets, something he was open to throughout his dip into free agency, so long as he was signing with a team that gave him a good chance to win.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge,” Bichette said. “It’s just like anything else, it’s gonna take work to be good at something. I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it.”\n\nBichette will land in the middle of a formidable lineup that includes Fransisco Lindor, Juan Soto, Marcus Semien and Luis Robert, Jr., whom the Mets acquired Tuesday night in a trade with the White Sox.\n\nStearns isn’t concerned about Bichette being used at the hot corner for the first time in his professional career. He trusts that Bichette’s range at shortstop will translate to third and that he can handle the longer throws. Stearns has been prioritizing run prevention and defensive improvements all winter. Even with Jorge Polanco making a similar transition this year to now starting at first base for the Mets, Stearns is confident in this new-look group (with Semien at second and Lindor returning at shortstop).\n\n“There are going to be certain days this season, probably a lot of days this season, where we’re playing four shortstops on the infield, and that’s a pretty distinct advantage,” Stearns said. “The majority of that learning curve is going to be where to be on certain plays. Frankly, some things that may not be completely perceptible. We’re probably going to make a mistake or two. But we’re also going to have elite range around the infield and that’s pretty exciting.”\n\nBichette singled out positioning, bunt plays and a new type of throw across the diamond as the biggest challenges of this transition. Mets manager Carlos Mendoza, who will play a key role in helping Bichette with his defense this spring, has faith that the 27-year-old can pull it off.\n\n“It’s a different angle that you could take from there,” Mendoza said, “But he’s athletic and has work ethic, a lot of the things that will make the transition hopefully a lot smoother.”",

    "description": "The 2A Greater St. Helens League initially rejected the merger proposal, a coach told The News Tribune.",
    "fullText": "Winning the Class 2A Greater St. Helen’s League football title just got harder. Tumwater is coming to town.\n\nThe 2A Evergreen Conference (EvCo) is merging with the 2A GSHL for football beginning in the 2026 high school football season, The News Tribune has learned. The merger will include the 2027 season, as well.\n\nFor competitive reasons, Centralia High School was granted to play a 1A schedule in the 1A Evergreen, leaving the 2A EvCo with four schools: Tumwater, W.F. West, Black Hills and Aberdeen.\n\nAside from the comical optics of having a tiny four-team league, the larger issue for the 2A EvCo’s members is scheduling, forcing the remaining programs scrambling to find non-league games for over half of the season — a challenge when most teams around the state are getting into the league portion of their schedules by Week 3, and in some cases even earlier.\n\nTumwater High School football coach Willie Garrow told The News Tribune the 2A EvCo petitioned to join the GSHL for the 2026 and 2027 seasons last December and initially was rejected. The 2A EvCo resides in the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association’s (WIAA) “District 4,” one of the six geographic districts in the state.\n\nDirectors from District 4 reversed the decision on Tuesday, mandating the merger.\n\nGarrow told The News Tribune the 2A GSHL didn’t provide an official reason for initially rejecting the merger proposal.\n\n“There are lots of potential things that could be cited,” he said. “I’m sure travel was one of those concerns, the potential for travel changes. Aberdeen to Washougal, for example, that’s a trek. Sub-varsity games, that could be long and expensive. That kind of thing.”\n\nThe new 12-team league will consist of:\n\nTumwater, a perennial state tournament contender in Class 2A, has played in the 2A state championship game each of the past three seasons, falling to Anacortes in 2023 and 2024 and losing to Archbishop Murphy last fall. Tumwater won the 2A title in 2019, beating the Emeka Egbuka-led Steilacoom Sentinels.\n\nW.F. West also has been a regular state tournament contender. It reached the state semifinals in 2011 and 2022.\n\nFor Garrow and the other 2A EvCo schools, it solves the issue of having to schedule six non-league games.\n\n“They were really, really, really hard to fill,” he said. “It’s extremely difficult to find six non-league opponents. Most leagues in the state are eight or so teams, so they don’t have byes in Weeks 4, 5 and 6. Then the number of schools that do have byes, you have to convince them to play you.\n\n“From a high school football perspective as a head coach over the next two years, I enjoy the fact that we’re gonna have league stability, we know we’re gonna have opponents.”\n\nThe format of the league has yet to be determined. As a 12-team league, not every team will be able to play each other during the regular season. Multiple formats are being considered: two six team divisions, as well as a “pod system” with three pods of four teams.\n\nThe league merger will remain in place through the 2027 season, before the WIAA’s next four-year reclassification cycle, which will begin in the 2028-29 school year.",

    "description": "Broncos players rally behind backup QB Jarrett Stidham, confident he's prepared to lead Denver to AFC Championship glory after starter's injury.",
    "fullText": "There isn’t as much optimism as you’d expect from the fanbase of a team playing in the AFC Championship for fans of the Denver Broncos, but they’re under unique circumstances this week. All of the luck and good fortune that helped the Broncos to the No. 1 seed in the AFC has gone out the window after quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle in the final moments of the divisional round win against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWith Nix out, backup Jarrett Stidham will be under center on Sunday as Denver takes on the New England Patriots. It’s not ideal by any stretch of the imagination, but success in such a situation has been achieved several times before.\n\nNick Foles was the most recent success story to lead his team to a Super Bowl after stepping in for the injured starter. He won multiple playoff games for the Philadelphia Eagles and ended up winning Super Bowl LII.\n\nThe greatest quarterback of all time, Tom Brady, also got his first shot in the NFL after replacing starter Drew Bledsoe in 2001. He went on to lead the Patriots to a great regular season record and all the way to the Super Bowl, where he also earned a win.\n\nNot that Stidham is going to be the next Brady by any means, but just because Denver is relying on their backup doesn’t mean Sunday’s outcome has already been decided. The Broncos’ players have their full confidence in Stidham, who has been in Denver under head coach Sean Payton’s system for three years now. Defensive edge Zach Allen has full confidence in the 29-year-old.\n\n“He's the first guy in the building every day, and he prepares like a starter, so we're really excited to see what he does,” Allen said on Monday. “And obviously, he goes against the defense in practice all the time, and he's great. He's definitely a really good quarterback in this league. So excited to see what he does this week.\"\n\nRight tackle Mike McGlinchey is also confident in Stidham’s ability heading into the biggest game of his career.\n\n“He's been ready for his opportunity, whenever that may come,” he told reporters. “He stays in his routine every single day for three years straight, not knowing when that opportunity is going to come around. I know that our team and our staff and everybody has got the utmost confidence in Jarrett to play well and lead our team forward.\"\n\nThe Broncos will be hoping for an early return from running back J.K. Dobbins, who has had his 21-day activation window opened. If Stidham can lead Denver to a win this week, Dobbin’s possible return for the Super Bowl would be a huge bonus to a squad without its starting quarterback.\n\nFocusing on this Sunday, however, Stidham is the type of backup you’d hope for in this situation. Though his play style is a bit different from Nix’s, he’s very familiar with how Payton operates and what he expects from his quarterback. All the eyes of the football world will be on Stidham and the Broncos this weekend, waiting to see if Stidham can become the next backup QB to lead his team to glory.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe college football national championship game pitted the Big Ten's Indiana against the ACC's Miami.\n\nIt's something that has been discussed plenty by ESPN's college football czar, Paul Finebaum, himself an SEC guy.\n\nAnd that representation may have shown itself most in the days following the natty.\n\nAwful Announcing analyst Matt Yoder wondered if ESPN was partaking in \"a changing of the guard.\"\n\nAfter Indiana won the title, Finebaum didn't appear on First Take the next day.\n\nInstead, it was E.J.

But while he and the SEC have had to eat a lot of crow this postseason, the end of their dominance over the sport might represent an opportunity for others to make their voices heard.\"\n\nHoward isn't as much of a surprise, as he's already on College Gameday.\n\nWe'll see if this translates to the offseason and the season ahead.\n\nMORE: Toosii's plans to play college football at Syracuse take a twist",

    "description": "Maye has fumbled six times in their first two playoff games.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his first two career playoff starts, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye has experienced his share of growing pains. Still, Maye has delivered key plays that have helped New England reach the AFC Championship Game.\n\nWith a trip to the Super Bowl now on the line, Maye’s teammates continue to express confidence in the young quarterback despite some recent mistakes.\n\n“Our quarterback continues to show up, especially in those moments where things can go left or right,” wide receiver Stefon Diggs said. “He’s making the right reads. He’s making the right throws. He’s rolling with the punches.\n\n“Playoff ball — it’s not going to be pretty. I’ll take an ugly win any day.”\n\nMaye has fumbled six times and lost three over the Patriots’ first two postseason games. Nonetheless, he has shown a short memory, bouncing back to make pivotal plays — such as fourth quarter touchdown passes to Hunter Henry against the Chargers and Kayshon Boutte versus the Texans — in order to secure a pair of wins.\n\n“I think none of his plays are really bad plays. It’s just part of football. I watch him, and his demeanor and his temperament throughout the game, it never changes. I think he’s consistent,” Diggs said. “The more people that band behind him, you see it. Once he gets rolling, he’s real scary. He’s a young quarterback but he has had a maturation process second to none in my opinion.”\n\nAs Maye and the Patriots now prepare for a Denver Broncos defense that led the league in sacks, ball security will be a major point of emphasis. That focus extends beyond Maye, as well, as the quarterback has not always been the primary cause of the fumbles.\n\n“We have to be able to not get careless with the football. We can’t be reckless,” head coach Mike Vrabel said. “A lot of it is operation. We had two turnovers where we all weren’t on the same page. Not only is that a negative play if you don’t have everybody on the same page, but even worse, you lose the football or if you don’t have somebody on the same page and they blitz, somebody gets hurt. Those are the things we talk about when we’re not on the same page. I think that the operation is going to be critical.”",

See:\n\nAt least he didn’t fail in another clear opportunity he had at the 30th minute of the second half.\n\nCalleri received a beautiful assist from Pedro Ferreira and, face to face with the goalkeeper, made it 1-1.\n\nThe final stretch of the match at Morumbis didn’t hold back on excitement.\n\nPortuguesa regained the lead after Renê converted a penalty and Maceió made it 3-1.\n\nThere was still time for Calleri to score his second goal of the game and push São Paulo into a final surge, but Lusa managed to hold on for the win.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "It took some time, but it finally happened.\n\nThe Vikings have announced that defensive coordinator Brian Flores has signed a contract extension. His three-year deal ran through the end of the 2025 regular season.\n\nThe Vikings were confident Flores would stay, if he didn't get a head-coaching job elsewhere.\n\n“Brian has a unique ability to connect with players, understand their skill sets, and put them in positions to maximize their impact on the field,” coach Kevin O'Connell said in a release. “The identity of our defense is a reflection of his leadership and preparation. On a personal level, I’ve really valued the relationship we’ve built over the last three years, and that shared trust, alignment and high standard will continue to be critical to our success.”\n\nFlores interviewed with both the Ravens and Steelers for their head-coaching vacancies. The Pittsburgh interview happened on Wednesday. It's unclear whether the Vikings' announcement means he has withdrawn from consideration for either job.\n\nFlores, who coached the Dolphins from 2019 through 2021, also interviewed for the vacant defensive coordinator position in Washington.\n\nThe Vikings believed the Cowboys might make a run at Flores for their vacant defensive coordinator job. He was never interviewed, which possibly means the Cowboys knew what he wanted financially, and weren't willing to pay it.\n\nRegardless, the silence has been broken. The Vikings have a new deal with Flores. They presumably wouldn't have announced it if they thought he may be leaving.",

    "fullText": "Ex-Deion Sanders five-star Sa’vell Smalls: Playing at Colorado nearly left me paralyzed originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSa’vell Smalls did everything football ever asked of him, and more.\n\nHe was a five star recruit, a consensus national prospect, and a player once spoken about as a future star at the highest level. His path took him from Washington to Colorado in 2023, following opportunity, belief, and the promise of a fresh start under Deion Sanders.\n\nInstead, the game nearly took his life.\n\nIn a deeply personal message shared publicly, Smalls revealed that he has medically retired from college football after learning he was born with spinal stenosis, a condition that dangerously narrows the spinal canal. The diagnosis came only after a series of terrifying moments that no athlete expects to experience.\n\n🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/2fYpWQLfaN\n\n— Sav’ell Smalls 🧬 (@SavvySmalls_9) January 21, 2026\n\nSmalls described episodes of transient quadriplegia, temporary paralysis in his arms and legs, occurring during routine plays he had executed thousands of times. At first, he did what many athletes are conditioned to do. He stayed quiet. He pushed through numbness. He told himself it would pass.\n\nMORE: Meet Abella Danger—The one Miami celebrity fan Curt Cignetti won't tell you to Google\n\nEventually, the symptoms became impossible to explain away. Medical evaluations revealed the seriousness of the condition. Spinal fusion surgery was discussed, but even that came with no certainty. Doctors warned that continuing to play football carried a real risk of permanent paralysis.\n\nFor Smalls, the choice became brutally clear.\n\nSanders has not publicly responded. However, the decision dates back to last fall, when Smalls was advised that continuing to play carried serious risk.\n\nMORE: Malachi Toney admits he’d be playing in the SEC if not for a coaching change\n\nWhat stood out just as much as what was said was what was not.\n\nIn a message filled with gratitude for family, doctors, and those who supported him through the hardest decision of his life, Smalls did not mention Coach Prime or the Colorado coaching staff. That absence is notable, especially in a sport where public thanks are often extended even in far less personal moments.\n\nOnce viewed as an immediate impact defender and a future NFL prospect, Smalls exited the game quietly. There was no press conference. No farewell moment. No orchestrated goodbye. Just a decision made privately, months earlier, with life itself hanging in the balance.\n\nMORE: D’Angelo Ponds’ father sends 'BTA' message to Michael Irvin after Indiana's title win\n\n“I medically retired,” Smalls wrote. “Ending my athletic career for good.”\n\nThe words are simple.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — From hitting in the clutch to testing free agency, Bo Bichette has soaked up plenty of baseball advice from his big league dad over the years.\n\nDante Bichette doesn't have much to offer about handling the hot corner, though.\n\nAfter signing a $126 million, three-year contract with the New York Mets, the younger Bichette was formally introduced by the team Wednesday and pulled on a No. 19 jersey at a packed Citi Field news conference.\n\nA two-time All-Star shortstop with the Toronto Blue Jays, Bichette will shift to third base with the Mets, who have Francisco Lindor entrenched at shortstop. Bichette said he hasn't played third since travel ball as a teenager.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge. I mean, it’s just like anything else: It’s going to take work to be good at something, and I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there’s different positioning, different plays you have to deal with at third base that I’m going to have to get used to and learn, but I think that’s all attainable.”\n\nDante Bichette, in attendance Wednesday along with other family members, was a four-time All-Star outfielder from 1988-2001. Known much more for his bat than glove, he played one inning at third base for Milwaukee in 1991.\n\n“I didn’t know he did that. I had no idea,\" Bo Bichette said with a grin. \"That would be interesting to watch.”\n\nHousehold jabs aside, the new-look Mets are confident Bichette can make the switch successfully.\n\nHe didn't grade well at shortstop last year, and Bichette entered free agency this offseason willing to move to second or third. He plans to call former Toronto teammate Matt Chapman, a five-time Gold Glove winner at the hot corner, to get some thoughts about manning third.\n\n“This is a player who is universally respected for his aptitude and his work ethic on the field,\" Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said about Bichette. \"And so when you combine those two things it generally gives you comfort that they can make adjustments, make changes, and Bo is very confident that he’s going to be able to do this, and everything we’ve seen backs that up.”\n\nBichette spurned the NL East rival Philadelphia Phillies to sign with the Mets and gives them a proven hitter with a potent right-handed bat to help complement lefty slugger Juan Soto.\n\nBichette batted .311 with 18 home runs, 94 RBIs and an .840 OPS in 139 games last year for the Blue Jays, who fell one win short of a World Series title.\n\nHe hit a three-run homer off Shohei Ohtani in Game 7 of the Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and is a .330 career hitter with runners in scoring position — the third-best mark in the majors among qualified hitters since 2019.\n\nBichette batted .381 with RISP last season.\n\n“I don’t know if my eyes light up or anything like that, but definitely probably get a little bit more focus,\" he said. \"And my dad taught me a lot about it. That’s all I heard about growing up was driving in runs, so I’ve put a lot of work into it.”\n\nBichette, who turns 28 in March, gets a $40 million signing bonus payable March 15 and a $2 million salary this year. He has $42 million player options for 2027 and 2028. If he declines either option, he would receive a $5 million buyout, payable in $1 million installments each July 1 from 2036-40.\n\n“We had a lot of conversations about the different structure of the deal, and Bo had his choice of long-term deals, shorter-term deals, opt outs,\" agent Greg Genske said. “His priority was finding a place where he felt like he could get better as a player and have a chance to compete for championships.”\n\nNew York signed right-handed reliever Luis García to a $1.75 million, one-year contract. He can earn $1.25 million in performance bonuses for games pitched: $100,000 for 25, $150,000 each for 30 and 35, $175,000 for 40, $200,000 for 45, $225,000 for 50 and $250,000 for 55.\n\nGarcía, who turns 39 this month, went 2-2 with a 3.42 ERA and two saves in 58 combined appearances last season with the Dodgers, Nationals and Angels. He is 28-30 with a 4.07 ERA and 17 saves in 13 major league seasons.\n\nTo open a spot for García on the 40-man roster, infielder Tsung-Che Cheng was designated for assignment.\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.",

It's the most important things. I don't have problems with them outside the cage. One of the reasons why we don't like each other is because if we fight we're going to smash each other. If someone would retire, we won't have issues to be in conflict. I think that position (is the one) taken by all fighters. Nobody will fight with friends.\"\n\nDespite his eagerness to take a crack at the current UFC titleholder, Nurmagomedov doesn't appear in a rush. Even should he get through former UFC flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo on Saturday, Nurmagomedov said he has a hunch he'll have to fight one more time before a title shot is awarded to him.\n\n\"I don't feel (Sean O'Malley) is even going to be next,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"Maybe after this fight, we're going to fight for the title. Merab and Petr will maybe fight in a rematch. But for me, it doesn't matter. Any option, I will be ready.\"\n\nShould he beat Figueiredo, Nurmagomedov has already penciled in the event and location on his calendar in which he could punch his ticket to a UFC title fight.\n\n\"It's going to be good, (if I fight in October in Abu Dhabi),\" Nurmagomedov said. \"I can fight main event five rounds. If it's going to Sean O'Malley, for example, it's going to be a big fight.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Umar Nurmagomedov clarifies Khabib's comments about Petr Yan",

I just want to talk it out,” Simmons said. “I feel like I’ve been in a really good spot with the Seattle sports fan bases. Sunday night, doing a live pod on Netflix. A lot of stuff going, coming off Bears-Rams, head’s spinning, all these different directions. We’re talking about Super Bowl matchups, and I say the Seahawks never won a Super Bowl.\n\n“Now, you could say I’m old. I would go with brain fart because I would say I know the Seahawks won a Super Bowl. I was writing for Grantland at the time. I was doing podcasts and writing about that Super Bowl year. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them kick Peyton Manning’s a--. If I had thought about it for a split second, I would have remembered they won. But I think I brain-farted and mixed them up with the Mariners. So I’m here to ask for forgiveness.”\n\nMORE: Bills have no choice but to trade Keon Coleman now\n\nHis brain very likely mixed them up with the Mariners, which is fair given they nearly made the World Series in October. The Mariners have never even made it to the World Series, let alone won one.\n\n“My standard response for this stuff is, it is hard to host a pod. You’re not going to bat a thousand,” Simmons said. “…I was thinking afterwards, I was like, ‘Why did I say that? What happened to my brain?’ But then I realized the Rams, Bears, and the Bills game probably broke my brain.”\n\nMORE: Could the Raiders trade the No. 1 pick and Fernando Mendoza?\n\nThose games were pretty wild. It broke a lot of brains.\n\nStill, though, the Seahawks won pretty recently. Simmons won't make this mistake again.\n\nBrowns can draft the brother of a Cavs' NBA star\n\nThe 2027 Super Bowl is on Valentine's Day\n\nNew perspective on Tua Tagovailoa and his head injuries\n\nThe lastest on how Travis Kelce's wedding to Taylor Swift impacts retirement\n\nJohn Harbaugh should already have a $100 million regret\n\nThis throw is why the Bears drafted Caleb Williams 1st overall",

Fighting Illini head coach Brad Underwood shared the tough injury news on Boswell earlier this week.\n\nBoswell has been one of the best guards in the Big Ten so far this season, averaging 14.3 points and 3.4 assists per game this year. He is a big reason for why Illinois is among the elite Big Ten teams this year, with an overall record of 15-3 and 6-1 mark in conference games.\n\nMichigan State is set to host Illinois on February 7 as the lone regular season meeting between the Spartans and Fighting Illini. That game would be within the expected window of time Boswell will be out, so his injury certainly could impact that game in a few weeks. Illinois is a well-rounded team this year, but we will see how they handle this unfortunate injury news.\n\nDamn tough break.

    "fullText": "With the brutal news after the Denver Broncos divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills of Bo Nix being done for the year with an ankle injury, the need to get healthy for the AFC Championship Game became a critical need. Two names are on that list for us to watch for: J.K. Dobbins and Luke Wattenberg. With Nix out, those first two are probably code red needs for this game. Surprisingly, both wide receivers Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant were at practice today as well.\n\nGreat news there on all injury fronts. First, Dobbins was practicing today for the first time since injuring his foot in Week 10. The rehab time on that felt like a iffy maybe for the Super Bowl at the time, but he’s well ahead of schedule and seemingly back at the most critical time for this football team. Wattenberg’s status is a little more questionable as the team did open his 21-day practice window today, but I should note he was the only guy of the four who was a full participant.\n\nThough, when asked, head coach Sean Payton was adamant that he would not comment on any player’s expected return time from injury. So practicing is a good sign, but we won’t know if they are game-ready until Friday or even possibly until 90 minutes before kickoff with the gameday inactive report.\n\nHere is your full practice report for Wednesday.\n\nBOLD – Indicates change in status; NIR­- Indicates not injury related; *- Team conducted a walk-through / report is an estimation\nSTATUS DEFINITIONS: Did not participate (DNP); Limited: means less than 100 percent of a player’s normal repetitions; Full—100 percent of player’s normal repetitions; Out: will not play; Doubtful: Unlikely to play; Questionable: Uncertain to play",

    "fullText": "Yoane Wissa does not have to look too far for inspiration.\n\nAlan Shearer, Jackie Milburn, Andy Cole, Malcolm Macdonald and Les Ferdinand are just some of the prolific strikers who have worn Newcastle United's iconic number nine shirt.\n\nWissa is the latest in a long line to inherit it, and he offered a reminder why in his side's 3-0 Champions League win against PSV Eindhoven at St James' Park.\n\nOn a night supporters unfurled a banner urging their side to \"write the next headline\", Wissa certainly did so.\n\nNot only did he open the scoring after just eight minutes, the forward also set up his side's second goal with the aggressive manner in which he pressed slack PSV defender Yarek Gasiorowski.\n\nNo wonder the man of the match left the field to a standing ovation after he was taken off by head coach Eddie Howe midway through the second half.\n\nThe prospect of sampling such moments under the lights had long served as inspiration after Wissa suffered a knee injury while on international duty with DR Congo back in September.\n\n\"It's been a tough start for him here,\" Howe said. \"For any new player to come and get a serious injury, having not even done a training session, that's really tough mentally.\n\n\"So it's taken us a while to get him to a level that's close to his best, and I still feel he's got some more to come.\n\n\"A big night for him tonight because in part that's why he came to the club - for these nights - and I'm just pleased that he's made a positive impact.\"\n\nIt has taken Wissa time to deliver such performances.\n\nWissa, who had already had a disrupted pre-season, following his protracted departure from Brentford, has only scored three goals since making his debut for Newcastle last month.\n\nThe forward has looked rusty at times, failing to take a big chance to open the scoring in the defeat against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-finals last week.\n\nBut Wednesday night showed what he can bring to this side.\n\nHowe had called on Wissa to \"max out\" before the game, and he led the press effectively against a naive PSV side, who repeatedly played out from the back.\n\nThat certainly did not go unnoticed by fellow goalscorer Harvey Barnes.\n\n\"He's had a tough start since he's come here,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"Obviously injured for a long time. I had a similar start here. I know how tough it is just watching from the stands, so I know how delighted he will be.\n\n\"A first Champions League goal. I thought he played really well so I'm buzzing for him.\"\n\nThe challenge for Wissa, of course, is to start scoring more regularly.\n\nBut he is a poacher in a differing mould to the towering Nick Woltemade, who likes to come in deep.\n\nOf those forwards to have played a minimum of 250 minutes in the Premier League this season, Wissa ranks first for cross option runs per game.\n\nThese are defined by Opta as runs to get into the penalty area to make yourself available for a cross while your team-mate has the ball in a wide area.\n\nWissa also ranks 15th for runs in behind.\n\nGiven their differing qualities, Howe felt it was \"transformative\" to have Wissa available after Woltemade had to shoulder the burden up front in his absence.\n\nIt had always been the plan for the pair to share the load after Newcastle lost top scorer Alexander Isak to Liverpool last summer, and Wissa's Premier League experience helps explain why Newcastle paid such a hefty £55m fee.\n\n\"Yoane's career at Brentford was brilliant to watch from afar because I thought he was outstanding for them, scoring a number of massive goals,\" Howe said.\n\n\"I loved his attitude and the way that he played, the determination and aggression that he played with.\"\n\nSuch aggression is one of the reasons Wissa is likely to line up from the off against holders Paris St-Germain next week.\n\nNewcastle are in a strong position going into that final game of the league phase, and sit in seventh place in the standings.\n\nNewcastle have already secured a last 16 play-off spot, and still have the chance to reach the knockout stages automatically with a landmark result in the Parc des Princes next week.\n\nWhile Howe refuted talk of \"revenge\" after a controversial stoppage-time penalty was awarded against his side on their last visit to the French capital in 2023, the visitors certainly won't need any added motivation.\n\n\"We know what we can do when we turn up against teams,\" Barnes added.\n\n\"We had a sour taste after the game a couple of years ago, and it's one we will want to go and put right.\n\n\"It's a massive challenge - they're a quality side - but why not?\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

And while there's apparently nothing to it, the 49ers won't shrug it off.\n\n“What I would tell you, because it deals with allegedly the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,\" G.M. John Lynch told reporters on Wednesday. \"So, our guys have been — we've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and by coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means. That's what we know exists. We've heard that debunked. So yes, we will look into it. We have. The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pour into it. Our ownership, [CEO] Jed [York], tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened. We aren't going to turn a blind eye. We'll look into everything.”\n\nThe 49ers have practiced in the same facility since 1988, winning three Super Bowls in the first seven years there. And even if there's nothing to the electricity angle, the 49ers have had too many injuries in recent years.\n\n\"The health and performance of our players is at the utmost priority each and every year,\" Lynch said. \"You know, this year it was tough and it took a toll on our team. We'll continue to look. Now, having said that, we've spent a lot of time and effort in recruiting really quality people and I think being at the forefront of injury prevention. I think this year probably because the star players that that went down there was a lot of attention given on that. The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game. And so, what we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries, and I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. That process has begun. It never frankly stopped, but yes, we'll look at everything and we'll examine everything.\"\n\nA certain amount of injuries are unavoidable. Still, training and nutrition and flexibility can be factors in the ability of players to stay healthy. Whatever the reason for two straight years of too many injuries for the 49ers, they need to get to the bottom of the problem, and fix it.",

    "description": "For those wondering if the Houston Texans will be moving off another offensive coordinator this offseason, don't bet the house on it happening.",
    "fullText": "For those wondering if the Houston Texans will be moving off another offensive coordinator this offseason, don't bet the house on it happening.\n\nTexans general manager Nick Caserio said Wednesday that he anticipates first-year playcaller Nick Caley to get a second season running the offense when the Texans return to NRG Stadium next season.\n\n\"I think Nick learned a lot, [in his] first opportunity as a playcaller,\" Caserio said. \"I would say, offensively, probably the last two to three months of the year played pretty good football and did a lot of good things, so there was growth and improvement.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Texans coach DeMeco Ryan sparked a bit of controversy among fans when he said that he would be “evaluating everything throughout the week” when asked about Caley’s future, which echoed a similar feel to that of former coordinator Bobby Slowik in 2024.\n\nNick Caserio when asked if Nick Caley will return in 2026:\n\n“Yeah I would anticipate Nick being here next year. Nick learned a lot, first opportunity as a play caller. Offensively, probably the last 2-3 months of the year, played pretty good football.” pic.twitter.com/GnfmGoHv62\n\n— Houston Stressans (@TexansCommenter) January 21, 2026\n\nWhile Caserio did say that nothing was final about any coach's return, he mentioned that he and Ryans speak daily and felt he wasn’t speaking out of line when dicussing the long-term status of the former New England Patriots tight ends coach.\n\n\"All of us are just trying to improve and do what we can to make the team and the organization better,” Caserio said.\n\nCaley replaced Slowik after an underwhelming second year running the offense with quarterback C.J. Stroud. Much to Caserio's comments, the offense did improve after a vastly underwhelming start, which resulted in an 0-3 record and four-game stretch where Stroud never scored a red-zone touchdown.\n\nWhile Caley's offense never took a colossal leap forward, the unit went from 23rd to 20th in total yards (319.7 to 327.0) and 21st to 13th in scoring (21.9 points per game to 23.8). Perhaps the biggest win came in the team's turnover ratio, which rapidly diminished from 19 in 2024 to just 12 in 2025 during the regular season.\n\nBut the playoffs are where Stroud and the overall struggles really reached a low for Caley's faults in year one. Over a two-game stretch, Stroud tossed five interceptions, including four first-half turnovers in the divisional round loss to the New England Patriots. He also had five fumbles and three turnovers in a wild-card round win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n#Texans GM Nick Caserio said he does expect OC Nick Caley to be back next season as the play-caller pic.twitter.com/8Y86EmOcr7\n\n— SportsTalk 790 (@SportsTalk790) January 21, 2026\n\nStroud seemed to be on board with a reunion for Caley in 2026 after seeing regular-season improvements the team's first 12-win season since 2012.\n\n\"Yeah, definitely. I love Cales,\" Stroud said. \"I think there's growth in our relationship, there's growth in his ability to call plays, growth and DeMeco trusted him.\"\n\nThe Texans also expected to have offensive line coach Cole Popovich back for next season after his promotion led to major changes to the trench play. Behind a makeshift offensive line that saw 13 different combinations, the Texans only allowed 31 total sacks and 113 pressures, which ranked 20th in the league.\n\n\"Overall, I would say that group certainly improved,\" Caserio said. \"I think Cole did a phenomenal job with that group, him and Coach [Zach] Yenser.\"\n\nThe Texans own the No. 28 pick in the upcoming NFL draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: Texans GM Nick Caserio 'expects' OC Nick Caley to return for 2026",

    "description": "Exclamation marks, ellipses and ‘haha’ can’t fix our growing inability to communicate.",
    "fullText": "“How Many Exclamation Points Are Too Many in an Email? A Psychologist Weighs In.” A psychologist! This article appeared in Parade last summer, but you could find the same question being asked, at varying levels of desperation, in any season over the past decade. It is widely understood that exclamation points must be inserted into the modern professional email at precise intervals — just enough to create a tone of eagerness and warmth without tipping over into sounding fake, sycophantic or batty. So people appeal to the internet, terrified they’re hindering their careers by striking the wrong balance; they seek advice from job coaches; they joke about their obsessive budgeting of exclamations. They fear seeming overexcited, yes — but they also know the risks of the plain old period. Too brusque. Too cold. Too testy.\n\nIt has been this way since soon after the smartphone arrived, when older Americans started getting the unwelcome news that ending their messages with periods was a grave faux pas. This must have been a baffling experience, like being called gross for drinking water or flossing. But a new tonal consensus really had emerged: The period seemed pointed, stern, passive-aggressive. By 2013, this shift was ingrained enough that The New Republic ran an article celebrating the period’s newfound role as a jerk.\n\nSince then, our anxieties about tone seem to have skipped right over the content of our messages to the characters that end them. There has been a long parade of replacements for the period. The writer of that New Republic piece thought ellipses were nice. (They’re not; younger people find them not only Boomerish but also horror-movie ominous.) For a while, young people preferred the nervous chuckling of a “lol” or “haha.” (“Why Do Millennials Feel Compelled to Write ‘Lol’ After Everything?” asked Huffpost last fall — to which one answered that it was “like a tension-breaking mechanism,” while another pointed out that texting “I think I love you, lol” allows you to pretend you were kidding if you don’t get a favorable response.) Emoji, too, had their turn as sentence-enders — all except that subset, like the thumbs-up and the “OK” hand signal, that came to be associated with the same passive-aggressive terseness as the period, the equivalent of a clipped verbal “fine.”\n\nSome of these habits are still considered informal or even immature, but they have also aged their way up into typical workplace communication, and some people would love to impose a new consensus around them, too. “It’s impossible to convey emotions through text, and this helps the reader understand your intent,” someone posted on Reddit years ago, regarding lols and hahas. “I have coworkers who sound dead inside when we IM, because they believe any kind of informal slang is reserved for childish teens.”\n\nOveruse has taken the shine off some tactics, with young men in particular getting mocked for reflexively haha-ing in an effort to seem coolly unbothered. (“Men are always communicating like this via text-based platforms haha,” Kelly Conaboy once wrote on the website The Hairpin. “Why? haha. You don’t have to haha.”) In the workplace, though, more upscale methods of period avoidance have thrived. Consider, for instance, the application of question marks to non-questions we’re hoping to advance gently — the same wheedling uptalk used when we fake-wince and tell a colleague “I don’t know if that will work?” As speech, this habit is so associated with corporate management that it’s mocked in comedies like “Office Space” and early stories by George Saunders, who once had a police officer explain an apparent grave-robbing with the line “Typically it’s teens?” And yet in text it has irresistible utility.\n\nTo monitor one’s tone is human, but why are we this scared of sounding brusque in routine emails? The usual explanations revolve around the difficulties of conveying tone in writing. It’s a bit much to say that it’s “impossible to convey emotions through text” — I mean, literature exists — but the lack of access to vocal inflections, facial expressions and listener feedback does create challenges.\n\nIf the issue were just writing, though, you’d expect the rise of short-form video to solve it. Making a TikTok or YouTube video restores all of the inflection and expression people claim to be lost without. And yet the people on these platforms are not exactly bringing back deadpan or disdain. For the most part, they evince a manic desire to be ingratiating, with everything from lulling hand movements to singsong speech designed to be immediately liked.\n\nThe issue, in other words, isn’t the writing. It’s the lack of context — the fact that more and more of what we communicate is aimed at somebody we don’t know or rarely speak to, with little base line of what we’re normally like. This is true of social media audiences, but it may be equally true of a colleague from accounts payable — someone with whom we might, in another time, have been forced to negotiate some in-person rapport, but now interact with largely via bursts of typing. No amount of tone-marking seems likely to resolve our worries over this arrangement. Even the habits we make socially mandatory will just become invisible obligations that have to be augmented with even friendlier signals. And if this level of social anxiety has infiltrated the act of typing a message, you might as well embrace the full experience: Walk over to accounts payable and say it directly, in whatever expressionless monotone you like. If nothing else, you won’t have to wonder how your new friend reacted.",

However, the gradient estimator in the distillation stage usually suffers from two sources of bias: (1) biased teacher supervision due to score estimation error incurred during pre-training, and (2) the student model's score estimation error during distillation.

    "title": "Spotify Lawsuit Triggered Anna's Archive Domain Name Suspensions",
    "description": "Spotify and several major record label have taken legal action against the unknown operators of Anna's Archive.",
    "fullText": "Anna’s Archive is generally known as a meta-search engine for shadow libraries, helping users find pirated books and other related resources.\n\nHowever, in December, the site announced that it had also backed up Spotify, which came as a shock to the music industry.\n\nWhile Anna’s Archive initially released only Spotify metadata, and no actual music, the industry was on high alert. Over Christmas, Spotify and the major labels prepared a legal response in U.S. federal court.\n\nOn December 29, Spotify, UMG, Sony, Warner, and other labels filed their complaint at the Southern District of New York. They accuse Anna’s Archive of mass copyright infringement, breach of contract, DMCA violations, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Anna’s Archive “brazenly” circumvented Spotify’s DRM. The site scraped 86 million music files and metadata for 256 million tracks from Spotify, which would all eventually be released publicly.\n\n“…Anna’s Archive has threatened to imminently mass-release and freely distribute its pirated copies of the sound recording files to the public, without authorization from or compensation to the relevant rights holders. Such widespread and illegal infringement would irreparably harm the music industry..,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe complaint comes with a request for a preliminary injunction and a restraining order that aim to take Anna’s Archive offline. All these documents were filed under seal, as the shadow library might otherwise be tipped off and take countermeasures.\n\nThese documents were filed ex-parte and kept away from Anna’s Archive. According to Spotify and the labels, this is needed “so that Anna’s Archive cannot pre-emptively frustrate” the countermeasures they seek.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was unsealed recently, explains directly why Anna’s Archive lost several of its domain names over the past weeks. The .ORG domain was suspended by the U.S.-based Public Interest Registry (PIR) in early January, while a domain registrar took the .SE variant offline a few days later.\n\n“We don’t believe this has to do with our Spotify backup,” AnnaArchivist said at the time, but court records prove them wrong.\n\nThe unsealed paperwork shows that the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on January 2, which aimed to target Anna’s Archive hosting and domain names. The sealed nature of this order also explains why the .ORG registry informed us that it could not comment on the suspension last week.\n\nWhile the .ORG and the .SE domains are suspended now, other domains remain operational. This suggests that the responsible registrars and registries do not automatically comply with U.S. court orders.\n\nWhile the TRO was not public, a preliminary injunction that was issued by U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff on January 16th shows how broad the granted powers are.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, and without a defense, the court concluded that the music companies’ copyright infringement claim will hold up. Therefore, the court ordered that Anna’s Archive is enjoined from ‘hosting, linking to, [or] distributing’ the copyrighted works.\n\nSince it’s uncertain whether Anna’s Archive will comply, the injunction also targets many third-party intermediaries, including domain registries and registrars, hosting companies, and other service providers.\n\nThese companies should assist in stopping the infringing activity on Anna’s Archive.\n\nTo avoid uncertainty, the court explicitly mentions that the targeted companies include the Public Interest Registry; Cloudflare Inc.; Switch Foundation; The Swedish Internet\n\nFoundation; National Internet Exchange of India; Njalla SRL; IQWeb FZ-LLC; Immaterialism Ltd.; Hosting Concepts B.V.; and Tucows Domains Inc.\n\nThe addition of Cloudflare stands out because the company operates a proxy service, without hosting Anna’s Archive’s content permanently. However, that was sufficient for the court to issue the order.\n\nWhile the unsealed documents resolve the domain suspension mystery, it is only the start of the legal battle in court. It is expected that Spotify and the music companies will do everything in their power to take further action, if needed.\n\nInterestingly, however, it appears that the music industry lawsuit may have already reached its goal. A few days ago, the dedicated Spotify download section was removed by Anna’s Archive.\n\nWhether this removal is linked to the legal troubles is unknown. However, it appears that Anna’s Archive stopped the specific distribution of Spotify content alleged in the complaint, seemingly in partial compliance with the injunction’s ban on ‘making available’ the scraped files.\n\nWhether this will mean that all troubles are now over has yet to be seen. For now, the copyright infringement allegations and other claims remain unresolved in court.\n\nA copy of the unsealed complaint filed by Spotify and the labels is available here (pdf). The preliminary injunction can be found here (pdf).",

    "description": "Data centers are shifting from NTP to PTP for precise time synchronization, enabling real-time workloads but requiring complex network upgrades.",
    "fullText": "Data centers are shifting from NTP to PTP for precise time synchronization, enabling real-time workloads but requiring complex hardware and network upgrades.\n\nFor decades, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been the gold standard for synchronizing time across data center networks. But increasingly, that’s no longer the case. Modern networking demands greater precision than ever, and the venerable NTP often falls short.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, data centers are now migrating to alternative methods for maintaining network time, such as the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) – an approach that is more complex to implement but worth the extra effort, enabling a whole new level of timing synchronization accuracy.\n\nNetwork time refers to the synchronization of time across devices connected to a network.\n\nTo exchange data accurately and avoid errors, all devices on a network must be synchronized. Otherwise, issues can arise, such as one server mistakenly treating data it received from another server as late due to inconsistencies in each server's time settings.\n\nKeeping network time in sync is important on any network. But it’s especially critical in data centers, which are typically home to large numbers of network-connected devices, and where small inconsistencies in network timing could snowball into major network synchronization problems.\n\nSince the 1980s, the main approach to synchronizing time across networks has been the Network Time Protocol (NTP). NTP works in a simple, straightforward way: devices on a network periodically check in with an NTP server, which tells them the correct time. If the time on a device is not in sync with the “official” time according to the NTP server, the device updates its time settings.\n\nNTP works very well in situations where networks can tolerate timing inconsistencies of up to a few milliseconds (meaning thousandths of a second). But beyond this, NTP-based time syncing is less reliable due to limitations such as:\n\nPeriodic check-ins: With NTP, devices only check in with NTP servers periodically – and often, several minutes can go by between verification events. In the meantime, devices may drift out of sync because their local clocks deviate from NTP-based time.\n\nNetwork latency issues: Even if devices were to poll NTP servers very frequently, delays in the time it takes for the server to respond over the network could contribute to inaccurate time readings. They may be measured only in small fractions of a second, but that’s still a problem for data centers that require incredibly precise network timing.\n\nComputational delays: Polling an NTP server and polling time data also takes time because it requires computational resources – and here again, although the delays may be extremely small, they can still matter.\n\nThese challenges render NTP unsuitable for data centers hosting workloads that demand true real-time data exchange – such as those that support real-time financial trading, robotic process coordination or the management of autonomous vehicles. To support cases like these, data centers need to maintain time with microsecond-level accuracy. (A microsecond is one-thousandth of a millisecond.)\n\nFortunately for data center operators facing challenges like these, there’s an alternative to NTP: the Precision Time Protocol (PTP).\n\nUnlike NTP, PTP doesn’t rely solely on a server-client model for syncing time across networked devices. Instead, it uses time servers in conjunction with a method called hardware timestamping on client devices. Hardware timestamping involves specialized hardware components, usually embedded in network interface cards (NICs), to track time.\n\nCentral time servers still exist under PTP. But rather than having software on servers connect to the time servers, hardware devices optimized for the task do this work. The devices also include built-in clocks, allowing them to record time data faster than they could if they had to forward it to the generic clock on a server.\n\nThe result is that, in most cases, PTP is much faster and more reliable than NTP. While timing inconsistencies may still occur, they’re usually much smaller under PTP.\n\nComprehensive statistics about the use of PTP are elusive. But some sources suggest that in real-time financial trading, for example, 85% of workloads now rely on PTP. Others predict that the market for PTP solutions will grow by a CAGR of about 8.5% through 2031.\n\nWhile PTP is more powerful and accurate than NTP, it’s also more complex (and, in many cases, more expensive) for data centers to implement. This is mainly because – whereas data center operators can implement an NTP server using just freely available software – PTP requires two key types of hardware components:\n\nNICs with hardware timestamping capabilities. As noted above, these play a key role in enabling PTP-based time measurement.\n\nA centralized, highly accurate clock that can feed time data to the PTP server. This is important because PTP is only accurate if the PTP server’s time readings are also accurate – and to achieve highly precise time readings, it works best to deploy a local time-keeping device, such as an atomic clock, directly within a data center. It’s also possible to retrieve time from remote time servers, but doing so usually introduces microsecond-level networking delays – and if your time readings are a few microseconds out of sync, you’ve defeated the whole purpose of using PTP in the first place.\n\nOn top of this, small inefficiencies in internal data center networking, such as congestion or packet loss issues that delay PTP time polling, can also make PTP inaccurate. Thus, to use PTP effectively, data center operators must optimize their networks and deploy the necessary hardware components.\n\nNone of this is easy. But again, it’s increasingly necessary for data centers aiming to redefine the meaning of “real time” and support workloads that just can’t tolerate the syncing delays of a network timing protocol designed forty years ago.\n\nAs workloads demand ever-greater precision, PTP is becoming the new standard for data center time synchronization. While its implementation is complex and costly, the benefits of microsecond-level accuracy far outweigh the challenges for data centers supporting real-time applications.\n\nChristopher Tozzi is a technology analyst with subject matter expertise in cloud computing, application development, open source software, virtualization, containers and more.

Russia says the killings amount to acts of state terrorism.\n\nUzbek national Akhmadzhon Kurbonov and three accomplices were found ‍guilty of various crimes related to the Kirillov killing, including terrorism and the illegal trafficking of explosives, Russian investigators said on Wednesday.\n\nThe three accomplices were given jail sentences in maximum security correctional prison ​camps ranging from 18 to 25 years, the Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, ‌said in a statement.\n\nKurbonov, who is now due to spend the rest of his life in a special regime correctional prison camp, pleaded guilty to the charges, while the others did not, Russian media reported. Reuters was not able to contact lawyers for the men.\n\nThe Investigative Committee said Kirillov's murder had been planned in Ukraine.\n\nThe perpetrators had smuggled the ⁠explosives into Russia from Poland, and one of ​the four men, Robert Safaryan, had stored the components ​at his home in Russia, it said.\n\nKurbonov had then assembled the bomb, planted it and remotely detonated it as Kirillov and Polikarpov stepped out of ‍the building.\n\nA string of ⁠senior Russian military figures have been killed since the start of the war in Ukraine nearly four years ago.\n\nThe latest was Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, head ⁠of the Russian General Staff's army operational training directorate, who died after a bomb planted under his car ‌went off last month.\n\nUkraine has not claimed responsibility for Sarvarov's death.",

    "fullText": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Canadian beef will be exported to China following the relaxation of an import ban that had been in ​place since 2021, the agriculture minister said, though analysts cautioned it will likely ‌be in small amounts.\n\nThe reopening of what could be a vital market for Canadian beef follows the visit ‌of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who reached an agreement with China's leadership to lower tariffs and do more business on a number of agricultural commodities, including canola.\n\n\"We know that there's a large company that's shipping its first load of beef to China next week,\" said Canadian ⁠Agriculture Minister Heath MacDonald on ‌Tuesday. Earlier on social media he said \"China has lifted market access for Canadian beef.\"\n\nChina's customs agency did not immediately respond to a request ‍for comment.\n\nThe move is not expected to have an immediate major impact on Canadian beef exports or prices because North America has a shortage of domestic beef and prices are historically high.\n\nSylvain Charlebois, a ​food market expert known as The Food Professor, said: \"China reopening or expanding access for ‌Canadian beef won't move food prices in Canada in any meaningful way.\n\n\"The volumes involved are relatively small, and Canada simply doesn't have the scale to divert large amounts of beef away from the domestic market without disrupting other exports first.\"\n\nHowever, China is an important market for certain cuts of beef, so the reopening is important for Canadian farmers and ⁠beef exporters.\n\nBeef market analyst Jerry Klassen said: \"It's very important ​for Canadian beef farmers to have access to as ​many markets as possible. The Chinese market is very important because it has potential for significant growth.\"\n\nKlassen and the Canadian Cattle Association said the ‍details on the reopening ⁠were not yet available, so the full implications would only be understood once they were. However the association celebrated the resumption of trade.\n\nChina was Canada's fourth largest ⁠beef market in 2021, before being suspended in December of that year.\n\nChina can be a vital export market ‌for Canada when North America has a beef surplus and domestic prices ‌are low.",

    "fullText": "A tense scene unfolded in Willowbrook after a federal agent opened fire during an immigration operation on Wednesday morning, prompting a large response from local and federal authorities.\n\nA federal agent opened fire while conducting an operation in the parking lot of an apartment building near the intersection of 126th Street and Mona Boulevard. No one was hit, but it triggered a large response from authorities as crowds of people gathered amid the chaos.\n\nShortly after 7 a.m., U.S. Border Patrol informed the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department that the agency was conducting an operation in the area, according to LASD. The shooting occurred shortly afterward.\n\nIn a statement provided to ABC7, the Department of Homeland Security said the targeted operation began in nearby Compton, \"to arrest a violent criminal illegal alien from El Salvador, William Eduardo Moran Carballo, who is involved in a human smuggling operation and has two prior arrests for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.\"\n\nAn immigration judge issued Carballo a final order of removal in 2019, according to DHS.\n\nDHS says Carballo tried to evade arrest around 7 a.m. on Wednesday and rammed his vehicle into law enforcement. That's when one of the agents fired at Carballo, missing him, and he was taken into custody.\n\n\"In a dangerous attempt to evade arrest, this criminal illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement,\" the Homeland Security statement read. \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots. The criminal illegal alien was not hit and attempted to flee on foot. He was successfully apprehended by law enforcement. The illegal alien was not injured, but a CBP officer was injured.\"\n\nFurther details on the officer's injury were not provided.\n\nVideo provided to Eyewitness News by a neighbor shows the man leaving the apartment building, getting into his car and driving away. Seconds later, neighbors say Border Patrol tried to take him into custody, and that's when the shooting occurred.\n\nAlong with several federal agents in tactical gear, sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers responded to the scene.\n\n\"This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming,\" DHS said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI told ABC7 that the agency was not a part of the operation and said that an evidence response team was being sent to the scene.\n\nA large group of residents and activists gathered near the scene late Wednesday morning as more agents arrived, denouncing their presence.\n\nIncredibly tense situation in #compton right now. Residents and activists are confronting agents performing immigration enforcement @ABC7 pic.twitter.com/s1C0JXGwWz\n\n— Josh Haskell (@abc7JoshHaskell) January 21, 2026\n\nSome were seen holding Mexican flags and filming videos on their phone. At one point, the group was yelling at members of the sheriff's department.\n\n\"I saw the car crash... it was just crazy,\" said one resident who lives in the area. \"It's just crazy how they're coming over here and interrupting everybody's livelihood and their lives... this is just their lives.\"\n\nSome of the people who showed up are TikTokers who said they're working to be a voice for those who may be afraid.\n\n\"The federal ones... they like to come and go,\" said Angie Vargas, a local TikToker and live streamer. \"They like to move quick, so the fact that they're here and this incident happened, I think honestly, they came to the wrong city. A lot of us are out against what's going on, but yes, they are around our city, and I think there's a lot of us out here... supporting the community, being an extra set of eyes for them. That's why we're here. We're filming. We're bringing everything... the truth of what's going on, because there's a lot of people that are scared to come out and see what's going on.\"\n\n\"People are not going to work. They're causing disruptions. It's heartbreaking. It hurts. Why are you all here?\" said neighbor Andre Smith. \"I heard this is border patrol. If this is border patrol, ya'll need to go and patrol the border.\"\n\n\"It brings a lot of chaos to the kids, to people that have no citizenship. They're just here to work. That's why we're here to support our people,\" said Eric, whose family lives nearby. \"They've been taking people with citizenships just because of the color of our skin. We're tired of it already. We need them out of here.\"\n\nThere were some tense moments between the federal agents and protesters, but it appears no less-than-lethal rounds were fired and no protesters were arrested.",

    "fullText": "NASA astronaut Suni Williams, who famously stayed in space for an extended nine-month visit because of problems with an experimental capsule, has retired after 27 years, NASA said Tuesday.\n\nWilliams retired effective Dec. 27, NASA said in a statement. Williams, a former Navy pilot, joined NASA in 1988.\n\n\"Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in the statement.\n\nWilliams went on three missions to the International Space Station, the first of which was in 2006 and in which she was carried aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA said.\n\nBut it was the most recent, in 2024, in which the planned one-week stay stretched from June until March 2025 because of concerns over Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, which was on a test mission.\n\nStarliner launched June 5, 2024, taking Williams and Butch Wilmore to the space station on its first crewed flight. But there were problems with the capsule's thrusters during the docking process, and eventually, in September, NASA decided to return the capsule with no one on board.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore spent 286 days aboard the International Space Station.\n\nA SpaceX Dragon capsule was then sent up to bring the pair, as well as two other astronauts who were wrapping up a six-month mission, back to Earth. The Dragon capsule left the space station on March 18 and splashed down in the ocean off Florida.\n\nOver her career, Williams logged 608 days in space, which is the second-longest cumulative time in space in NASA history, the space agency said.\n\nShe also logged the most spacewalk time of any female astronaut, at 62 hours and 6 minutes, which is the fourth-most time of any NASA astronaut, it said.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have said they enjoyed their extended time living and working at the orbiting outpost, even though it was longer than expected.\n\n\"The plan went way off for what we had planned, but because we’re in human spaceflight, we prepare for any number of contingencies,” Wilmore said in late March, after they returned to Earth. “This is a curvy road. You never know where it’s going to go.”\n\nWilliams said her recovery on Earth after the longer-than-intended space stay was helped by her previous space flights.\n\n“Though it was longer than any flight either one of us have flown before, I think my body remembered,” she told NBC News in an interview alongside Wil\n\nWilliams called her career and the opportunities to serve at NASA an \"incredible honor.\"\n\n\"Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,\" she said in NASA's statement.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "Cruise passengers sailing to ports in Mexico should take note of a strict new law that just went into effect in the country.",
    "fullText": "Packing for a cruise comes with a lot of considerations — from what you’ll need on board the ship and in ports of call to what you shouldn’t bring for lack of space in your compact cabin or due to cruise line rules.\n\nCruise lines prohibit an array of items on their ships to ensure safe sailings, but those aren’t the only items that could get you into trouble for bringing on a cruise. The destinations you visit on a cruise also have their own sets of rules that cruise passengers need to keep in mind. Laws can change at any time, so it’s important to always double check travel guidance for your ports of call before a cruise, even if you’ve visited the destinations in the past.\n\nPassengers who are visiting cruise ports in Mexico, including Cozumel, Costa Maya, and Cabo San Lucas, on 2026 cruises are being warned about a strict new law that just went into effect in the country that applies to something many cruisers may have in their bags when coming ashore in ports of call.\n\nDoug Parker shared more details on the new ban in Mexico that cruise travelers visiting the country need to know about, and more cruise news, on the Jan. 21 edition of Cruise News Today.\n\nWant the latest cruise news and deals? \n\nCruise News Today with Doug Parker.\n\nGood morning, here's your cruise news for Wednesday, January 21st.\n\nA cruise passenger is missing after jumping overboard from a ship in the South Pacific. A 66-year-old American man jumped off of Star Breeze, operated by Windstar Cruises, early Sunday while the ship was sailing in French Polynesia.\n\nLocal reports say the incident followed an argument with his wife. The ship conducted an immediate search, joined later by French Navy patrol boats. The man has not been located, and the investigation is ongoing. The ship has since continued its itinerary.\n\nThis is the second man overboard of 2026.\n\nAnd cruise passengers heading to Mexico are being warned: leave your vapes on the ship.\n\nAs of January 17th, Mexico has banned the import, sale, and marketing of vapes and e-cigarettes. That means bringing a vape ashore during a port stop, even for personal use, could be considered illegal importation. Penalties include confiscation, fines up to $12,500, or even jail.\n\nCruise lines say vapes are still allowed on board in designated areas, but not ashore in Mexican ports. It should be noted that this is for all cruise ports in Mexico, not just Cozumel.\n\nAnd a follow-up to that story we brought you Monday, where opposition is growing against a proposed cruise port near the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay.\n\nNow, a Change.org petition started just four days ago has already collected more than 6,300 signatures. Local residents and environmental advocates say the development threatens fragile marine ecosystems and could overwhelm area infrastructure.\n\nThe 328-acre site near Rattlesnake Key is still very much in the planning stages. If approved, it would take three to five years to complete.\n\nAnd cruise stocks were down on Tuesday. Carnival Corporation: down 3.1%, 28.02, Royal Caribbean: down 2%, 270.01, Norwegian: down 7.5%, 20.37, and Viking: down 1.6%, 68.35.\n\nIf you have a lead on a story, let us know: tips@cruiseradio.net.\n\nI'm Doug Parker with Cruise News Today. Have yourself a great Wednesday.\n\n(The Arena Group will earn a commission if you book a cruise.)\n\nMake a free appointment with Come Cruise With Me’s Travel Agent Partner, Postcard Travel, or email Amy Post at amypost@postcardtravelplanning.com or call or text her at 386-383-2472.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during the medical crisis.\n\nDuring their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.\n\nNASA’s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.”\n\nIt was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. “It really helped,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"\n\nThe space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.\n\n“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”\n\nJoining them on what turned out to be a 5 1/2-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched last August from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off the San Diego coast last week.\n\nWelcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who aren't due to launch until mid-February. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.\n\n“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Shortly after his arrest in early October, Little Village construction worker Juan Espinoza Martinez was led by three federal agents into a windowless interview room, still dressed in a green work T-shirt and carrying a small bottle of water.\n\n“You’re probably a little confused about what’s going on today, so I’m gonna try to explain it all to you,” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Christopher Perugini told Espinoza Martinez at the outset of the Oct. 6 videotaped interview, which was played for a federal jury Wednesday. “Feel free to ask me any questions you want.”\n\nThen, the agents laid it on Espinoza Martinez, a 37-year-old father of three, why he was there.\n\n“Murder for hire?” Espinoza responded, holding up his hands questioningly.\n\n“Correct, so that’s what the charge you’re charged with,” Perugini said. “I’ll explain it to you as we’re going.”\n\nThe agents then confronted Espinoza Martinez with text messages he’d sent an acquaintance that included a photo of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who was then the face of Operation Midway Blitz, along with what agents characterized as cash bounties for Bovino’s kidnapping and murder.\n\nOver the course of the interview, the agents pressed Espinoza Martinez repeatedly on how he thought the messages looked. He said over and over he meant nothing by it, that they were nothing more than social media chatter, and that he had no intention of making any actual offer for Bovino’s killing.\n\n“I’m really confused about this,” Espinoza said at one point in the interview. “I have no gang affiliation…I’m not nowhere around there. I work for a living every day. I’m a union worker. I work concrete, so I don’t know.”\n\nPortions of the videotaped interview were played for jurors in court Wednesday as the trial of Espinoza Martinez got underway before U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who has lived in Chicago for years but is not a U.S. citizen, is charged in an indictment with a single count of solicitation of murder for hire, which carries up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Espinoza Martinez told an acquaintance from the construction business, Adrian Jimenez, after an immigration agent shot a woman in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood on Oct. 4 “that he had dispatched members of the Latin Kings” to the area of 39th Street and Kedzie Avenue in response to the shooting.\n\nJimenez, who had worked as a government informant on and off for years, called up Homeland Security and shared the Snapchat messages that Espinoza Martinez had sent him saying, “2k on information when you get him” and “10k if u take him down,” along with Bovino’s photo, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney Minje Shin said the case was not about someone charged with “expressing strong, even angry, views about immigration enforcement policy” or a hatred of Bovino.\n\n“Make no mistake – the evidence in this case will show that what the defendant did was not a joke, not just mouthing off, not just him blowing off steam behind a keyboard, not political discourse … what the defendant did was a solicitation of murder,” Shin said.\n\nShin said Espinoza Martinez was “fixated” on Bovino, who was “the face of the threat” to arrest, detain, and deport members of his community in Little Village, a threat that “hit close to home.”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s attorney, Jonathan Bedi, told the jurors in his opening remarks that the case was “riddled” with reasonable doubt because “the government cannot point to anything that shows Juan’s intent.”\n\n“When you cut through all of their words…all they have is their guesses and speculation,” Bedi said. “They are guessing.”\n\nBedi says there were no bags of money, no follow up, no recordings, no discussion of any plans. No location scouting, no escape route, no surveillance, no communication saying “Bovino’s here now would be a good time to act.”\n\n“Repeating neighborhood gossip is not a federal crime,” he said.\n\nBefore the Espinoza Martinez’s taped interview was played, jurors heard testimony from the informant, Jimenez, who walked slowly into court with a pronounced limp from a back issue he’s been suffering.\n\nDressed in a blue suit, with a salt-and-pepper beard, Jimenez said he’s been in construction for decades and recently started his own construction business. He also was convicted in 2000 of a felony and spent several years in prison.\n\nThough the jury did not hear details of that case, court records show Jimenez’s conviction was for an armed robbery and home invasion in Franklin Park that was charged in 2000. He was later sentenced to six years behind bars.\n\nJimenez told the jury he’s known Espinoza Martinez for “less than a year.” The defendant first reached out to him on Snapchat, looking for construction work, he said.\n\nJimenez testified he took photos of the Snapchat messages received from Espinoza Martinez on Oct. 2 and “almost immediately” contacted agents with HSI about them.\n\nJimenez testifies he had conversations about immigration with Espinoza Martinez “more than a few times.”\n\nBut when Shin attempted to ask what they talked about specifically, the defense repeatedly objected and the judge sustained it.\n\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Dena Singer asked Jimenez a series of questions: You have a family, right? You work? You want to continue working and you want to continue staying in the U.S.? And you take care of your kids?\n\nJimenez answered “Yes” to all of them.\n\n“And you’re not somebody who commits murder-for-hire, right?” Singer asked,\n\nSinger also got Jimenez to acknowledge that Espinoza Martinez never asked him to take any action against Bovino or share the message with any wider audience.\n\nDid he ever say “Here’s where Bovino is going to be next?” Singer asked.\n\n“Did he ever say “Here’s a picture of cash,” or “I have someone who can pay you all this cash?'”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s trial is the first criminal case to stem from Operation Midway Blitz to go to trial.\n\nThough limited in scope, the case is expected to offer an important litmus test as immigration-enforcement operations continue to roil Chicago and other Democrat-led cities long targeted by President Donald Trump, including Minneapolis, where the killing of a U.S. citizen by an immigration agent earlier this month has sparked nationwide protests.\n\nThe case was held up by top Department of Homeland Security officials as an example of the violence and threats immigration agents were facing from gang members and even international drug cartels.\n\nIn the months since, however, evidence of Espinoza Martinez’s supposed gang affiliations has not materialized. Prosecutors vastly toned down that aspect of the case, first dropping mention of gang affiliation in the indictment handed up by a grand jury, then saying in a pretrial hearing they only intended to prove Espinoza Martinez had an “affinity” for the Latin Kings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the defense objected to prosecutors introducing a text string where Espinoza Martinez told an unidentified contact: “It’s going down bro my guys are ready in the vill (Little Village). Saints sd and 2Six being bitches. Kings on they ass n they scared.”\n\nProsecutors argued the conversation showed Espinoza Martinez was disappointed other gangs weren’t fighting back.\n\nBut Lefkow sided partially with the defense, saying the comments on Little Village can be shown to the jury, but not the references to the Latin Saints or Two-Six gangs.\n\nShe also excluded later text by Espinoza Martinez about “Chapo” having the Latin Kings’ back — a reference to former Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.",

    "fullText": "The hairstylist for the film \"The Cleaning Lady\" has clarified her comments about executive producer Timothy Busfield.\n\nShe said she was unaware her conversation with a detective was recorded and stressed she aimed to speak truthfully about her observations.\n\nTimothy Busfield, 68, who faces charges of sexual abuse involving a child actor and his twin, has denied all the allegations.\n\nDanielle Vigil, the hairstylist for \"The Cleaning Lady,\" is clarifying statements she made regarding Timothy Busfield following his arrest on child sexual abuse charges.\n\nVigil stated her previous comments, in which she said she saw Busfield kiss two kids on their foreheads in a trailer on set, were \"misconstrued\" and emphasized that she never intended to accuse anyone or speculate about the case.\n\nIn a statement to Us Weekly, Vigil explained that she had been contacted by a detective about a child-related investigation, which caused her \"significant emotional distress\" due to her personal history, as her daughter was tragically murdered several years ago.\n\nVigil said she initially felt \"caught off guard and fearful\" that the investigation might involve her own children or grandchildren.\n\n\"During the call, I expressed discomfort with continuing the conversation,\" she wrote. \"However, due to my lived experience with my daughter's unsolved murder, and my belief that silence and lack of cooperation can sometimes prevent justice, I ultimately chose to answer questions about what I had personally observed.\"\n\nShe emphasized that her aim was \"never to speculate, accuse, or harm anyone, but to speak truthfully about my own perceptions as requested.\"\n\nVigil noted that she was unaware the call was being recorded, saying, \"Had I been aware that my words were being recorded or that the detective would use the conversation to fit his narrative, I would have chosen my language more carefully and ensured that my statements were fully contextualized.\"\n\nShe added that she did not anticipate her comments would be used as part of official testimony against Busfield.\n\nExpressing frustration over how her statements were reported, Vigil said portions of her conversation were \"selectively presented in a manner that does not reflect the full context\" and misrepresented her intentions.\n\nVigil described submitting her clarification in the \"interest of accuracy, fairness, and transparency,\" insisting her goal has always been to tell the truth responsibly.\n\n\"This statement is not intended to interfere with any investigation,\" she added about her remarks being used in the Busfield case. \"It is solely meant to clarify my position, my intentions, and the circumstances under which my statements were made.\"\n\nThe hairstylist then noted, \"I have always believed in telling the truth and acting in good faith, especially when the safety of children is involved. I also believe that truth must be handled responsibly and in full context.\"\n\nBusfield, 68, faces charges including two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and child abuse.\n\nAccording to reports, the allegations involve inappropriate behavior toward a child actor and his twin on the set of Fox's \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which Busfield directed several episodes of.\n\nBusfield has denied the allegations, maintaining he had no physical contact with the children. After turning himself in, he spoke to TMZ, asserting, \"I'm going to confront these lies. They're horrible. They're all lies, and I did not do anything to those little boys. I'm going to fight it. I'm going to fight it with a great team, and I'm going to be exonerated. I know I am because this is all so wrong and all lies.\"\n\nDuring a hearing on January 21, Busfield was released ahead of trial. The judge ordered him to maintain communication with his attorney, refrain from possessing firearms, and avoid contact with the alleged victims. His next court date has not been scheduled yet.\n\nProsecutors had requested that Busfield remain in custody until his trial, describing him as \"an ongoing and serious danger to children and the community.\"\n\nIn a pretrial filing, the Bernalillo County District Attorney's office referenced what they characterized as a pattern of \"sexual misconduct, abuse of authority, and grooming behavior\" to justify his continued detention.\n\nIn response, Busfield's legal team argued in a 237-page court document that the boys' mother, whose children were replaced during filming, was seeking revenge against the director.\n\nThey also noted that Busfield had successfully completed an independently administered polygraph test and that a professional psychosexual evaluation determined he \"does not appear to have a sexual attraction to prepubescent or adolescent males or females.\"\n\nThe defense also submitted numerous character reference letters to the court from friends and family members, including his wife, actress Melissa Gilbert, who had not previously commented publicly on the allegations against Busfield.",

    "fullText": "If people don't go to the office, then all of the infrastructure built to support workers stops being viable.\n\nRemote and hybrid work are reshaping downtown economies, and restaurants are among the businesses feeling the impact most acutely.\n\n\"As remote or hybrid work continues to be popular, office attendance has fallen. Less in-person work may increase office vacancy rates and reduce foot traffic to other businesses located in office-dense areas,\" according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThat shift played out firsthand near my former office, where a Starbucks in the attached hotel closed after the pandemic.\n\nFor businesses, it's death by a thousand paper cuts. It's not the loss of any one customer, but thousands of them visiting less often.\n\nRestaurants, coffee shops, and bars have felt the pinch from hybrid work situations.\n\n“Even though you may be busy on Wednesday and Thursday, your Mondays and Fridays may be very slow,” Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance told CNBC. “If someone was to walk by a restaurant around lunch or dinner time on a Thursday, they may say, ‘Wow, that restaurant’s packed, they’re so busy,’ but it’s not like that every single day.”\n\n\"In cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta, the three-day in-person work week has posed challenges for hospitality businesses. With fewer workers in offices on Mondays and Fridays — which for some businesses were their strongest sales days — many businesses have been forced to shift work schedules or launch initiatives to pull in customers at the start and end of the week,\" CNBC reported.\n\nThis change in consumer behavior has forced an iconic Boston marketplace to close its doors forever.\n\nFood halls have been a growing trend in tourist areas, driven by the Covid shutdown of buffets. In Las Vegas, where there used to be buffets in nearly every hotel on the Strip, only a handful remain, and more food halls have opened.\n\nA modern take on the mall food court, food halls offer multiple restaurants under the same roof. Some even offer ordering via QR code, making it easy to have a meal where dishes come from multiple restaurants.\n\nThis concept has also been adopted in cities as a way to serve workers, and one of the best-known food halls, Time Out Market, located near Fenway Park, has decided to close its doors.\n\n\"Following the pandemic, we have seen the Boston Market recover and grow, and we have focused on initiatives driving further growth; however, footfall until today remains inconsistent in the area due to ongoing hybrid working and in addition, operating costs have increased — all of which prevents consistent profitability,\" Time Out Market CEO Michael Marlay said in a statement.",

    "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says ‘a lot’ of six-figure jobs in plumbing and construction are about to be unlocked because someone needs to build all these new AI centers",
    "description": "The AI boom is threatening white-collar entry jobs—but it’s creating a booming six-figure opportunity for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers.",
    "fullText": "The job market has been a tough sell for many Gen Z graduates, with tariffs, economic uncertainty, and artificial intelligence reshaping hiring plans across corporate America. But according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, the next wave of six-figure opportunities won’t be found in a Wall Street cubicle or Silicon Valley Slack channel. Instead, high-paying careers will partially come by picking up a wrench—literally.\n\nAs tech giants race to build sprawling data centers—totaling $7 trillion in global capital outlays by the end of the decade—Huang believes the world is on the cusp of what he calls the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” which will create “a lot of jobs.”\n\n“It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe hands-on skills needed to construct what he described as chip, computer, and AI factories are already facing shortages—even though many roles pay over $100,000 without requiring a college degree. One McKinsey report estimated that between 2023 and 2030, there will be a need for an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—in the U.S. alone.\n\n“Everybody should be able to make a great living,” Huang said. “You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Huang has expressed his optimistic outlook on new career paths emerging alongside AI.\n\n“The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom,” he told Channel 4 News in the U.K. last year. “You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.”\n\nThat optimism stands in contrast to warnings from leaders like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has repeatedly cautioned that AI is hollowing out traditional white-collar entry points—just as the education system continues to funnel students toward four-year degrees.\n\n“There’s more than one way to the American Dream, but our whole education system is focused on four-year [college] education,” Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year. “Hiring an entry worker at a tech company has fallen 50% since 2019. Is that really where we want all of our kids to go? Artificial intelligence is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”",

    "description": "Craft Ventures, the firm Sacks cofounded, previously announced that he had moved to the Austin area.",
    "fullText": "AI czar David Sacks said California is taking a potentially \"scary direction\" if voters approve a wealth tax on billionaires.\n\n\"This is not a tax, this is an asset seizure,\" Sacks told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nSacks, a longtime venture capitalist, is just one of the many voices in the tech industry who have denounced \"The Billionaire Act.\"\n\nCraft Ventures, the firm Sacks cofounded with Bill Lee, previously announced that Sacks had relocated to the Austin area in December. According to Bloomberg, Sacks is a billionaire and thus could have been subject to the tax.\n\nWhile the proposal is limited, Sacks said it would just be the beginning.\n\n\"It's not a one-time. It's a first time,\" he said. \"And if they get away with it, there'll be a second time and a third time. And this will be the beginning of something very new and different in this country.\"\n\nIf passed, California residents with a net worth of over $1.1 billion would face a one-time tax totalling 5% of their assets. (Residents with a net worth between $1 billion and $1.1 billion would pay a smaller tax.)\n\nGoogle cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved entities tied to them out of California ahead of the deadline. Other billionaires, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have said they won't leave the state.\n\nThe tax has yet to be approved. Supporters are still gathering enough signatures to put the issue before California voters this November. If they meet that threshold, a majority of voters would then need to support it. It's likely legal challenges would ensue as well.\n\nSacks said Gov. Gavin Newsom deserves blame for the current situation for not opposing the tax sooner and \"vocally\" enough.\n\nTara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, pointed to the governor's history of questioning earlier wealth tax proposals going back to 2020.\n\n\"Clearly, David Sacks didn't know what he was talking about,\" she said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn recent weeks, Newsom has continued to step up his opposition to such a tax.\n\n\"I'll do what I have to do to protect the state,\" Newsom told The New York Times in an interview earlier this month.\n\nIn a separate interview, Newsom said the news that billionaires like Brin and Page were leaving the state was exactly the response he had feared. California is home to more billionaires than any other state.\n\n\"This is my fear. It's just what I warned against,\" Newsom told Politico. \"It's happening.\"",

    "title": "Brooklyn Beckham confirmed his family feud. PR experts are wincing — and say David and Victoria should stay silent.",
    "description": "Brooklyn Beckham recently confirmed long-standing rumors of a family feud. PR experts say David and Victoria Beckham should proceed with restraint.",
    "fullText": "If you're a publicist watching Brooklyn Peltz Beckham this week, you're probably wincing.\n\nOn Monday evening, the eldest in the Beckham brood confirmed long-standing rumors of a rift between himself and his parents, A-list power couple David and Victoria Beckham — although, through Brooklyn's lens, the rift appears closer to an impassable canyon.\n\n\"I do not want to reconcile with my family,\" Brooklyn wrote in a six-part Instagram Story. \"I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.\"\n\nWhile certainly juicy, Brooklyn's scathing accusations struck PR experts as less than shrewd.\n\n\"He didn't just light a match. He brought a flamethrower to the bridges,\" Mike Fahey, the founder and CEO of the PR agency Fahey Communications, told Business Insider.\n\nBrooklyn went on to accuse his parents of \"trying endlessly to ruin\" his relationship with his wife, Nicola Peltz Beckham, and soiling their 2022 wedding with \"anxiety and embarrassment.\" He also said his parents have planted unflattering stories in the tabloids about the couple, presumably referring to the frequent reports that painted Nicola as a controlling and all-consuming influence in Brooklyn's life.\n\n\"My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first,\" Brooklyn wrote.\n\nHe concluded the series of posts with an appeal that, given the extremity of his method, could be read as counterproductive: \"My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation.\"\n\nBrooklyn, Nicola, David, and Victoria did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. So far, no party has directly addressed Brooklyn's posts publicly.\n\nBrooklyn's statement immediately ignited a firestorm on social media, and an eruption of headlines followed suit. \"Brooklyn goes nuclear\" became a popular phrase, while some British tabloids framed the statement as an \"outburst\" or \"temper tantrum.\"\n\n\"It is wild to see that something that started as Deuxmoi posts and whispers on gossip sites has now gone so mainstream, and it's everywhere,\" Fahey said. \"Him doing this six-page Instagram Story takes this from speculation to, literally, a royal-family-style fracture — front-page news everywhere.\"\n\nIndeed, rumors of a Beckham family feud — Brooklyn and Nicola on one side, David and Victoria on the other — have been just that for years. Fans began to wonder if something was amiss when Nicola wore a Valentino wedding gown instead of a design by her fashionable mother-in-law, though Nicola repeatedly denied it was a snub. Still, tabloids ran wild with reports of unspecified \"tensions,\" sweeping accusations of narcissism, and unrealistic \"demands\" from one camp or the other, reaching a fever pitch when Brooklyn and Nicola were absent from his father's 50th birthday celebrations last year.\n\nNow, Brooklyn's communication strategy has shifted firmly away from off-the-record comments and anonymous sources who are \"familiar with the situation.\" In doing so, he's removed any option for plausible deniability. No longer can he or anyone in his orbit simply shrug off questions about their familial drama.\n\n\"This is obviously a drastic change,\" Fahey said. \"This isn't even a 180. It's like a 1,080.\"\n\nBrooklyn's bombshell comments contrast sharply with the Beckham family brand of elegant, unified self-promotion, which was honed over many years of public appearances, marketing campaigns, and, most recently, his-and-hers Netflix documentaries for David and Victoria.\n\n\"If this was vetted by a publicist, it wasn't a very good one, because the level of detail and the way it is written are not PR-savvy whatsoever,\" Fahey said of Brooklyn's statement. \"It comes across as unpolished. It is airing the family laundry.\"\n\nTara Goodwin, a crisis communications expert and author of \"Manage the Message, Change the Outcome: An Executive's Guide to Crisis Management,\" echoed Fahey's analysis, describing Brooklyn's approach as \"more emotional than strategic.\"\n\n\"He has the power to push the agenda and create a spectacle, and that's what he's trying to do,\" Goodwin said. \"What I would say to him if he were my client is, 'Take a breath.' Restraint gives you more choices, because once it's in the public domain, you think you're controlling the narrative, but you actually lose control of it.\"\n\nIf Brooklyn gave a crisis PR crash course in what not to do, his parents are more likely to take the safer route: silence.\n\nThe day after his son's complaints went live, David appeared on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" yet he smartly avoided mentioning Brooklyn by name. Instead, he advised general caution with social media, especially for kids.\n\n\"They make mistakes, but children are allowed to make mistakes. That is how they learn,\" David said. \"That is what I try to teach my kids. You sometimes have to let them make those mistakes as well.\"\n\nFahey described this comment as a masterclass in celebrity image management: \"That is a brilliant way of sending a message without saying anything of substance,\" he said.\n\nNot only would a direct public response to Brooklyn clash spectacularly with the established Beckham brand, but David and Victoria are famous and beloved enough that there's very little risk in staying mum.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to hurt the Beckham brand at this juncture,\" Goodwin said. \"If this is protracted and goes on, and he has more to say, there could be some reverberations, but at the moment, I think most people are going to see this for what it is. I​​t's a difficult family moment that probably should have remained private.\"\n\nMoreover, being the parents in this situation, meeting Brooklyn's energy would likely be perceived as petty or punching down. Even though Brooklyn is 26, he's still their son, and they stand accused of disrespecting his boundaries. Now that he's loudly and explicitly asking for space, David and Victoria would be wise to heed his wishes.\n\n\"If I'm their publicist, I'm like, 'Let's let this die down. Let's try to do something behind closed doors. Let's try to mend fences privately,'\" Fahey said. \"Having this play out in the court of public opinion is not going to benefit anyone.\"\n\nIf the goal here is neither fame (according to Brooklyn) nor money (Nicola is a billionaire heiress, and the Beckhams' net worth is nothing to scoff at, either), the only benefit left is narrative control. However, with a narrative as intimate and messy as this one, both Fahey and Goodwin agreed that it's not worth braving the internet's brutal jury.\n\n\"Maybe you air that out with your therapists and not millions of people online,\" Fahey said.",

    "fullText": "Bumble's chief product officer is out as the result of a recent leadership restructuring within the dating app company, Business Insider confirmed.\n\nMichael Affronti, Bumble's chief product officer and one of two executives who remained after Whitney Wolfe Herd was reinstated as CEO, has left the company after a year in the role.\n\nIn an end-of-year message to staff obtained by Business Insider, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd shared that she and Affronti, who was hired in January 2025, had \"mutually agreed that the best path forward for the company is to centralize Product, Engineering, and Design under one leader.\"\n\nVivek Sagi, previously the company's chief technology officer, now holds the new title of chief product and technology officer. A source familiar with the matter said that much of Bumble's engineering talent is based in Austin, where Sagi is based.\n\n\"I know this news will land differently across the organization,\" Herd wrote in the December note. \"Michael has been a strong leadership presence across Bumble, and I want to thank you all in advance for supporting one another as we move through this transition.\"\n\nAffronti was one of two remaining executives who worked under Lidiane Jones, who served as Bumble's CEO from January 2024 to March 2025. After Herd, who founded Bumble, announced her return as CEO in 2025, a string of executives left, including the company's CMO, CTO, CLO, and CBO.\n\nDavid Ard, Bumble's chief people officer, is the only C-suiter left at Bumble who was hired before March 2025, when Herd officially took over.\n\nIn her message to staff, Herd described a \"year of meaningful transformation for our company.\"\n\n\"Over the past several weeks, and in close partnership with our Board, we've taken a hard, honest look at where our business stands and what our members need from us right now,\" Herd wrote. \"What's become clear is that we need to sharpen our focus so we can stabilize our core, prioritize our product investments with intention, and set ourselves up for a confident return to growth.\"\n\nBumble had a rough 2025. The company's stock has fallen 52.35% in the last year.\n\nIn response to Herd's note, Affronti sent his own note to the company's staff.\n\n\"I have a strong, enduring belief in Bumble's mission and in our ability to return to growth and become a truly massive, category-defining business,\" Affronti wrote. \"I feel incredibly positive about the direction we're heading and the clarity we now have to operate in a way that lets our teams do their best work.\"\n\nBefore joining Bumble, Affronti served as a senior vice president and general manager at Salesforce. Jones, Herd's predecessor, came to Bumble from Salesforce as the former CEO of Slack.\n\nBumble announced Affronti's hiring on January 6, 2025. 11 days later, the company announced Jones' exit and Herd's reemergence as CEO.\n\nAffronti will now be \"cheering loudly from the outside,\" he wrote in his message.\n\nRead Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd's full message to staff:\n\nI want to share that, after thoughtful discussion, Michael and I have mutually agreed that the best path forward for the company is to centralize Product, Engineering, and Design under one leader. As a result, Michael will be departing Bumble today. We are incredibly grateful for the impact he has made during his time here and the care he brought to leading his teams, and we wish him the very best in what comes next.\n\nI know this news will land differently across the organization. For many of you who have partnered closely with Michael, it may feel especially significant; for others, it may feel less immediate. Michael has been a strong leadership presence across Bumble, and I want to thank you all in advance for supporting one another as we move through this transition.\n\nVivek will step in to lead Product alongside Engineering and Design.\n\nOver the past several weeks, and in close partnership with our Board, we've taken a hard, honest look at where our business stands and what our members need from us right now. What's become clear is that we need to sharpen our focus so we can stabilize our core, prioritize our product investments with intention, and set ourselves up for a confident return to growth.\n\nBringing these functions under one leader will provide clarity, tighter alignment, and a singular focus on what matters most: moving faster and delivering against our roadmap with more value to our members.\n\nMany of our cross-functional teams already know Vivek well - he has been deeply involved in our strategic and technical direction. Vivek has successfully led combined Product and Engineering teams at scale during his career and led them to deliver impact, giving us a proven model to build from. He brings a results oriented, steady, thoughtful approach that will continue to support our times through this next phase of work.\n\nIn the coming days, Vivek will connect with leaders across Product to ensure a smooth transition and to provide additional clarity when needed.\n\nThis has been a year of meaningful transformation for our company. Through it all, what continues to differentiate us is our talent: your resilience, your ambition, and your commitment to building products that impact our members in the most meaningful way possible. You've chosen to be here for our mission, every day, and I don't take that for granted. That is why we are building an environment where you can do the most impactful work of your career, and your engagement in this next phase is critical to our success.\n\nWe remain anchored in our three hubs - London, New York, and Austin - and now is the moment for focus. The path forward will require discipline, pace, and a shared commitment to outcomes. Let's channel our energy toward delivering for our members, our business, and each other.\n\nYou will hear more from me on our 2026 strategy during our Global All Hands on Wednesday.\n\nThank you for your partnership, your confidence, and the work ahead.\n\nDo you work at Bumble?

She's taking her own lessons as a founder, marketing exec, and investor in startups over to Bullish, a consumer-focused venture capital fund. She's joining the firm as a venture partner, the company exclusively told Business Insider.\n\nBullish has invested in several consumer hits, including Warby Parker, Harry's, Peloton, and Casper, Kaplan's former employer.\n\nBullish invests in early-stage startups, typically from pre-seed to Series A, Kaplan said. The categories she's most interested in span loneliness, dating, parenting, health, and identity and belonging.\n\n\"AI can be a tool to help those problems,\" Kaplan said, but she's acutely aware that not all AI is going to be a hit with real-life people.\n\nWhat does it take to get people to care about your product?\n\nCracking how to \"break through the noise\" helps, Kaplan said.\n\n\"What a consumer cares about is what is in it for them. What do we get out of it?\" Kaplan said. \"Founders are so used to pitching VCs that it's really hard to switch gears and start thinking about: Why should a customer care?\"\n\nWhen it comes to consumer-facing AI startups, brands need to think outside the box.\n\nKaplan said that \"contrarian\" plays can be useful when marketing a startup in a crowded space.\n\nFor instance, while so many tech companies are shouting AI from rooftops, some are strategically letting AI take a back seat.\n\n\"The best brands emerging are using AI, they're not necessarily making their startup fully based in AI,\" Kaplan said.\n\nKaplan pointed to Rocco, a smart fridge brand she angel invested in, as an example.\n\n\"It's a smart fridge, but the brand doesn't lead with 'AI-powered appliance,' it leads with design and functionality,\" Kaplan said. \"The AI makes the product better without becoming its identity, which is how they've managed to generate incredible buzz and traction in one of the most commoditized categories in consumer hardware.\"\n\nMarketing AI has been a tricky battlefield for brands.\n\nLook no further than the Friend AI ads across New York City. The ads promoting the startup's AI companion pendant were defaced by locals.\n\nOther marketing and advertising agencies, such as Day Job, are being tapped by AI companies specifically to help translate their brands to everyday people — in other words, potential customers.\n\nKaplan said startups trying to reach consumers have a unique tool at their disposal: creators.\n\nKaplan said the creator economy \"rewrote who controls distribution\" on social media by shifting who stirs buzz about brands and how people learn about them.\n\n\"Early adopters have really become the creators,\" she said.\n\nWhile startups previously toiled over customer acquisition cost (CAC), Kaplan said the big question now is: \"Who will carry the story out into the world and why will anybody listen?\"\n\n\"Distribution is no longer something you can buy,\" she said. \"You have to earn it.\"",

He said meetings with Swiss businesses, including watchmaker Rolex, influenced the decision.\n\nTrump said, \"all hell really broke out\" after he proposed the tariff rate.\n\n\"I was paid visits by everybody,\" he said. \"Rolex came to see me.\"\n\nTrump said that watch brands like Rolex had contributed to a trade deficit with Switzerland.\n\n\"But I realised, and I reduced it because I don't want to hurt people,\" he said of the tariff rate.\n\nAs it stands, there's a 15% cap on the tariff rate for Swiss imports.\n\nHowever, that rate could change again, Trump said. He said he initially planned a 30% tariff on Switzerland, then raised it to 39%, before lowering it to 15%.\n\n\"We brought it down to a lower level. Doesn't mean it's not going up, but we brought it down to a lower level,\" Trump said.\n\nSome US watch sellers have said higher tariff rates could lead Swiss watchmakers to raise prices, which could affect consumers.\n\nRolex didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nSwiss business leaders met with Trump last year to discuss the tariffs, and Rolex left him with a desk clock modeled after one of its iconic watches, watch publication Hodinkee reported.\n\nTrump had kind words for Swiss watchmakers at Davos.\n\n\"They make beautiful watches, great watches, Rolex, all of them,\" he said.",

    "description": "Taylor Swift slams Justin Baldoni in text messages sent to Blake Lively, court documents reveal.",
    "fullText": "The \"It Ends With Us\" press tour in the summer of 2024 was overshadowed by rumors and speculation of a feud between lead star Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, her costar and director.\n\nBut while the movie survived the backlash and went on to become one of the summer's biggest hits at the box office, grossing $350 million worldwide, the \"It Ends with Us\" drama didn't end there.\n\nIn December 2024, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, setting off a cascade of subsequent lawsuits brought by Lively, Baldoni, and even tangential characters like Baldoni's ex-publicist Stephanie Jones.\n\nIn June 2025, a judge threw out Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit. Baldoni was allowed to file an amended complaint, but in November, the judge formally ended the suit after the deadline for Baldoni to do so had passed.\n\nLively's original lawsuit against Baldoni is still ongoing with a trial set for May 18.\n\nIn January 2026, unsealed court documents revealed texts between Lively and her friend Taylor Swift, in which Swift called Baldoni a \"bitch\" and Lively referred to him as the \"doofus director of my movie.\"\n\nHere's everything we know about their feud and legal battle.\n\nEve Crosbie and Ayomikun Adekaiyero contributed to previous versions of this post.\n\nFans suspected something was amiss when Baldoni and Lively didn't interact during the press tour despite playing partners in the film.\n\nLively did press events with costars Brandon Sklenar and Isabela Ferrer and author Colleen Hoover, who wrote the book the film is based on. Baldoni did most of his press solo.\n\nWhen they both attended the New York premiere on August 6, they were not photographed together. Lively posed with her castmates, Hoover, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and Hugh Jackman, his \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" costar. Baldoni was photographed with his wife and some of the other producers who worked on the film.\n\nWhile speaking to Entertainment Tonight on the carpet at the New York premiere, Baldoni explained why he was stepping back from the limelight.\n\n\"This isn't my night — this is a night for all the women who we made this movie for,\" he said.\" This is a night for Blake, this is a night for Colleen. I'm just so grateful that we're here, five years in the making.\"\n\nOn social media, fans theorized about the potential drama between the two.\n\nThe speculation intensified after a user on the r/ColleenHoover subreddit noted on August 6, 2024 that Lively and Hoover did not follow Baldoni on Instagram. Fans also noticed that the film's other stars, including Sklenar, Ferrer, and Jenny Slate, did not follow Baldoni. Baldoni followed all of them except Hoover.\n\nBusiness Insider could not verify whether they previously followed Baldoni.\n\nAdding to this theory was a clip of Slate seemingly sidestepping a question about Baldoni at the movie's New York premiere. Asked about having Baldoni as both a scene partner and a director, she responded by not mentioning him and instead speaking about how \"intense\" it must be to do both jobs.\n\ni just found out about the whole 'it ends with us' cast drama and omg they asked her what it was like to work with justin and she completely ignored the question 💀 pic.twitter.com/2DdlmvxS4x\n\nMany fans began blaming Lively for the supposed feud, accusing her of trying to take over the film.\n\nThis theory was supported by Baldoni and Lively's interviews in the lead-up to the premiere.\n\nOn August 9, 2024, Baldoni told Today that Lively and Reynolds, who was not a producer on the film, contributed significantly to it.\n\n\"You can't summarize Blake's contribution in a sentence, because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,\" Baldoni said.\n\nBaldoni also said he struggled to balance allowing collaboration and having his voice drowned out entirely.\n\n\"You don't have to listen to everybody, and that didn't happen all the time, but there were just moments where I would get out of the way too much,\" he said.\n\nBaldoni said Lively should take over as director to adapt the sequel to the \"It Ends With Us\" novel, \"It Starts with Us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lively told E! News on August 7, 2024 that Reynolds helped pen the opening scene of \"It Ends With Us.\"\n\nThe film's screenwriter Christy Hal told People a day later that she wasn't aware that Reynolds had written some of the dialogue used in the final version of the script.\n\n\"When I saw a cut, I was like, 'Oh, that's cute. That must have been a cute improvised thing,'\" Hall said. \"So if I'm being told that Ryan wrote that, then great, how wonderful.\"\n\nFans also criticized how Lively promoted the movie, choosing to focus on its lighthearted and romantic elements instead of its heavy domestic abuse plot.\n\nBaldoni was the only cast member who consistently spoke about the domestic abuse element.\n\nAs online sentiment toward Lively turned increasingly negative, journalist Kjersti Flaa released an archival clip of an interview with Blake Lively on August 10, 2024 titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"\n\n\"It actually took me a while to get over the experience,\" Flaa told BI in an email on August 19, 2024 of the interview, which took place years earlier.\n\n\"Every time I entered a room after this I got nervous that something similar might happen again,\" she wrote.\n\nA post shared by Brandon Sklenar (@brandonsklenar)\n\nSklenar, who plays Lively's other love interest in \"It Ends With Us,\" spoke out about the backlash in an Instagram post on August 20, 2024.\n\n\"Colleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves. Vilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strongly in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about,\" he said.\n\n\"This film is meant to inspire. It's meant to validate and recognize,\" Sklenar added. \"It is not meant to once again, make women the 'bad guy,' let's move beyond that together.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Baldoni, Lively, Reynolds, Hoover, and Sklenar did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, inflicting \"emotional distress,\" and conspiring to damage her public reputation.\n\nLively's complaint also named Wayfarer Studios, Baldoni's production company, and Jamey Heath, the company's CEO, as two of the 11 defendants.\n\nIn the complaint, Lively said an all-hands meeting about Baldoni and Heath's behavior on set was held in January 2023. She accused him of showing her nude videos and images of women, improvising kissing scenes or intimate scenes, and entering her trailer while she was naked.\n\nLively said Heath and Baldoni responded by hiring Melissa Nathan, a crisis PR representative, and Jed Wallace, a Texas-based contractor, both defendants in the complaint, to orchestrate a \"multi-tiered\" plan to \"destroy\" her public reputation and stop her or anyone else from speaking out about what happened on set.\n\nShe also said that the cast agreed to a marketing plan created by the film's distributor, Sony Pictures Entertainment, to avoid talking about the sad parts of the movie, which Baldoni broke away from.\n\n\"What the public did not know was that Mr. Baldoni and his team did so to explain why many of the Film's cast and crew had unfollowed Mr. Baldoni on social media and were not appearing with him in public,\" the complaint said.\n\nBryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, told BI in a statement after the complaint was filed: \"It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to 'fix' her negative reputation, which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions.\"\n\nFreedman said Nathan was hired because Lively made multiple demands and threatened not to show up to set or promote the film if they were not met.\n\nWhen asked to respond to Freedman, a representative for Lively referred BI to a statement shared with The New York Times on December 21, 2024: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\"\n\nOn December 24, 2024, publicist Stephanie Jones sued Baldoni, his film studio, Melissa Nathan, and Jennifer Abel, a former employee of Jones' PR company, for breach of contract and defamation.\n\nIn the suit, Jones alleged Baldoni and the PRs orchestrated a smear campaign against Lively while her company was working with Baldoni. Jones said this was done behind her back until August 2024, when Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios stopped working with the company and worked directly with Abel.\n\nA post shared by Amber Tamblyn (@amberrosetamblyn)\n\nLively's costars from 2005's \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" — America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledel — shared a joint statement supporting Lively after she made the complaint.\n\nHoover and Sklenar, who worked on \"It Ends With Us,\" seemed to both throw their support behind Lively by sharing links to her allegations on their Instagram stories.\n\n\"@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient since the day we met,\" Hoover wrote in her story post. \"Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt.\"\n\nHoover has since deleted her Instagram, TikTok and Threads account.\n\nRepresentatives for Hoover did not immediately respond to a comment request from BI.\n\nOn December 21, 2024, The New York Times reported that Ari Emanuel, chief executive of the parent company that owns Baldoni's talent agency, William Morris Endeavor, said the agency had stopped representing him.\n\nOn December 9, 2024, before the complaint was released, Vital Voices, a nonprofit organization that supports women leaders, awarded Baldoni the Voices of Solidarity Award to honor his advocacy work for women.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Vital Voices said in a statement on their website that they had rescinded the award.\n\n\"The communications among Mr. Baldoni and his publicists included in the lawsuit — and the PR effort they indicate — are, alone, contrary to the values of Vital Voices and the spirit of the Award,\" the statement read.\n\nBaldoni, Wayfarer Studios, and others mentioned in a New York Times story that detailed Lively's accusations against Baldoni filed a lawsuit against the newspaper on December 31, 2024.\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by BI, said the Times' story published on December 21, 2024 \"relied almost entirely on Lively's unverified and self-serving narrative\" and accused the publication of \"disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, contained screenshots of messages that it said contradicted the Times' reporting.\n\nIn a statement provided to BI after the lawsuit was filed, a Times spokesperson said the newspaper stood by its reporting and would \"vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\"\n\n\"Our story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article,\" the statement said.\n\nThe outlet also published its full statement responding to the allegations.\n\nIn a statement provided to BI after Baldoni's lawsuit was filed, Freedman, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said Lively had orchestrated a \"vicious smear campaign\" and that the Times \"cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful 'untouchable' Hollywood elites.\"\n\nFreedman also said that they would also sue other individuals \"who have abused their power to try and destroy the lives of my clients.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to BI about Baldoni's suit, Lively's lawyers said: \"Nothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively's California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint.\"\n\nThe same day Baldoni filed his lawsuit against the Times, Lively filed a lawsuit against him, Wayfarer, and others in New York federal court.\n\nRepresentatives for Lively said the lawsuit, which was obtained by BI, was based on the legal complaint Lively previously filed with the California Civil Rights Department. The lawsuit accuses Baldoni and his PR team of engaging in a campaign to retaliate against her for speaking out about sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Ms. Lively's decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks,\" her lawyers said in a statement provided to BI. \"As alleged in Ms. Lively's federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Baldoni and Wayfarer did not address the lawsuit filed by Lively when reached by BI.\n\nOn January 7, Freedman told SiriusXM's \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" that his team planned to take further legal action.\n\nFreedman also alleged Reynolds used his influence to help Lively take over \"It Ends With Us\" and to mock Baldoni on \"Deadpool and Wolverine,\" via a new character in the film called Nicepool.\n\nIn the film, which premiered in July 2024 and was the second-highest-grossing movie of 2024, Nicepool, a version of Deadpool from an alternate dimension whose face has not been disfigured, jokes about a woman's pregnancy weight, claims to be a feminist and wears a man bun.\n\nFreedman alleged this was based on Baldoni, who has a reputation for being a feminist and has been known to wear his hair in a bun in the past.\n\nIn the movie, Nicepool is eventually killed by Ladypool, a female version of Deadpool from an alternate dimension played by Lively.\n\n\"What I make of that is that if your wife is sexually harassed, you don't make fun of Justin Baldoni,\" Freedman said. \"You don't make fun of the situation. You take it very seriously. You file HR complaints. You raise the issue and you follow a legal process. What you don't do is mock the person and turn it into a joke.\"\n\nOn January 16, 2025, Baldoni, his associates at his company Wayfarer Studios, and his publicists Nathan and Abel sued Lively, her publicist Leslie Sloane, and her husband Ryan Reynolds, alleging they orchestrated a smear campaign against him.\n\nBaldoni's lawsuit, which seeks $400 million in damages, alleges that Lively, with the help of Reynolds and Sloane, hijacked \"It Ends with Us\" by wresting creative control away from Baldoni, then worked to destroy his reputation and livelihood.\n\nThe suit, which contains many of the same details from Baldoni's defamation suit against the Times, also claims that Reynolds pressured the talent agency WME, which also represents Lively and Reynolds, to drop Baldoni.\n\nThe agency did so in December but a WME spokesperson previously denied Reynolds and Lively put pressure on the agency.\n\nFreedman told BI that their suit was \"based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team's duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni.\"\n\n\"Justin and his team have nothing to hide,\" the statement adds, \"documents do not lie.\"\n\nLively's legal team said Baldoni's team's suit is another attempt to \"shift the narrative\" from one about harassment claims to one around battles for creative control.\n\n\"This latest lawsuit from Justin Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios, and its associates is another chapter in the abuser playbook,\" Lively's legal team said. \"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim.\"\n\nIn Lively's complaint, Lively said Baldoni acted as himself instead of Ryle while filming a slow-dance sequence for the romance film.\n\n\"At one point, he leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, 'it smells so good,'\" the complaint read. \"None of this was remotely done in character, or based on any dialogue in the script, and nothing needed to be said because, again, there was no sound.\"\n\nHer team alleged Lively later objected to this behavior and said Baldoni replied, \"I'm not even attracted to you.\"\n\nOn January 21, Baldoni's production company and lawyer hit back by sending a nearly 10-minute behind-the-scenes footage of the cast filming the scene to outlets including the Daily Mail.\n\nBaldoni's team said in a statement at the beginning of the video that the footage contains three takes filmed on May 23, 2023, and said these were the only versions filmed of the scene.\n\n\"Both actors are clearly behaving well within the scope of the scene and with mutual respect and professionalism,\" they added.\n\nThe video also showed that the initial direction in the \"It Ends With Us\" script is that Baldoni and Lively's characters just dance together.\n\nIn the takes, Baldoni repeatedly moves in to kiss Lively, and Lively pulls away and says it would be better if they talked during the scene. At one point, Baldoni rubs his face on both sides of Lively's neck seemingly without warning, but the pair joke about it in the video.\n\nThe video has elicited a range of responses on social media. Some users thought Lively looked uncomfortable, while others believed Lively was attracted to her costar.\n\nLively's attorneys sent a statement to The Hollywood Reporter after the video was published, saying that the footage corroborated Lively's story because \"every moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\"\n\n\"The video shows Ms. Lively leaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk. Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively's discomfort,\" the statement said.\n\n\"They will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent.\"\n\nLively's attorneys also said that Baldoni's choice to release the video to the media instead of presenting it to court was an \"unethical attempt to manipulate the public\" and a \"continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign.\"\n\n\"While they are focused on misleading media narratives, we are focused on the legal process,\" her attorneys said.\n\nFreedman responded in a statement sent to Business Insider via email on Wednesday: \"Prior to filing her lawsuit in court, Ms. Lively went to The New York Times in an effort to publicly destroy Justin Baldoni. When Mr. Baldoni exercises his right to publicly defend himself by putting forth actual facts and evidence, for Ms Lively and team this instantly becomes morally and ethically wrong.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"Ms. Lively wants very different standards to apply to her but fortunately, truth and authenticity apply to everyone and can never be wrong. Looking at the video and the evidence to come, I can understand why Ms. Lively would now, not want this to play out in public.\"\n\nIn February 2025, Baldoni's lawyers launched a website containing two documents related to his legal battle with Lively.\n\nThe first is an amended version of Baldoni's $400 million counter-lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds.\n\nIn the amended complaint, Baldoni's team claims that the metadata on The New York Times' website shows that the publication had access to Lively's civil rights complaint at least 11 days before publishing its report on Baldoni's alleged smear campaign, titled \"'We Can Bury Anyone': Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\"\n\nAnother update in the lawsuit took aim at Lively's husband and accused him of using the character of Nicepool in \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" to bully Baldoni, saying that the \"caricature of a 'woke' feminist\" was a \"transparent and mocking portrayal of Reynolds' warped perception of Baldoni.\"\n\nThe second document on the new site is a 168-page \"timeline of relevant events\" related to the feud and the movie's production. The timeline dates from January 2019, when Baldoni approached Hoover about adapting her novel, to January 2025.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman said: \"The decision to amend our lawsuit was a logical next step due to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light.\"\n\nVariety reported that the Times has disputed \"inaccuracies\" in Baldoni's complaint.\n\nOn June 9, US District Judge Lewis Liman dismissed Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit, in which the actor and director accused Lively of taking creative control of \"It Ends with Us\" and damaging his reputation. The suit also alleged that Lively had falsely accused Baldoni of sexual harassment as a way to take control of the production.\n\nThe countersuit had previously been combined with a separate suit Baldoni had filed against The New York Times and Lively's publicist Leslie Sloane, which accused Sloane of planting rumors to smear Baldoni in the press and the Times of facilitating their circulation.\n\nJudge Liman ruled that Lively's claims of sexual harassment were legally protected and immune from a lawsuit. Liman is still weighing whether to dismiss Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni.\n\nOn October 31, Judge Liman officially ended Baldoni's lawsuit against Lively.\n\nLiman stated in his order that he contacted all parties on October 17 that his final judgment to conclude the case was coming soon. Only Lively responded. With Baldoni's side missing the deadline to continue to claim, the judge dismissed the lawsuit.\n\nLively's original lawsuit against Baldoni is still ongoing. A court date is set for May 18.\n\nOn January 20, 2026, following Judge Liman's ruling that both parties release evidence before a hearing to dismiss the May trial, Lively's team released documents, including depositions and text messages.\n\nThey included text exchanges between Lively and her friend Taylor Swift. In one, Swift referred to Baldoni as a \"bitch,\" writing to Lively before the New York Times story ran, \"I think this bitch knows something is coming because he's gotten out his tiny violin.\"\n\nA year prior to that text, Lively referred to Baldoni as the \"doofus director of my movie\" in a text to Swift.\n\nThe deposition of Lively's \"It Ends With Us\" costar Jenny Slate was also among the unsealed documents. In it, she describes an alleged incident on set where Baldoni said to her, \"I can say this because my wife is here, but you look sexy in what you're wearing.\"\n\nSlate said the comment was \"not appropriate\" on set or in \"any workplace.\"\n\n\"The comment was about me, not my character. It wasn't useful for my work. It wasn't anything I wanted. It was unwanted and had no place, in my professional experience,\" Slate said in her deposition.\n\nTexts by Slate were also released. In one, she described Baldoni as \"a fraud.\"\n\nIn another message, she called him \"the biggest clown and the most intense narcissist.\"\n\nBaldoni's team has yet to release its evidence.\n\nBryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, told Business Insider in a statement that \"the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law\" and pointed to messages from Sony discussing Lively's behavior.\n\n\"A simple read of the newly released message exchanges makes the truth abundantly clear. We remain confident in the legal process and clearing the names of all of the Justin Baldoni parties.\"\n\nReps for Lively, Swift, and Slate did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "America's economy has never been stronger.\n\nAt least that's what President Donald Trump told the Davos audience on Wednesday. From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump framed his economic agenda as one centered on affordability.\n\nTrump repeatedly credited his policies for lowering everyday costs, and promised more savings in the future. But the reality is slightly different.\n\nAs Americans navigate a brutal job market and climbing cost of living, Business Insider dove into the data behind the president's Davos speech.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The price of gasoline is now below $2.50 a gallon in many states… Soon it will be averaging less than $2 a gallon.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The average price of gasoline in the US was $2.81 a gallon as of January 19, nearly half of what it was during a 2022 high. Gas prices haven't been below $2 since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAs of January 21, AAA reported that ten states have an average gas price at or below $2.50.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Homes are built for people, not corporations. America will not become a nation of renters. We're not going to do that. That's why I've signed an order banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump signed an executive order targeting institutional investors this month — but it's unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, largely in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The cost of prescription drugs is coming down by up to 90%.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The president is negotiating with some pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of drugs and has launched TrumpRx, a government-run, direct-to-consumer prescription platform aimed at connecting people with cheaper medications. Trump's healthcare plan, released last week, outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums while maximizing transparency for Americans.\n\nEnhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired in December because of Republican opposition in Congress, leading to a spike in premiums for millions of Americans on marketplace plans. January data shows that, with rising costs, at least 1.4 million Americans dropped their healthcare plans between 2025 and 2026.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that the enrollment decline is \"entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act also proposed changes to Medicaid, including stricter work requirements for enrollees and a federal funding reduction of $1 trillion over the next ten years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump has called on Congress to cap credit card rates that have \"ripped off\" consumers. In the third quarter of 2025, the most recently available data, American credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nThis proposal has received bipartisan support, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders pushing for a similar credit card cap. \"Trump even acknowledge the bipartisan appeal, telling CNBC's Joe Kernen Wednesday that the proposal sounds like something \"the mayor of New York maybe came up with.\"\n\nBank and business leaders are largely opposed, arguing that a 10% cap would prevent companies from adequately pricing subprime credit risk.",

I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "description": "Expect to see clips from \"Stranger Things\" and Pete Davidson's podcast sometime this year.",
    "fullText": "The funny thing about smartphone addiction is that it makes low-effort tasks feel totally productive. When I finally quit doomscrolling through Instagram and TikTok and watch an actual movie or TV show, I feel like I've just spent the afternoon studying physics. Platforms like Netflix, which could once be seen as time-wasting entertainment, now seem like antidotes to endless, useless scrolling.\n\nBut Netflix doesn't seem to appreciate its new role. Instead, the company apparently sees short-form video apps—and smartphones themselves—as a direct threat to its business, and is jumping on the bandwagon. It's not only that Netflix is reportedly now making content with phone scrollers in mind, encouraging creators to craft dialogue that makes their shows and movies easy to understand even if you're not actually paying attention.\n\nNo Netflix also wants to position its mobile app as an actual competitor to TikTok and Instagram, by introducing a short-form video feed directly within the app.\n\nThe company officially introduced its plans for short-form video during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters announced the company will roll out a new app later this year that will include its take on the vertical video feed. This isn't totally new, as the company has been experimenting with vertical video feeds since May. But it's the first time we've seen a larger announcement about how Netflix plans to integrate the short-form experience directly into its app.\n\nUnlike TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, you won't hop on the Netflix app to find short-form videos from independent creators. Instead, Netflix will serve users clips from Netflix-distributed shows and movies in a scrollable TikTok-style feed. You might swipe through this feed and see clips from Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, or His & Hers. Many of us already waste our time watching clips from shows and movies on other platforms—often cropped, slowed down or sped up, in low-quality, and besieged by artifacts meant to throw off copyright claims. Netflix obviously won't need to do this, so I expect the experience will be filled with high-quality videos (depending on how you define \"quality\" of course).\n\nIt won't just be TV shows and movies on the feed. Netflix also has big plans for its video podcasts, as evidenced by recent programs like The Pete Davidson Show and recent deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia to bring existing podcasts to its platform. Expect Netflix to sprinkle clips from these video podcasts into the short-form feed to create an experience that sounds not too far off from scrolling through other apps. How many clips you do see from video podcasts, TV shows, and movies on TikTok?\n\nAs Netflix inches closer to acquiring Warner Bros., you might soon be seeing a lot of official short-form content in the Netflix app. If and when the acquisition closes, I wouldn't be surprised to see clips from HBO shows like A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, The White Lotus, and Euphoria.\n\nI get the move from a business perspective: Netflix is likely losing subscribers' attention due to the addictive nature of vertical video apps. But do any of us really need another app to scroll through, especially when we're already paying for access to the full content to begin with? Maybe could be a helpful avenue to find new shows and movies to watch, but in all likelihood, it will just be be another addictive time-waster. I have too many of those in my life as it is.",

    "fullText": "A malicious ad-blocking extension on Chrome and Edge is using the ClickFix attack to infect devices with a remote access payload capable of spying on and taking over a system.\n\nNexShield pitched itself as a privacy-focused ad blocker from the developer of well-established and highly trusted uBlock Origin. However, as security firm Huntress found, the extension initiates a variation of the ClickFix attack that has been dubbed \"CrashFix\"—a reference to the browser crash that precedes the fake security warning and malicious command prompt.\n\nAs BleepingComputer describes, the NexShield extension creates a denial-of-service (DoS) loop that exhausts your device's memory, ultimately freezing Chrome or Edge and causing it to crash. When the browser restarts, the extension displays a pop-up with a \"Run Scan\" button to identify \"potential security threats that may compromise your browsing data,\" leading users to believe that the crash resulted from a security issue.\n\nIf you follow through, you'll see another fake window with instructions for executing commands in the Windows command prompt. This is the ClickFix attack: a form of social engineering that relies on fake error messages, CAPTCHAs, and command prompts to trick users into deploying malware onto their own devices.\n\nIn this case, the extension copies a command to the clipboard, and if users enter the keystrokes in the fake pop-up, downloads and executes a malicious script. After a 60-minute delay to avoid detection, NexShield delivers the payload that can run commands, fingerprint systems, and elevate privileges.\n\nNote that as of this writing, NexShield has been removed from the Chrome Web Store.\n\nIf you've installed NexShield, you should uninstall it and perform a full system cleanup to clear its payloads from your device. (We've got step-by-step guides to removing malware from your Mac and your PC.)\n\nAs general protection against similar attacks, only install browser extensions from trusted sources. This isn't a guarantee that you'll never encounter a malicious add-on in the Chrome Web Store or in other browsers, as hackers occasionally manage to sneak through the approval process and even get their extensions labeled as trusted or verified. Some extensions are only later injected with malicious code, essentially \"waking up\" their ability to attack.\n\nBefore installing a new extension, carefully check the creation date, reviews and ratings, and even the name, as malicious add-ons will often impersonate trusted ones (or, as in the case of NexShield, piggyback on legitimate brands like uBlock Origin). Watch for suspicious permissions—if the extension requests access to data or actions that seem excessive or are unrelated to its core function, it might be malware.\n\nFinally, never run codes or commands on your machine copied from websites or communication that you don't understand, and always verify instructions with an independent, trusted source. For this specific campaign, Huntress has other indicators of compromise you can look for on your system.",

    "title": "How to Follow Any Workout Video, Even If You're an Absolute Beginner",
    "description": "Including how to substitute easier exercises, and what to do when you just can't keep up.",
    "fullText": "A workout habit has a way of building momentum: Once you’re doing something, anything, it’s easy to build on that. Video workouts are a simple way to get started, but if you're having trouble following along, I'm here to help. Below are some ways to make common exercises more accessible, and what to do if you can't get through a whole video yet.\n\nLots of “easy” bodyweight programs ask you to perform a squatting motion without any added weight. But if that’s already more than you can do, try one of these instead:\n\nSit in a chair, and stand back up.\n\nLean your back against a wall and slide down until you’re in a sitting position (this is called a wall squat).\n\nHold onto a countertop or the back of a chair while you do a squat.\n\nFor any of these, it’s okay to squat as low as you can, even if that’s not all the way to parallel. You can work on going lower over time.\n\nPushups are another move you’ll find in simple beginner workouts, but not everyone can do a pushup on their first day. Pushups get easier the higher your hands are, and harder the higher your feet are. So for the easiest beginner version, put your hands on a wall around shoulder height. Lean into the wall, then push yourself back to a standing position.\n\nOnce those become easy, choose a lower surface, like a table or countertop. Then move to a chair, and so on. This progression is arguably better than doing pushups on your knees, because no matter which level you’re on, you are practicing holding your entire body straight in a plank position.\n\nDumbbells come in all sizes—and fortunately for beginners, the smallest ones are also the cheapest. If your gym doesn’t have dumbbells small enough, any store with a sporting goods section will likely have some one- and two-pound dumbbells you can pick up and add to your gym bag.\n\nBut if you’re not even ready for dumbbells, that’s okay. A half-liter water bottle weighs about a pound. Same with a can of soup. Larger water bottles, wine bottles, and milk jugs can take you up a bit further in weight; we did the math for you here. You can also hold books, roller skates, or tote bags full of literally anything. (Two water bottles in a grocery bag? That’s a two-pound weight.)\n\nNeed to start even lighter? It’s okay to do weight workouts using literally nothing. Make your hands into fists and go through the motions. If you’re following a video that does a million reps of bicep curls or tricep extensions, your arms will get tired even if they’re empty. Just move up to the water bottles as soon as you’re ready.\n\nWith these substitutions, you may feel ready to start following along with beginner level workout videos. But what if you can’t handle exactly what’s on the screen? Remember, your goal should be to do a workout at your current level of fitness, not to complete a certain number of reps that you theoretically could do if you were in better shape. So if the video asks for 30 seconds of pushups but you can only manage a few reps, do as many as you can and rest for the remainder of the time.\n\nIt’s fine to bounce from video to video until you find something at your level. Keep an eye out for one that seems like fun but is just out of your reach. Do it anyway, modifying it or resting as needed, and then bookmark it and come back to it next week. Chances are good you’ll be able to keep up a little bit better—and if you keep coming back to that same workout week after week, you’ll eventually master it. Consistency breeds momentum.\n\nLet’s say you want to do a workout from a Peloton-like cycling instructor. You’ve got your bike, you can pedal, but pretty quickly you’re out of breath and feel like you can’t keep going.\n\nThese workouts are easy to adjust: All you have to do is pay attention to the instructor’s voice and facial expressions and ignore any specific numbers. It doesn’t matter if she’s asking you for a “20” or a “50.” If the instructor looks and talks like she’s on an easy bike ride, adjust your resistance so you are on an easy bike ride. If she looks like she’s working hard but not dying, adjust your resistance so you are working hard but not dying.\n\nStart literally anywhere. There isn’t a wrong answer. Maybe you start doing cardio dance videos, but it turns out you hate dancing. Well, you’re already moving your body a couple times a week, so you can swap out the dancing for something else.\n\nOr maybe you start doing pushups every day, but after a while your wrists are aching. You can choose to address that problem and continue your pushups, or you can look back on how far you’ve come, congratulate yourself, and pick a different thing to try for the next chapter of your fitness journey. After all, you’ve already started, so why not keep going?",

    "description": "The statement comes about a week after OpenAI announced ads are coming to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "A week after OpenAI admitted it will soon start testing ads in ChatGPT, Google has promised that it's not planning to inject ads into Gemini anytime soon.\n\nThe statement was given to journalist Alex Heath during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the company doesn't have \"any plans\" for ads in Gemini. While the statement was fairly brief, it also jibes with a similar quote Hassabis gave to Axios, where he said he was \"a little bit surprised\" that OpenAI was already introducing ads to ChatGPT.\n\nThat surprise is understandable, especially because OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2024 that he considered ads a \"last resort for us as a business model.\" But looking at the numbers, it makes sense that ChatGPT is getting ads long before Gemini is even thinking of them.\n\nWhile Google makes most of its money through showing people ads, it's also able to rely on Search and YouTube to push ads to most of those eyeballs. Meanwhile, OpenAI is pretty much just ChatGPT. As the latter moves to a for-profit model, it now has to put moneymaking first, something it's had trouble doing without relying on traditional internet moneymakers like ads. Google, meanwhile, is already profitable elsewhere, and is able to take its time and use its sheer size to keep Gemini ad-free, at least while it continues to chase market share.\n\nDoes this mean Google's AI will never get ads? Well, never say never. But it does mean that they're probably not on the horizon—even if Google plans to more aggressively monetize Gemini over the long term, it isn't facing the same kind of time crunch as Altman's company.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the presence of ads will push users away from ChatGPT, but the move comes in the wake of significant wins for Gemini and one major loss for ChatGPT. First, Google's Nano Banana image editing model went viral on social media, winning over the general public. Then, Google struck a deal with Apple to put its AI into the iPhone, and it looks like Gemini will be powering Siri for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT reportedly saw a 6% dip in users early last month, following a model update from Gemini—and that was before the introdution of ads. While ChatGPT still seems to be in the lead on total user count, there's evidence that Google is catching up.\n\nThe divide in strategy seems clear: As OpenAI seeks ways to get more money out of its existing user base, Google can focus on growing its own with new integrations into the products we already use every day. I can't say what the limits of this growth are, but I can say that I rarely go out of my way use AI, yet I've still found myself accidentally relying on Google's AI overviews every now and then. If Google can get more people like me to casually integrate AI into our regular workflows, it's possible we could soon have a new AI leader on our hands.",

    "title": "I Tried Strava's New 'Instant Workouts' Feature, and It Isn't Great",
    "description": "The rollout leaves a lot to be desired.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month Strava unveiled its new Instant Workouts feature, a subscriber-exclusive tool that seems like a natural way to leverage its acquisition of Runna. In a Reddit post, Strava said this feature builds upon Runna's already successful Instant Workouts feature.\n\nInstant Workouts uses your activity history to generate personalized workouts across four intents (\"Maintain,\" \"Build,\" \"Explore,\" or \"Recover\"). The idea is that the more you upload, the more personalized your recommendations become. Another major selling point is the automatic route generation feature, which draws on Strava's massive database of billions of historical activities to suggest optimal paths for each workout.\n\nThe timing of this rollout seems deliberate as the company positions itself for its anticipated IPO. And on paper, it sounds like exactly the kind of innovation that would indeed justify a Strava subscription. In practice, however, the execution leaves a good bit to be desired.\n\nUnfortunately, the feature's current implementation falls far short of its potential. The most glaring issue: You cannot actually view your workout details once you've started the activity in the app. Strava generates solid, complex, multi-interval workouts—but provides no way to reference them on your watch during your run or ride. You'd have to screenshot the workout beforehand or print it out.\n\nFor the majority of us athletes who rely on our devices to guide interval training, pace targets, and recovery periods, this renders the feature practically useless. Strava has acknowledged this limitation in a Reddit post, promising that device integration for Garmin and Apple watches is \"coming soon.\" But the timeline for that \"soon\" is questionable at best.\n\nThe relationship between Strava and Garmin has reportedly grown frosty following a lawsuit last fall, and there's little incentive for Garmin to prioritize features that primarily benefit Strava's subscription revenue and investor appeal. Without Garmin's cooperation and swift implementation, a significant portion of Strava's serious athlete user base remains locked out of the feature's full utility.\n\nOn the bright side, in my opinion, the workouts themselves show promise—though others disagree. The training plans generated appear to take into account individual fitness levels reasonably well. From my testing, the prescribed intervals, pacing, and progression made sense given my current training status and recent activity history.\n\nThat said, user experiences vary considerably. Some athletes report receiving workouts that seem disconnected from their actual fitness or goals, while others note that the workout descriptions use non-standard terminology that doesn't align with how most training plans communicate intervals and pacing.\n\nThen there's the route generation. In a well-traveled area with dense activity heat maps like New York City, my suggested routes tend to be solid and sensible enough. As always, my personal preferences are to avoid extra crowded streets or sketchy areas, which Strava never seems to take into account. Ultimately, the algorithm benefits from years of crowdsourced data showing which streets, paths, and loops are actually popular with runners and cyclists.\n\nHowever, users in less densely populated areas or regions with sparser Strava usage report wildly inconsistent results. Some routes make no logical sense, sending athletes on inefficient paths or suggesting roads that aren't suitable for the prescribed workout type. The feature's quality appears directly tied to the richness of local Strava data, creating a drastic two-tier experience.\n\nAnd once again: Until I can push the workout and corresponding map to my watch, this feature doesn't mean much to me.\n\nIf you ask me, Strava's Instant Workouts feature feels rushed to market, likely timed to generate positive press ahead of the IPO rather than to actually serve athletes. Basic functionality that should have been present at launch—like being able to see your workout in the app or send it to your watch—is mysteriously absent. The wonky workout descriptions and inconsistent route quality only compound the sense that this needed more time in development.",

    "title": "Apple Might Turn Siri Into an AI Chatbot to Rival ChatGPT",
    "description": "It could be ChatGPT's next big competitor.",
    "fullText": "Last week, Apple finally admitted it will need to team up with Google to finally make good on that contextual Siri promise it made two years ago, which would have allowed the virtual assistant to integrate with content like your texts or emails to answer personal questions and take actions for you. Now, according to a new report, the iPhone company might actually go one step further and turn Siri into a full-fledged AI chatbot—one on par with the likes of ChatGPT, and perhaps even more sophisticated.\n\nCurrently, Siri has AI implementation, but only technically, and it's certainly underwhelming: You can use it to get tech support on Apple products or shunt questions off to ChatGPT, but otherwise, Siri basically works as it always has. But according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has reliably reported on insider information at Apple before, the company is finally not only looking to make Siri smarter, but also change the way you interact with it. Currently planned for iOS and macOS 27 under the name \"Campos,\" Siri's new chatbot interface will still be powered by Gemini, but will allow you to both type and talk to Siri, with full continuity between your conversations. This upgrade will be in addition to the overdue features that were already announced.\n\nIn other words, it'll look something like the chatbot interface from the ChatGPT app or the standalone Gemini app. Yes, you can technically type to Siri right now, but it mostly works like a separate input method, rather than as a full conversation. You can't scroll through your previous questions to Siri or peruse the assistant's previous answers, and if you ask Siri to reference a message you sent it two weeks ago, it'll have no idea what you mean. That's far behind what other AI chatbots offer right now.\n\nThe update will also apparently further expand Siri's capabilities even beyond the contextual or personalization upgrades that were already revealed. Gurman says that, while the contextual upgrades will be able to pull information from other apps like Messages, the chatbot-style Siri will be \"integrated into all of the company's core apps, including ones for mail, music, podcasts, TV, Xcode programming software and photos.\" Essentially, Siri will have more access to your iPhone than other AI chatbots, and those integrations will go beyond what was previously promised. That could make it more or less appealing to you, depending on your tastes in AI integration.\n\nWith the chatbot interface planned for iOS 27, it's likely to come after the contextual upgrades, rather than at the same time. That's because, as Gurman said previously, those upgrades are set for the spring. He predicts we'll learn more about it during this year's WWDC, which, if it follows the standard set by previous years, will take place in June.\n\nThe move to turn Siri into a chatbot could come across as a a much-overdue modernization, as Google has already done the same with Gemini over on Android, but it's also a bit of a surprise, as Apple had previously said it did not intend to turn Siri into a \"bolt-on chatbot on the side\" for Apple Intelligence.\n\nBut Apple was likely talking about quality of the experience rather than expressing any significant anti-chatbot bias among the development team, meaning the fact that Siri is turning into a chatbot could mean the company is finally happy with the direction it's headed. But it's also possible that the professed skepticism about turning Siri into a chatbot was meant to appeal to AI skeptics in general. Unfortunately, if you're still skeptical about AI, it currently seems like iOS 27 will be a boring update for you, as Gurman indicated the new Siri chatbot will be the \"primary new addition\" to the operating system.\n\nHowever you feel about it personally, Siri as a full-fledged AI chatbot could seriously upset ChatGPT's market dominance—ironic, given its early integration with Apple Intelligence. Currently, OpenAI has reportedly admitted it's in a Code Red situation, as it is losing market share to Google and introducing ads to bolster its bottom line. The new Siri, being powered by Gemini, is unlikely to hurt Google (although it will have more access to your phone than the standalone Gemini app), but its ease-of-access might make it the new go-to for iPhone users, and that could hurt pretty much every AI company Apple isn't in business with directly.",

    "title": "This Hydration App Tracks Your 'Output' Instead of Your Intake",
    "description": "This approach may be more accurate, anyway.",
    "fullText": "I’ve never managed to get on board with any hydration trackers. I’ll log the foods I eat, the exercise I do, but drinks just happen. Did I have one glass of water or two with lunch? Hell if I know. Not to mention that your hydration depends on all the H2O you take in, not just the glasses of plain water. You can hydrate with soup, with Diet Coke, or with slices of watermelon. Most hydration apps forget this, but even if they don’t, that just makes logging even more complicated.\n\nThat’s why I was intrigued by the P Water app for iPhone and Apple Watch. It tracks exactly what you’d expect from the name. I’ve been using it for about a week, and so far, I'm a fan. I tap a button on my Apple Watch when I’m heading to the bathroom, and between pit stops, I can drink whatever I want without measuring or logging any of it. If it’s been a few hours since my last bathroom trip, the app will prompt me to drink water.\n\nThis approach means that I get full credit for the water in my soup and Diet Coke, because it’s still hydrating me, and my internal hydration level is still triggering my bathroom trips. I spend a total of about 30 seconds each day thinking about the app, and I measure nothing. This is ideal for me.\n\nThe developers of P Water were not the first to think of tracking water output rather than input. You may have noted this approach is sometimes used in medical settings, and as a new parent I remember being asked how many wet diapers my newborn was producing each day.\n\nP Water cites research showing that counting up the number of times you urinate per day can give a reasonably good estimate of how hydrated you are. For example, this study on healthy young men concludes that “[Void frequency] is a reliable index of 24-[hour] hydration status” so long as bathroom visits come at a consistent “urgency”—in other words, if you sometimes go when you don’t really have to, but sometimes hold it a long time, your pee count will be less reliable as a hydration indicator. That much is pretty obvious.\n\nTracking output rather than input accounts for not just different sources of water in your diet, but also different hydration needs. For example, the “eight glasses of water a day” rule was never a particularly good one, especially when you consider that people come in different sizes and may have different activity levels.\n\nThat said, if you have a need to monitor your exact hydration, an app like P Water won’t necessarily do everything you need it to do. Medical providers often ask for specific amounts when they have people do what they call a “voiding diary.” But for a general sense of whether you’re hydrating enough that you’re peeing a normal amount, P Water seems to be a convenient tool.\n\nWhile it’s convenient to use P Water on an Apple Watch, it also works as a regular iPhone app. The full app has some convenient actions, like having a “log a pee” option when you long-press the home screen icon or when you swipe down to see Siri suggestions.\n\nI only used the app’s most basic features—logging bathroom visits, basically—but there’s",

    "description": "Home emergencies can happen at any time. Here are the tools and supplies you need to have ready to deal with emergency home repairs.",
    "fullText": "So many things can go wrong with your home at any given moment—and those problems won't exactly wait for you to be prepared to deal with them before they hit. Plus, they often happen when it’s difficult or impossible to get a professional to come help you—like during storms, or in the middle of the night.\n\nIf you wake up to a burst pipe or a leaking roof and you can’t get a pro to come for a while, you don’t want to be powerless in your efforts to stave off further disaster. Having a basic set of tools is a great start, but you need to keep a few more items on hand if you truly want to be able to respond with a quick fix. Here’s the short list of everything you should have in your home in case you need to do some emergency repairs.\n\nWater is incredibly destructive, and leaks that seem minor can do major damage to your house. Making sure you have basic tools like wrenches and knowing where the water shutoffs are in your house is essential, but here are a few more items that can hep you respond to emergencies:\n\nSnake auger. A plunger will take care of a clogged drain or toilet (and if you lack a plunger, don’t forget you can use a garbage bag on the toilet in a pinch), but if plunging doesn’t stop the water’s inexorable rise, you need to have a snake auger on hand. It’s a simple tool that anyone can operate, and it will break up most clogs pretty quickly, potentially averting disaster.\n\nBattery powered pumps. You may already have a sump pump installed to keep things dry in your basement and crawl space. If the power goes out, however, your sump won’t do you much good. And battery backup power typically doesn’t last long, so having a cordless transfer pump could be a lifesaver. Even something like a DrillPump (for $17) can stave off a flood long enough to get a professional in there.\n\nPipe clamps. Water pipes always seem to burst at the worst possible time—and shutting off the water to the whole house isn’t ideal if you have to wait a few days for a plumber. Having a few pipe repair clamps on hand will get you through those days. These clamps are pretty simple: You just slip them onto the pipe and tighten the clamp until the leak is sealed by the rubber backing. This fix won’t last forever, but it will probably let you keep the water on for a few days while you sort out a more permanent repair.\n\nRoof leaks often stay hidden until a bad storm suddenly reveals them—and roof repairs have to wait until the weather clears. Here’s what you need if your roof starts leaking at the worst possible moment:\n\nRoof cement. Roof cement (like the Henry 208R) can be a lifesaver. If you notice that your roof has obvious damage, or it has leaked recently, applying a layer of roof cement to the affected area is a fast, easy repair that will keep the water out until you can do something more permanent.\n\nTarp. A durable tarp is useful in a lot of emergencies, but essential for a surprise roof leak. Along with some plastic-cap nails, you’ll be able to quickly cover any damaged section of your roof and keep things as dry as possible until a roofer can make an assessment. Tarping a roof isn’t hard, though you should always use extreme caution when on your roof—especially if it’s raining.\n\nThere are a bunch more things you might not need every day, but should have on hand in case of emergency:\n\nSpray sealant. Clear waterproof sealant spray can be used to seal off cracked windows, minor roof damage, and anything else that suddenly starts leaking.\n\nZip ties. These plastic ties are incredibly useful because they’re easy to deploy quickly, can be linked together, and are strong enough for most temporary repairs when you need to hold things together. They can even be fashioned into a DIY drain cleanout tool in a pinch if you don’t have that snake auger.\n\nDuct tape and electrical tape. No, duct tape can’t fix everything, but this strong, sticky tape can temporarily fix tools, hold stuff together, stop minor leaks—and, yes, seal up broken ductwork. Electrical tape is essential if you’re going to attempt any DIY electrical repair, whether it’s braiding wires together, covering exposed wire when the insulation has worn off, or securing a loose connection.\n\nPlastic sheeting. Plastic sheeting is useful when a tarp is too heavy and cumbersome. It can be used in just about any application where you want to keep water or the weather out of a space, like covering a broken window in a storm or on the floors under a roof leak.\n\nSuper glue. Super glue is useful stuff—it can bond just about anything, and it can even be used to seal small leaks in pipes in a pinch.\n\nTwine. Having some strong twine rope will definitely come in handy. It can be used to lash things down, to reinforce repairs and connections, to tie down a tarp, or in a million other ways.\n\nBucket. The classic 5-gallon bucket has so many uses you probably already have one—but if you don’t, it’s time to pick one up. Catching leaks, hauling debris, water, or even tools, mixing—they can even be used as ersatz step stools in a pinch.\n\nMultitool. You have a whole set of hand and power tools, but when an emergency strikes, you don’t always have the time to gather everything you need. Having a high-quality multitool gives you a range of tools in your pocket, letting you get to fixing things immediately without delay.",

    "fullText": "Speaking to Tottenham fans on their way to Tuesday's Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund, almost none retained any belief in Thomas Frank.\n\nIt felt as though a bad defeat against the German side - which would have been a fourth loss in a row in all competitions - would not only have led to more boos and more toxicity inside the stadium, but the end of his reign as manager.\n\nInstead, a 2-0 win thanks to first-half goals from Christian Romero and Dominic Solanke is likely to buy Frank some time. An encouraging performance from his depleted team could even give him more than that.\n\nJust a few days earlier, loud boos greeted the final whistle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as West Ham snatched a last-minute winner.\n\nBefore kick-off on Tuesday there were some jeers once again when Frank's name was read out, but they turned into cheers at full-time as Spurs secured a win that now puts them in a strong position to qualify automatically for the Champions League knockouts.\n\nThe question now is: was this a temporary reprieve for Frank or a platform to build on? And is it enough to win back the fans who had turned against him?",

    "description": "Arne Slot praises the return of Mohamed Salah, with Liverpool's Champions League win in Marseille proving important for both.",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot has good memories in Marseille. It was here in 2022 when his Feyenoord side held on to secure a place in the Europa Conference League final.\n\nOn the eve of this week's game in the bowels of the Stade Velodrome, he was asked about those memories. He was also bizarrely and rudely asked about Xabi Alonso's links to the Liverpool job.\n\nAny noise surrounding the future of the Liverpool boss was quietened by a trademark European away performance from his side, who added Marseille to Eintracht Frankfurt and Inter Milan as the teams they have beaten on their travels this season.\n\nTheir unbeaten run of 13 matches (W7 D6) in all competitions may have been uninspiring for the large part but it is the longest ongoing streak of any team from Europe's big five leagues. In itself, credit must be due for that. Liverpool last lost a game in November.\n\nCrucially for Slot, it was a first win in a game that Mohamed Salah started for Liverpool since November 4, when they beat Real Madrid in the Champions League. It now looks like a line has been firmly drawn after Salah's interview at Leeds and both player and manager can move on for the betterment of the football club.\n\nThe reality is that both need each other. Pre-match, Slot told TNT Sports: \"The moments when I didn't play him, I was trying something different. We have missed goals from all the ball possession. If there's one player in the history of Liverpool that can score goals, it's Mo Salah.\"\n\nIt was a night where Salah did not add to his club record of 46 Champions League goals for Liverpool, even though he really should have when he fired wide in the second half, but the assurance with which Liverpool played in a 4-2-2-2 setup will leave Slot delighted and may well give him food for thought for the coming weeks.\n\n\"It says a lot about how big a professional he [Salah] is that he can be away for more than a month with a different team and be so fit to play 90 minutes for us after one day of training,\" said Slot. \"He was so close to a goal. It would usually be a goal from him, but it didn't harm us because we scored three.\"",
