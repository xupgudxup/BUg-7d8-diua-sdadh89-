    "fullText": "With longtime head coach Mike Tomlin stepping down after 19 seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the future of quarterback Aaron Rodgers in Pittsburgh is now uncertain.\n\nRodgers joined the Steelers in 2025 largely because of his relationship with Tomlin, and with the coach’s exit, both sides face a pivotal offseason decision.\n\nSeveral reports indicate that convincing the four-time MVP to reconsider his plans may hinge on the Steelers’ next coaching hire and the return of someone Rodgers trusts.\n\nCommentators have speculated that the Steelers could use Rodgers’ past relationships to their advantage.\n\n“I saw that Mike McCarthy’s name got thrown in the hat here now. And that’s his guy. That’s his guy in Green Bay. That’s a Pittsburgh guy. Now that could save him. That could save it.”\n\nThe idea is that hiring someone Rodgers has worked with before, such as former Packers head coach Mike McCarthy, might recreate the comfort and familiarity he had earlier in his career.\n\nRodgers and McCarthy won a Super Bowl together in Green Bay, and that shared success could be a factor in steering the veteran back to Pittsburgh if Rodgers decides to play in 2026.\n\nNFL insider Ian Rapoport has stated that Rodgers is not expected to return to the Steelers now that Tomlin is gone, largely because Rodgers specifically came to Pittsburgh to play for the veteran coach.\n\nRodgers’ one-year deal in 2025 was influenced by that relationship, and with Tomlin’s resignation, his future with the franchise has been thrown into doubt.\n\nAt the same time, sources have indicated that players within the Steelers organization have made it known they want Rodgers back for another season, praising his leadership and respect inside the locker room.\n\nEven though his return is considered unlikely, the organization remains open to a reunion, and the decision may hinge on whom the Steelers hire as their next head coach. Names like Mike McCarthy, who holds previous ties to Rodgers, have surfaced in early coaching search discussions.\n\nRodgers, who turns 43 in 2026 and previously suggested he might retire after the 2025 season, has not ruled out continuing in the NFL, but Tomlin’s departure has shifted the narrative.\n\nFor Pittsburgh to persuade him to stay, the Steelers may have to align their coaching search with someone Rodgers trusts and respects, potentially reviving momentum for his return under a familiar voice.\n\nTom Brady’s honest reaction to Aaron Rodgers potentially retiring from NFL\n\nTroy Aikman makes Aaron Rodgers prediction during Steelers’ loss to Texans\n\nAaron Rodgers gets honest about potential retirement after Pittsburgh Steelers playoff exit",

    "fullText": "The scenario: Ninth against second. Both teams are hard to beat. Union have gone undefeated in five Bundesliga games in a row for the first time this season, Borussia in 11. BVB have lost only one of their last 26 Bundesliga games across this season and last (away to Bayern on Matchday 7) and have 39 points after 18 matchdays – two more than at the same stage of their championship-winning 2011/12 season.\n\nHome & away: Union have picked up 13 of their 24 points at their own stadium, celebrating victories against VfB Stuttgart, RB Leipzig and Borussia Mönchengladbach at the Alte Försterei and picking up a point against Bayern Munich, among others. BVB are now second in the away table, having won four of their nine away games so far (plus four draws and one defeat).\n\nHead-to-head: BVB have won eight of the last ten encounters. There has never been a draw in this fixture in the top flight; BVB have played no other club so often without ever sharing the points (13 encounters to date). So far, the team that scored the first goal in the game has always won! Union celebrated their first ever Bundesliga win against Borussia (3-1 on 21 August 2019), but also suffered their heaviest Bundesliga defeat (6-0 in February 2022 in Dortmund). The Irons have lost nine times to Borussia Dortmund and have also conceded the most goals against BVB (34).\n\nStatistics: Borussia Dortmund have scored three goals in each of their three Bundesliga matches in 2026 (3-3 in Frankfurt, 3-0 against Bremen and 3-2 against St. Pauli). Nine different players scored: Beier, Nmecha, Chukwuemeka, Schlotterbeck, Sabitzer, Guirassy, Brandt, Adeyemi and Can. Union Berlin have had more attempted headers on goal than any other team in the league (52) and don't leave themselves exposed: they have conceded just one goal from a counter-attack. Only one team has done better in this regard: BVB (who have yet to concede from a counter-attack).\n\nLast season: 22,000 spectators, a sold-out stadium and an electric atmosphere at the Alte Försterei. A few days after a 7-1 rout of Celtic in the Champions League, Borussia tried hard but lacked ideas and punch, while Union were sharp and consistent, deservedly leading 2-0 at half-time thanks to goals from Kevin Vogt (26th minute, penalty) and Yorbe Vertessen (45th minute). After the break, BVB improved significantly and pulled one back after an hour through Julian Ryerson. Union then focused purely on defending their lead and managed to hold on to win 2-1.\n\nBiggest away win: The first of only two away wins at Union to date was the most convincing. On Matchday 22 of the 2021/22 season, BVB took advantage of their first two chances in a hard-fought game, with Marco Reus (18/26) scoring both goals to give his side a 2-0 lead. In the second half, Union increased the pressure in front of the 10,000 spectators allowed to attend during the Coronavirus pandemic, but Raphael Guerreiro sealed the win with a third goal 20 minutes before the end.",

    "description": "Despite Dana White's firm stance, Michael Chandler officially won't move on until Conor McGregor is \"announced against somebody else.\"",
    "fullText": "Call it determination or call it delusion, Michael Chandler refuses to accept that he's no longer in play as Conor McGregor's UFC comeback opponent.\n\nAfter being positioned as the opponent McGregor (22-6 MMA, 10-4 UFC) would face in his first fight since July 2021 for the better part of three years, Chandler's (23-10 MMA, 2-5 UFC) hopes to share an octagon with \"The Notorious\" took a massive hit this week when UFC CEO Dana White said he's no longer interested in booking that fight.\n\nChandler admits he was disappointed to hear those comments after displaying extreme patience and understanding throughout the process. However, after digesting what was said, he still isn't ready to give up entirely that the fight will happen at the UFC White House event slated for June 14.\n\n\"My reaction is: We will see. We'll see how this whole thing plays out,\" Chandler said Wednesday on \"The Ariel Helwani Show.\" \"Obviously nobody has any idea what the fights are going to be on the White House card. It is going to be the biggest card ever assembled, whether it be the biggest fights or obviously the biggest venue. We'll see. Is that 100 percent how it's going to be, me and Conor not fighting at the White House? I don't know. All I know is I can control what I can control, and that's me doing exactly what I've been doing since Day 1 in this sport.\n\n\"Obviously it's not encouraging. It's not great to hear. But I've also heard many things that were not encouraging that turned out to be not true or just flat-out false. So we just keep on going. Until the fights get announced, until Conor McGregor gets announced, his next opponent, and until I do or do not get announced as his next opponent, or do or do not get announced as being on the White House card, until then, all we can just do is hope and pray.\"\n\nChandler isn't sure what he can say or do to switch the narrative back in his favor. He will attend UFC 324 on Saturday in Las Vegas and said he would be open to a face-to-face conversation with White to better understand why he was taken off the board.\n\nA former three-time Bellator champion and one-time UFC title challenger, Chandler thinks he is still the most viable fight for McGregor and would create the most interest for fans. He hopes White will soon see that again, too.\n\n\"It's a fight that just makes so much sense,\" Chandler said. \"It's an explosive fight. It's an exciting fight. I think I'm his top choice, he's my top choice, that's the fight that we want. I don't have a Plan B. I don't have a Plan B until Plan A is 100 percent exhausted. That's kind of where we're at. That's the plan, fighting at the White House, fighting Conor at the White House until that train gets completely derailed. The only way it's going to get derailed is him getting announced against somebody else at the White House, or me getting announced against somebody at the White House. So, we'll see.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Michael Chandler reacts to Dana White nixing Conor McGregor fight",

    "description": "RUGBY’S GREATEST RIVALRY: As the two heavyweight nations prepare to clash in Baltimore in September, Harry Latham-Coyle lays out the landscape as rugby chases the American dream",
    "fullText": "One’s knowledge of Baltimore may depend upon how recently – or, indeed, if at all – you have watched The Wire, but for Springboks and All Blacks fans, the Maryland city will soon be put more emphatically on the map. Come 12 September, officials at World Rugby, SA Rugby and New Zealand Rugby (NZR) will hope to be celebrating a sell-out at the M&T Bank Stadium after an ambitious decision to host the fourth and final Test of the inaugural “Rugby’s Greatest Rivalry” series at the ground.\n\nIt is an announcement that will be greeted with elevated eyebrows around the rugby world. After three Tests on South African soil – two in Johannesburg, one in Cape Town – had been confirmed for the landmark series, speculation had been rife as to the until-now undisclosed location for the fourth encounter. Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium, a ground the Springboks have successfully transformed before, might have felt an obvious fit, but concerns over event saturation with the Nations Championship finals looming at the venue ruled it out. Discussions are understood to have been had over Dublin’s Croke Park, the Principality Stadium in Cardiff and even Seville; but, as rugby prepares to fully chase an American dream ahead of the 2031 and 2033 World Cups, Baltimore emerged as a surprising standout option.\n\n“We were approached by a promoter who asked if we would be interested in moving the game to America,” Rian Oberholzer, chief executive of SA Rugby, explains. “It made some sense because as part of World Rugby we agreed on the rugby expansion into America, and the request of World Rugby to take some of our fixtures and events in to the American market.\n\n“It made sense for New Zealand and South Africa to take this one to America, and Baltimore specifically because they are keen to establish themselves as a potential host for the 2031 World Cup in America. That is why they put their hand up.”\n\nBaltimore is one of 27 cities interested in hosting games at the 2031 World Cup, with World Rugby beginning to think about whittling down to a chosen few. At a capacity of 71,000, the M&T Bank Stadium – home of the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens – is about the right size for this game, with an East Coast location favoured for ease of travelling from Johannesburg and elsewhere. If not quite a Twickenham turnout, it is hoped that a South African diaspora numbering 139,322 (as of 2022) will make their presence known, too.\n\n“It came at the right time for us to be able to take a game to America,” Oberholzer says. “We have huge support from Nike and Coca Cola, who are sponsors. There is a South African contingent in America who we believe would like to see the Boks play. If we can establish ourselves as one of the foreign teams in America in 2031 World Cup to be supported by the new American supporters, then we will have achieved what have set out to achieve.”\n\nMost of the world’s top nations will play fixtures in the United States between now and that men’s World Cup. England took on the USA in Washington DC last year, while the All Blacks and Ireland’s clash at Soldier Field in November was a considerable draw, with tickets said to have been sold to buyers in all 50 states and several Canadian provinces. That game was not without its problems, though, from a messy presentation both in-ground and out to a surface that did not seem up to scratch. SA Rugby and their counterparts have taken lessons from that game and hope to produce an occasion with more of a prestige feel.\n\nMore beyond their control may be the geopolitical situation, and the whims of Washington. Oberholzer and other key figures have discussed the matter both internally and with South African politicians, and are not unduly concerned.\n\n“We don’t want to start something that will be an embarrassment for the American government or the South African government,” the SA Rugby CEO stresses. “We are comfortable that we have taken the necessary precautions. We’re trusting World Rugby. They’ve thought long and hard about asking us to bring the game there and supporting us, looking into the consequences. At this moment in time, we are very comfortable that there will not be an issue.”\n\nThe goal of growing the game – either commercially or otherwise – in the United States is admirable, but Oberholzer is frank and forthright on why this fixture exists at all. Like most unions, he and SA Rugby are preparing for a World Cup year in 2027 in which their finances take a substantial hit with fewer home fixtures, and the knock-on impacts that has. “This game was always about finding an option where we could make as much financial gain as we could,” Oberholzer says, aided by a confidential contribution from World Rugby.\n\n“We understand the challenges all of us will have in the World Cup year of 2027. We only have three international fixtures [at home], which affects sponsorship and affects broadcast rights. We have to make as much money as we can out of this season and this series so that us and New Zealand can have a bit of a buffer going into 2027.”\n\nIf it is commercially imperative to play more Tests, it is vital that player welfare is managed, too. While all nations are dealing with the issues of a crowded calendar, South Africa are particularly acutely afflicted, dealing as they do with a European club schedule and participation in southern hemisphere international competitions.\n\nOberholzer is an advocate – like Rassie Erasmus, his Springboks supremo – of moving the Rugby Championship closer to the Six Nations window, and hopes that there may soon be progress on a global season that the men’s game has long sought to introduce.\n\nIt is a busy year of international action headlined by the new Nations Championship; South Africa will host England, Wales and Scotland in July before this series begins in August.\n\nOberholzer however dismissed any fears of this fixture becoming something of a sideshow after three thunderous Tests on home soil. “I don’t foresee it will be seen as a festival match when the two play in Baltimore. I don’t think there will ever be a NZ-SA game that will not be high intensity and a must-win.”\n\nTo borrow from Baltimore’s best TV show, the warning to New Zealand might be that if they come for the kings, they best not miss.",

    "fullText": "With Super Bowl LX nearly two weeks away, five finalists have been announced for the 2025 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nAfter a campaign in which Christian McCaffrey suited up for every game and posted a career-high 413 touches from scrimmage, the San Francisco 49ers running back is a heavy favorite to comeaway with the award.\n\nHere are the latest NFL odds ahead of the annual NFL Honors ceremony, scheduled for February 5 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco.\n\n• Over the last seven years, the NFL CPOY Award has been handed out to a quarterback.\n\n• From 2014 to 2018, every Comeback Player of the Year had suffered a season-ending injury during the previous year, and Alex Smith won in 2020 after recovering from a devastating leg injury that almost required amputation.\n\n• Joe Burrow joins Chad Pennington (2006 and 2008) as the only player to win this award twice.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when wagering on NFL awards betting odds.\n\nSportsbooks will adjust NFL awards odds as the season goes on. In the preseason and the early weeks of the regular season, betting on dark horses can prove very profitable. As the season continues, expect to see odds tighten around the favorites. At that point, it becomes wise to focus on the players near the top of the odds board, and betting big underdogs is unwise.\n\nLive long shots can provide tremendous value. Look at younger players on the verge of breaking out, or guys that have already been playing at a high level but could take the next step now that they are in an ideal situation with a new team, coach, or system. Other players that can give a great payout are established stars coming off underperforming seasons due to injuries or other factors.\n\nWhen placing futures bets on individual awards, keep in mind that voters, not a scoreboard, are often the deciding factor. Voters can be influenced by a variety of factors, including media coverage and public opinion. Consider what the media narrative is for a particular season and which players they seem to be rooting for and against.\n\nHistorical trends, especially recent ones, can give you a good idea of which way voters tend to lean. For example, the NFL MVP has been handed out to a quarterback in 14 of the last 15 seasons. Identifying those trends is a good way to separate the true contenders from the pretenders.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "The Ravens coaching search is off and running, and after interviewing 17 candidates, owner Steve Bisciotti has narrowed it down to a final group. Anthony Weaver, Joe Brady, and Jesse Minter have all had second interviews, while Bisciotti could be waiting on a coach from a conference championship team to also interview.\n\nMinter was on the Ravens' coaching staff from 2017-20, beginning as a defensive assistant, then promoted to assistant defensive backs coach and, in 2020, to defensive backs coach. He was scheduled to interview for the Browns head coaching job on Thursday, but Mary Kay Cabot reports that Minter canceled that interview.\n\nBreaking: #Chargers DC Jesse Minter is not interviewing for the #Browns HC job today as scheduled, likely because he feels like he has other HC opportunities that are more certain, sources tell clevelanddotcom.\n\n— Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) January 22, 2026\n\nMinter then succeeded current Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald as Michigan's defensive coordinator when Macdonald joined the Ravens in 2022. After winning a national title in 2023, Minter followed Jim Harbaugh to the Chargers, and his defenses have earned respect around the league as Los Angeles is tied for second in interceptions (15) and tied for eighth in takeaways (18).\n\nThe search is wide-ranging and will still include interviews with 49ers DC Robert Saleh, Rams Passing Game Coordinator Nathan Scheelhaase, Ex-Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel, Rams DC Chris Shula, and Bills OC Joe Brady.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ravens Wire: Ravens head coaching search: Jesse Minter cancels Browns interview",

    "fullText": "Bills fans start petition to bring back Sean McDermott originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's safe to say Buffalo Bills fans were largely surprised at Sean McDermott being fired after nine seasons under the headset. There are certainly arguments to be made that it was time for the Bills to find a new voice and new leadership, but the pushback from the fanbase has come after the Bills kept general manager Brandon Beane, and even promoted him to President of Football Operations on the same day McDermott was fired.\n\nThis comes after several swings and misses in the draft, as well as Beane's inability to put a good No. 1 receiver around Josh Allen since trading Stefon Diggs in 2024. In light of these decisions, Bills fans have gone to extreme lengths to voice their frustrations with the organization, with many signing a petition to bring McDermott back as head coach.\n\nAt the time of writing, the petition, put together by Maria Maisonet, has over 25,000 signatures.\n\n\"I've been a lifelong Buffalo Bills fan for over 40 years, and the recent decision to fire Sean McDermott has left me and countless others heartbroken and baffled,\" Maisonet writes. \"Sean McDermott has not only been a strategic mastermind behind our team's recent successes, but he has also been an inspiring leader with a deep commitment to the Buffalo community. Under McDermott’s leadership, the Bills have experienced a remarkable transformation. He revitalized the team's performance and reignited the passion of the fans. Notably, he led the Buffalo Bills to the playoffs multiple times after a lengthy drought, bringing a renewed sense of hope and excitement to a community that lives and breathes football. His coaching style and strategic insight have been pivotal in shaping a competitive and spirited team that made us proud...\"\n\nThe Bills certainly aren't going to just re-hire McDermott, but a vocal part of the fanbase is angry with the decision, which puts even more pressure on Beane and owner Terry Pegula to hire the right guy who will bring immediate success.\n\nBuffalo Bills wide receiver defends Keon Coleman after Terry Pegula's disparaging comments\n\nJosh Allen may need surgery to repair lingering injury\n\nBuffalo Bills disaster press conference unmasked a franchise in freefall\n\nCommanders predicted to make massive trade for $106 million defender\n\nMessy details emerge on Sean McDermott's fractured relationship with Buffalo Bills GM Brandon Beane",

    "fullText": "England slipped to a 19-run defeat against Sri Lanka in the opening ODI on Thursday.\n\nSri Lanka capitalised on home conditions and superior bowling to take a 1-0 lead in the series.\n\nCaptain Harry Brook admitted his side were second best on the day, praising Sri Lanka’s performance while acknowledging that losing the toss played a key role.\n\nEngland’s spinners performed strongly through the middle overs, but their batting failed to build on a promising start in the chase of 272.\n\nIt was a frustrating result for a side eager to set the tone early in the three-match series.\n\nSpeaking after the loss, Brook was quick to credit Sri Lanka for a complete performance, while pointing out that batting second had made life difficult on a turning pitch.\n\n“It [the toss] was very crucial at the end, but Sri Lanka played a very good game there and deserved to take the victory,” the England captain said, via Sky Sports.\n\nBrook praised the way his bowlers performed through the middle stages, particularly his spinners, who managed to keep the hosts in check until Jamie Overton’s expensive final over.\n\n“I thought we bowled really well through the middle – the spinners bowled exceptionally well. Obviously, they got hold of us in the last over, but that’s part of white-ball cricket,” he added.\n\nEngland were undone by Sri Lanka’s spin attack when it came to their chase, and Brook admitted his side struggled to find answers against the variation of the home bowlers.\n\n“They’re a very good side, they’ve got some extremely good spinners as well. They were getting enough out of the surface to be able to get us to miss the ball,” Brook concluded.\n\nBatting first after winning the toss, Sri Lanka posted 271 for 6 from their 50 overs, with Kusal Mendis anchoring the innings with an unbeaten 93 off 117 balls.\n\nJanith Liyanage added 46 and Kamil Mishara contributed 27 as the hosts built a solid total.\n\nEngland’s spinners impressed: Adil Rashid took 3 for 44, while Liam Dawson kept things tight with figures of 1 for 31.\n\nHowever, a late flourish in the final overs lifted Sri Lanka to a competitive score.\n\nIn reply, England were bowled out for 252 in 49.2 overs, despite promising knocks from Ben Duckett (62 off 76) and Joe Root (61 off 90).\n\nOverton offered late resistance with a quick-fire 34 from 17 balls, but it wasn’t enough to see his side over the line.\n\nSri Lanka’s bowlers, led by Pramod Madushan (3-39), Jeffrey Vandersay (2-39), and Dunith Wellalage (2-41), kept England’s middle order quiet.\n\nThe result leaves England trailing 1-0 in the three-match series, with Brook urging his team to respond quickly and show greater resolve in the second ODI.",

Specifically with All-Star hopeful Michael Porter Jr.\n\nAfter being traded from the Denver Nuggets to Brooklyn this offseason, Porter Jr. has become a number-one option for a team for the first time in his career. This has made him a player who's been brought up in rumors. Let's take a look.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors have been teams to watch in a trade involving the Nets' forward, but these talks have slowed down.\n\n\"It no longer appears as if pursuing Porter is a path the Warriors would like to go down in the wake of Butler's injury,\" Brett Siegel of ClutchPoints said. \"The Los Angeles Lakers possibly throwing their hat in the mix for Porter isn't a realistic possibility and something they don't have a desire to do, sources said.\"\n\nAlthough Michael Porter Jr. is on pace for career-highs in points (25.3), rebounds (7.4), and assists (3.2) this season, the contract that is linked to him has made teams uninterested in trading for the 27-year-old.\n\nPorter Jr. has two years remaining on the five-year, $179.2 million deal he signed back in 2021 with the Nuggets.\n\nIt's looking like neither team is interested in picking up the contract of Porter Jr., so a trade is looking less and less likely.\n\nNets take tanking to the next level, ending 10-year drought with this horrific stat\n\nWill the Nets trade Cam Thomas at the NBA trade deadline?\n\nJordi Fernandez demands better physicality from Brooklyn Nets rookie Egor Demin\n\nWarriors trade idea swaps Jonathan Kuminga for 25.7 PPG scorer in All-Star conversation",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa are monitoring the situation of Fulham attacker Harry Wilson ahead of the winter transfer window deadline, according to the BBC. Aston Villa manager Unai Emery wants to bolster his options in the final third at the Villa Park club and would love to sign the Wales international. Wilson is out of contract at the end of the season, and Fulham are desperate to get the 28-year-old to extend his deal. However, the Villans target prefers to get clarity on the future of Fulham head coach Marco Silva, who is also out of contract in the summer, before deciding over any new deal.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Craven Cottage club will be open to selling Wilson this window, but he could be available for a decent fee if they do. He will be a free agent at the end of the season if he does not extend his deal and more clubs will join the Villans if he becomes available by then. The former Liverpool star has been involved in 13 goals so far this term, with eight goals and five assists to his name in 25 games. Wilson ended last term with six goals and two assists in 25 league games and Villa could do with his quality and experience as they target a top-four finish this season.\n\nGetting him this window could prove tricky for the Midlands club as Fulham are unlikely to be open to losing such a player midway through the season. Villa will also be facing competition from the likes of Brentford, Everton and Crystal Palace for Wilson if he becomes available by any chance this month.\n\nThey have signed Brazilian forward Alysson from Gremio in a £10 million deal, while Leon Bailey has been recalled from his loan at AS Roma, with Donyell Malen joining the Serie A club.",

He has not given up on a fight he has been waiting years to make happen. But while he waits, there could be another opportunity taking shape over in the wrestling world.\n\nChandler has not fought since his loss to Paddy Pimblett in April 2024, but he recently stepped back into combat sports by returning to his wrestling background.\n\nThe 39-year-old made his debut with Real American Freestyle earlier this month, picking up a win over Chad Mendes at the promotion’s fifth event.\n\nHe seems intent on staying active under the RAF banner, and a new opportunity has already come up. UFC lightweight contender Arman Tsarukyan has called him out for a match.\n\nSpeaking on The Ariel Helwani Show, he said: “I saw somebody comment the other day, ‘Man, Arman’s done a really good job of staying relevant during this time.’ I get it. He talks about everybody. He’s saying my name.\n\n“One thing I will say about Arman, the dude has stayed busy with these grappling matches. I watched him wrestle live at RAF; he did a great job there.\n\n“I think I am interested (in facing Tsarukyan). My plan A, the one thing I’m focused on, is fighting at the White House.\n\n“His future is somewhat up in the air. Mine’s up in the air as well, but less up in the air than his is.\n\n“Who knows. But yeah, I’ll wrestle against him.”\n\nTsarukyan’s next wrestling match may not be against Chandler.\n\nTalks are reportedly underway for a potential bout with Dustin Poirier, which would take place under the Hype FC banner.\n\nNo further details have emerged since Hype FC CEO Armand Martirosian first mentioned the discussions in an interview on Jason Takhtadjian’s YouTube channel.\n\nPoirier and Chandler have their own history, having faced off at Madison Square Garden back in late 2022. ‘The Diamond’ came out on top that night at UFC 281 and later accused Chandler of fish-hooking during the bout",

    "fullText": "Josh Jacobs, the Green Bay Packers running back, and Ash Kash have become the subjects of dating rumors following the emergence of a video that appeared to feature the two.\n\nJacobs uploaded this video to Snapchat. In this video, Jacobs can be seen walking on the beach with their hands joined together. However, this video went viral, which sparked rumors that Jacobs is in a relationship.\n\nAsh Kaash and Packers RB Josh Jacobs are reportedly dating\n pic.twitter.com/oymQmQm2F8\n\n— FearBuck (@FearedBuck) January 22, 2026\n\nNeither Jacobs nor Kash has made any public comments regarding their relationship.\n\nMost people who shared their opinions on social media had negative views about the video.\n\nOne such comment read, “I don’t get some athletes, maybe that’s why they are so good. Bittersweet life.” Another comment was, “There are grad schools all over America full of good women aged 24-42. These athletes are overreacting.”\n\nSome also asked how well they knew each other. For instance, someone commented, “NBA and NFL players love to date the same people.” There was also a joke about Jacobs’ performance. The joke was, “So this is why he’s been playing poorly. She drained his powers.”\n\nAnother comment referenced the dating lives of athletes in general. “Athletes are the easiest targets,” a woman wrote. A man commented that he would find a suitable, humble person with the amount of money he would have, and made fun of Kash.\n\nJacobs has been to two Pro Bowls and has been one of the best running backs in the NFL over the past few years. Jacobs currently plays for the Green Bay Packers, signing in 2024 after six years in Las Vegas. Ash Kash, also known as Ashaley, is a popular Instagram and TikTok personality.\n\nThe alleged couple has not commented on the rumors.\n\nThe post Josh Jacobs Sparks Dating Rumors With Ash Kash After Posting Beach Video Holding Hands appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.",

    "fullText": "Dortmund took a large (and loud) away contingent to London for this midweek tie that would see the winner jump to the automatic qualification spots. Thomas Frank’s Spurs came into it on the back of five winless games, with stale displays seeing ever-increasing numbers of fans voice their discontent with his management. By contrast, we had only lost one in our last twelve and, while our own game wasn’t much to write home about, it was effective enough that one might reasonably expect us to win this one.\n\nUnfortunately, we started on the back foot and never quite got off it, as the hosts headed into the break two goals and a man up. Niko Kovac attempted to steady his obviously shaken troops, making two defensive changes at half time, and while Spurs looked far less threatening, our offensive play remained non-existent, with our first (and only) shot on target a Nico Schlotterbeck header in the 91st minute. A well-deserved loss, then, and a huge missed opportunity. Here are your match ratings.\n\nNot much he could’ve done about the two he conceded. Stood up well to Kolo Muani’s late chance.\n\nGets a point extra for his very obvious desire to keep going even after several of his teammates’ heads had dropped. Timing of the challenge was often poor.\n\nPossibly the only defender to leave this game without a serious blot on his copybook.\n\nReally struggled with the pacy Odobert after Svensson’s sending off, didn’t cover himself in glory today.\n\nI have no idea what he contributed.\n\nOne of the first players to lose steam after the second goal. Made several careless errors.\n\nStarted brightly, but looked increasingly lost as the game wore on.\n\nUnfortunately, can’t really have complaints about the red. It put us in an awful position, which Spurs really exploited.\n\nThe red card left him marooned on the left wing, chasing the shadows of quicker players without support.\n\nShould really have done better on the break in the first half, but I can’t fault him for his second 45; he had absolutely no support up there.\n\nDidn’t press, didn’t run, didn’t even look interested in trying to contribute.\n\nAdded some spine to the midfield.\n\nGets a six simply because of the insane work rate he demonstrated immediately after coming on. Was clearly up for it and I could imagine things being very different if he’d started up top. A must-start.\n\nSpurs were (unexpectedly) legitimately good today and good value for their win. We, by contrast, looked stunned from the get-go and never really got going, with Svensson’s red card effectively sealing our fate. Several poor individual performances were compounded by an apparent lack of belief post the red, making the rest of the game more or less a formality. It’s clear to me that, while a hard worker, Bellingham lacks the requisite nous for this level, and Couto cannot be relied upon to consistently perform. The final player I’m going to single out is Serhou Guirassy, who once again provided zero industry up front; I have no problem with a striker not scoring when he isn’t receiving service, but he really has to have a bit more grit about him and a much better first touch. Fabio Silva looked miles ahead when he came on.\n\nOverall, Kovac’s approach was typically pragmatic, but one has to wonder if things might’ve been different had he reacted better to the red. Shifting to a 4-4-1 resulted in Bensebaini going up against a winger he had no hope of catching and relegated Brandt to a spectator’s role, especially without the more active Silva to make things happen up top. It also put a whole lot of responsibility on the as-yet unready Bellingham and forced Adeyemi into an unnatural wide position. After the substitutions at half, the team was entirely rudderless going forward, as Adeyemi was tasked with making something out of absolutely nothing all on his own. Things improved marginally after Carney and Silva came on, but nowhere near enough for us to even dream of a point. Once, more I’m left wondering if Kovac has the ability to really inspire a team to rally against adversity; we seem more likely to lose from a winning position than win from a losing one, and that was on full display today.",

    "description": "Bad news for Philly.",
    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles are losing passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach Christian Parker. Not ideal.\n\nEven worse, he’s joining the Dallas Cowboys as their new defensive coordinator. This much according to a report from NFL insider Tom Pelissero.\n\nWe knew this outcome was possible; Parker recently drew DC interviews from Dallas and the Green Bay Packers. Really, the Eagles were fortunate to be able to retain him for 2025 after he drew interest from the New Orleans Saints last year.\n\nLosing Parker was likely inevitable. Losing him to a division rival isn’t very fun. Unless he proves to be a double agent, which I wouldn’t count on.\n\nWe previously touched on Parker’s value:\n\nThe 34-year-old Parker has a strong track record of getting the best out of his players. He notably oversaw the development of Patrick Surtain II with the Denver Broncos before coming to Philly and coaching Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean to All-Pro status in their second seasons.\n\nThe Eagles have had one of the best defenses in the NFL since they hired him along with Vic Fangio during the 2024 offseason. The team would probably like to retain him, especially since he could potentially be a Fangio successor one day. But it’s quite possible — if not outright likely — that Parker will be poached before that can happen.\n\nIt’s possible that Parker is a good position coach but not a good defensive coordinator. And Dallas has a long way to go in remaking their talent on that side of the ball after it was such a disastrous unit under Matt Eberflus in 2025.\n\nBut it’ll be pretty annoying for the Eagles if Parker helps the Cowboys turn things around in a big way.\n\nAnyway, it remains to be seen how the Birds will replace Parker. They currently have a cornerbacks coach in Roy Anderson and a safeties coach in Joe Kasper. Will there be an internal promotion or will they look to make an external hire? Perhaps a combination of both if there’s some backfilling to be done? We’ll see.",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of writers, musicians and performers urge licensing deals instead of scraping creative work\n\nScarlett Johansson, Cate Blanchett, REM and Jodi Picoult are among hundreds of Hollywood stars, musicians and authors backing a new campaign accusing AI companies of “theft” of their work.\n\nThe “Stealing Isn’t Innovation” drive launched on Thursday with the support of approximately 800 creative professionals and bands. The campaign includes a statement accusing tech firms of using American creators’ work to “build AI platforms without authorisation or regard for copyright law”.\n\nIt adds: “Artists, writers, and creators of all kinds are banding together with a simple message: Stealing our work is not innovation. It’s not progress. It’s theft – plain and simple.”\n\nThe statement urges AI companies to pursue licensing deals and partnerships with the creative industries and acknowledges firms that have taken that route. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has signed deals with content owners including Disney and the Guardian, while Warner Music Group has struck a licensing deal with AI music generator Suno.\n\nHowever, copyright remains one of the most contentious issues within AI, because the models that power chatbots like ChatGPT or image generators like Grok Imagine rely on vast amounts of data taken from the open web in order to help create their responses. Creative professionals argue that tech firms should seek their permission before using such material – and that they should receive a payment if they give their consent.\n\nOpenAI, and other AI firms, have argued that using material available online is “fair use”, a US legal doctrine that allows use of copyright-protected work without the owner’s permission in certain circumstances. As of last year, dozens of lawsuits had been launched in the US over the AI and copyright issue.\n\nJohansson was dragged into the AI debate in 2024 after OpenAI’s voice assistant used her vocal likeness, prompting the actor say she was “shocked, angered and in disbelief” by the move. OpenAI subsequently removed the voice from ChatGPT.\n\nOther signatories to the statement include actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and singer Cyndi Lauper. Last year Gilligan described AI as the “world’s most expensive and energy-intensive plagiarism machine”.\n\nThe “Stealing Isn’t Innovation” push has been organised by the Human Artistry Campaign, whose backers include the Writers Guild of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the actors’ trade union SAG-AFTRA, which went on strike in 2023, partly over the use of AI.\n\nIn the UK, the government has been under fire for proposing that AI firms should be allowed to use copyright-protected work without first seeking artists’ permission, unless they signal that they wish to “opt out” of the process. The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said this month that the government was seeking a “reset” on these plans via an official review due to be published in March.",

    "fullText": "Estimate made by Center for Countering Digital Hate after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked outrage\n\nGrok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appear to depict children, according to researchers who said it “became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material”.\n\nThe estimate has been made by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked international outrage when it allowed users to upload photographs of strangers and celebrities, digitally strip them to their underwear or into bikinis, put them in provocative poses and post the images on X.\n\nThe trend went viral over the new year, peaking on 2 January with 199,612 individual requests, according to analysis conducted by Peryton Intelligence, a digital intelligence company specialising in online hate.\n\nA fuller assessment of the output from the feature, from its launch on 29 December 2025 until 8 January 2026, has now been made by the CCDH. It suggests the impact of the technology may have been broader than previously thought. Public figures identified in sexualised images it analysed include Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, Christina Hendricks, Millie Bobby Brown, the Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and the former US vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe feature was restricted to paid users on 9 January and further restrictions followed after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful”. Other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, announced blocks on the AI tool.\n\nCCDH estimated that over the 11-day period, Grok was helping create sexualised images of children every 41 seconds. These included a selfie uploaded by a schoolgirl undressed by Grok, turning a “before school selfie” into an image of her in a bikini.\n\n“What we found was clear and disturbing: in that period Grok became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Stripping a woman without their permission is sexual abuse. Throughout that period Elon was hyping the product even when it was clear to the world it was being used in this way. What Elon was ginning up was controversy, eyeballs, engagement and users. It was deeply disturbing.”\n\nHe added: “This has become a standard playbook for Silicon Valley, and in particular for social media and AI platforms. The incentives are all misaligned. They profit from this outrage. It’s not about Musk personally. This is about a system [with] perverse incentives and no minimum safeguards prescribed in law. And until regulators and lawmakers do their jobs and create a minimum expectation of safety, this will continue to happen.”\n\nX announced it had stopped its Grok feature from editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes, including for premium subscribers, on 14 January.\n\nX referred to its statement from last week, which said: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.\n\n“We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”",

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

    "fullText": "Video game publisher to cancel Prince of Persia remake and close studios after several difficult years\n\nThe video game publisher behind the Assassin’s Creed series has cancelled six projects including a remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time as it fights to stay competitive in the global gaming market.\n\nUbisoft announced a sweeping reorganisation and said it would cancel six games, sending its shares to their lowest level in more than a decade on Thursday.\n\nUbisoft is abandoning development of six titles, including a highly anticipated remake of Prince of Persia – a series that dates back to 1989 and received an ill-fated Hollywood adaptation in 2010 – and delaying a further seven. Studios in Halifax, Canada and Stockholm are being closed, with restructuring to follow in other countries, it said.\n\nAfter the announcement, Ubisoft’s shares fell by a third to their lowest level since 2011 on Thursday, valuing the company at €590m (£514m) compared with a peak of more than €10bn in the previous decade. The Paris-based company said it planned to split its operations into five creative divisions organised by genre, part of a broader attempt to sharpen focus and rein in costs after years of disappointing releases and weak results.\n\nThe company said the restructuring was driven by the competitive market for AAA games, the term for big-budget, high-profile titles such as Grand Theft Auto.\n\n“The triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” said Ubisoft’s founder and chief executive, Yves Guillemot.\n\nHowever, Guillemot added that successful triple-A games have “more financial potential than ever”.\n\nUbisoft also blamed an “increasingly competitive market” for shooters, a key genre for the industry.\n\nLaurent Michaud, a gaming industry economist, said action adventure titles such as Prince of Persia were out of step with a market dominated currently by shooters like Fortnite and Call of Duty, cooperative adventure titles such as Peak and sports titles and multiplayer games such as those available on the Roblox platform.\n\n“The expectations of gamers are quite different to where they were 10 years ago. That’s why it’s difficult to keep in touch with an audience that has changed so much over the years.”\n\nHe added: “Ubisoft is still one of the most popular content providers in the video games industry. It has developed one of the best IP slates in the industry but even if the games are really good, it is not enough. It has to meet people’s expectations and tastes.”\n\nThe latest overhaul follows several difficult years marked by game delays, cancellations and weak execution, which have eroded investor confidence and strained the group’s finances. In November 2025, Ubisoft postponed the publication of its half-year results at the last minute, triggering a week-long suspension of trading in its shares and bonds. The company later said an accounting change had revealed a breach of the terms for its debt.",

Take people from similar countries, which I suppose means Canada and Australia?\n\n5. Take people with graduate degrees.\n\nI will not evaluate those one-by-one, only to note they are not the very worst standards you might apply.  Instead, I have a new idea, which consists of two parts.  Apply strict (but not low “n”) standards for admission and then:\n\n6. Take people from populous countries with high cognitive variance, and\n\n7. All other things equal, prefer people from very distant countries.\n\nThat in essence suggests taking in people from China, India, and Russia, which are indeed countries with high cognitive variance.  And today that is quite possibly the right thing to do.  You will note that none of those countries count as especially high trust, and India at least has very mixed IQ readings, I am not sure about Russia given the rural idiocy there.\n\nTo understand that standard in more general terms, #6 gets you geniuses and the extremely ambitious.  They are the ones who can fight through your immigration thicket, and will be motivated to do so.  And because they are coming from screwed up countries, many of them will be quite keen to leave.  They also will be used to fighting very hard to get ahead, more so than a lot of the graduate students who might come from Sweden.\n\n#7 recognizes that a lot of people from nearby countries will come simply because it is convenient.  And because of “the gravity equation.”  So you should discriminate against them somewhat.  Note that because borders are somewhat porous, you are going to get a lot of them anyway.  That is OK, but you can then penalize them a bit in the standards process, in essence to get the same net “tax” on entry.  And because their home countries are nearby, they might be a little slower to assimilate.\n\nTo be clear this is a recipe for America in 2025.  A lot of other countries might do better opting for the boring Macedonian dentist, because they will not get top talent anyway.  Or America in 1770, when building out a core population, might have done well with what was in essence a version of #3, with a bit of #2 and #4.  Which is more or less what we did, though not by conscious design (borders were open).\n\nWorth a ponder.  These questions are underdiscussed.  I am not sure this proposal is the best idea, but it occurred to me it never has been presented before.",

    "description": "How I built automatic QR code footnotes so printed pages keep their links.",
    "fullText": "Philip I. Thomas sent me a mailed copy of his “Print Edition” post. I sat down in an armchair to read it, and found myself wanting to follow the links in the text. But I couldn’t - the blue underlined text was just text on paper.\n\nPhilip uses Lob to print and mail his issues, which includes a single QR code on the header/mailing page to direct the reader to the single source article. BUT I didn’t grok that at first (it’s not labeled as anything and I assumed it was errata from Lob) and I think there should be a general solution to this outside of using Lob.\n\nThis isn’t a new problem. Over a decade ago, I wrote about how The Great Discontent handled links in their first print issue - they used numbered footnotes with shortened URLs. Back then, I noted that QR codes felt “large and intrusive.” But they’ve become ubiquitous since, and at 64 pixels square they’re unobtrusive enough to include alongside each URL.\n\nI wanted to make link-following possible on my site. When someone prints one of my posts, I want them to still be able to follow the links I included.\n\nI wanted to take a similar approach to what Stripe Press does in its books (e.g. An Elegant Puzzle): footnotes with full links and QR codes.\n\nWhen you print any page on this site now, every link gets:\n\nThe L prefix distinguishes these from any regular footnotes on the page, and ties visually to the “[L]inks” header. Readers can either type the URL or scan the QR code with their phone to follow the link.\n\nThe implementation uses the browser’s beforeprint event to generate footnotes just before printing. The qrcodejs library is preloaded so it’s ready when needed:\n\nWhen printing is triggered, it collects all unique links from the page content, seeding the list with the current page URL as item 0:\n\nThe selector targets links within article content specifically - navigation, masthead, and footer links are already hidden in print via .print-hidden, so we skip those.\n\nFor each link, we add a superscript to the anchor (if it exists) and create a footnote entry:\n\nA few CSS details make this work:\n\nPrint-only visibility: The .print-only class hides elements on screen but shows them in print. The superscripts and footnotes section both use this.\n\nInline superscripts: The .print-only class uses display: block !important, so the superscript refs need display: inline !important to stay inline with the link text.\n\nList markers: Using display: flex on list items hides the default markers. Switching to display: list-item with explicit list-style-type: decimal brings them back.\n\nhref property vs attribute: The anchor.href property returns the fully resolved URL (e.g., https://example.com/page#section), while getAttribute('href') returns the raw attribute value (#section). Using the attribute makes it easy to filter out in-page anchor links.\n\nCSS display conflicts: The .print-only class uses display: block !important for print media. Superscript elements inside links need display: inline !important to stay inline with the link text rather than breaking to a new line.\n\nThis isn’t just for mailed print publications like Philip’s. I sometimes print web pages to archive on my physical bookshelf, or print recipes, instructions, and reference tables to use around the house. Others save web pages to PDF. In all these cases, the links in the original content become dead text unless you preserve them somehow.\n\nNow when someone prints an article from my site, the links stick around. They can scan a QR code or type a URL. The reference is preserved.",

    "description": "How Databricks built SAFE, our in-house feature flagging platform. Technical architecture, scaling challenges, and operational learnings.",
    "fullText": "Shipping software quickly while maintaining reliability is a constant tension. As Databricks has grown, so has the complexity of safely rolling out changes across hundreds of services, multiple clouds, and thousands of customer workloads. Feature flags help us manage this complexity by separating the decision to deploy code from the decision to enable it. This separation allows engineers to isolate failures and mitigate incidents faster, without sacrificing shipping velocity.\n\nOne of the key components of Databricks' stability posture is our in-house feature flagging and experimentation platform, called \"SAFE\". Databricks engineers use SAFE on a daily basis to rollout features, control service behavior dynamically, and measure the effectiveness of their features with A/B experiments.\n\nSAFE was started with the \"north star\" goal of fully decoupling service binary releases from feature enablement, allowing teams to roll out features independently from their binary deployment. This allows for many side-benefits, like the ability to reliably ramp-up a feature to progressively larger populations of users, and quickly mitigate incidents caused by a rollout.\n\nAt Databricks' scale, serving thousands of enterprise customers across multiple clouds with a rapidly growing product surface area, we needed a feature flagging system that could meet our unique requirements:\n\nAfter carefully considering these requirements, we ultimately opted to build a custom in-house feature flagging system. We needed a solution that could evolve alongside our architecture, and which would provide the governance controls required to safely manage flags across hundreds of services and thousands of engineers. Achieving our scaling and safety goals successfully required deep integration with our infrastructure data model, service frameworks, and CI systems.\n\nAs of late 2025, SAFE has approximately 25k active flags, with 4k weekly flag flips. At peak, SAFE runs over 300M evaluations per second, all while maintaining a p95 latency of ~10μs for flag evaluations.\n\nThis post explores how we built SAFE to meet these requirements and the learnings we've encountered along the way.\n\nTo start, we will discuss a typical user journey for a SAFE flag. At its core, a feature flag is a variable that can be accessed in a service's control flow which can take different values depending on conditions controlled from an external config. One extremely common use case for feature flags is to gradually enable a new code path in a controlled fashion, first starting with a small portion of traffic and gradually enabling globally.\n\nSAFE users first start by defining their flag in their service code, and use it as a conditional gate to the new feature's logic:\n\nThe user then goes to the internal SAFE UI and registers this flag and selects a template to roll out their flag. This template defines a gradual rampup plan consisting of a list of ordered stages. Each stage is ramped up slowly by percentages. The user is presented with a UI that looks like this once the flag has been created:\n\nFrom here, the user can either manually roll out their flag one stage at a time, or set up a schedule to have the flag flips be created on their behalf. Internally, the source of truth for the flag configuration is a jsonnet file checked in to the Databricks monorepo, that uses a lightweight domain-specific language (DSL) to manage the flag config:\n\nWhen users change a flag from the UI, the output of that change is a Pull Request that needs to be reviewed by at least one other engineer. SAFE also runs a variety of pre-merge checks to guard against unsafe or unintended changes. Once the change is merged, the user's service will pick up the change and start emitting the new value within 2-5 minutes of the PR being merged.\n\nAside from the use case described above for feature rollout, SAFE is also used for other aspects of dynamic service configuration, such as: long-lived dynamic configurations (e.g. timeouts or rate limits), state machine control for infrastructure migrations, or to deliver small configuration blobs (e.g. targeted logging policies).",

    "description": "LiveKit raised $100M at a $1B valuation from Index Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Hanabi Capital, Altimeter, and Redpoint Ventures.",
    "fullText": "Today, I get the privilege of announcing LiveKit’s Series C. With this funding round, we’ve reached an important milestone: a $1 billion valuation. Index Ventures is leading the $100M investment, joined by Salesforce Ventures, Hanabi Capital, and our longtime supporters Altimeter and Redpoint Ventures.\n\nTo our customers, users, OSS contributors, investors, and core team: thank you, we wouldn’t be here without you.\n\nVoice is the most natural interface we have—it’s the one we use with each other every day. And for the first time in history, we can interact with computers in the same way.\n\nWhen we announced our Series B in April 2025, voice AI had gone from a feature inside ChatGPT to thousands of applications across financial services, healthcare, retail, customer support, education, and robotics. Startups were building voice agents that could perform tasks like processing claims, tutoring students, triaging patients, supporting customers, and interviewing candidates.\n\nToday, large enterprises are evaluating and building voice agents to automate workflows, improve customer experiences, and unlock new revenue. While many of these use cases are still in the proof-of-concept stage, some are moving into production and operating at real scale: Agentforce voice agents run customer support for the world's top brands and Tesla uses voice AI for sales, support, insurance, and roadside assistance.\n\nWe anticipate 2026 will be the year voice AI will be broadly deployed across thousands of use cases around the world.\n\nBut there's still a lot to build to support this new paradigm of computing.\n\nVoice AI applications are not like web applications. The protocol underlying every web application is HTTP, which was designed for reliably moving text data between computers. Every HTTP request is independent and stateless, meaning that a web backend by default has no historic information. When needed, web applications load state from a database, which may take additional time.\n\nFor an application you can talk to like a person, traditional web infrastructure breaks.\n\nVoice AI applications are realtime and stateful. A conversation with a voice agent might last a few minutes or a few hours and the agent is continuously listening, thinking, and responding while maintaining context across the entire session.\n\nThat shift at the application layer, from using a keyboard and mouse to speaking with a voice agent, changes everything underneath. You can’t build your application the same way. You can’t test it the same way. You can’t deploy and run it the same way. You can’t monitor it the same way. The whole stack has to be rebuilt for realtime, stateful applications with human-native interfaces.\n\nWe’re building that stack. Every piece of it, designed to work together seamlessly.\n\nAgents are still applications, and like all applications, they go through a set of stages from design to production:\n\nLike web applications, voice AI applications have a frontend and a backend. To build the former, LiveKit offers client SDKs across every single platform.\n\nOn the backend, LiveKit Agents—modeled from our work on ChatGPT Voice Mode and downloaded over 1M times a month—gives you full programmatic control over agent orchestration, access to hundreds of AI model integrations, and automatically handles conversational dynamics like turn detection and interruptions.\n\nNot everyone wants to start in code though. Sometimes it’s preferable to quickly start from a template, tune your prompts or sketch out a workflow, and share a link with friends or colleagues—for that vibe, we recently launched Agent Builder.\n\nAI models are stochastic. Given the same input, they don't produce the same output, thus you can't write simple assertions against non-deterministic code. You have to test these systems statistically, the same way we evaluate human performance through exams and interviews.\n\nLiveKit Agents now includes support for writing unit tests against your agent code, and you can wire up traces to OpenTelemetry for deeper analysis.\n\nFor simulation (the AI version of an integration test), where a voice agent calls another voice agent and runs through thousands of conversations permuting prompt, language, and voice attributes to build statistical confidence in agent behavior, we've partnered with Bluejay, Hamming, and Roark. In parallel, we’re also exploring how to integrate simulation more directly into LiveKit’s platform.\n\nWhile deploying a web application and voice agent both involve pushing code to the cloud, the similarities end there. Your user might speak with an agent for an indeterminate amount of time and there may be unplanned spikes in demand across your user base. This requires a different approach for capacity, connection, and change management, load balancing, and failover. Earlier this year, we released serverless agents to make agent deployment turnkey for builders everywhere.\n\nVoice AI applications also require new network infrastructure, purpose-built for transporting voice data with as low latency as possible between your agent and wherever your users are located. We’ve built out a global network of data centers that act as a unified fabric optimized for routing voice and video data. Today, our network handles billions of calls a year between voice agents and users, across web and mobile applications and phone calls.\n\nRecently, we’ve partnered with telephony carriers around the world to link LiveKit’s network directly to the PSTN. This enables us to deliver the lowest latency experience when speaking to a voice agent over the phone.\n\nOnce your voice agent is on a live call, there are usually multiple models strung together for every conversational turn: speech-to-text, turn and interruption detection, LLM, and text-to-speech. These models may be running on the same server or data center as your agent code, but most of the time they’re accessed by your agent via cloud API from a model provider. Model providers host their models in different regions around the world, potentially far away from your agent. Sometimes a provider’s service gets backlogged and inference requests queue up, other times a provider’s service goes down. These orchestration challenges can negatively affect end-to-end latency, making agent conversations choppy and unreliable.\n\nLiveKit Inference abstracts away much of this complexity. The same system we built to monitor and route voice in real time can also route inference between model providers. We’ve also started to host our models across our data centers so they’re colocated with the agents you deploy to LiveKit Cloud.\n\nUntil we launched Agent Observability, there was no Datadog-equivalent built for voice agents—no way to truly understand how an agent and user are interacting on a live call. How long did it take for the agent to answer the call? What did the agent “hear” when the user specified the prescription drug they’ve been taking? Did the user press the “0” to speak to a human operator? What was the average turn latency across the call? Did the agent invoke the correct tool to schedule an appointment for the user?\n\nAnswering these questions through session replays, traces, time-aligned transcripts of conversations, and error logs is the critical final phase of the lifecycle. As a developer, armed with these learnings and insights, you can then go back to the Build step, modify your agent code, and run through another iteration.\n\nVoice is one of the biggest paradigm shifts in computing. It’s still early—and it starts where voice is already the interface: phone calls, cars, and smart speakers.\n\nOver the next few years, as new form factors emerge and models get better at turn-taking, tool use, and reliability, voice-native applications will move from novelty to default. Software will feel less like something you navigate, and more like something you delegate to.\n\nLiveKit is building the development stack and runtime between foundation models and end-user applications. Our goal is simple: make building and scaling voice AI as easy as building and scaling on the web.\n\nThis round helps us move faster. We’re excited to build the voice-driven era of computing with our customers, community, and partners.",

In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.\n\nCurrent commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver said then in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n\n“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”\n\nFor decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.\n\nYet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won the Premier League just about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.\n\nConcerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double as handy instruments to write off taxes for billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.\n\nLately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.\n\nThey can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.\n\nThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rules now tweaked to merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.\n\nMore tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)\n\nCertainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.\n\nAt least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.\n\nThat’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

    "fullText": "Pacific Life Insurance Company on Thursday asked a federal court to dismiss the $8.5 million lawsuit filed by NASCAR champion Kyle Busch and his wife over policies the Buschs claim were sold to them under false and negligent representations as tax-free income for retirement.\n\nThe filing in the Western District of North Carolina — the same court that just heard the Michael Jordan-led antitrust suit against NASCAR — alleges the Buschs purchased five separate Indexed Universal Life policies between 2018 and 2022 to provide more than $90 million in insurance protection for the two-time NASCAR champion.\n\nThe IUL policies were intended to provide immediate death benefit protection and “the opportunity to accumulate cash values when the policies are held for the long term.”\n\nPacific Life claims Busch failed to fully fund the policies, let some lapse and surrendered the others. Busch has claimed he is out $10.4 million and filed suit in October alleging Pacific Life failed to reveal the true risks of the policies.\n\nPacific Life countered in its request to have the suit dismissed that both Buschs signed multiple documents acknowledging they understood the policies, including one that indicated the couple would pay planned premiums and hold the policies over 30 years through age 70 and beyond.\n\n“Instead of keeping the policies long enough to capitalize on their growth potential, Plaintiffs failed to timely pay planned premiums, failed to monitor allocation of their policy values between indexed and fixed accounts and surrendered the policies or allowed them to lapse,” Pacific Life wrote in the filing. “Rather than accept responsibility for their own decisions, Plaintiffs now attempt to blame their negative outcome on the IUL product.”\n\nAn IUL is a combination life insurance policy that provides a death benefit with a cash value component. The cash value growth is tied to a stock market index, supposedly with built-in protections against market downturns.\n\nWhen he filed the suit last year, Busch said he was told that if he paid $1 million for five years, he would be able to take out $800,000 a year once he turned 52. Busch claims when he received a sixth premium notice he began asking questions and discovered almost all of his money was gone.\n\nPacific Life has countered that the Buschs acknowledged understanding the policies, but also that his claims for breach of fiduciary and negligent misrepresentation come seven years after he began purchasing the policies and are therefore outside the three-year statute of limitations.\n\n“A plaintiff cannot avoid the statute of limitations by remaining ‘willfully blind’: A man should not be allowed to close his eyes to the facts readily observable by ordinary attention, and maintain for his own advantage the position of ignorance,\" Pacific Life wrote. “Such a principle would enable a careless man, and by reason of his carelessness, to extend his right to recover for an indefinite length of time.”\n\nPacific Life also maintains that all of the Buschs claims on misrepresentation are false due to the “express, repeated disclosures\" they signed. Additionally, all five policies come with a cover letter that in bold capitalized letters says “READ YOUR POLICY CAREFULLY” and offered a 20-day cancelation window in which premiums would be refunded.\n\nBoth Buschs signed a form that certified they had received the policies and understood they must carefully review them, Pacific Life said.\n\nThe Buschs also named agent Rodney A. Smith in their lawsuit for steering the Buschs into an unsustainable, high-risk product, along with charging an up-front 35% commission they were unaware of.\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

Let's send it over to Yahoo Finance's Fed correspondent Jennifer Schonberger to break down the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Jen?\n\nHey there, Julia. Yep, crossing the wires right now. Personal consumption expenditures index on a core basis, clocking in year-over-year at 2.8%, month over month up two-10ths of a percent. That is right in line with expectations.\n\nNow, recall that this is a number that is delayed because of the government shutdown. And so the Bureau of Economic Analysis also had to do a bit of gymnastics to back into this number because it is combined for October and November, and for portions of October, they had to use the average of September and November figures.\n\nSo, we should probably take this with a little bit of a grain of salt as we did for other data measures for October and November previously. Having said that, 2.8%, it's uh closer to 3% than the Fed's 2% inflation goal and sitting right where it was at the beginning of the fall in September.\n\nSo, this certainly doesn't change the course for the Fed's meeting next Wednesday. And if anything, I think it solidifies it because you had the unemployment rate drop in December to 4.4%. There's really no reason for the Fed to cut at this point, especially given the three rate cuts that they did at the tail end of last year.",

    "description": "Two cases of Nipah virus, a rare, bat-borne pathogen, have been confirmed in an Indian hospital, prompting a nationwide alert as well as local quarantine and surveillance measures.",
    "fullText": "Two cases of Nipah virus, a rare, bat-borne pathogen, have been confirmed in an Indian hospital, prompting a nationwide alert as well as local quarantine and surveillance measures.\n\nThe cases, both in nurses working at the private Narayana Multispeciality Hospital in Barasat, West Bengal, 16 miles from the capital city Kolkata, have raised fears that the disease, which inspired the Hollywood film Contagion, could be spreading undetected.\n\n“Two nurses at a private hospital are infected with Nipah virus, and one of them is in critical condition,” Mr Narayan Swaroop Nigam, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, West Bengal, told The Telegraph.\n\nThe pair were on duty together between December 28 and 30. Between December 31 and January 2, they developed high fevers and respiratory distress and were admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit on January 4 after their conditions worsened.\n\nInitial investigations suggest that both nurses, one of whom is in a coma, caught the virus while treating a patient with severe respiratory symptoms who later died before testing could be carried out, sources at the hospital said.\n\n“The most likely source of infection is a patient who had been admitted to the same hospital previously. That individual is being treated as the suspected index case, and investigations are ongoing,” said a senior health official involved in West Bengal’s Nipah surveillance efforts.\n\nThe outbreak prompted the health authorities to impose quarantine and emergency surveillance  and contact tracing measures in the area.\n\nSo far 180 people have been tested and 20 high risk contacts quarantined.\n\n“All of them are asymptomatic and tested negative. We will again test them before their 21-day quarantine ends,” Mr Nigam said.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a nationwide alert, urging states to strengthen surveillance, detection, and preventive measures to reduce risk and prevent any further spread.\n\nIndia has faced sporadic outbreaks of Nipah in recent years. The virus lives in bats and can be passed to humans through contaminated food or by contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals. It can also jump from bats to pigs, opening up another route for onward transmission to people, where it spreads from person to person through droplets and saliva.\n\nThe virus has a fatality rate of up to 75 per cent and causes a range of symptoms, beginning with a fever, vomiting and fatigue before developing into respiratory issues and swelling of the brain. Neurological issues like encephalitis can appear months or years after an initial infection\n\nIn response to the new cases, several Indian states have directed their health authorities to strengthen surveillance for Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), a broad term for brain inflammation that can be caused by Nipah infection.\n\n“Persons admitted with AES, particularly those with travel or contact history linked to West Bengal, should be closely monitored and evaluated for possible Nipah virus infection,” reads one advisory issued by the authorities in Tamil Nadu, a state in southern India.\n\n“Government and private hospitals must be alerted about the Nipah virus situation and directed to promptly notify all AES cases,” it said.\n\nThe focus on examining cases of AES will help stop undiagnosed Nipah infections from flying under the radar, said Ali Althaf, a senior health official at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, who has done extensive work on the Nipah virus.\n\n“There were over 100 cases of AES, a key indicator for diseases like Nipah, reported last year in Kerala, and if we subjected all of them to diagnostic testing, it’s plausible that we’d uncover a greater number of Nipah infections,” he told The Telegraph.\n\nMisidentifying Nipah infections as AES or as other respiratory illnesses has serious consequences, particularly for healthcare providers, he added.\n\n“We have repeatedly seen human-to-human transmission occurring within hospital settings,” he said. “When cases are not recognised early, healthcare workers are placed at the highest risk of exposure to this often fatal virus.”\n\nThe senior health official involved in West Bengal’s Nipah surveillance efforts denied the initial case had been misdiagnosed, but conceded the case had probably been missed.\n\n“I wouldn’t describe it as misdiagnosis. It’s more accurate to say a missed diagnosis,” he said.\n\nHe added: “We are expanding the criteria for testing so clinicians know when to suspect Nipah and when to order broader panels. This is not only about Nipah, several emerging and re-emerging infections, including respiratory diseases, can present with AES-like syndromes. The state is therefore expanding case definitions and lab testing protocols.”\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage and refinance rates moved slightly higher over the past week. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose three basis points to 6.09%, and the 15-year rate increased by six basis points to 5.44%. With rates still well below their 52-week average, this could be a good time to lock in a mortgage rate.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and the U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate with not just banks, but also credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is a fantastic mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on what your financial goals are when refinancing, and when your break-even point would be after paying refinance closing costs.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance involves replacing your original home loan with a new one. Learn how to refinance a mortgage loan and decide if it's the right choice for you.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity.

    "fullText": "Why do many news outlets ignore the connections between climate change and the struggle for democracy?\n\n“Protecting the climate and protecting our democracy are inextricably linked,” veteran climate reporter and activist Bill McKibben said last week at a Covering Climate Now press briefing on covering the climate story in 2026. President Donald Trump “is in many ways operating as a political arm of the oil industry,” McKibben added, “and coming to grips with his authoritarian impulse is going to be crucial to ever getting any climate action.”\n\nThe struggle for democracy—in the streets of Minneapolis, Tehran, and beyond—is but one high-profile issue with a strong climate-change connection. Internationally, Greenland, Venezuela, and Iran possess sizable amounts of oil whose burning could push Earth’s climate past catastrophic tipping points. In the United States, the surging cost of electricity produced by coal and gas is shaping up as an issue in congressional elections in November that could either counter or reinforce Trump’s authoritarianism. Yet, despite newsrooms devoting countless airtime hours and column inches to these subjects, climate change is still missing from most news coverage.\n\nMcKibben cited Trump’s obsession with Greenland as a perfect example. While most Greenland coverage has focused on the geopolitical and military implications of Trump’s aggression, McKibben said, “the actual strategic asset in play here is a two-mile-thick sheet of ice that, if it melts, will change the lives of every person on planet Earth” by raising sea levels catastrophically.\n\nMeanwhile, developments in Europe and Africa contrast sharply with US behavior, Mohamed Adow, director of the NGO Power Shift Africa, said during the briefing. Africa has become “one of the world’s most important laboratories for climate solutions,” Adow said, though the speed at which change is happening “is often missed” in media coverage. (This excellent Bloomberg Green article is an exception.) “Kenya now generates 95 percent of our electricity from renewables,” he said. “Solar capacity has expanded rapidly in countries such as South Africa, Morocco, and Egypt…. Solar mini-grids in rural Nigeria, Tanzania, and Senegal are bringing reliable electricity to [rural] communities that fossil fuel-based grids have failed to reach for decades.”\n\nThe European Union’s imposition of climate tariffs on January 1, 2026, is also an “incredibly important” development, said Fiona Harvey, whose article in The Guardian explained that under the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, “companies selling steel, concrete, and other high-carbon goods into the European Union will have to prove that they comply with low-carbon regulations, or they will face fines.” The tariff is aimed at companies that might “shift their manufacture of those high-carbon goods or services to another [country] that has more lax regulation,” Harvey said, “so you don’t actually get any carbon saving.”\n\nNoting that editors like stories about unexpected developments, McKibben highlighted “the dramatic reduction in the price of clean energy, which is shaking up all of our assumptions…. With solar and wind now providing 90 percent of new generating capacity around the world, there’s nothing alternative about them anymore, and one of the stories we need to tell is that we’re breaking into a new paradigm.”\n\nEditors also need to hear that polls repeatedly show that “people really do care about this stuff,” Harvey said. Our job as journalists, she added, is “to show them that there are constructive ways out of the mess, as well as presenting them with the reality of the mess.”",

    "description": "Jules Boykoff, Dave...",
    "fullText": "Europe’s governing soccer body saves a pitch in the West Bank—but is it only because the Swiss Parliament is threatening to pull its tax exemption over its inclusion of Israel?\n\nIn a victory for the Palestinian solidarity movement, Israeli soldiers and munitions will not reduce a soccer field in the occupied West Bank’s Aida refugee camp to rubble. In November, Israel announced its plans to demolish the Aida field, despite—or maybe because of—the fact that it is one of the few spaces in the area where kids can play and actually be kids.\n\nThe pitch is the only sports facility available to the residents of the Aida camp, and young people from the nearby Bayt Jibrin refugee camp also use the venue. Mohammad Abu Srour of the Aida Youth Center told The Nation, “The football pitch is much more than a sports field for Aida camp. It is also a community hub for families, youth, and social activities. For many children, it represents hope, stability, and a path toward opportunity through sport, education, and psychosocial support.”\n\nIn a letter obtained by The Nation, Aida Youth Center board director Munther Amira implored FIFA president Gianni Infantino to recognize that Israel’s decision to raze the field “is a clear and callous attempt to deprive Palestinians, including hundreds of boys and girls of a facility that is of critical importance to their physical and mental welfare.”\n\nInfantino, the only sports official to attend the Summit for Peace in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, last October where Israel and Hamas signed a ceasefire agreement, has been conspicuously quiet while Israel routinely violates the peace pact. But The New York Times reported that Infantino—alongside Aleksandr Ceferin, the head of UEFA, Europe’s governing body for soccer—stepped in, following the outcry, to help save the field from destruction. Palestinians are now awaiting final confirmation that the pitch will actually be saved.\n\nNick McGeehan, the program director for the human rights group FairSquare, told The Nation, “This intervention from FIFA and UEFA, is welcome and overdue, but it shouldn’t divert attention from FIFA and UEFA’s statutory responsibilities when it comes to the Israel Football Association and their long-standing violation of statutory rules.”\n\nAbu Srour added, “Sports institutions such as FIFA and UEFA should intervene to protect children’s right to play, including the suspension of Israel from international sporting competitions, as was done previously with Russia and South Africa in response to serious violations.”\n\nThe planned destruction of the field barely registered on the US sports mediascape, even as the war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu has ratcheted up illegal land seizures in the West Bank. But Rachel Griffin Accurso—the popular US children’s educator known to the world as Ms. Rachel—stepped in where the sports media failed, joining kids in Aida via videostream to share her support, saying, “We need help to save this field!”\n\nUEFA’s support to save the Aida refugee camp’s pitch didn’t come out of nowhere. Last August, Ceferin, UEFA’s president,Ceferin allowed a banner before the kickoff at the Super Cup final that read “Stop Killing Children—Stop Killing Civilians.” He was accompanied to the match by two children from Gaza, Palestinian refugees who had been relocated to Italy for medical treatment. UEFA officials also reportedly met last month with organizers from the Game Over Israel campaign to discuss the possibility of banning Israel from international competition. In the end, UEFA allowed Israel to continue to participate in World Cup qualifying matches.\n\nBut UEFA’s motivations may lie elsewhere. The news from FIFA and UEFA that Aida’s field would be spared, came the same day that a vote was due to take place in the Swiss Parliament also aimed at standing up to Israel’s genocide against the people of Gaza. Swiss politicians put forward a resolution to revoke the tax exemptions of UEFA. It leans on a 2024 advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice that ruled that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip was unlawful. And yet UEFA continues to recognize soccer clubs in illegally occupied territories in the West Bank.\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nStudentNation\n\n /\n\n Colin Warren\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nThe vote was delayed until January 27. If it passes, the Swiss government’s tax authority will give UEFA a deadline to justify allowing the Israel Football Association to continue to compete and explain how the group’s stance chimes with the conditions of tax exemption: fostering peace and combating discrimination. The resolution notes that UEFA moved swiftly to sanction Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, but hasn’t acted similarly when it comes to Israel’s decimation of Gaza and illegal annexations in the West Bank. It then takes aim at UEFA’s pocketbook, noting that it “has long benefited, despite its significant commercial activity, from a tax exemption granted specifically because international sports federations play an important role in promoting peace and combating racism and discrimination.”\n\nAhead of the vote, Richard Falk, the former UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, told The Nation, “Revoking UEFA’s tax status will send the sporting world a needed message that even when the UN and prominent governments cast a blind eye to the cause of peace, justice, and law, the authorities of Switzerland will act to uphold their reputation as dedicated to the universal principles of a humane world order.”\n\nFalk concluded, “It is a time of urgency where words alone do not meet the challenge to us all of the ongoing Palestinian ordeal; only action matters.”\n\nWhy, might one ask, does the European governing body for football oversee Israel, given the country’s location in the Middle East? The Israel Football Association originally belonged to the Asian Football Confederation, but after Indonesia, Sudan, and Turkey all refused to play 1958 World Cup qualifying matches against Israel, and other countries ramped up their own political pressure, the IFA was expelled in 1974. In the early 1990s, UEFA invited Israel to participate in its competitions, and in 1994, Israel became a full member of UEFA.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has stripped the varnish off of liberal internationalism. But not everyone is accepting of such gangster governance. Soccer can be a means to show that a large army isn’t a license for domination. And as Swiss authorities have shown—and as a movement is demanding—soccer can also be a way to try to stop the violence.",

    "title": "The 6 Healthiest Canned Soups You Can Find at the Grocery Store, According to Nutritionists",
    "description": "Navigate the canned soup aisle with these useful pointers and recommendations.",
    "fullText": "There are dozens of canned soup options to choose from at the supermarket, including plant-based picks and traditional types with differing fat and sodium content.\n\nWhen shopping for a healthy canned soup, look for one with 300 to 600 milligrams of sodium per serving, zero trans fat or added sugars, and no more than four grams of saturated fat per serving.\n\nUsing those guidelines, some of the healthiest canned soups you can buy at the supermarket include Amy’s Organic Lentil Soup Light in Sodium and Cedarlane Foods Organic Vegetable & Barley Soup.\n\nWhen you need a quick lunch or dinner, it’s hard to beat the comfort of a warm, savory can of soup. These convenient meals often bring back nostalgic memories of childhood—but today’s soup aisle looks a lot different. Nearly every variety you can imagine is now available in canned form. While many are undeniably tasty, plenty are also packed with sodium, fat, preservatives, and even added sugars—ingredients that can chip away at their health appeal.\n\nThe good news? More and more healthy canned soups are hitting grocery store shelves nationwide. Read on to find out what makes a canned soup truly better for you—and which dietitian-approved options are worth stocking up on.\n\nJamie Adams, MS, RDN, RPYT, women’s health dietitian and founder and owner of Mamaste Nutrition\n\nRachel Gargano, MS, RD, CSSD, CBS, chief registered dietitian at Live it Up\n\nWhen it comes to sussing out healthier canned soup options, the main nutrients and ingredients we want to be wary of are sodium, saturated and trans fat, added sugars, additives, and preservatives.\n\nCanned soup is one of the most notorious sources of sodium (aka salt) as it adds to the product’s overall taste and shelf life. But long-term excessive sodium consumption can lead to hypertension (or high blood pressure levels), and increase one’s risk for developing heart disease. “A good soup choice will have between 300 and 600 milligrams (milligrams) of sodium per serving. Just remember that one serving is usually just half of the can, so if you’ll be having both servings (which most people do), don’t forget to double the sodium,” says Rachel Gargano, MS, RD, CSSD, CBS, chief registered dietitian at Live it Up. These guidelines help you to stay within nationally-recognized limits. “The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting sodium intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams a day (though ideally no more than 1,500 milligrams per day for most adults),” says Jamie Adams, MS, RDN, RPYT, women’s health dietitian and founder and owner of Mamaste Nutrition.\n\nSpeaking of heart disease, trans and saturated fats are other nutrients we want to be on lookout for. Trans fat, also known as hydrogenated fat, increases LDL (low-density lipoprotein or ‘bad’) cholesterol levels while decreasing HDL (high-density lipoprotein or ‘good’) cholesterol levels, delivering a one-two punch to heart health and increasing cardiovascular disease risk. The healthiest canned soup will have zero grams of trans fat and no ‘hydrogenated’ ingredients on the ingredients list. Saturated fat (though more controversial) is also generally accepted as a cholesterol-raising nutrient as well, and is best limited when heart health is the priority. The AHA recommends keeping saturated fat intake to less than six percent of your total daily calories. So if you’re following a 2,000 calorie diet, that would be about 13 grams total. Look for soup options with no more than four grams of saturated fat per serving.\n\nAdditives, preservatives, and added sugars are also ingredients to avoid in canned soup. This is because mystery ingredients like additives and preservatives lack the long-term evidence to fully evaluate their health effects (though they’re technically deemed safe for consumption). Meanwhile, added sugar is a major pro-inflammatory agent in the diet, and can contribute to chronic disease development and insulin resistance. “Some soups, particularly tomato-based varieties, may contain higher amounts of added sugars which only provide empty calories,” says Adams. The healthiest soups will mainly contain ingredients you recognize and have no added sugars.\n\nBetter-for-you canned soups will be filled with health-boosting nutrients, like protein and fiber, too. “Ensuring you have enough protein and fiber at the meal will help you get enough nutrition and feel satisfied. Some soups don’t have enough of these macronutrients, which means you may be more likely to feel hungry sooner,” says Gargano. These nutrients also promote muscle and tissue growth and repair, as well as gut and metabolic health. Protein can be found in lean meats, fish, poultry, dairy, eggs, nuts, seeds, and legumes, whereas fiber is most concentrated in whole grains, veggies, legumes, nuts, and seeds. “Look for soups higher in protein (at least five to seven grams per serving) and fiber (three plus grams per serving) for a more nutritionally balanced soup that leaves you feeling full and satisfied,” Adams adds.\n\nUnsaturated fat, vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds are other nutrients you want to see in a canned soup. Unsaturated fats offer satiating benefits while also working to lower cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation throughout the body. Micronutrients like vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds support several important body systems like the gut, immune system, heart, brain, skin, hair, nails, and more. Sources of these nutrients include whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, vegetables, and healthy oils (like olive or avocado), and you want to choose a soup with as many of these ingredients as you can find.\n\nWith these guidelines in mind, let’s dive into six of the healthiest canned soup varieties:\n\nFor a super-satisfying dish full of protein, fiber, plant compounds, B vitamins, and vitamin A (which together support gut, heart, immune, metabolic, and eye health), look no further than lentil soup. “Lentil soup tends to have a bit more protein than other bean-based soups,” Gargano agrees, meaning you’ll feel plenty full after enjoying it. Amy’s Organic Lentil Soup Light in Sodium has nine grams of protein, six grams of fiber, and a total of 460 milligrams of sodium.\n\nMinestrone warms you from the inside out with its rich tomato broth filled with an array of vegetables, beans, and pasta. These ingredients provide plenty of protein, fiber, and micronutrients for a balanced and filling meal. “Soups such as minestrone usually have at least three grams of fiber per serving, and bring with them the excellent health benefits of beans and legumes,” says Gargano. Health Valley Organic Minestrone Soup is made with organic veggies and spices, and provides seven grams of protein, six grams of fiber, and only 32 milligrams of sodium per serving.\n\nFew soups are as American as tomato soup, often conjuring up childhood memories of gooey grilled cheese dipping. And thankfully, this soup can be plenty healthy as a meaningful source of fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A, and lycopene—a powerful plant compound that benefits eye, immune, and gut health. However, many tomato soups are sneaky sources of added sugars, so it’s important to check the ingredients list prior to making a purchase. Sprague Tomato Bisque with Roasted Red Peppers is a fantastic grab that meets our criteria, though is a little low in protein. “If you love a soup that has enough fiber, is low in sodium, but not enough protein (like tomato soup), you can add leftover chicken, low-sodium canned chicken, or extra beans to it for a boost,” Gargano shares.\n\nThough chicken noodle soup is a comforting classic, it lacks the robust vegetable content needed to earn a spot on this list. Chicken and vegetable soup meets this criteria, however, providing plenty of protein, fiber, energy-boosting B vitamins, and immune-supportive plant compounds. “Pacific Foods Organic Chicken and Wild Rice Soup is one example made with organic chicken and veggies, and this soup provides you with 12 grams of protein and four grams of fiber per serving,” says Adams. While this option is just 40 milligrams over the recommended sodium guidelines, you can mix in a touch of water while warming it up to mitigate this.\n\nA close relative to lentil, split pea is equally satisfying with its impressive fiber, protein, iron, B vitamins, potassium, and magnesium content to benefit immune, bone, blood, gut, heart, and metabolic health. “This soup provides plenty of fiber and vegetables—things that most Americans fall short of every day,” Gargano adds. Amy's Organic Light in Sodium Split Pea Soup is made with organic vegetables and provides 12 grams of protein, seven grams of fiber, and 510 milligrams of sodium per serving with no added sugars.\n\nAnd our final healthy canned soup to highlight is vegetable barley. This vegetarian soup is rich in fiber with its high vegetable content, and features an often-forgotten (but super nutritious) ingredient—barley! Barley is an excellent source of protein, fiber, potassium, iron, magnesium, B vitamins, selenium, zinc, copper, and manganese, championing heart, gut, immune, metabolic, and bone health. Cedarlane Foods Organic Vegetable & Barley Soup is a tasty organic option with less than 500 milligrams of sodium per serving, and it serves as the perfect palette for protein-rich add-ins.\n\nWhile the above varieties are fantastic soups to start with, there are many other healthy canned soup options to be discovered in the canned foods aisle. To find them, use the following guidelines:\n\nChoose soups with less than 600 milligrams of sodium per serving\n\nLook for options with zero grams of trans fat and no ‘hydrogenated’ ingredients on the label\n\nOpt for soups with ingredients you recognize and can pronounce\n\nChoose soups with at least five to seven grams of protein per serving\n\nLook for fiber content of at least three grams per serving\n\nAim for soup brands with four grams of saturated fat or less per serving\n\nSelect soups with no added sugars\n\nReach for varieties with plenty of nutrient-dense ingredients like lean meats, fish, poultry, whole grains, legumes, and/or vegetables",

    "description": "A senator from Utah has come under fire after demanding that Charlie Kirk's alleged killer be executed in public.",
    "fullText": "A senator from Utah has demanded that Charlie Kirk's alleged killer be executed in public.\n\nSenator Mike Lee, who has been serving since 2011, made the comment in a post on X shortly after Charlie's wife called for a speedy trial of the accused, Tyler Robinson.\n\nTyler Robinson already faces the death penalty if he is found guilty at trial, but has yet to enter a plea amid the ongoing legal proceedings.\n\nSenator Mike Lee of Utah would rather have Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin publicly executed than go through the legal process of ascertaining his guilt.\n\nThe accused is Tyler Robinson, who was arrested days after Charlie was shot in the neck during an event for his nonprofit, Turning Point USA, last September.\n\nTaking to X, Lee wrote candidly, \"Execute Tyler Robinson. In public.\" He had previously made a similar statement, claiming that the accused deserved to be \"publicly executed\" for allegedly doing the same to the late right-wing influencer.\n\n\"Tyler Robinson publicly executed Charlie Kirk,\" Lee wrote at the time. \"Tyler Robinson should be publicly executed.\"\n\nWhile there is no law allowing public executions in the state of Utah, Robinson could still face execution, as prosecutors have announced their intention to seek the death penalty if he is convicted at trial.\n\nIn public https://t.co/AjtJTjdXzR\n\n— Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) January 20, 2026\n\nX users were quick to call out the politician for his remarks, with many arguing that such a statement is unbecoming of a sitting senator.\n\nOne person noted sarcastically, \"Very pro-life of you,\" while another simply stated, \"Due process.\"\n\nA third person said, \"The amount of absolute morons in govt is just mind-bending.\"\n\n\"Mike, you are truly a disgrace to your profession and humanity! STFU!\" another individual commented under the senator's post.\n\nOne more person stated, \"You just called for the public execution of a man who has not yet had his day in court to argue his innocence. Start searching for God before it's too late for your soul.\"\n\nLee's call for the public execution of Robinson comes after Charlie's wife, Erika, urged the court to speedily try her husband's alleged killer, per The Blast.\n\nVia her lawyer, she recently filed a motion to that effect, which noted that Utah law allows her to seek a speedy trial as a victim.\n\n\"The Utah Code affords victims of a crime 'the right to a speedy disposition of the charges free from unwarranted delay caused by or at the behest of the defendant,'\" read the filing by Erika's attorney, Jeffrey Neiman.\n\n\"This Court is tasked with the critically important function of ensuring the Defendant has a fair trial, but this Court must also do so while balancing Mrs. Kirk's right to a speedy trial, and therefore this Notice invokes Mrs. Kirk's rights under applicable Utah Code,\" the doc further read.\n\nRobinson last appeared in court on Janaury 16, during which the judge, Tony Graf, was forced to take a drastic move over the pool cameraman's recordings of the proceedings.\n\n\"During the remainder of this hearing, the camera shall not photograph Mr. Robinson at all,\" Graf declared midway through the hearing, per the New York Post.\n\n\"That will be the sanction of this court. I will allow the pool camera operator to reposition the camera to adhere to that.\"\n\nThe Utah district judge made the ruling after Robinson's attorneys raised concerns that a cameraman had zoomed in on their client during the proceedings, seemingly to capture private conversations.\n\nThe defense also presented previous footage that they claimed showed the cameraman violating an earlier order from Judge Graf regarding recording during hearings.\n\nAfter considering the attorneys' arguments and making his ruling, Graf also warned that such close-up footage of Robinson could prejudice the remainder of the proceedings. However, he declined to hold the videographer in contempt or issue a fine, though he noted that doing so was within his authority.\n\nThe January 16 hearing saw Robinson's attorneys continue their push to remove a local prosecutor from the case over an alleged conflict of interest.\n\nIn a previous hearing, Robinson's counsel, Richard Novak, claimed that a family member of one of the prosecutors was present at the event where Charlie was killed, and that keeping that particular prosecutor on the case could prejudice the matter.\n\nNow, as part of their argument to have the request granted, Robinson's attorneys asked for it to be referred to the Utah Attorney General's Office.\n\nIn response, Judge Graf declined and ruled that an evidentiary hearing would be held to determine whether the prosecutor should be removed.\n\nRobinson is now expected to return to court on February 3 and has yet to enter a plea.",

    "fullText": "A Tesla owner took to Reddit to vent frustration after their vehicle's cameras captured a woman stealing a key charging accessory not long after the car was plugged in. While the incident ended without permanent loss, it highlights a growing concern around electric vehicles and charging station vandalism or theft.\n\nThe situation was shared in the r/TeslaModelY forum, and the owner said the theft took place \"30 min after [they] plugged in.\" They also shared a video.\n\nThe stolen item was a J1772 adapter, a small but essential piece of equipment for many Tesla drivers. The adapter allows Tesla vehicles to connect to non-Tesla EV charging stations, making it especially valuable for drivers who rely on public infrastructure.\n\nSeveral commenters noted that someone shouldn't have been able to steal the adapter due to Tesla's technology. According to the OP, they were unaware that Tesla vehicles have a locking feature that can secure the adapter while charging, preventing it from being removed by someone else.\n\nIncidents like this can discourage new drivers from adopting EVs, particularly those who have concerns about charging access, reliability, and security. If people fear that charging equipment can be easily damaged or stolen, it undermines confidence in the infrastructure needed to support wider EV adoption.\n\nThe hesitation is problematic because EVs play a crucial role in reducing reliance on gas and oil. Critics often argue that EVs can be just as polluting as internal combustion vehicles due to battery manufacturing or electricity generation. However, numerous studies show that even EVs charged on the dirtiest grids still produce less lifetime pollution than gas-powered cars.\n\nIn a follow-up comment, the owner shared a positive update: They managed to track down the woman and recover the adapter, adding that they plan to contact their local dealership to make sure the locking feature is enabled.\n\nAs EV ownership grows, addressing vandalism, educating drivers on built-in security features, and continuing to expand secure charging infrastructure will be key to ensuring cleaner transportation can scale effectively.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "MADRID (AP) — After back-to-back fatal train crashes sent shock waves through Spain, some good news arrived on Thursday: Boro, the missing dog, was found.\n\nDays earlier, Boro's owner Ana García issued a desperate plea to help find him after the dog bolted Sunday in the aftermath of the high-speed train crash in southern Spain that killed at least 45 people. García, 26, and her pregnant sister were traveling with Boro on the train that derailed.\n\nOn Thursday, forest firefighters in southern Spain found the black-and-white pooch, and posted images that showed García with one of her legs in a brace embracing Boro. Sitting inside a car, she spoke to reporters.\n\n“Many thanks to all of Spain and everyone who has got involved so much,\" she said. \"It gave me great hope and we’ve done it.”\n\nThe search for Boro appeared to provide Spaniards something to hope for amid the week’s tragedy, and ultimately something to celebrate.\n\nFor days, people had rallied online to find him, amplifying García’s call by sharing video of an interview she had given to local media. Photos of Boro, a medium-sized black dog with white eyebrows, went viral alongside phone numbers for García and her family. Spanish television broadcasters and newspapers covered the search.\n\nGarcía, her sister and the dog had been traveling Sunday by high-speed train from Malaga, their hometown in southern Spain, to the capital Madrid, when the tail of their train car jumped the rails for reasons that remain unclear, and smashed into another train.\n\nThe collision killed dozens and injured more than 150 people. Rescue crews helped García and her sister out of the tilted train car. That's when she briefly saw Boro before he ran. She spoke to the cameras with a blanket draped over her shoulders and a bandage on her cheek after Spain’s worst rail accident in more than a decade.\n\n“Please, if you can help, look for the animals,” a limping García told reporters at the time, choked up and holding back tears. “We were coming back from a family weekend with the little dog, who’s family, too.”\n\nOn Thursday, she had a bruise beneath her eye but, with Boro back by her side, also a smile plastered across her face.\n\n“Now we have him and we have him for all our life,” García told reporters. “Now let’s go home, buddy.”",

    "fullText": "The court’s conservatives appear likely to block trump from firing Lisa Cook—not because they care about principle but because they care about the Fed.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in Trump v. Cook, a case that centers on Donald Trump’s illegal attempt to fire Federal Reserve Board commissioner Lisa Cook. The legal arguments should be familiar to anyone who has been watching Trump’s authoritarian takeover of the federal government: Trump claims he has the authority to fire anybody he wants; Cook argues “that’s not how it works, that’s not how any of this works.”\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has generally been game to allow Trump to fire whomever he wants. The court says Trump is entitled to this power under the “Unitary Executive Theory,” a fringe theory that was made up by Republican academics to justify dismantling the regulatory state and that has been adopted by Supreme Court Republicans over the past few years. The theory reimagines every independent agency created by Congress as part of Trump’s personal fiefdom. Based on this view, the Supreme Court has allowed Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board (see Trump v. Wilcox); and it will likely allow him to fire commissioners from the Federal Trade Commission (see Trump v. Slaughter. If the theory holds, Trump should be able to fire Cook.\n\nBut here’s the benefit of using a made-up thing like Unitary Executive Theory: The Republicans on the court can make it do whatever they want it to do. While Trump has been busy waving his magic wand and shouting “unitarium executatus!” at the Fed, he’s failed to grasp that the Supreme Court is the author of the entire book of spells. The court can make the spell fizzle out whenever it wants.\n\nUnlike the NLRB and the FTC, Republicans on the court like the Fed. They like its independence. They like what it does. Since Unitary Executive Theory did not exist as a practical thing until Trump decided to take away the independence of all the executive agencies Republicans don’t like, it’s very easy for the Republican justices to say that Unitary Executive Theory doesn’t exist when it comes to the one independent agency they actually care about.\n\nIndeed, Chief Justice John Roberts laid the groundwork for granting the Fed a made-up cloak of protection during the Trump v. Wilcox arguments, which took place after Trump made his first noises about firing Cook. Anticipating her likely firing, Roberts noted that the Fed was a “uniquely structured, quasi-private” independent agency, distinct from all the others. Alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh has made similar statements. This means at least two Republican justices are already poised to allow Trump to run roughshod over every independent agency except the Fed.\n\nWhy? Well, the easy answer is that the Fed has a direct impact on the financial health of the Republicans on the Supreme Court and the donors who’ve bought them. The stability of monetary policy, and its independence from the crazy white supremacist installed in the White House, is important for the stock market, and thus all of the investments rich people have.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that destabilizing the Fed could, without hyperbole, crash the economy. Even beyond the matter of their personal finances, it’s likely that the Republican justices care about that. Remember, before the Roberts court was known as the most pro-authoritarian court in US history, it was widely regarded as the most pro-business court in US history.\n\nPractically speaking, giving Trump personal control over the Fed is bad for business. While the Republicans famously do not care about practicality when it comes to abortion rights or gun rights, when it comes to money? The Republicans care a great deal.\n\nThe majority of the justices’ evident skepticism toward Trump in this case are only really intelligible if you understand both the personal and national implications of the issue in front of the court. The core argument made by the Trump administration was that Cook was fired “for cause,” as is required by statute. The administration claims that the “cause” is an allegation that Cook committed mortgage fraud (she did not) before she was appointed to the Fed. Ostensibly, the justices were arguing over whether this particular alleged fraud is enough of a cause (because not only are the allegations false; they’re allegations over conduct from before she was on the Fed, which is not normally a “for cause” reason to fire somebody from a federal position). The justices were also arguing over whether Cook should have any opportunity to defend herself from these (again, provably false) allegations.\n\nAgain, Trump has fired people based on made-up allegations before. The only reason the court is skeptical about this firing, based on these made-up allegations, is that the ability to fire Fed commissioners at will places the monetary policy of the entire nation at the whim of Trump. We are literally watching Trump trying to push Fed chair Jerome Powell out right now, but he won’t have to push him if the court says the president can just fire Fed officials whenever he wants.\n\nBecause of this, Kavanaugh finally raised the question that he should have raised during every Trump-fires-someone case the court has heard thus far. He asked Solicitor General John Sauer what would stop future presidents from “manufacturing” artificial “cause” to justify firing Fed commissioners whose political positions they don’t like. Sauer said that Trump’s reasons were not manufactured, and that the “for cause” provision protects commissioners from being fired for policy reasons. But everyone knows that the only reason Cook was fired by Trump was policy reasons. Kavanaugh rightly intuited that if Trump can fire Cook, a future Democratic president can just come in and fire all the Trump appointees and install Fed commissioners loyal to the new administration’s monetary policies. Kavanaugh literally quoted himself—from his confirmation hearing, when he threatened retribution on his political enemies—and warned: “What goes around comes around.”\n\nThat’s always been true with these firing cases. Kavanaugh just suddenly cares about it now.\n\nNor is it just Kavanaugh who has suddenly decided to care about the obvious. Here’s what will really shock people who naively think the Republicans on the Supreme Court are committed to their own logic: I think Justice Sam Alito is in play for ruling against Trump. For the first time during Trump’s second reign, he sounded like he was trying to find a way to rule against the president—specifically, to send the case back down to a lower court to have it decide whether the alleged pre-office mortgage fraud was sufficient “cause” for this firing. Roberts and Kavanaugh wanted to end this attack on the Fed now, but Alito (and Ketanji Brown Jackson, to an extent) seemed interested in letting a lower court simply say “this isn’t cause,” as opposed to forcing the Supreme Court to do the dirty work.\n\nThe two justices most aligned with Trump’s position were Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, and that should not be surprising. Say what you will about those two (and I’ve said a lot about how much they suck), those guys are consistent in their belief that the practical consequences of their decisions should be ignored, even when their decisions lead to suffering and death. Thomas and Gorsuch are, like the rest of the justices from both parties, outcome determinative. But in this case, the outcome these two value most is power, not the health of the American economy. If Trump wants to use that power to crash the economy, that’s his problem, not Thomas’s or Gorsuch’s (according to them).\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nStudentNation\n\n /\n\n Colin Warren\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Benjamin R. Barber\n\nStill, they were in the minority. Ultimately, Roberts does not want Trump to have personal control over the Fed, so Trump won’t have it. I also don’t think Roberts wants Trump to be able to impose retaliatory tariffs, so Trump likely won’t have that power either. Roberts does want Trump to be able to kill the NLRB and USAID, so he can. I don’t yet know if Roberts wants Trump to be able to end birthright citizenship, but I guess I’ll find out soon.\n\nI wish Roberts thought immigrants and white ladies in Minnesota were as important as the Federal Reserve. I wish Roberts thought protecting American schoolchildren was as important as protecting American investments. I wish Roberts thought discriminating against a Black woman working at Publix was as important as discriminating against a Black woman working for the Fed. But… he doesn’t.\n\nTrump will lose this case because he’s trying to mess with something the Supreme Court thinks is important. I wish we all could be so lucky as to appear valuable to John Roberts and the Supreme Court.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.\n\nGeraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the 55-year-old father of four was attempting suicide and the staff tried to save him.\n\nBut a witness told The Associated Press last week that Lunas Campos was handcuffed as at least five guards held him down and one put an arm around his neck and squeezed until he was unconscious.\n\nHis death was one of at least three reported in little more than a month at Camp East Montana, a sprawling tent facility in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base.\n\nThe autopsy report by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos' body showed signs of a struggle, including abrasions on his chest and knees. He also had hemorrhages on his neck. The deputy medical examiner, Dr. Adam Gonzalez. determined the cause of death was asphyxia due to neck and torso compression.\n\nThe report said witnesses saw Lunas Campos “become unresponsive while being physically restrained by law enforcement.” It did not elaborate on what happened during the struggle but cited evidence of injuries to his neck, head and torso associated with physical restraint. The report also noted the presence of petechial hemorrhages — tiny blood spots from burst capillaries that can be associated with intense strain or injury — in the eyelids and skin of the neck.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy report for AP, said the presence of petechiae in the eyes support the conclusion that asphyxia caused the death. Those injuries suggest pressure on the body and are often associated with such deaths, he said.\n\nHe said the contusions on Lunas Campos’ body may reflect physical restraint and the neck injuries were consistent with a hand or knee on the neck.\n\nThe autopsy also found the presence of prescription antidepressant and antihistamine medications, adding that Lunas Campos had a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. It made no mention of him attempting suicide.\n\nGovernment provided changing accounts of what happened\n\nICE's initial account of the death, which included no mention of an altercation with guards, said Lunas Campos had become disruptive and staff moved him into a cellblock where detainees are held away from others.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 statement. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nLast Thursday, after Lunas Campos' family was first informed the death was likely to be ruled a homicide, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin amended the government's account, saying he had attempted suicide and guards tried to help him.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” she said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nAfter the final autopsy report was released Wednesday, McLaughlin issued a statement emphasizing that Lunas Campos was “a criminal illegal alien and convicted child sex predator.”\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with a person under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry. Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,\" McLaughlin said Wednesday, adding that the agency was investigating the death. DHS has not responded to questions about whether any outside law enforcement agency was also investigating.\n\nDeaths put a spotlight on Camp East Montana\n\nThe AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion contract to build and operate Camp East Montana, expected to become the largest detention facility in the U.S., was awarded to a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility and has subcontracted with other companies to help operate the camp.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of a private contractor.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. While the cause of death was still pending, the agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nOn Sunday, ICE announced that Victor Manuel Diaz, a 36-year-old immigrant from Nicaragua, died at Camp East Montana on Jan. 14 of a “presumed suicide.” The agency said Diaz was detained by ICE earlier this month during the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz's body wasn't sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso. McLaughlin said Wednesday that the autopsy for Diaz is being performed at the Army medical center at Fort Bliss. DHS again did not respond to questions about whether any agency other than ICE will investigate the death.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, called on DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons to brief Congress about the recent deaths.\n\n“DHS must preserve all evidence — including halting their effort to deport the witnesses,” Escobar said Wednesday. “I reiterate my call for Camp East Montana to be shut down and for the contract with the corporation running it to be terminated.”",

The French navy is escorting the ship to anchorage for more checks, the statement said. The tanker departed from the city of Murmansk in northwestern Russia, it said.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nFrance and other countries have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet of oil tankers which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nRussia is using what is described as a “shadow fleet” to evade sanctions over its war on Ukraine. The fleet is a compilation of aging vessels and tankers owned by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from such countries.\n\n“We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a post about the interception, with a photo showing a French helicopter hovering over a ship.\n\n“The activities of the ‘shadow fleet’ contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine,” Macron added.\n\nThe French mission was conducted together with the U.K, which gathered and shared intelligence that enabled the ship to be intercepted, according to French military officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation.\n\nThe ship was operating under a false flag from the Comoros islands, which are off east Africa, and its crew is Indian, the officials said. It was intercepted in the western Mediterranean, off the southern Spanish coastal town of Almeria, the officials said.\n\nLast September, French naval forces boarded another oil tanker off the French Atlantic coas t that Macron also linked to the shadow fleet. That tanker traveled from the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk near Saint Petersburg. Known as “Pushpa” or “Boracay\" — its name was changed several times — the ship was sailing under the flag of Benin.\n\nPutin denounced that interception as an act of piracy and alleged that Macron initiated the move to deflect attention from French domestic problems.\n\nThe tanker's captain will go on trial in February over the crew’s alleged refusal to cooperate, according to French judicial authorities.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA giant reservoir of \"secret\" fresh water off the East Coast that could potentially supply a city the size of New York City for 800 years may have formed during the last ice age, when the region was covered in glaciers, researchers say.\n\nPreliminary analyses suggest the reservoir, which sits beneath the seafloor and appears to stretch from offshore New Jersey as far north as Maine, was locked in place under frigid conditions around 20,000 years ago, hinting that it formed in the last glacial period due, partly, to thick ice sheets.\n\nLast summer, researchers went on an expedition to follow up on reports from the late 1960s and early 1970s of fresh water beneath the seafloor off the East Coast. \"It was quite the project and sort of a lifelong dream,\" Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist and a professor of geophysics at the Colorado School of Mines, told Live Science.\n\nThe research voyage, known as Expedition 501, lasted three months and dredged up 13,200 gallons (50,000 liters) of water from beneath the seafloor in three locations off the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. The results aren't finalized yet, but so far it looks as if the reservoir might stretch farther underground than early reports suggested, meaning it might be even bigger than previously thought.\n\nDugan and his colleagues also think they know what created the reservoir thanks to preliminary radiocarbon, noble gas and isotope analyses, he said.\n\nFresh water in the region was first reported 60 years ago by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), during offshore mineral and energy resource assessments between Florida and Maine. \"In a very peculiar way, they found fresh water in the sediment beneath the ocean,\" Dugan said. \"In the 1980s, some of the USGS people came up with ideas of how that fresh water could get there. Then it went quiet for a while — no one was talking about it.\"\n\nIn 2003, Dugan and Mark Person, a professor of hydrology at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, rediscovered these records and came up with three ideas of how fresh water can end up beneath the ocean. One way that a submarine freshwater reservoir can form is if sea levels are very low for a long time and rainfall seeps into the ground. Then, when sea levels rise again over hundreds of thousands of years, that fresh water gets trapped in the underlying sediment, Dugan said.\n\nA second possibility is that tall mountains close to the ocean funnel rainwater directly down into the seabed from their high elevation point, he said. And thirdly — related to the first hypothesis — a freshwater reservoir can form under the ocean if ice sheets expand, causing sea levels to drop. Meltwater collects at the bottom of ice sheets because they grind against the bedrock, producing heat. The huge weight of the ice sheet then pushes that water into the ground, trapping it beneath layers of sediment.\n\nMore than two decades later, the researchers are finally close to getting an answer, with preliminary data indicating that most of the fresh water came from glaciers some time during the last ice age (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). \"We kind of ruled out the large topography for New England, because we don't have big mountains next to the coast,\" Dugan said. However, \"there might be a rainfall component\" blended in the glacier water, he said. \"You can imagine that in front of a glacier you have rainfall, so it's probably a mixed system.\"\n\nExpedition 501 extracted water samples from sites 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast of Massachusetts. The researchers drilled down to 1,300 feet (400 meters) below the seafloor, which was deep enough to reveal a thick layer of sediment engorged with fresh water sitting beneath a layer of salty sediment and an impermeable \"seal\" of clay and silt.\n\n\"We have a seal at the top [of the fresh water] that keeps the seawater above from the fresh water below,\" Dugan said. This seal is strong enough to separate the two layers now, but it wasn't robust enough to stop a glacier from forcing water down through it — if that is what happened. \"Whatever emplaced that water didn't care if there was a seal. There was enough energy to flush it with fresh water,\" he said.\n\nSalinity measurements showed that water freshness in the reservoir drops with distance from the shore, but it stays well below ocean salinity in the areas studied last summer. The drill site closest to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard had a salt content of 1 part per 1,000, which is the maximum safe limit for drinking water. Farther offshore, salt content was 4 to 5 parts per 1,000, and at the farthest site, the researchers recorded 17 to 18 parts per 1,000 — or about half of the ocean's average salt content.\n\n—1.2 billion-year-old groundwater is some of the oldest on Earth\n\n—Scientists discover enormous reservoir hidden in Cascades — more than twice the amount of water in Lake Mead\n\n—Enough fresh water is lost from continents each year to meet the needs of 280 million people. Here's how we can combat that.\n\n\"The important part was we collected all the samples we need to address our primary questions,\" Dugan said. \"When we're done drilling and we pull our equipment out, the holes collapse back in and seal themselves up.\"\n\nNow, scientists are studying the reservoir in finer detail, including any microbes, rare earth elements, pore space — which can help researchers better estimate the reservoir's size — and the age of the sediments, which will help narrow down when it formed. More definitive results about how and when the reservoir formed are expected in about one month's time, Dugan said.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide an understanding of the system so if and when somebody needs to use it, they have information to start from, rather than recreating information or making an ill-informed choice,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — After a video of coyotes attacking a dog went viral on the Nextdoor app, one pet owner said coyotes are becoming a real problem in the Sun City East neighborhood of Summerlin near Lake Mead and Rampart boulevards.\n\nJK Proctor said coyotes jumped a fence in his front yard on Wednesday, Jan. 14, around 7 a.m. while letting his 16-year-old dog, Bently, out. He posted footage of the attack online, which he said happened quietly and within seconds. The footage showed Bently’s neck and head in the jaws of one of the two coyotes, before Proctor ran out and scared them off.\n\n“It was just a blur, I saw them come in, and then as you can see in the video, they were attacking my dog right here,” Proctor said.\n\nBentley was not injured in the attack. Proctor said he was aware of coyote presence when he moved to the 55+ community four years ago. But he said the coyotes have gotten increasingly aggressive.\n\n“There’s a lot of people, women who are walking their little dogs every morning and evening. And we’ve noticed that the coyotes are starting to stalk them. And they won’t run when they blow the whistles anymore,” Proctor said. “You used to be able to blow a whistle or beat a pan or something and make them run off. But they’re getting braver and braver.”\n\nOn Jan. 19, a woman named Rainna Davis also posted on the Nextdoor app about the rise in coyote problems in Sun City Summerlin North. “The amount of coyotes I have run off from my backyard is at an alarming rate. I’ve lived here since Oct. 21, and yesterday was 5 times,” her post read. “I’ve lived in Summerlin for over 20 years and have never seen it this bad.”\n\nAccording to the Department of Wildlife’s website, coyotes can jump fences between six and seven feet. Proctor said due to HOA rules in 55+ communities like his, it’s unlikely to raise fences that high or add coyote rollers. He believes it’s only a matter of time until a human has an ugly encounter with the coyotes.\n\nProctor said he felt conflicted about efforts to remove coyotes roaming the area, due to them being in their natural habitat nearby.\n\n“I know they were here before us, and I feel sorry for them, because I’ve seen last summer one walking down the road here and out in the heat, and he was stumbling and hungry,” he said. “You know, it just breaks your heart to see them suffer.”\n\nBut he said their behavior is getting out of hand.\n\n“It’s getting really bad. They’re starting to get more and more aggressive. And I think somebody’s going to get bit and pretty soon attacked,” Proctor said. “I think there’s only one option available, and that’s to exterminate them. I don’t like the idea of it at all, but I don’t see any other option.”\n\nRemoving coyotes is rarely an option, according to an informational page about coyotes on the Nevada Department of Wildlife’s website, which said:\n\n“Removal of coyotes is not a long-term solution. If there is habitat in your neighborhood, coyotes will be in the area. Even if every single coyote was removed, more would quickly come into the area…Coyotes are very territorial and dependent on their home ranges. After being relocated, they will do just about anything to get back home where they are familiar with the resources (this includes crossing roadways, exposure to elements, lack of food and water) – this is both dangerous for the animal, and counter-effective for the neighborhood.”\n\nIn a statement to 8 News Now, regional public information and education supervisor for the Nevada Department of Wildlife, C. Douglas Nielsen, said:\n\nWhen it comes to managing coyotes, we generally recommend a combination of removing attractants, excluding them from specific areas, and consistent hazing. The worst thing people can do when they see a coyote is nothing. By doing nothing, we are hanging out a welcome sign and saying make yourself at home. We need to make them uncomfortable, and that is where hazing comes in. We encourage people to haze them actively and consistently.\n\nAttractants can include food left outside for pets, fallen fruit from trees, or even quiet, shady areas that offer shelter. Eliminating these attractants is an important first step in discouraging coyote presence.\n\nExclusion techniques may involve installing coyote rollers on the tops of fences or walls. These devices prevent coyotes from gaining a foothold and pulling themselves over. Motion-activated lights or sprinklers can also help deter coyotes, particularly if they are frequenting the area during nighttime hours.\n\nHazing should be done whenever a coyote is seen to prevent them from becoming habituated to humans. This involves using deterrent actions such as making loud noises, throwing objects, spraying with a hose, or anything else that creates a negative experience for the animal. The goal is to teach the coyote that being in a particular area leads to unpleasant consequences. If there are no food sources and they are routinely hazed, they are much less likely to remain in or return to that area.\n\nFor pet safety, dogs should always be walked on a short leash to keep them close and prevent tangling, especially with retractable leashes. Carrying an umbrella can also be a useful tool—popping it open can startle a coyote and create both a visual and physical barrier. Pets should never be left outside unattended, particularly during dawn and dusk when coyotes are most active.\n\nIf there is a significant public safety risk, the Nevada Department of Wildlife tells the public to reach out to wildlife officials. But even then, each case is different according to Nielson.\n\n“There is no hard & fast rule on when someone should call to report an interaction with a coyote or other wildlife. Every situation and every person are unique,” Nielsen said. “If someone is uncomfortable going about their daily life, they may want to report their concern. We will evaluate each report based on its own merit and determine what the appropriate response should be. Generally, education and information are sufficient in most circumstances. Sometimes a physical response is merited, but not very often.”\n\nAnyone concerned about coyotes in their area can call the Nevada Department of Wildlife dispatch center at 1-800-992-3030 or its Las Vegas office at 702-486-5127.",

The officers then told him to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,\" she said.\n\nStenvik said the family has an active asylum case and has not been ordered to leave the country.\n\n“Why detain a 5-year-old?” she asked. \"You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child.”\n\nShe said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was conducting an operation to arrest the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador and in the U.S. illegally. He fled on foot, “abandoning his child,” she said.\n\n“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.\n\nStenvik said another adult who lives at the home was outside when the father and son were taken, but agents wouldn't leave Liam with that person. DHS didn't immediately respond to an email Thursday asking if Conejo Arias had asked to keep his son with him.\n\nLiam and his father were being held in a family holding cell in Texas, Marc Prokosch, the family’s lawyer, said during the news conference.\n\n“Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they’ve been asked to do,” Prokosch said of the family's asylum claim. “So this is just cruelty.”\n\nMinnesota has become a major focus of immigration sweeps by DHS-led agencies. Greg Bovino, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns in Minneapolis and other cities, said 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” have been arrested in Minnesota in the last six weeks.\n\nJulia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.\n\nLiam is the fourth student from Columbia Heights Public Schools who has been detained by ICE in recent weeks, said Stenvik. A 17-year-old student was taken Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.\n\nThe district is made up of five schools and about 3,400 students from pre-K to 12th grade, according to its website. The majority of the students come from immigrant families, according to Stenvik.\n\nShe said they've noticed their attendance drop over the past two weeks, including one day where they had about one-third of their students out from school.\n\nElla Sullivan, Liam’s teacher, described him as “kind and loving.”\n\n“His classmates miss him,” she said. \"And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.”\n\nThis story was updated to correct Greg Bovino's title to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection offical, not Patrol.",

    "description": "More than half of respondents to a Bloomberg survey have \"not yet begun their generative AI journey.\"",
    "fullText": "Generative AI hasn't yet won over the quants.\n\nA majority of people running systematic trading strategies at top-tier asset managers have \"not yet begun their generative AI journey,\" according to a new Bloomberg survey.\n\nThe data giant interviewed 151 quants between April and November last year to determine how they've integrated generative AI tools into their investment research process. While this section of the investing world has used machine-learning techniques for years, generative AI has not yet broken through. Most of the respondents, 54%, do not incorporate it into their workflows, the survey found.\n\nThis matches the vibe Business Insider reported on in October, where quants at a London-based conference were skeptical of the technology's ability to beat the market and add value to their investing processes. A UBS executive, for instance, said that AI is not going to help win the \"alpha war.\"\n\nBloomberg's rationale for the slow adoption is focused on data formatting and structure.\n\nAngana Jacob, the firm's global head of research data, said quants require their data to be cleaned and structured a specific way because of the complex systems their strategies run and the amount of capital at stake if there is an error.\n\n\"They're working in a very controlled research environment, models need to be explainable, models need to be repeatable,\" said Jacob, in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nThe work required to get the datasets to a point where they can be used is \"unglamorous,\" but \"foundational,\" Jacob said. Her team is creating data products for quants that might increase AI adoption among them, because, she said, the enthusiasm is high for what AI can do once the data catches up. The lack of widespread use in the investing process is more a sign of the diligence of these players.\n\n\"It's a good thing, it shows their caution,\" she said.\n\nBloomberg is not the only data player that has identified this issue. Former Point72 data executive Kirk McKeown's startup, Carbon Arc, is also focused on structuring datasets for easier ingestion into artificial intelligence models.",

    "title": "Vintage photos show American life under Trump's tariff hero, William McKinley",
    "description": "See how William McKinley's tariff policies that have inspired President Trump's affected everyday Americans in the 1890s.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have become a defining feature of his second term, central to his strategy for reshaping global trade.\n\nAggressive tariff policies have been rare at the White House in recent decades, but history offers clues about how they can ripple through everyday American life.\n\nThe last time sweeping tariffs were enacted, in the 1890s, it was at the hand of William McKinley, who authored the highly protectionist Tariff Act of 1890, imposing tariffs of more than 50% on many imported goods.\n\nMcKinley, who was the US president from 1897 to 1901, introduced his tariff policies while serving as a congressman. They had far-reaching effects on the economy and were ultimately unpopular among voters, leading him and other Republican congressmen to lose their seats in the 1890 midterms. Even McKinley himself changed his mind on foreign trade by the time he became president.\n\n\"This was protectionist at its height,\" William K. Bolt, a professor of history at Francis Marion University in South Carolina, told Business Insider of McKinley's original policy. \"And there was a significant political backlash against it.\"\n\nTrump has credited McKinley's tariff policies for making America a \"very wealthy country,\" and repeatedly namedropped him on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\n\"In the 1890s, our country was probably the wealthiest it ever was because it was a system of tariffs,\" Trump said in a Michigan town hall in September. \"We had a president, you know McKinley?\"\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has pushed an expansive and often unpredictable tariff agenda, from his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs to country-specific threats that have rattled markets and trade partners.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump's desire for the US to buy Greenland has reignited concerns over a potential trade war between the US and its European allies, as Trump threatened eight European nations with a new 10% tariff starting February 1. He has since paused those plans.\n\nOn the other side of the wealth divide, workers and immigrants faced harsh living conditions.\n\nThe rapid increase in industrialization drew masses to America, and immigration, particularly from countries in eastern and southern Europe, changed the face of the workforce, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nChildren, who weren't protected by law from physically challenging labor, had often started contributing to their households by age 10.\n\nIn New York City, the population doubled every decade from 1800 to 1880. Tenement housing, where families packed as many people as possible into apartments by using cheap materials to create walls or add floors to existing buildings, quickly dominated parts of the city. These settlements often lacked indoor plumbing or ventilation, leading to a rapid increase in the spread of illnesses. The cramped conditions also led to many fires in major cities.\n\nJacob Riis' \"How The Other Half Lives,\" a photojournalism book documenting the lives of poor Americans towards the end of the century, exposed the realities faced by millions of people, such as having 12 adults sleeping in 13-feet-wide rooms and child mortality in tenements being as high as one in 10.\n\nAn average family spent nearly 60% of their annual income on food and rent, and laborers — including children — often worked six 10-hour days per week.\n\nOne report of living standards of the time suggested that an average family's dreams would be fulfilled by owning a home valued around $36,000 in today's money, a Sunday dress and suit, a barrel of flour, 5 tons of coal, and $9,000 in today's money in savings.\n\nThe presence of disposable income led to the establishment of department stores and consumerism in the big cities.\n\nFor women entering the workforce, retail stores offered a more respectable field of work than the factory work available to them, which was mostly in textile and garment manufacturing. While job opportunities opened for women, their wages remained significantly lower than men's, who were still seen as the breadwinners of the households, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nPrior to the adoption of the federal income tax in 1913, tariffs were the federal government's main source of funding.\n\nIn an effort to help the economy recover following the Civil War, the government had kept tariffs on foreign goods relatively high compared to pre-war rates, Douglas Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote for the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nHowever, by the late 1880s, a unique problem had arisen: The federal government was taking in too much money from tariffs, resulting in a budget surplus over 40% higher than its spending.\n\nBoth parties agreed to revisit tariff rates in efforts to reduce it, although each side supported a different alternative in what became known as the Great Tariff Debate of 1888.\n\nBorn in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, William McKinley was working as a school teacher when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He enlisted in the Union Army and quickly climbed the ranks. After the war, he attended Albany Law School in New York and began his political career shortly after, being elected to the House of Representatives in 1876.\n\nAuthored by McKinley and later named after him, the Tariff Act of 1890 raised protective tariffs of over 1,500 products by almost 50%.\n\nThe tariff imposed duties on items like tinplate and wool while eliminating tariffs on sugar, molasses, tea, and coffee. The goal of the act was to \"make the duty on foreign-tinplate high enough to insure its manufacture in this country,\" McKinley said in 1890.\n\nIt also protected American workers' wages from competition from cheaper labor abroad.\n\nWhile miners and farmers of crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes benefited from the stimulus to American production and the rise in foreign competitors' prices, some manufacturing was hurt by the price hikes in raw materials.\n\nThe tariffs affected consumer products like shoes, clothes, and canned goods, as well as some other 1,500 products, ranging from chemicals and metals to dairy products and grains, to varying degrees.\n\nUltimately, it was everyday people who ended up paying the price for the tariffs, Bolt said.\n\n\"Consumers had to pay a higher price for the manufactured good they wanted,\" Bolt said. \"So there was in fact a political backlash against the McKinley tariff.\"\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Tariff Act, McKinley's Republican Party lost control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1890, and the Ohio representative himself was ousted as the party lost 93 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nOver the next two years, as voters continued to feel the impacts of the measure and other economic instabilities, the party also lost the presidential election and both chambers of Congress in 1892.\n\nAcross the country, economic unrest as prices rose turned workers against vendors and employers, leading to a rise in the labor movement.\n\nAs industries expanded, workers began to unite against industry barons to demand fair work conditions.\n\nAn 1892 strike demanding improvements in working conditions turned deadly after Carnegie Steel-hired security forces exchanged gunfire with the worker coalition.\n\nAcross the country, labor movements gained momentum, with the rising hostility between industry leaders and workers ending in fatal incidents.\n\nIn 1894, the Pullman Strike, after which Labor Day was established, led to dozens of deaths and millions of dollars in damages, pushing then-President Grover Cleveland to legitimize the labor movement by declaring the national holiday.\n\nThe rise in unemployment (which reached 17% by the winter and surpassed 10% for the next half of the decade), along with government spending on Civil War pensions, were some of the factors that contributed to the panic.\n\nFollowing the panic, the Democrats reduced some of McKinley's tariffs with the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894. Tariffs on some items — including iron ore, lumber, and wool — were nixed entirely, angering US producers of those products.\n\nFollowing the economic troubles, voters blamed President Grover Cleveland and his Democratic party, which didn't regain power in any branch of government until 1910.\n\nShortly after ending his term as governor of Ohio, serving from 1892 to 1896, McKinley ran for president on a protectionist platform that aimed to benefit American industries while discouraging trade with foreign nations.\n\n\"Free trade gives to the foreign producer equal privileges with us,\" McKinley proclaimed in a 1892 speech. \"It destroys our factories or reduces our labor to the level of theirs.\"\n\nMcKinley's tariff plans heavily targeted the import of goods like tinplate, wool, yarn, steel, and sugar in an effort to encourage domestic manufacturing.\n\nWith domestic industries continuing to grow thanks to widespread industrialization and an increase in goods production, American manufacturers saw a need for exports to an international market.\n\nHowever, America's tariffs on foreign imports led other nations to increase their duties on American products, limiting the domestic industries' role in foreign trade and hurting the economy as a surplus of production failed to bring in more revenue for manufacturers.\n\nOnce in the White House, President McKinley's approach to tariffs turned to a reciprocal view that would help export American products and stimulate trade rather than penalize it.\n\nStaying true to his election promise of high tariffs, McKinley supported the Dingley Tariff Act, which raised previously lowered tariffs back to an average of 49% on imported goods, according to Lewis L. Gould, a professor of American history at the University of Texas. However, the act also granted the president the power to negotiate tariff reductions up to 20% or add products to a tariff \"free-list.\"\n\nUsing the tariffs as a negotiating tool with foreign markets, McKinley encouraged nations to lower their tariffs on American goods to allow for more exports.\n\nMajor donations from executives from firms like JP Morgan and Standard Oil ensured that the McKinley presidency remained friendly to business interests.\n\nMcKinley was also in office for part of the Great Merger wave of 1895-1904, in which companies consolidated into larger firms, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Between 1895 and 1904, the average number of firms disappearing to mergers each year was 301; in 1899 alone, as merger activity peaked, this number rose to 1,028, per the NBER.\n\nWhile the Sherman Antitrust Act — a federal law prohibiting businesses from engaging in unfair practices that restrain competition — was passed in 1890, it is understood that the McKinley administration failed to strictly enforce the law to prevent large firms from consolidating into even larger monopolies during this period.\n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, one out of every eight children was employed by 1870. By 1900, the rate had risen to one in every five, with almost two million kids aged 10 to 15 working full-time jobs.\n\nIn rural areas, young boys (some even younger than 14) often worked at coal mines, breaking up coal with their bare hands or performing farm labor. In cities, many earned an income through newspaper delivery. In towns, both boys and girls often worked at mills or factories.\n\nThe unregulated growth of large firms led to more workers getting involved with the labor movement. Between 1897 and 1904, union membership increased from less than 500,000 to over two million workers, according to the US Department of Labor.\n\nWorkers united to demand fair working conditions, like improved facilities and hours. At the time, the norm for a worker was to work over 10 hours a day in places like factories or mills that exposed them to dangerous chemicals and conditions.\n\nAs the labor movement gained support, tensions between workers and businesses grew more hostile. One 1897 encounter between coal miners and local authorities, which later became known as the Lattimer Massacre, resulted in the death of 19 strikers.\n\nSent to Havana Harbor during the Cuban War of Independence against the Spanish, the USS Maine and its accidental explosion set the stage for America's declaration of war with Spain.\n\nUnverified reports of a Spanish attack on the ship alarmed Americans and quickly built support for the war, which Americans saw as a just cause for Cuban freedom.\n\nOn the night after the explosion alone, the Army received over 100,000 volunteers.\n\nThe Spanish-American war was perhaps the most significant development of the McKinley administration, and might've contributed to the president's shift in tone regarding foreign trade towards the end of his presidency.\n\nThe Spanish-American war greatly expanded America's reach in the hemisphere and beyond.\n\nThe 16-week war and low casualties on the American front helped raise the national spirit following the economic and political instability of the past century.\n\nAmerica's victory in the Spanish-American War and the subsequent annexation of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam ended America's isolationist approach of the 19th century in favor of a globalist view, which was then reflected in the domestic politics adopted by McKinley's leadership.\n\nVictory in the war effectively turned a page in American politics as the country was now emboldened by its newly found global power.\n\nIn a drastic change in views since his Congress days, McKinley openly discouraged the protectionist economy in favor of reciprocal tariffs, saying that \"a policy of good will and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals.\"\n\nHis speech at the Pan-American Exposition signaled a shift in the Republican Party's views of trade following the war, and opened the door for an expansionist economy.\n\nWhile attending the event, the president was shot by Leon Czolgosz, a Polish-American laborer and anarchist. He died from the wounds eight days later, on September 14, 1901.\n\nDespite the economic turmoil of the previous decade, McKinley was widely mourned by the country.\n\n\"It's a great \"what-if\" in American politics,\" Bolt said. \"If McKinley wasn't assassinated, [would] we [have started] to move towards free trade a lot earlier than we did?\"\n\nFollowing McKinley's death, his successor, President Theodore Roosevelt, and subsequent Progressive politics brought upon changes that alleviated the social and economic tensions of the Gilded Age.\n\nPower shifted from the barons and reforms in labor, trust busting, tax policies, and civil rights changed the landscape of American life.\n\nWhile McKinley's presidency is often overshadowed by his successor's, he had a significant impact on setting the stage for a new age in the domestic economy, both through his protectionist tariffs and his undoing of them.",

    "description": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin says AI has shifted power to tech teams, but today's tools often fall short, even as massive data-center spending accelerates.",
    "fullText": "Hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin has a blunt message for anyone expecting artificial intelligence to instantly rewrite the global economy: the hype is real — and it's there to justify enormous spending.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, the Citadel CEO said the AI boom is being fueled as much by narrative as by real productivity gains.\n\nGriffin, who ranks as the 39th wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of about $48.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said that doesn't mean AI isn't powerful — but expectations have run far ahead of reality.\n\n\"Is it hype? Of course,\" Griffin said, pointing to the extraordinary scale of investment now pouring into AI infrastructure.\n\nGriffin said that data center spending in the US is estimated to top $500 billion this year. Bank of America previously estimated that Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta — who are leading the data center construction boom — will spend a combined $385 billion annually on AI infrastructure between 2025 and 2028.\n\n\"You're not going to generate this kind of spend unless you're going to make a promise you're going to profoundly change the world,\" Griffin said.\n\n\"How else are you going to get people to write $500 billion of checks just this year alone?\" he added.\n\nGriffin's skepticism came after he was asked whether he agreed with predictions from AI leaders such as Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who has said that half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could disappear within five years.\n\nGriffin didn't endorse that view, instead questioning whether AI systems are delivering the kind of deep productivity gains that would justify such forecasts.\n\nTech leaders, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, have pointed to overheated valuations and investor overexcitement to predict a looming bubble.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have said AI spending reflects a fundamental shift in computing and that demand and model capabilities are still growing fast enough to justify the buildout.\n\nWhat is certain for Griffin said is that AI has \"re-empowered the head of technology in every business in the United States,\" he said.\n\nGriffin was especially critical of generative AI outputs in white-collar work, saying they often look impressive at first glance but fall apart under scrutiny.\n\nHe described reviewing an AI-generated report that seemed insightful at the top but devolved into \"garbage\" further down.\n\nStill, Griffin isn't dismissing AI's long-term impact. He said the technology will be transformative in areas like call centers and software development, and that massive investment in technology broadly is already benefiting the economy.",

Think meetings, note-taking, and tools that source company knowledge.\n\n\"The winners will be companies that build the muscle of day-to-day use early enough for the gains to compound,\" said Hoffman in an X post.\n\n\"Start learning now, or watch the advantage slip away,\" he added.",

In events like the 800-meter freestyle, she's her own biggest competition, breaking her own world records in the quest for her personal best.\n\n\"I do really love the training,\" she told Business Insider. \"And I think because I love the training, it makes it very easy to go to practice every day and really continue to strive toward these big goals that I've set for myself.\"\n\nLedecky's training plan involves long hours in the pool, of course. But her dry-land workouts incorporate a mix of high-intensity circuits and weightlifting to build muscle.\n\n\"Swimming is a full-body exercise. So upper body strength, lower body strength, core strength, mobility, all those things are important,\" Ledecky said.\n\nThe gold medalist's approach can help you get the most out of your gym time even if you're not headed for the Olympics, with simple strategies to level up your workouts.\n\nA typical workout for Ledecky includes movements like cleans, squats, deadlifts, and pull-ups that help build explosive athleticism to stay ahead in the pool.\n\n\"Things like that translate well to developing power and pushing off the wall,\" she said.\n\nNon-swimmers can benefit, too: full-body exercises are one of the most efficient ways to build muscle, since you're working arms, legs, core, and back all at once. They can also improve mobility if you're training in a full range of motion.\n\nLedecky also incorporates circuit training with bike sprints and sled pushes. These shorter bursts of high-intensity exercise are great for improving your cardio fitness when you're short on time, and are linked to better longevity.\n\nLedecky has been swimming since she was six, and competed at her first Olympics (London 2012) at age 15.\n\nSince then, she's been to the Olympics three more times, dominating at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, in Tokyo 2020, and Paris 2024. She's also held multiple World Championship titles.\n\nThe training doesn't stop between big events. To stay focused leading up to international competitions, she said her approach is all about showing up to put in the work, over and over again.\n\n\"I've just always had a goal of consistency and I take it one year at a time, one day at a time,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor everyday athletes, it's a good reminder to find a sustainable exercise routine. Personal trainers recommend starting small and building up over time, since exercise only works if you can keep doing it long enough to see results.\n\nLedecky said one of her favorite aspects of swimming is the intensely supportive community, from the youngest athletes who start at age six to the most elite competitors.\n\n\"It's seen very much as an individual sport, but I think many swimmers would say they couldn't do it without their team. There's such great camaraderie,\" she said.\n\nThat team spirit, encouragement, and playful rivalry among friends is what keeps Ledecky going through early-morning sessions in a cold pool and long hours of hard training.\n\nA good fitness community can make a big difference for everyday athletes, too — research shows you're more likely to stick to a workout plan and get results if you find a gym buddy (or many).\n\n\"It makes the motivation piece really easy when you know that you're in it with someone else,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor peak performance, training is only part of the equation. Resting is crucial to allow the body to build back stronger. Ledecky has been competing for over a decade, and at 28 said she needs more recovery time than before.\n\n\"When I was 15, I don't remember ever feeling tired,\" she said. \"I'm definitely making sure that I'm getting extra sleep at night and getting naps in when I can.\"\n\nThe Olympian said she prioritizes getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet (she loves a veggie omelet and has a partnership with egg brand Eggland's Best). The basic habits work better than an elaborate or high-tech protocol, according to Ledecky.\n\n\"It's not anything too crazy or too out there,\" she said. \"It's really just the simple things I think are the most important things.\"",

    "description": "Waymo expands its self-driving robotaxi service to Miami, covering key neighborhoods and planning future airport and highway access.",
    "fullText": "Waymo is expanding its robotaxi service to Miami on Thursday, putting the Alphabet-backed company another step ahead of competitors racing to deploy fully autonomous cars in the US.\n\nA company spokesperson told Business Insider that Waymo will invite users in Miami gradually before expanding the service to everyone. More than 10,000 residents have signed up, according to Waymo.\n\nThe initial service area will cover 60 square miles. This includes the Miami's core corridor: Design District, Wynwood, Brickell, and Coral Gables.\n\nFor now, the geofence does not include Miami Beach. The company said it has plans to expand to Miami International Airport.\n\n\"We're excited to offer its residents and visitors a safe, reliable, and magical way to move around and look forward to earning their trust with every ride,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a statement.\n\nA Waymo spokesperson didn't disclose a specific number for the initial Miami deployment but said that the service will start with a limited number of vehicles before expanding.\n\nWaymo will be opening the service to everyone later in 2026, according to the spokesperson.\n\nThe spokesperson did not share how many riders Waymo will invite for the initial launch.\n\nFor now, Waymo's robotaxis won't be available on highways. The spokesperson said those routes will be available to public riders later this year.\n\nRiders can only request a robotaxi through the Waymo app.\n\nThe company is not partnering with other ride-hailing companies for the initial Miami launch. In some service areas, like Austin or Atlanta, riders can hail a robotaxi through Uber.\n\nWaymo is outsourcing the management of its fleets, including charging and maintenance, to Moove, a Nigerian mobility fintech.\n\nWaymo said in its press release that its AI driver will be able to handle conditions from sunny weather to \"tropical downpours.\"\n\nA Waymo spokesperson said the company will operate the robotaxis only when conditions fall within its safety framework and will heed local guidance during unsafe weather, adding that the company has validated its AI driver across adverse conditions such as flooding, debris, and outages.\n\nWaymo has previously had to pause its service during flash flooding and large-scale power outages.\n\nIn December, Waymo's robotaxis were seen stuck in the middle of intersections after a blackout in San Francisco that affected more than a third of the city's residents.\n\nThe company said at the time that its remote operating center was overwhelmed with requests from its vehicles seeking additional confirmation on how to navigate downed traffic lights.\n\nWaymo will be the first fully autonomous ride-hailing service open to the public in Miami.\n\nAmazon's Zoox and Tesla Robotaxi have shared that they are targeting the Florida city for future deployments.",

    "description": "The Southern chicken chain is going after the city's bagel-lovers with its menu of biscuit breakfast sandwiches.",
    "fullText": "Bojangles' breakfast is built on Southern cooking traditions, and now the chain hopes it's a recipe for success in New York City.\n\nThe chain, headquartered in North Carolina but with locations across the Southeast, opened its first New York location in Brooklyn on January 12.\n\nBojangles' new Flatbush restaurant features 38 dine-in seats and a drive-thru, tapping into a broader trend of New Yorkers' enthusiasm for grab-and-go breakfast.\n\n\"New Yorkers are famous for eating their bagels and cream cheese, and I think we're going to turn a lot of heads with our fresh-made buttermilk biscuits and our really flavorful chicken filets,\" Marshall Scarborough, the chain's vice president of menu and culinary innovation, told Business Insider.\n\n\"We've learned from all the Southern cooks out there, the grandmas and the Southern chefs that have been making this stuff for many years,\" he said. \"We're just taking what we've learned and modernizing it for today's customer.\"\n\nThat approach is most evident in Bojangles' all-day breakfast menu, which has long been a defining part of the chain's identity.\n\nThe chain is entering a city with deeply entrenched breakfast habits — a 2024 survey found that the average New Yorker eats roughly 111 bagels a year — but Scarborough believes Bojangles' biscuits can compete with local staples.\n\nThe menu is simple, focusing on favorites like bacon-egg-and-cheese, sausage-egg-and-cheese, and chicken sandwiches, all served on the chain's buttermilk biscuits. As part of its expansion in the North, the chain is also testing made-to-order iced coffee.\n\n\"It's not just a sad breakfast,\" Scarborough said.\n\nWhen Business Insider visited the new Bojangles restaurant ahead of its grand opening, we found juicy, well-seasoned chicken and flaky biscuits, which the chain said involves a \"49-step process.\" Bojangles believes quality is essential to winning over new customers.\n\n\"There's a lot of art and science that goes into making the perfect biscuit,\" Scarborough said.\n\nAs fast-food chains contend with declining foot traffic, rising prices, and consumers who are more selective about where they spend their money, breakfast is emerging as a promising growth opportunity.\n\nChains from McDonald's to Dunkin have upped their breakfast offerings in recent years, focusing on value-driven meal deals they hope will become a part of customers' daily routines. For its part, Bojangles says 31% of its sales at its company-operated full-size locations occur before 11 a.m.\n\nBut breakfast still remains a challenging daypart for fast-food chains.\n\nNation's Restaurant News reported that breakfast traffic at quick-service restaurants fell 8.7% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period the previous year. The decline is steeper than at other dayparts: Lunch dipped 2%, while dinner grew 1.8%.\n\nBojangles hopes that by offering something slightly different in the fast-food breakfast landscape, it will translate to sales among office workers and families seeking convenient, filling meals.\n\n\"You want to be the office hero — bring a box of biscuits,\" Scarborough said.",

    "description": "Timothée Chalamet just earned his third acting Oscar nomination thanks to his role in \"Marty Supreme.\"",
    "fullText": "Timothée Chalamet could join the history books as the second-youngest best actor winner of all time if he takes home the Oscar this year for \"Marty Supreme.\"\n\nIn 2018, the 30-year-old landed his first nomination at just 22 for his role in \"Call Me By Your Name.\" Chalamet was nominated again at last year's ceremony for his performance in the Bob Dylan biopic \"A Complete Unknown.\"\n\nBut he's the closest to the statue this year with the ping-pong sports drama \"Marty Supreme,\" for which he has already won the Golden Globe and the Critics' Choice Award.\n\nThe actor has also starred in critically acclaimed movies such \"Dune,\" \"Interstellar,\" \"Lady Bird,\" and \"Little Women.\"\n\nHere are all 23 Chalamet movies, ranked by critics' scores.\n\nAbby Monteil and Eve Crosbie contributed to a prior version of his story.\n\nThe actor starred alongside Diane Keaton, Steve Martin, and Amanda Seyfried in the holiday comedy \"Love The Coopers,\" which centers on a troubled family coming together for their annual Christmas Eve celebration.\n\nDespite its talented cast, the movie was criticized for its cloying, overbearing script.\n\nNPR critic Scott Tobias described the film as \"holiday entertainment that feels like a horror movie.\"\n\nBased on Stephen Elliott's memoir of the same name, \"The Adderall Diaries\" follows a troubled writer (James Franco as Stephen) who becomes obsessed with a high-profile murder case. Chalamet has a small role playing the teenage version of Stephen.\n\nThe movie received largely negative reviews for its inability to translate Elliott's memoir into a compelling onscreen story.\n\n\"'The Adderall Diaries' is about nothing but itself,\" wrote IndieWire critic David Ehrlich. \"It's not fiction, it's forgery. It's not adaptation, it's erasure.\"\n\nChalamet had a small role in \"Men, Women, & Children,\" which revolves around a series of interconnected characters who are negatively affected by technology.\n\nMany critics took issue with the movie's patronizing, outdated view of social media and the internet, and found its characters two-dimensional as a result.\n\n\"Men, Women, & Children' curates the world of technology into a tiny sliver of only the most outlandishly evil elements, and pretends that perspective is reason for despair,\" wrote Teo Bugbee for The New Republic.\n\nAfter making waves for his role in A24's 2017 movie \"Lady Bird,\" the actor starred in \"Hot Summer Nights,\" another offering from the popular indie film distributor. Here, he played an awkward teenager who begins dealing drugs in Cape Cod during the summer of 1991.\n\n\"Hot Summer Nights,\" which was written and directed by Elijah Bynum, was largely criticized for its inability to sustain a compelling story outside its nostalgic '90s visuals.\n\n\"While Bynum captures the year of [1991] and its transitional early-'90s fashions with melancholic vividness, his paper-thin story of minimal character development ultimately resolves to a shrug,\" wrote Time Out critic Tomris Laffly.\n\n\"One & Two\" centers on two siblings (Chalamet and Kiernan Shipka) with supernatural powers who plot to escape from the family property on which their father has imprisoned them.\n\nAlthough \"One & Two\" received mixed reviews, many critics found that its quiet coming-of-age meditations gave the young adult movie some much-needed substance.\n\n\"[Director Andrew Droz Palermo's] affinity for naturalism — complemented by Shipka and Chalamet's introspective performances — prevents 'One & Two' from being co-opted by the tired tropes of recent YA fantasies,\" wrote Ehrlich for Time Out.\n\nThe actor was criticized for starring in Woody Allen's 2019 film \"A Rainy Day in New York\" after Allen's daughter, Dylan Farrow, had accused her father of sexually abusing her when she was a child. Allen has denied the allegations.\n\nChalamet later apologized for his involvement in the project and pledged to donate his \"A Rainy Day in New York\" salary to the anti-harassment movement Time's Up, RAINN (an anti-sexual violence organization), and the LGBT Center in New York, per The Wrap.\n\nThe movie itself, which follows a love triangle that forms when a young couple (Chalamet and Elle Fanning) spends a weekend in New York City and meets an old acquaintance, Chan (Selena Gomez), received lukewarm reviews for its predictability.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's Jordan Mintzer called it \"merely a watchable rehashing of [Allen's] preferential themes and plot points, set in a present-day Manhattan so nostalgic and unreal it might as well be a period piece.\"\n\nDirected by Adam McKay, this Netflix-released film starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as astronomers who make an astounding discovery of a comet orbiting within the solar system, and it's hurtling directly toward Earth.\n\nChalamet played Yule, a skateboarding, live-streaming, long-haired outsider who unexpectedly connects with Lawrence's character, Kate, as the end of the world draws nearer.\n\nWhile the film remains one of the streaming platform's most-watched movies, it wasn't such a hit with critics.\n\n\"It's a disaster movie in more ways than one,\" Rolling Stone's David Fear wrote in his review, noting that \"while McKay may believe that we're long past subtlety, it doesn't mean that one man's wake-up-sheeple howl into the abyss is funny, or insightful, or even watchable.\"\n\n\"Beautiful Boy\" is based on a pair of memoirs by journalist David Sheff and his son, Nic Sheff. The movie tells the real story of David (played by \"The Office\" alum Steve Carell) struggling to help Nic (Chalamet) overcome his meth addiction, and the leading duo's soulful performances largely helped writers look past its aimless structure and muted emotional beats.\n\nChalamet was nominated for a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Nic.\n\n\"Chalamet now leaves no doubt that he's an actor of refined and profound gifts,\" wrote The Washington Post's Ann Hornaday. \"His performance in 'Beautiful Boy' helps elevate a boho-bourgeois melodrama to something that aspires to be more achingly real and human.\"\n\nThe actor briefly appeared in \"Hostiles,\" which tells the story of a 19th-century Army captain (Christian Bale) escorting a group of travelers on a treacherous journey through the American West.\n\n\"Bursts of intense violence are punctuated with sometimes tedious blocks of speeches and silence, but 'Hostiles,' despite its posture of brutal amorality, has a goodness at its core, of understanding and empathy,\" wrote The Associated Press critic Lindsey Bahr.\n\nChalamet played royalty in \"The King,\" bringing the monarch King Henry \"Hal\" V to life in the Netflix original movie. \"Twilight\" and \"The Batman\" star Robert Pattinson also appeared as \"The Dauphin\" (the historical term for a French king's youngest son).\n\n\"The lithe, doe-eyed Chalamet may feel too physically slight for the role, but he brings a fierce emotional intelligence that moves his Hal much closer to believability,\" wrote Leah Greenblatt for Entertainment Weekly.\n\nChristopher Nolan's sci-fi epic \"Interstellar\" follows an astronaut named Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who leaves his family behind to go on a space expedition that might hold the key to humanity's survival.\n\nThe movie stars many famous actors, such as Matt Damon and Anne Hathaway, but viewers might have forgotten that Chalamet also appeared in \"Interstellar\" in one of his earliest roles. The actor played the younger version of Cooper's son, Tom, while Casey Affleck portrayed the character as an adult.\n\n\"Yes, ['Interstellar'] may be tendentious at times and absurd at others,\" said The Atlantic critic Christopher Orr. \"But the scope and ambition of Nolan's vision are refreshing in this era of safe bets, of sequels and spinoffs and franchise-hopefuls.\"\n\nTold in an episodic fashion, Wes Anderson's \"The French Dispatch\" focuses on an American newspaper in a fictional French city as it celebrates the life of its recently deceased editor in chief.\n\nAs well as Chalamet, the eclectic cast includes stars Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Saoirse Ronan, Léa Seydoux, Willem Dafoe, and Owen Wilson.\n\nChalamet's section of the film is told from the point of view of Frances McDormand's character, a reporter. She meets Zeffirelli (Chalamet) while he's in the middle of organizing a student uprising.\n\n\"The film is — to use a French term — a jeu d'esprit with no depth to its characters or edge to its satire,\" Nicholas Barber at the BBC wrote in his review of the film, adding that Anderson's \"craftsmanship is so overwhelming that unless you're already allergic to his tics and trademarks, you should get a buzz from the film's many, many incidental pleasures.\"\n\nSet in the late 1980s, \"Bones And All\" follows Maren (Taylor Russell) and Lee (Chalamet) as a pair of young lovers with, let's say, interesting appetites, who develop feelings for each other on a road trip.\n\nThe film marked Chalamet's second collaboration with Italian filmmaker Luca Guadagnino following \"Call Me By Your Name.\"\n\nAudiences may have found the film's subject matter hard to stomach, but Chalamet and his costar were praised for their performances.\n\nAs ABC's Peter Travers wrote in his review of the film: \"It's the romantic sweetness of the two leads, even playing lovers ravaged by killer impulses, that carries you through their fiendish odyssey.\"\n\nChalamet played the titular character in this prequel to Roald Dahl's children's book, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" which was previously adapted into the 1971 movie \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\" and 2005's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\"\n\nThe film follows a young, driven Willy Wonka as he embarks on his journey to open the candy shop of his dreams. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance.\n\nWriting for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz described the film as a \"breezy two-hour musical comedy\" that hopes to \"make the audience shed a sentimental tear or two, but is mainly content to amuse, delight, and inspire cheers when the bad guys are defeated.\"\n\n\"A Complete Unknown\" follows a young Bob Dylan in the early 1960s as he embeds himself in — and later extricates himself from — the Greenwich Village folk scene, alongside other real-life legends like Joan Baez and Pete Seeger, played by Monica Barbaro and Edward Norton, who received Oscar nominations for their roles.\n\nChalamet's portrayal of Dylan was five years in the making, allowing him ample time to embody the musician and even learn to play and sing like the legendary singer. It was worth it; he earned his second Oscar nomination for the film.\n\nAs critic Mark Kennedy wrote for the Associated Press, \"A Complete Unknown\" is Chalamet's \"most ambitious work to date, asking him not only to play insecure-within-a-sneer but also to play and sing 40 songs in Dylan's unmistakable growl, complete with blustery harmonica.\"\n\nBased on the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, 2021's \"Dune\" marked the third time the story had been brought to life, following the David Lynch-directed movie in 1984 and Syfy miniseries in 2000.\n\nChalamet took on the lead role of Paul Atriedes, a young nobleman who must travel to the desert planet Arrakis to secure the future of his family and people.\n\n\"Chalamet plays Paul as someone alternately tempted by and fearful of his prophesied future, and the mythic powers that carry him further and further from normalcy,\" David Sims wrote for The Atlantic.\n\n\"Miss Stevens\" revolves around its titular high school teacher (\"American Horror Story\" star Lily Rabe), who chaperones three of her students (Chalamet, Anthony Quintal — aka Lohanthony — and Lili Reinhart) on a weekend trip to a drama competition.\n\nChalamet appeared as high schooler Billy, who is dealing with a behavioral disorder.\n\n\"'Miss Stevens' [...] is a small but likable film,\" wrote Christopher Orr for The Atlantic. \"The true standout, however, is Timothée Chalamet, who plays the most troubled of the teacher's charges.\"\n\nIn the follow-up to Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune: Part One,\" Chalamet returns to continue the story of Paul Atreides as he seeks to avenge his father's death while fulfilling the ancient prophecy that an off-world prophet will bring prosperity to the planet of Arrakis.\n\nThe sequel also introduced a handful of new characters played by Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, and Christopher Walken.\n\nCritics lauded the movie for its epic scope and powerful performance by its lead, with Inverse's Hoai-Tran Bui dubbing it \"the best sci-fi epic of the century.\"\n\nChalamet won his first Golden Globe for his performance as Marty Mauser, a young hustler determined to become the next table tennis world champion, in \"Marty Supreme.\"\n\nHe also won the Critics' Choice Award, and is one of the frontrunners at the Academy Awards this year.\n\n\"Chalamet is fantastic in this role. It may very well be his best work yet, in a career filled with excellent performances,\" wrote Max Weiss for Baltimore Magazine.\n\nChalamet reunited with \"Lady Bird\" director Greta Gerwig for her adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic book \"Little Women.\" The story centers on the four March sisters as they come of age during the Civil War.\n\nChalamet played Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, the March family's wealthy neighbor who becomes infatuated with the sisters (particularly Saoirse Ronan's Jo and Florence Pugh's Amy).\n\n\"Timothée Chalamet plays charming boy-next-door Laurie in a more quiet and pensive way than the character has typically been portrayed,\" wrote Danielle Gensburg for The Chicago Reader. \"'Little Women' is a beautiful story about family and love, the creativity and imagination that comes with childhood, and the challenges and sacrifices we make as we grow up.\"\n\nAdapted from André Aciman's best-selling novel, \"Call Me By Your Name\" tracks the summer romance that unfolds between 17-year-old Elio Perlman (Chalamet) and 24-year-old graduate student Oliver (Armie Hammer), who is studying at the Perlmans' Italian home.\n\nChalamet received his first Oscar nomination for best performance by an actor in a leading role at the 2018 Academy Awards for his portrayal of Elio.\n\n\"'Call Me By Your Name' is a visually stunning coming-of-age story that boasts a star-making performance by Chalamet,\" wrote Calvin Wilson for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nIn the animated rom-com created by rapper Kid Cudi, Chalamet voiced a character named Jimmy, the best friend and confidant of Cudi's character Jabari.\n\nThe film, which was released in 2022 alongside an album of the same name, follows Jabari as he attempts to balance success and love when he moves into his dream Manhattan apartment and falls for his next-door neighbor.\n\nRobert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times called the special \"sweet, corny and fairly adorable rom-com,\" that benefited from the gimmick of \"being animated and the musical tie-in.\"\n\nIn Gerwig's 2017 film \"Lady Bird,\" headstrong 17-year-old Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) clashes with her equally strong-willed mother (Laurie Metcalf) as she dreams of attending college beyond her quiet hometown of Sacramento, California.\n\nChalamet played Kyle Scheible, Lady Bird's high school crush. The movie received near-unanimous praise for its warm, wistful meditations on mother-daughter relationships and growing up.\n\n\"As teen movies go, ['Lady Bird' is] supremely sophisticated, capturing and crystallising that moment in adolescence when it seems that life is at last about to start and the only place you want to be is elsewhere,\" wrote Sandra Hall for The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nNote: All scores were current on the date of publication and are subject to change.

    "fullText": "When a one-of-a-kind aircraft from World War II needs work done, not just any body shop will do.\n\nAt the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, staff members repair and preserve historic aircraft in an in-house restoration hangar that offers a behind-the-scenes look at the work that goes into maintaining the museum's collection.\n\nThe Smithsonian museum's second location, situated about 30 miles from the National Air and Space Museum's flagship site in downtown Washington, DC, offers an expansive setting with 340,000 square feet of exhibit space.\n\nThe Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar, which is connected to the exhibits, can accommodate several aircraft at a time and houses everything workers might need, including a sheet-metal shop, a welding room, a paint room, and a fabric shop.\n\nIt also features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the hangar, allowing visitors to watch the work happening in real time.\n\nHolly Williamson, public affairs specialist at the National Air and Space Museum, told Business Insider that visitors shouldn't expect to see planes being built with the speed of a factory assembly line. Progress can be slow, with some restoration projects spanning months or years.\n\n\"This kind of will look like paint drying if you just sit here for the whole day,\" Williamson said. \"It's a lot of research. It's very detail-oriented.\"\n\nDespite the slow pace, there's still plenty to see. One of the museum's longer-term projects is \"Flak-Bait,\" a Martin B-26 Marauder that flew 202 combat missions during World War II, including D-Day.\n\nWhen the museum first opened in 1976, visitors were allowed to touch the aircraft's nose, which wore down the paint. Workers have focused on restoring its appearance while preserving its authentic combat damage.\n\n\"It flew more missions than any other aircraft in World War II for the US, so we want it to look like it's been through hundreds of missions,\" Williamson said.\n\nAnother striking display is a Sikorsky JRS-1 seaplane, the only aircraft in the museum's collection that was present at Pearl Harbor when it was attacked on December 7, 1941. After Pearl Harbor, the Sikorsky JRS-1 patrolled for Japanese submarines. It arrived at the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar in 2011.\n\nStaff members are also working to restore a McDonnell F-4S Phantom II, a fighter and bomber that shot down an MiG-21 during the Vietnam War. After the Vietnam War, it underwent modernization and was redeployed in 1983, remaining in service until its last squadron duty in 1987.\n\nThe rest of the hangar floor is a maze of tools, machinery, aircraft parts, and storage bins, indicators of just how intricate the museum's restoration efforts are.\n\nCertainly more interesting than watching paint dry.",

    "description": "My partner and I spent 10 weeks backpacking through South America. Some of my favorite places we visited were Puerto Natales, Chile, and Machu Picchu.",
    "fullText": "In the summer of 2022, I quit my full-time job to spend 10 weeks backpacking through South America with my then-boyfriend (now-husband).\n\nConsumed by the travel bug, we packed up all our belongings and moved them from our Miami apartment to a storage unit before hitting the road, visiting 16 cities across eight countries.\n\nThe whole trip was incredible, but four places hold a special place in my memory. From ancient wonders and bustling cities to breathtaking mountains, each of these destinations has a unique draw that would bring me back in a heartbeat.\n\nI couldn't quite place my finger on why, but as soon as we arrived in Buenos Aires, I had a feeling I'd love the city — and I was right.\n\nOn the cab ride from the airport to the hotel, we passed long stretches of waterside parks with miles of bike lanes. I enjoyed seeing how bike-friendly the city is — there's even a system in place where riders can rent them for free.\n\nBeyond being a cyclists' paradise, Buenos Aires was full of energy, with no shortage of fun things to do and neighborhoods to explore.\n\nDuring our time there, my partner and I enjoyed visiting a free botanical garden (Jardín Botánico Carlos Thays), shopping at street fairs, touring the underground tunnels (El Zanjón), and savoring delicious Argentine steak.\n\nFrom Buenos Aires, we flew south to Ushuaia, Argentina. We were immediately greeted by a blizzard, and the snow-capped mountain views were unlike anything I'd seen before.\n\nWe tried to be as budget-conscious as possible on our trip, but in Ushuaia, we spontaneously splurged on a private plane ride over Tierra del Fuego National Park. I never imagined I'd be on a tiny plane with a bird's-eye view of both Chile and Argentina, but sometimes the most unexpected experiences turn out to be the best.\n\nAnother highlight of Ushuaia was the boat tour we took through the Beagle Channel. We spent a couple of hours on the water, taking in breathtaking mountain views, as well as a picturesque lighthouse, sea lions, and even elephant seals.\n\nSadly, we missed penguin season by less than a month, so I'd love to return sometime between October and March to do a penguin boat tour.\n\nPuerto Natales, Chile, is located in the Patagonia region of South America.\n\nWe spent about two hours traveling from our hostel in the city to Torres del Paine National Park. During the journey, I squealed with excitement as we passed herds of guanacos (close relatives of llamas), gasped in awe at the mountains, and held my breath as our little rental sedan drove over unpaved, rocky roads.\n\nAnd when we arrived, I thoroughly enjoyed hiking up mountains, around lakes, and past icebergs. It was the first (and as of now, only) time I've seen a glacier — a paradise for true outdoor adventure lovers like myself.\n\nIt may not come as a surprise to see Machu Picchu on this list — it's one of the New Seven Wonders of the World for a reason.\n\nWhat caught me by surprise, though, wasn't the ancient city itself (which, to be clear, was absolutely amazing), but the winding bus ride to the citadel through lush, cloud-covered mountains. It seriously felt like being in another world.\n\nThe icing on the cake was seeing the llamas that roam freely throughout the ancient wonder. I'm a sucker for cute animals, and they stole my heart.",

    "description": "The rise in Japanese bond yields is an \"explicit warning\" that the US could see its own bond market revolt, Ken Griffin said.",
    "fullText": "The bond vigilantes could make a comeback soon.\n\nThat's the big message Citadel CEO Ken Griffin thinks the US got this week.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Griffin pointed to the sharp sell-off in Japan's bond market as investors balked at a potential pause on food taxes, a policy proposal that caused the nation's 40-year government bond yield to hit a record high.\n\nThat dynamic could play out in the US if the fiscal situation doesn't improve, the hedge fund icon warned.\n\n\"I actually think there's an explicit warning that if your fiscal house is not in order, the bond vigilantes can come out and retract their price,\" Griffin said.\n\nBond vigilantes are a hypothetical group of investors who stage a sell-off in bonds to pressure the government to be more fiscally responsible. When worries begin to fan over inflation or rising debt levels, the selling pressure causes bond yields to rise, which can influence lawmakers to turn their hand to more macro-friendly policies.\n\nWorries about growing deficits in the US have already led long-end yields to rise in recent years, with stock and bond prices beginning to move in tandem, Griffin noted. He called the trend \"particularly troubling\" for a few reasons:\n\n\"So mortgage rates will be higher. The cost for us to finance our deficits will be higher,\" Griffin said. \"I think that what happened in Japan is a very important message to the House and to the Senate: You need to get our fiscal house in order,\" he added.\n\nBond investors have long been concerned about rising deficits in the US, but fears about another bond market revolt have spiked in recent weeks as investors take in fresh geopolitical tensions and a slew of new policy initiatives from President Donald Trump.\n\nMost notable are the president's push to make housing more affordable and his earlier proposal that he could impose new tariffs on Europe if Greenland weren't soon up for sale. Though the tariffs have been called off, both initiatives are believed to stoke inflation, which weighed on the demand for US bonds.",

    "description": "Google launched free SAT practice tests via Gemini, with Princeton Review content, challenging traditional tutoring and ed-tech firms.",
    "fullText": "Students have long studied for the SATs with endless flashcards and prep books that doubled as doorstops. There's also personal tutors and prep classes for those who can afford it.\n\nGoogle debuted free, on-demand practice tests for the SAT through Google Gemini on Wednesday. The content of these tests is vetted by the Princeton Review — one of the publishers of those study tombs — while feedback is given by Google's AI.\n\nWhile the practice tests are only available for the SAT, Google teased that more exams were coming in the future.\n\n\"For anything you don't understand, you can ask Gemini to explain the correct answer,\" wrote Google DeepMind's Carol Walport. \"By helping you identify specific knowledge gaps, Gemini empowers you to turn those insights into action.\"\n\nWe’re launching full-length, on demand practice exams for standardized tests in @GeminiApp, starting with the SAT, available now at no cost.\n\nPractice SATs are grounded in rigorously vetted content in partnership with @ThePrincetonRev, and Gemini will provide immediate feedback… pic.twitter.com/GmivPuBp7B\n\nIt's another blow to the tutoring industry, a small but lucrative space coaching young adults toward academic success. College prep is especially high-earning. One SAT tutor told Business Insider last year that he charged $135 to $155 an hour; an essay tutor said he made $200,000 while only working nine months.\n\nIt's not the first time technology has eaten into the largely human tutoring industry. PDFs of practice tests have long run rampant around the internet. Tools like Quizlet and Chegg have made it easier for students to share study materials.\n\nThe threat of AI is wholly new, though, and the industry is still figuring out how to respond.\n\nIn 2023, Chegg's stock crashed 49% in a single day after the company said students were using ChatGPT to study. Two years later, the company laid off 45% of its workforce — or 388 employees — while citing the \"new realities of AI.\"\n\nSal Khan, the founder of the online tutoring program Khan Academy, said in 2023 that AI could be the \"biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen.\" Khan aims to give every student an \"artificially intelligent, but amazing, personal tutor.\"\n\nThe AI companies also know that education is a space where they can grow. Anthropic launched Claude for Education in April, which included student programs and a \"learning mode.\" Elon Musk's xAI has Grokipedia, a knowledge base similar to Wikipedia.\n\nOpenAI launched its Study Mode in July, when Business Insider declared education a \"new battlefield in the AI war.\"\n\nIn his famous 2023 letter about the future of AI, Bill Gates gave significant space to his predictions for education. Teachers would need to adapt, he wrote, but they wouldn't go away entirely.\n\n\"Even once the technology is perfected, learning will still depend on great relationships between students and teachers,\" Gates wrote. \"It will enhance — but never replace — the work that students and teachers do together in the classroom.\"\n\nBut for students and parents evaluating their options ahead of SAT season, Gemini's new test-prep offerings are the latest competition for human tutors.",

    "description": "Seasoned interior designer and design historian Alessandra Wood said she'd never put some colors, window treatments, and design elements in her home.",
    "fullText": "With so many design options and changing trends, it can be difficult to decide what items are worth buying and which you may want to skip in your own home.\n\nSo, Business Insider has been checking in with interior designers for tips and inspiration. This time, we spoke with Alessandra Wood, an interior designer and design historian with over a decade of industry experience.\n\nHere are a few items and trends Wood said she'd never have in her own home — plus a few styles she'd opt for instead.\n\nMason jars have been a popular interior-design trend for years, especially among those who like rustic or farmhouse aesthetics. They can be found on Pinterest as repurposed soap dispensers, lighting fixtures, flower vases, candle holders, and so on.\n\nHowever, these decorations can feel a bit too homemade for Wood.\n\nThough mason jars work well for storing leftovers and dry goods, she said she'd never use them as decorative accents in her home.\n\nInstead, she'd opt for more stylized accents and fixtures that fit her personal design style.\n\n\"For soap dispensers, you can find beautiful natural materials that take a sculptural vibe,\" she told BI. \"And for lighting fixtures, the world is your oyster.\"\n\nWood said she also avoids \"filler\" accessories, or decorative objects that are mass-produced and essentially meant to fill empty space.\n\n\"While these pieces can be great when they really speak to you, oftentimes we find ourselves buying them just to buy something,\" Wood said.\n\nInstead, she prefers to have a more curated look in her home, focusing on displaying decor with meaning.\n\n\"Choose decorative accents that you find yourself drawn to and really love or ones that you collect on your journeys,\" Wood told BI. \"I like to use this approach when deciding what to put in my home space and nix the objects that don't support a larger narrative.\"\n\nShe's not a huge fan of roller shades, a type of window covering that typically features a single piece of material that can be rolled up and down using a string or chain.\n\n\"I had these in my bedroom as a child,\" Wood said. \"I know they've come a long way since then, but I can't have them in my current home.\"\n\nCordless roman shades, which can be pushed and pulled, can be a stylish alternative, she added. They're easy to operate and can add softness to a window.\n\nThough a clothing rack can look chic in a bedroom, Wood said, it's just too hard to keep it organized and display-worthy on a daily basis.\n\n\"This only looks good when curated and perfect, which is a lot to ask for something that you use every single day,\" she told BI.\n\nShe said she'd rather have an armoire, which allows you to store clothing and accessories behind closed doors. That way, you don't have to rearrange your belongings daily to keep your room looking perfect.\n\nTextured walls and ceilings aren't her cup of tea, either, though she acknowledges they can be costly to remove in a home if they're already there.\n\n\"Unless your walls are made of plaster, which has a gorgeous, natural texture, I would always refrain from adding texture to sheetrock,\" Wood said.\n\nSmooth sheetrock has a crisp look and feel, and doesn't limit your decor options later. For example, she said, it's challenging to put up wallpaper on textured walls and nearly impossible to use peel-and-stick options.\n\nA room that's painted red and black screams \"teenage boy\" or \"boudoir,\" Wood said. She avoids this color palette in her home.\n\n\"Pure reds can be quite aggressive and carry a lot of energy with the color, especially when paired with black,\" she told BI.\n\nIf you really like red, you may want to use a reddish brown that retains the hue's warmth while adding softness. You can pair this color with earthy neutral tones for a more subdued look or with earthy greens for a bit of contrast, she suggested.\n\nFaux flowers are also a pass for Wood.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of faux flowers,\" she told BI. \"While they do add a pop of color, they feel like dust collectors to me.\"\n\nInstead, it's better to use a real bouquet or living plant to add life to a room.\n\nThough polypropylene rugs can be affordable and often come in trendy colors and patterns, their synthetic material is not ideal.\n\nThey're primarily made of plastic, which can break down and look worn in a few years, Wood said.\n\n\"Instead, I prefer to invest a bit \n\nFor example, wool rugs can be easy to clean, durable, and hypoallergenic.\n\n\"When you see a room that has a bed, nightstands, and dressers totally matching, it feels like the set was purchased right off the showroom floor and lacks the personality of the occupant,\" Wood told BI.\n\nThough a few matching pieces can create harmony for those who love order, she said, don't go for the full furniture suite.\n\nIt's important to mix in different textures and materials so your space looks more organic and feels much more personalized, she added.\n\nAccording to Wood, mirrored walls have a certain vibe that's just not ideal for a home.\n\n\"While mirrors do wonders to add light and brightness to rooms, floor-to-ceiling mirrored walls have a distinctly dated feel,\" she said. \"They feel more appropriate for a ballet studio than a living room or bedroom.\"\n\nWood recommended hanging large mirrors above a sofa or on a bedroom wall to get the same effect without having the feel of a 1980s Miami Beach condo.\n\nBathroom vanities with an all-in-one molded sink can look really basic, Wood told BI.\n\nShe said these are often the cheapest options available and a \"quintessential piece\" in flipped homes that lack style.\n\nInstead, Wood prefers vanities with stone counters and a separate sink made of a different material.\n\n\"This will make your bathroom look much more personalized and feel a bit more luxurious,\" she added.\n\nClick to keep reading other things interior designers say they would (or would never) have in their own space.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 4, 2021, and most recently updated on January 22, 2025.",

    "description": "Moodys' chief economist Mark Zandi is worried that strong headline data is masking underlying weakness, while the wealth effect in markets could wane.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zandi isn't feeling great about the economy as 2026 get underway.\n\nThe top economist at Moody's Analytics was ringing the alarm all throughout 2025, and he's still convinced that the headlines about strong GDP and a stable economy are masking other issues.\n\nZandi's thesis centers on the weakness he sees in the labor market, which he believes is being masked by a strong headline GDP number.\n\nIn his latest outlook for 2026, Zandi wrote that while the US economy is expanding, the growth is fragile. Whether it becomes stronger in the coming year will largely depend on the Trump administration's policies, specifically regarding tariffs and immigration.\n\nIf economic policy continues in its current direction, Zandi maintains that the problems that plagued the US last year are likely to persist, and even reasonably high GDP growth can't cover up the cracks below the surface.\n\nZandi said there are several reasons to believe the likelihood of a recession is high.\n\nThe economy is growing, but not fast enough\n\nThe economy may look strong, but Zandi said that the numbers look misleading. Accounting for the six-week government shutdown, he estimates that real GDP growth in the fourth quarter will be 2%. That's short of the growth rate needed to employ everyone entering the labor force, and continued growth below potential will ultimately be a hindrance to further expansion.\n\n\"Of course, the economy cannot consistently grow below its potential for long. This is not sustainable. Consumers and businesses will eventually lose faith in the economy and become more cautious in their spending and investment, leading to even more job losses and higher unemployment,\" he said. \"Recession will ultimately ensue.\"\n\nThe deteriorating labor market is a clear recession indicator\n\nZandi has repeatedly flagged problems in the labor market as an indication of an oncoming downturn. For 2026, he is still deeply concerned about cracks in the labor market, as the economy isn't able to absorb new labor supply fast enough.\n\n\"That unemployment is definitively on the rise is evidence that the economy's 2% underlying growth rate is falling short of its potential rate of growth—the rate at which it needs to grow to employ all those entering the labor force,\" he noted.\n\nZandi added that hiring has fallen to levels historically in line with other economic downturn cycles, something that often precedes a recession.\n\nZandi has cautioned against relying on the stock market as an economic scorecard, and has said the wealth effect of rising asset prices could be clouding the broader picture of consumer health.\n\nHe acknowledged that the market's strength provided a much-needed tailwind for the economy in 2025, but also highlighted the possibility of the AI bubble bursting and creating wider systemic risks.\n\n\"If the stock market is a bubble and it bursts, wiping out this wealth, consumer spending will suffer a significant blow, triggering a recession,\" he stated. \"This is precisely what happened in the wake of the bursting Y2K bubble.\"",

    "title": "I spent years traveling nonstop. It took me too long to admit my 'dream life' was actually horrible for my health.",
    "description": "Traveling full-time was my dream, but it was bad for my mental and physical health in a lot of ways. Here's why I don't do it anymore.",
    "fullText": "I was living the dream — flying internationally nearly once a month for my work as a travel writer, crisscrossing the globe to cover incredible destinations.\n\nInvitations like cruising the Norwegian coastline and then jetting off to a buzzy restaurant opening in Las Vegas were too good to refuse, even if they were happening back-to-back.\n\nMeanwhile, the frequent long-haul flights, indulgent meals, packed itineraries, and erratic sleep schedules were quietly taking a toll on my health — I was gaining a substantial amount of weight and frequently feeling exhausted.\n\nI just told myself that less-than-stellar health was just the price of admission for this sort of career. After all, my job consisted of bucket-list-worthy experiences, like hiking in Peru and going on safari in Kenya!\n\nIt took me several years to admit to myself that I couldn't keep living this way.\n\nIn reality, the job of my dreams consisted of overnight flights where I'd get little to no rest, then hit the ground running as soon as I arrived at my destinations.\n\nAfter I'd fly back home from some trips, it would take me nearly a week to recover from jet lag. My stress levels were often cranked up, dealing with flight delays, deadlines, and navigation across different states and countries.\n\nWith grueling daily schedules on the road, I rarely had time to answer emails. I'd come home to a full inbox and even fuller calendar.\n\nThe regular exposure to dry air on planes wasn't helping my immune system, and neither was all the stress. I felt like I was constantly getting sick with colds, flus, or whatever was going around.\n\nMeanwhile, my diet wasn't balanced or nutritious. It largely consisted of indulgent meals on press trips, where I felt pressure to try everything so I could write about it.\n\nSaying no felt awkward, even when I knew I'd feel better if I could set firmer boundaries.\n\nOn top of all that, I wasn't exercising. After all, press trips run on tight schedules. I'd return to the hotel late, wake up early, sit in a van for hours between stops, and finish the day with a multicourse dinner.\n\nSome fellow writers managed to fit in workouts, but I didn't. It wasn't a priority for me then.\n\nAll the travel felt isolating at times, too. I was spending most of my days with publicists, fellow writers, and guides. They were all lovely people, but not permanent fixtures in my life.\n\nMy closest friends lived far away, and I kept postponing visits because I was always either traveling or catching up from being away.\n\nMeanwhile, my parents were getting older and needed more support.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of jet-setting, by 2019, it had become undeniable that my mother's memory problems went beyond normal aging. Finally, I felt compelled to take my health seriously.\n\nThere wasn't anything I could do to stop my mom's Alzheimer's from progressing, but I threw myself into researching the disease so I could know more about what the future held for her and, eventually, me.\n\nI worried whether a similar diagnosis — one millions of Americans share — could be in the cards for me someday.\n\nThough it's not preventable, some studies and members of the medical community suggest that certain lifestyle changes, like being physically active and managing blood sugar and blood pressure levels, may lower one's risk of developing some forms of the disease or delay its symptoms.\n\nEven if I couldn't prevent a future diagnosis, I knew finally taking care of my body and mind would be good for me. All that nonstop travel had been quietly wrecking my health, and the way I'd been living and working wasn't sustainable.\n\nIt's been over five years since I significantly cut back on travel.\n\nI exercise almost every day and try to regularly follow a balanced diet. I've since lost over 50 pounds and sleep much better.\n\nWhen I do go on trips, I do so with more intention and a lot of focus on the Northeast, close to home.\n\nI probably take an overnight or weekend trip within driving distance about every six weeks. I still fly for work once or twice a year, but I'm no longer constantly on the road, and my body feels the difference.\n\nWhen I go on bigger trips, I actually feel like I have more opportunities than I did before. Recently, I even hiked the Grand Canyon rim-to-rim, which I would never have attempted back when I was out of shape and constantly feeling drained.\n\nGiving up on my dream job wasn't easy, but I want to feel good and stay in great shape for as long as I can — even if that means finding peace at home instead of abroad.",

    "description": "After a difficult breakup, I was celibate for a year — until I met someone 10 years younger. He helped me believe in relationships again.",
    "fullText": "I was recently celibate for a year. Not out of choice, but because I was grieving the loss of a past relationship.\n\nAfter much post-breakup drawing out, I had finally cut ties with an ex. Ending all communication affected me in ways I hadn't foreseen, even when I was already dating other people.\n\nAs much as I tried — and even though I was filled with desire — I couldn't open up physically to anyone. But after several months, the distance allowed me to see that relationship for what it had been. I put it behind me and opened up to the possibility of healthy intimacy again.\n\nThat's when I met someone much younger than me.\n\nOne day, while searching on Hinge for someone who might help me come out of celibacy, I came across the profile of a 25-year-old man who seemed handsome and interesting.\n\nI didn't mind that he was 10 years younger. But I had other misgivings, like the fact that he lived 35 miles away. I sent him a \"like\" anyway.\n\nHe sent me a message right after matching. From the first few interactions, I noted that he was thoughtful, curious, and a true gentleman. He didn't wait around to ask me out; he was self-assured yet not cocky. I really wanted to like someone enough to be intimate, and his chivalry gave me the kind of reassurance I needed at that point.\n\nI met him a week later for drinks, and we had a nice time. However, toward the end of our date, he revealed that he was moving to another city. I encouraged his bold decision, but I also quietly decided that I would never see him again. Even though I wasn't looking for a serious relationship, I felt lazy about investing time and energy in someone who was leaving. I wanted something sustainable.\n\nThen again, when we hugged goodbye, I felt his strong, sexy back — and figured I could be a little flexible.\n\nWe kissed at the end of our second date, and then I was in. For me, physical connection is important. Every time I had turned someone down before, it was because I hadn't enjoyed the kissing or the touching.\n\nAfter we had sex on our third date, I knew I'd done the right thing by waiting. I wasn't just attracted to him; I felt a physical ease with him. Before we did anything, he asked me what I liked. He was attuned to my body and to our conversations. He was present and playful. In turn, I felt an absoluteness every time we had sex.\n\nBeyond the sex, we connected over our experiences as artists — inspiration, creativity, ambitions. These are all things I value deeply. In contrast with my previous experience, I felt there was mutual curiosity, support, and respect. He wasn't threatened by my dreams because he wasn't expecting me to give up anything for him. I relished this freedom. In him, I found exactly what I'd been seeking: not a boyfriend, but a real emotional connection.\n\nWe saw each other for three months, until he left. When I realized how much I liked him, I knew his departure would be hard for me, but I accepted his transience and the certainty of future pain for the respite he gave me.\n\nThe way I see it, this fling was a gift from life, light, and lightness after so much darkness and heaviness. He came along to lift the spell the past had over me and to help me reconnect with what gives me pleasure. Most importantly, he made me feel safe.\n\nWhat we had gave me the reassurance that those experiences are out there, and that good sex and real connection are, indeed, well worth waiting for.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Ellison, the former cryptocurrency executive and ex-girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, is now a free woman.\n\nEllison, 32, was officially released from the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Wednesday after about 14 months, a BOP spokesperson told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nBOP spokesperson Donald Murphy said Thursday that Ellison was released Wednesday from what's known as community confinement, which means home confinement or a halfway house. As Business Insider previously reported, the ex-FTX insider was quietly moved to community confinement from a Connecticut prison in October after serving roughly 11 months of her two-year sentence.\n\nAttorneys for Ellison declined to comment.\n\nIn December, online prison records listed Ellison's projected release date as February 20, but that date was pushed up about a month at some point, allowing for an even earlier release.\n\nEllison was sentenced to two years in prison in September 2024 after she pleaded guilty to conspiring with FTX founder Bankman-Fried in an $11 billion fraud scheme. The sentence also included three years of supervised release after prison time.\n\nShe was the CEO of Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried that helped FTX siphon money off of customers. Ellison was the star witness in Bankman-Fried's 2023 criminal trial.\n\nAt her sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan commended Ellison for her \"very, very substantial cooperation\" and her genuine remorse.\n\nHowever, the judge handed down a prison sentence because of the scale of the fraud, rather than the zero time behind bars her attorneys had asked for.\n\n\"For it to be a case this serious, to be a literal get-out-of-jail-free card — I cannot see a way to it,\" Kaplan said at the time.\n\nBankman-Fried was found guilty of seven counts of wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy charges in Manhattan federal court. He is serving a 25-year sentence at a federal correctional institution in Los Angeles while appealing his conviction and sentence.",

    "description": "These refurbished earbuds keep you aware of your surroundings while delivering clear audio.",
    "fullText": "The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds don't block out the world—they sit just outside your ears and let everything in. Traffic noise, conversations, the doorbell—all of it stays audible while your music plays alongside it. That makes these earbuds a better match for people who move around outdoors or just don’t like feeling sealed off. Right now, a certified refurbished pair in White Smoke is $125.99 on Woot. That’s a noticeable drop from the roughly $179 (refurbished) price on Amazon, where a brand-new pair still lists for $299. Bose handles the refurbishment directly, includes all original accessories, and backs the earbuds with a one-year manufacturer's warranty. Shipping is free for Prime members, with a $6 fee for everyone else, and the deal runs for nine days or until it sells out.\n\nEach earbud clips onto your ear using a flexible silicone band instead of resting inside your ear canal. Once you find the right fit (which may take a few tries), you should find them surprisingly stable. Runners and walkers will appreciate that they stay put without squeezing or irritating the ears, and with IPX4 water resistance, they can handle sweat and light rain, which is enough for most daily use. The earbuds support Bluetooth 5.3 with AptX Adaptive, so Android users get a small audio edge over iPhone users, but connection quality is solid across the board. Battery life averages about 7.5 hours per charge and stretches to roughly 27 hours with the case.\n\nSound quality is better than most open-style earbuds manage. Vocals come through cleanly, highs stay sharp, and the midrange has enough body to keep music from sounding hollow. Deep bass is where you feel the compromise. It’s there, but it doesn’t hit hard, which is most noticeable with bass-heavy genres. For podcasts, calls, and casual listening, though, the tuning feels balanced and easygoing. According to this PCMag review, the earbuds sound best around 70 percent volume, where detail stays intact without distortion. If you want high-quality, open-ear audio and don't mind a little trial-and-error with the fit, this is one of the better ways to try Bose’s latest without paying full price.",

    "title": "Spotify's 'Prompted Playlist' Feature Is Finally Coming to the US",
    "description": "The feature was previously only available in New Zealand.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Spotify announced \"Prompted Playlist,\" a new feature the company claimed let users \"steer the algorithm.\" This was a bold—if not vague—claim, to be sure, but it was backed by everyone's favorite tech trend of the last three years: AI. The pitch was that Spotify would let subscribers use the company's AI models to better control their listening experience, so long as they lived in the country of New Zealand. That's a very small slice of Spotify's very large user base.\n\nLuckily for those of us in the United States and Canada, Prompted Playlist is expanding to our side of North America. Spotify announced the move today, Jan. 21: Now, Premium subscribers in any of these three countries can access the feature, if they want to hand over the playlist reigns to Spotify's machine learning models.\n\nPrompted Playlist is Spotify's AI-powered tool that lets you use natural language to create custom playlists. The idea is, rather than look for songs to add to a playlist, you tell Spotify's AI what you're in the mood to listen to, and it adds songs automatically for you. That can include genres and existing songs, but also ideas, deeper descriptions, and, for lack of a better word, vibes.\n\nTo understand what I mean, here are some of the suggested prompts Spotify suggests you try:\n\n\"Make me a playlist of songs I’ve saved to my Library (playlists or Liked Songs) that I either haven’t played yet or have only listened to once. The goal is to round up those songs I found, saved, and then totally forgot to revisit. Give me a chance to finally hear what I’ve been missing.\"\n\n\"What are the first tracks I ever listened to on Spotify? Order them by the very first track I ever streamed - with date and time - and keep going.\"\n\n\"Knowing what I listen to today, make me a playlist of songs from 2016 that match my current taste, mixing the biggest tracks from that year with songs that feel timeless now.\"\n\n\"Make me a playlist to help me learn Spanish, with clear vocals and easy-to-follow lyrics. Mix popular Spanish-language songs with slower tracks that make it easier to catch the words, and include music that reflects different Spanish-speaking cultures to keep it engaging.\"\n\nSpotify says that Prompted Playlist takes your existing listening history into account as well. While you and a friend might give Spotify's AI the same prompt, in theory, you should each receive different playlists, since the AI will make adjustments based on the music you like and don't like. You also don't have to wonder why the AI put a specific song in the playlist: Each track starts with a \"quick one-liner\" that explains why Spotify chose it in the first place. I could see that being either insightful, or extremely annoying.\n\nThe thing is, Spotify has rolled out a feature like this before, appropriately dubbed \"AI Playlist.\" Lifehacker's David Nield covered it in September of 2024, and catching up on that feature, it sounds pretty similar to Prompted Playlist. AI Playlist isn't actually going away now that Prompted Playlist is here: Spotify tells me that these are two separate features, and that the major differences are that Prompted Playlist factors in your entire Spotify listening history, going back to your first song, as well as real-time information about \"trends, charts, culture, and history\" in the industry today. You can also schedule playlists if you like, so the mix refreshes every day or week, something you can't do with AI Playlist.\n\nFrom my seat, it also seems like Prompted Playlist is designed to handle more complex prompts, as well. While the company advertised AI Playlist as a way to build playlists from prompts like \"upbeat pop music for my road trip,\" the company's suggested Prompted Playlist prompts are much more intricate, and include multiple levels of instruction for the AI. Perhaps part of that is the result of improvements in the technology over the past year and half.\n\nPrompted Playlist is launching as a Premium-only feature, so if you don't pay for Spotify, you unfortunately can't access it. If you do have a Premium account, you'll need to head to Spotify, tap \"Create,\" then choose \"Prompted Playlist.\"\n\nAs explained above, from here, you can describe what kind of playlist you want the tool to make. From here, you'll be able to set how often it refreshes (if it refreshes at all). If you're not happy with the results, you can choose \"Edit Prompt\" to adjust it. You can share the playlist with friends, but know that Spotify will adjust the playlist to match their listening histories instead.",

That means you might not be able to check out posts, add new posts, or send and receive DMs—at least until Meta figures out what's causing the issue.\n\nInevitably, of course, it will: Outages and downtime happen, though it seems this week they're happening with increasing frequency. There was, obviously, Verizon (which the company attributes to a software issue), but also issues with Yahoo!, X, and Microsoft 365. Something's in the air this week, it seems. Whatever is going on with Instagram though, Meta will assuredly figure it in due time. Usually, these things are resolved pretty quickly, but if there's a deeper issue, us Instagram users may have to go without the app for some time.",

    "title": "Fitness Culture Has a Hyper-Personalization Problem",
    "description": "More isn't always better.",
    "fullText": "The latest craze in the fitness world—from gym culture, to nutrition planning, to recovery protocols— is hyper-personalized optimization. But is there really a benefit to at-home microbiome tests that reveal the optimal diet for your gut bacteria? How about a device that tells you whether you're burning carbs or fat with each breath?\n\nPersonalized fitness advice used to be largely limited to factors like height and weight, but now you might have a Whoop, Oura, or Apple Watch wearable tracking your track heart rate variability, skin temperature, blood oxygen, and so much more. Continuous glucose monitors, once reserved for diabetics, are now worn by biohackers and CrossFit enthusiasts trying to optimize their carb timing.\n\nOn the one hand, the appeal of having unprecedented insight into your body's unique needs is understandable. On the other, there's a looming shadow behind all this data: As the metrics multiply, so does the potential for anxiety. When every workout, meal, and bedtime becomes a referendum on dozens of competing data points, decision fatigue is likely to set in. And as your algorithms suggest targeted interventions for every perceived deficiency, someone else—likely a giant corporation getting fat off of user data—is profiting. The question looms larger with each new device metric: Does more data actually lead to better health outcomes?\n\nYour wearable spits out a sleep (or stress) report every morning. How is this data serving you? \"Metabolic testing, biomechanics, and body composition are all forms of objective data that can be pretty powerful when collected in validated settings and interpreted by professionals who understand physiology and adaptation,\" says Lekshmi Kumar, a performance physiologist at Boston-based Human Powered Health. But consumer devices, while improving, exist in a different category: \"Consistent research has bolstered consumer-facing tools and significant improvements have been made over the past several years. But they're still not considered substitutes for professional-grade assessments,\" Kumar says. In other words, for a lot of bio-hacking endeavors, there’s a major gap between the numbers you see and their potential real-life applications.\n\nKumar sees three critical prerequisites for data to actually improve outcomes: data quality, proper context, and accurate interpretation. \"Absent these, we often see expensive and excessive supplementation, conflicting recommendations, and decision fatigue,\" she says. The real danger, she says, isn't the data itself—it's the illusion of expertise it creates.\n\nMany direct-to-consumer tests lack the clinical validation of their medical-grade counterparts. Interpretation of the data is frequently automated, missing nuance that a trained professional might catch. And the recommendations often trend toward more—more supplements, more tracking, more intervention—rather than identifying changes that might actually move the needle. It's a hard truth that no wellness product actually cares more about your health than its company's profits.\n\nPerhaps the most insidious cost of hyper-personalization is less financial, and more psychological: When every metric matters, decision-making becomes paralyzing. Should you work out today even though your HRV is down? Is that meal worth the glucose spike? Did last night's 6.5 hours of sleep doom today's training session?\n\nThe constant feedback loop can transform exercise from a joyful practice into an optimization problem to be solved. This isn’t the first time I’ve pointed out the trappings of wellness culture. The internal compass—how do I actually feel?—gets drowned out by all the external data streams. Ironically, the tools meant to “empower” can instead create dependency, where you can’t trust their own bodily sensations without technological confirmation.\n\nWhen implemented thoughtfully (with quality data, proper interpretation, and professional guidance), personalized approaches can obviously aid you in optimizing training, recovery, and nutrition in ways generic programs cannot. Elite athletes have long used sophisticated testing—VO2 max assessments, lactate threshold testing, motion capture analysis—to gain advantages, however marginal. As these tools become more accessible, it makes sense their benefits can extend beyond the professional realm.\n\nBut accessibility without expertise? That’s a different matter. Consider two hypothetical people concerned about their fitness: Person A tracks sleep quality, HRV, resting heart rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, glucose levels, and workout strain—but lacks a framework to understand how these metrics interact, or what to do when they conflict. Person B follows a simple evidence-based program: strength training three times per week, 30 minutes of cardio on alternate days, eight hours of sleep, and a balanced diet with adequate protein. Even absent all that data, Person B will likely see better results and experience far less angst about their health.\n\nAgain, there are the economic incentives to consider too. Companies profit from selling more tests, more devices, more subscriptions, and more supplements. The business model depends on convincing consumers they need increasingly granular data to achieve their goals. This creates an environment where the answer to \"what should I track?\" is almost always \"more than you're tracking now,\" regardless of whether the additional data actually serves you.\n\n\"The biggest gains won't come from chasing every single flashy metric,\" says Kumar. \"They'll come from identifying the variables that matter most to the specific individual, and working with a credentialed professional who can assist in translating the information into meaningful takeaways and actions.\"\n\nWhat does smart, targeted tracking look like in practice? Here are scenarios where specific metrics can genuinely help:\n\nFor a runner struggling with fatigue: Tracking HRV and resting heart rate can reveal when you're not recovering adequately between training blocks. If these metrics trend downward over weeks, it's a signal to dial back intensity or add rest days—something that matters far more than monitoring glucose fluctuations after breakfast.\n\nFor someone with persistent digestive issues: A food diary paired with symptom tracking (not necessarily a microbiome test kit) can help identify genuine patterns. Working with a registered dietitian to systematically eliminate or reintroduce foods provides actionable insights, unlike a $200 test suggesting you eat more fermented foods.\n\nFor someone desperate to improve sleep: Use your gadgets to track total sleep time and sleep consistency. That matters more than obsessing over REM percentages. Focus on establishing a regular pre-sleep routine and measuring whether you feel rested, rather than achieving some algorithm's \"optimal\" sleep score.\n\nFor the lifter hitting a plateau: Remember that linear gains are for beginners. Instead of stressing over daily scale readings, focus on your training log tracking progressive overload and consider following these tips.\n\nYou'll notice a patter here: Each tracking approach is targeted, time-bound, and directly connected to a specific goal or problem—not a fruitless pursuit to optimize every single thing all the time.\n\nIn a culture obsessed with optimization, it’s getting harder and harder to cut through the noise. But maybe your goal shouldn’t be to track everything. As hyper-personalization continues its ascent, think about how you’re engaging with every new tool. The wisest approach may be a picky one: choosing one or two key metrics that align with specific goals. Because more information isn't automatically better, and consumer tools have real limitations, and that the human body is beautifully, frustratingly complex—not exactly reducible to a dashboard of numbers.",

    "fullText": "Another wave of malicious browser extensions capable of tracking user activity and compromising privacy have been found across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, some of which may have been active for up to five years.\n\nThe campaign, known as GhostPoster, was identified by Koi Security in December and included 17 Firefox add-ons designed to monitor users' browsing activity. Threat actors planted malicious JavaScript code in the extension's PNG logo, which served as a malware loader to retrieve the main payload from a remote server. Researchers at LayerX have found an additional 17 malicious extensions across multiple browsers that have collectively been installed more than 840,000 times.\n\nAccording to the report from LayerX, GhostPoster initially targeted Microsoft Edge and then expanded to Chrome and Firefox. The malicious add-ons may have been active as early as 2020 and include the following:\n\nGoogle Translate in Right Click\n\nTranslate Selected Text with Google\n\nSave Image to Pinterest on Right Click\n\nTranslate Selected Text with Right Click\n\n\"Google Translate in Right Click\" alone had 522,398 installs. The next most popular add-on was \"Translate Selected Text with Google\" with 159,645 installs. Researchers also found a more sophisticated variant of the campaign in \"Instagram Downloader,\" which had 3,822 installs.\n\nGhostPoster malware has built-in safeguards to prevent detection—for example, activation is delayed by 48 hours, and it only communicates with remote attack servers under certain conditions. Once installed, though, extensions that are part of GhostPoster have the ability to hijack affiliate traffic (and redirect commissions to attackers), strip and inject HTTP headers to weaken security, bypass CAPTCHA, and inject iframes and scripts for click fraud and user tracking. The only sort-of good news is that the malware doesn't harvest credentials or engage in phishing.\n\nWhile the malicious extensions are no longer available to add in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, users who have them installed should remove them immediately, as they remain active until explicitly deleted.",

You can make your own predictions below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.",

    "fullText": "First one-day international, R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 271-6 (50 overs): K Mendis 93 (117), Liyange 46 (53); Rashid 3-44\n\nEngland 252 (49.2 overs): Duckett 62, Root 61; Madushan 3-39\n\nSri Lanka won by 19 runs, lead three-match series 1-0\n\nEngland changed formats and opponents, yet still followed their dismal Ashes campaign with defeat by Sri Lanka in the first one-day international in Colombo.\n\nOnly two weeks after the completion of their 4-1 series defeat in Australia, England were choked by the Sri Lanka spinners on a slow, low surface.\n\nSet a taxing 272 to win thanks to 93 not out from Kusal Mendis, the tourists were given a platform by a much-needed 62 from Ben Duckett and a typically classy 61 by Joe Root.\n\nBut both were out playing sweeps to the skilful Sri Lankans, and the required rate spiralled out of England's control.\n\nThe visitors lost eight wickets for 84 runs, including Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell both stumped.\n\nJamie Overton's hitting meant 20 were needed off the final over, but his miscue to cover left England 252 all out. The margin of 19 runs made the contest look closer than it was.\n\nEngland go 1-0 down in the three-match series, having now lost their last 11 ODIs away from home.\n\nThe second match of the series is at the same ground on Saturday.\n\nIn the aftermath of a high-stakes, high-intensity Ashes series, the contrast of a low-key tour of Sri Lanka could either be a welcome change for England, or an unwanted return to the grind.\n\nFive of England's Ashes squad were in the XI in Colombo. A sixth man, Will Jacks, would have played, only to be ruled out by illness. Brydon Carse is also in the squad.\n\nThere are consequences to this ODI series and the three T20s that follow. England need ODI wins to ensure automatic qualification for the 2027 World Cup, while the T20s are preparation for the World Cup in the shortest format next month.\n\nFor head coach Brendon McCullum, wins in the white-ball format may ease some of the pressure on his position. Captain Brook needs positive results on the field to move on from the controversy of being punched by a nightclub bouncer in Wellington.\n\nConditions that demand the bowling of and batting against spin are a historical weakness for England, and the task for the Ashes players was made all the harder given the switch from the pace and bounce of Australia.\n\nAfter the criticism of their preparation down under, England had only two training sessions in Colombo – this time no fault of their own because of the tight turnaround.\n\nThey can expect plenty more spin in the coming weeks. Their challenge is to adapt and improve quickly.\n\nA target of 272 was modest by the standards of modern ODIs, but well above par at this venue – only three times have more runs been chased to win a one-dayer on this ground.\n\nZak Crawley, playing his first ODI in more than two years, was out in familiar fashion – edging a drive at a wide one for only six, before Root and Duckett gave England a chance.\n\nDuckett looked horribly out of touch, swishing and swiping. The left-hander had 21 from the first 37 balls he faced, then found rhythm after two fours in the same over. This was his highest score in any cricket since the last Test against India in July.\n\nRoot, an expert in these conditions, was sublime, finding gaps and running hard. Still, even at 129-1, England were not fully in control.\n\nDuckett was lbw reverse-sweeping the leg-spin of Jeffrey Vandersay, Root leg before conventionally sweeping the off-spin of Dhananjaya da Silva delivered from round the wicket. England fell apart.\n\nSri Lanka found increasing turn, England found ways to get out. Brook ran past Chamira Asalanka to be stumped down the leg side and Bethell – who struggled to 15 off 32 balls – was stumped between bat and pad off left-armer Dunith Wellalage.\n\nAs England faltered, they were given some hope by Rehan Ahmed's 27, until he was brilliantly caught relay-style by Wellalage at long-off. Overton clubbed 34 from 17, though a heist never seemed likely.\n\nEngland named three frontline spinners - Jacks was replaced by Ahmed – and probably needed more. Bethell only bowled three overs of his left-arm spin, Root did not bowl at all.\n\nThe 33 overs of spin delivered by England was their second-most in an ODI. Adil Rashid was superb, dropping his pace for 3-44, while Liam Dawson managed 41 dots in his 1-31.\n\nCurran also impressed with his variations. At times he was almost bowling left-arm spin, and a 49mph 'moon ball' deceived Pathum Nissanka for England's first wicket.\n\nWhen Sri Lanka were 124-4, England had the opportunity to restrict the hosts, only for Mendis and Janith Liyanage to build a crucial partnership of 88, helped by some England errors in the field.\n\nLiyanage crunched two sixes in his 46, while wicketkeeper Mendis used all his experience and nous to hold the innings together. Time and again he showed deft touches to find the boundary behind square on the off side.\n\nWith Mendis as the fulcrum, Sri Lanka found 80 runs from the final 10 overs, an acceleration that would later prove beyond England.\n\nOverton's hit-the-deck style was entirely unsuitable to the surface and he went at more than seven an over. Wellalage took him for three fours and a six in a final over that cost 23 – vital given the eventual difference between the two sides.\n\nEngland in Sri Lanka 2026 - schedule\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"[The toss] proved very crucial in the end. Sri Lanka played a very good game and deserved the victory.\n\n\"We bowled really well through the middle. Spinners bowled exceptionally well. But they got hold of us in the last over - but that's part of one-day and white-ball cricket.\n\n\"They've got extremely good spinners who were able to get enough out of the surface. They challenged us in a lot of different departments.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka: \"I know that are a few areas we need to improve, especially fast bowling.\n\n\"We knew that the first 25 overs it wasn't going to spin. Suddenly I think after the 25th-30th over it started, and we bowled really well.\"\n\nWhat is Curran's ultra-slow 'moon ball' leaving batters in a spin?\n\nWright stands down as England national selector\n\nSL hold nerve to beat England despite Overton's late hitting - as it happened",

    "fullText": "The Florida Panthers are back on the road again.\n\nAfter a brief stop in South Florida for Monday’s matchup with the San Jose Sharks, the Panthers boarded a plane on Wednesday bound for the great white north.\n\nAssuming they can defrost, Florida will kick off a three-game road trip Thursday when they face the Winnipeg Jets at Canada Life Centre.\n\nHopefully the Cats brought their fur layers, as the temperature on Thursday in Winnipeg has a high of minus-17 and a low of minus-22.\n\nWhen they eventually hit the ice, Florida will be playing against a Jets squad that is desperately trying to bounce back from an atrocious stretch that took up most of November and December.\n\nAfter winning nine of their first 12 games, the Jets went into a tailspin that peaked with an 11-game losing streak that ran from mid-December to early January.\n\nThey went from a strong 9-3-0 start to the season to holding a 15-22-5 mark on Jan. 8 (that’s a 6-19-5 run for those wondering).\n\nSince ending the losing streak, Winnipeg has seemingly turned a corner, going 5-1-1 over the past couple weeks.\n\nThey will face a Florida squad that is also trying to make up ground and viewing every potential point in the standings as crucial.\n\nIt helps that the Panthers are getting healthier, welcoming Matthew Tkachuk into the lineup for the first time on Monday against San Jose.\n\nWith Tkachuk back in the fold, it’s just a matter of time before Florida’s forward ranks become as potent as they’ve been all season, which will happen when Brad Marchand is cleared to return.\n\n“He’s certainly close, day-to-day,” Maurice said of Marchand, who has missed six straight games with an undisclosed injury. “Whether it happens on this road trip, I don’t know yet. We are just kind of building off how he comes in each day. He felt better today than he maybe expected to (after) he got through practice. So we’ll need him to wake up tomorrow at least, and then probably the next day, before we start feeling that he’s right there.”\n\nFor Maruice, any time Florida returns to Winnipeg, it’s a special night for him.\n\nMaurice spent nine seasons coaching the Jets, leading them to the playoffs five times.\n\n“I do look forward to it,” Maurice said of returning to Winnipeg. “There’s great memories in that place, so it’s a fun trip.”\n\nSince joining the Panthers in 2022, Maurice has yet to see Florida pick up a victory in his old stomping grounds, going 0-3-0 in Winnipeg by a combined score of 14-5.\n\n“I don’t know if we’ve ever won in there,” Maurice said with a smile. “Other than the final scores, it’s been good.”\n\nHere are the Panthers projected lines and pairings for Thursday’s tussle in Winnipeg:\n\nEetu Luostarinen – Anton Lundell – Sam Reinhart\n\nCarter Verhaeghe – Sam Bennett – Matthew Tkachuk\n\nMackie Samoskevich – Evan Rodrigues – A.J. Greer\n\nSandis Vilmanis – Luke Kunin – Jesper Boqvist\n\nLATEST STORIES FROM THE HOCKEY NEWS - FLORIDA\n\nSeth Jones replaced on Team USA Olympic roster due to injury\n\nPanthers' Niko Mikkola Exits Game Early, Misses Practice But Is Still Expected To Play Against The Jets\n\nPanthers local TV viewership numbers continue to rise\n\nAs Panthers get healthier, salary cap could be major obstacle in Florida suiting up its full roster\n\n'We loved it,' Panthers Players Discuss Sergei Bobrovsky's Goalie Fight With Sharks' Alex Nedeljkovic",

    "description": "Hope arrives for Houston fans as explosive receiver Tank Dell nears return for the 2026 season, poised to reignite the offense and boost C.J. Stroud's performance.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Texans are coming off a disappointing end to the 2025 season, as the franchise was blown out by the New England Patriots in the Divisional round of the playoffs. Fans may be upset with how things ended, but the franchise is in the midst of its best stretch in history, having won a postseason game in each of the last three seasons. Things could also be looking up as Tank Dell will likely be returning for the 2026 season.\n\nDell has faced a ton of adversity in his career. The wide receiver attended three different colleges on his way to being the Texans' third-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. He had an immaculate rookie season in 2023, hauling in 47 passes for over 700 yards and seven touchdowns. The young wideout has dealt with injury issues since then as he missed the entire 2025 season while recovering from a knee injury he suffered at the end of the 2024 campaign.\n\nGeneral Manager Nick Caserio spoke to the media on Wednesday, providing updates on many topics. He spoke about Dell, and the executive shared that the wide receiver should be ready to go for the team's offseason program.\n\n#Texans GM Nick Caserio says the team expects Tank Dell to be ready for the offseason program.\n\n— Sam Warren (@samwarren_3) January 21, 2026\n\nThis is great news, as it means Dell will return to the lineup for the 2026 season. This brings Houston back one of its offensive weapons, while also giving quarterback C.J. Stroud back one of his favorite targets.\n\nDell and Stroud have always had a good connection, as evidenced by each player's numbers when they are on the field together. Dell has played in just 25 games in his career and has amassed 1,300 receiving yards while scoring 10 touchdowns. It's almost as if he makes the game a little bit easier for Stroud, which is something fans in Houston would like to see after the quarterback regressed once again during the 2025 campaign.\n\nStroud has been trying to get back to playing the way he did during his rookie season, but the quarterback has taken steps backward in his second and third years in the league. Dell returning to the lineup might spark some confidence in the quarterback, which hopefully will allow him to play the way he did in 2023.\n\nThe wide receiver room is a little more crowded now than it was in 2023, but Dell will hopefully fit back into the offense seamlessly once he is fully recovered from his injury.",

    "description": "England's secondary cup competition will adopt a format like the Champions League from next season – and will \"probably not\" be called the League Cup.",
    "fullText": "The Women's League Cup is undergoing a major revamp for next season which will include adopting a similar format to the Champions League and possibly altering its name.\n\nIt has already been confirmed that Women's Super League (WSL) clubs who qualify for the Women's Champions League will not compete.\n\nAnd in further changes, the WSL has said it plans to introduce a Swiss-style format for the league phase to guarantee more games for all participating teams.\n\nCurrently, all WSL2 and some WSL teams play in round-robin groups of four or five in the first round, with the winners progressing to the quarter-finals. Teams taking part in the Champions League - Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United this season - enter at the knockout stage.\n\nIn the revamped competition, all participating clubs would enter the league phase and be drawn to play six other sides.\n\nThe top eight teams in the league phase would progress to the quarter-finals. Unlike in the Champions League, there will be no play-off round because there is no space in the fixture calendar.\n\nThe name of the competition is still being discussed. It will \"probably not\" be called the League Cup because it will not have all the league teams involved.\n\nA WSL spokesperson said other options, including scrapping the League Cup, had been considered, but they felt these changes would give \"clarity of purpose\" to the competition.\n\n\"The calendar is one of the biggest constraints and challenges, there is only so much space on weekends for us to work with,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We've listened to fans and clubs, and it felt like it didn't have complete purpose, including Champions League teams entering at the quarter-final stage.\n\n\"We even put on the table, do we not have a secondary cup competition?\n\n\"But the challenge is that top players at top clubs get loads of minutes, loads of matches. If you are in the WSL2, you have a real disparity – we want to close that gap.\n\n\"We looked at whether Champions League clubs could enter a secondary team, but at this stage we deemed it was not possible.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said plans were being finalised with clubs and commercial partners, and would be put before the Football Association within the next four weeks.\n\nThe changes come amid the women's domestic calendar growing ever more crowded.\n\nThe Women's Champions League this season expanded from 16 to 18 clubs at the league phase, with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United involved – the first time three WSL teams had reached that point.\n\nArsenal and Manchester United will play in the knockout play-offs – a new round of games introduced this season - after finishing fifth and sixth respectively in the league.\n\nNext year the number of domestic top-flight games is also set to increase following the expansion of the WSL from 12 to 14 teams.\n\nWSL organisers have confirmed that teams who play in the Champions League will not drop into the secondary domestic cup even if they fail to progress through the qualifying rounds.\n\nBBC Sport also understands that the league phase will still be regionalised, as it is currently, to help clubs with travel time and costs.\n\nSponsorship of the competition is also uncertain. The deal with current sponsors Subway expires this summer, although it has an option to extend the contract by a year.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast. New episodes drop every Tuesday on BBC Sounds, plus find interviews and extra content from the Women's Super League and beyond on the Women's Football Weekly feed\n\nWomen's Club World Cup could be 'catastrophic' for WSL\n\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

    "fullText": "Atlético Madrid couldn't get past a draw in their Champions League match against Galatasaray. However, the big surprise of the night wasn't the result, but the performance of Marc Pubill.\n\nDue to absences in the defense, Simeone opted for the young full-back as a central defender, a risky decision that ended up resulting in a tactical showcase.\n\nPubill recorded an impeccable statistic in ball distribution with a 90.2% pass accuracy (37 out of 41 completed). His ability to interpret the game allowed the team to maintain possession under pressure, also adding zero ball losses in critical areas, a vital stat for his new position.\n\nIn the defensive aspect, the touch map reveals a constant presence in his own area and the central lane. His reading of the plays allowed him to intercept key balls that cut off the Turkish team's quick transitions.\n\nWith 59 total touches, the player demonstrated that his versatility is an invaluable asset for \"El Cholo's\" scheme. This performance not only secures the three points in Europe but also opens up a new range of tactical possibilities for the rest of the season.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Mercedes became the latest Formula 1 team to share their look for the new season, unveiling the striking W17 with a series of images released on Thursday.\n\nThe technical elements are in line with the incoming set of regulations, geared towards making the cars smaller, lighter, and more agile. The front and rear wings are smaller and the car is narrower overall, particularly when compared with previous season.\n\nFrom a livery standpoint, the design is a departure from what we have seen from Mercedes in previous years. A green line — a nod to title partner Petronas — anchors the car from the nose to the rear, drawing attention to a “transition” from silver to black as the eye trails along the W17. The iconic Mercedes three-pointed star dots the engine cover, while the sidepods contain a stunning array of silver lines.\n\nTop-down on the Mercedes W17 👁️#F1 @MercedesAMGF1 pic.twitter.com/MCTYSll4K9\n\n— Formula 1 (@F1) January 22, 2026\n\n“Formula One will undergo significant change in 2026, and we are prepared for that transition. The new regulations demand innovation and absolute focus across every area of performance. Our work on the new car, and the long-term development of the Power Unit and advanced sustainable fuels with Petronas, reflects that approach,” said Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff. \n\n“Releasing the first images of the W17 is simply the next step in that process. It represents the collective, sustained effort of our teams in Brixworth and Brackley. We will continue to push hard in the months ahead.”\n\nUp next for Mercedes — and the rest of the grid — is next week’s Barcelona Shakedown, where the teams will put their 2026 challengers through a private testing session. Two more testing sessions in Bahrain will follow next month.\n\nThe Silver Arrows will also officially unveil the W17 at a season launch event on February 2.",

    "description": "Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football according to Deloitte",
    "fullText": "Real Madrid continue to operate in a financial stratosphere of their own. According to Deloitte’s latest Football Money League report, Los Blancos have once again been crowned the highest-revenue club in world football — and by a significant margin.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the club tops Deloitte’s global ranking after generating €1.161 billion in revenue during the 2024–25 season. That figure represents a year-on-year increase of €115.5 million and places Real Madrid nearly €200 million ahead of second-placed Barcelona (€974.8m). It also puts them well clear of the Premier League’s financial heavyweights, with Liverpool the highest English club in fifth place on €836.1m.\n\nCrossing the €1.1 billion threshold further cements Real Madrid’s status as football’s dominant economic force. What makes the achievement even more striking is that it comes despite a season without major silverware on the pitch in 2023–24. While trophies remain the club’s ultimate objective, the numbers underline Madrid’s ability to thrive financially regardless of short-term sporting outcomes.\n\nDeloitte notes that football’s three primary revenue streams — commercial, broadcasting, and matchday income — all reached record levels across the industry. Real Madrid were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this growth, consolidating their place at the top of the global game.\n\nKey contributors included revenue generated through the operation of the renovated Santiago Bernabéu, alongside income from participation in elite competitions such as the Champions League and the Club World Cup.\n\nThe central pillar of Real Madrid’s financial dominance remains its commercial arm. According to Deloitte, the club’s commercial revenue increased by 23% over the previous season, fueled by stronger merchandising sales and the addition of new global commercial partners.\n\nThe scale of that growth is such that Real Madrid’s commercial revenue alone would be enough to rank the club inside the top ten of the Money League — a threshold currently occupied by Chelsea at €584.1m in total revenue. This commercial strength also helped Madrid absorb a 6% drop in matchday revenue, largely linked to fluctuations tied to stadium usage and scheduling.\n\nIn short, Real Madrid’s business model is no longer dependent on any single income stream. Instead, it is built on diversification, global reach, and the growing monetization of the Bernabéu as a multi-purpose venue.\n\nBelow is the full top-20 ranking from Deloitte’s report, highlighting just how far ahead Real Madrid currently stand:\n\nThe latest Money League figures reinforce a trend that has been developing for years: Real Madrid are not merely competing with Europe’s elite — they are financially separating from them (at least from a revenue standpoint). With sustained growth across commercial partnerships, global merchandising, and stadium-driven revenue, the club has set a benchmark few others appear capable of matching.\n\nAs football’s economic landscape continues to evolve, Deloitte’s report makes one thing clear: when it comes to revenue generation, Real Madrid are not just winning — they are redefining the scale of the game.",

    "fullText": "C.J. Anderson knows what it's like to beat the New England Patriots with a backup quarterback under center.\n\nDuring the 2025 season, starting quarterback Peyton Manning went down with a foot injury and Brock Osweiler was called on to start in his place. Osweiler ended up going 5-2 as a starter, including a 30-24 win against the Patriots in Week 11.\n\nDenver Broncos running back C.J. Anderson rushed 15 times for 113 yards and two touchdowns in that contest, including a 48-yard game-winner in overtime. That victory helped Denver (12-4) claim the No. 1 playoff seed over New England (12-4) later in the season.\n\nThat time the Broncos had a comeback win over the Patriots with C.J. Anderson’s 48-yard touchdown run in overtime. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/n6956b3izO\n\n— Sunday Night Football on NBC (@SNFonNBC) July 13, 2024\n\nTen years later, the Broncos are set to face the Patriots in the AFC Championship game with backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham under center following Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury.

    "description": "Oregon State women's basketball is beyond the halfway point of the 2025-26 season. Are the Beavers on track for March Madness?",
    "fullText": "The NCAA women’s basketball season has crossed over the halfway point.\n\nEyes are starting to turn toward postseason basketball as teams establish resumes worthy of a March Madness appearance.\n\nAmong them is Oregon State, which sits near the top of the West Coast Conference and is 14-6 overall (6-1 WCC) heading into the Jan. 22 home conference matchup with Gonzaga (also 14-6, 6-1)\n\nLeading the charge for the Beavers this season is junior guard Jenna Villa, a Washington native who’s averaging a team-high 15.9 points per game.\n\nNext to her are a pair of guards, Kennedie Shuler and Tiara Bolden, who are both averaging above 10 points per game. Shuler dishes out a team-high 5.6 assists per game, which is among the 25 best individual tallies in the nation.\n\nWins against Illinois, Utah State, Colorado State and a slew of WCC competition bolster the Oregon State resume, while the Beavers have losses to teams including Vanderbilt, No. 4 team in the USA Today’s coaches poll, Oregon and Arizona State.\n\nHow do the Beavers’ March Madness hopes stack up to the rest of the country?\n\nThe clearest path to March Madness for any team is to win the conference tournament. In 2025, Oregon State won the WCC tournament to earn an automatic bid to the dance.\n\nThis season, a competitive field of WCC opposition will challenge the Beavers to retain the throne.\n\nGonzaga, Oregon State and Santa Clara boast overall records securely above .500, while Loyola Marymount and Portland also hold strong conference records midway through the season.\n\nAll will be decided March 5-10 in Las Vegas, when the WCC hosts its conference championship. It’s a strong field, and bracketologists have conflicting predictions for which school will stand above the rest in the West Coast Conference.\n\nIn one prediction made by CBS’ Connor Groel, Gonzaga claims the WCC title to earn an automatic bid as a 12 seed. In another by ESPN’s Charlie Creme, the Beavers take WCC gold and an automatic bid as a 13 seed.\n\nThe WCC, notably, didn’t receive an at-large bid in 2025 but did in 2024 with Gonzaga.\n\nAccording to the NCAA, at-large bids are decided by a committee with a 10-step process that gathers a list of nominations, which is followed by an eight-step process that then ranks those nominations. Restrictions to nominees are lenient, but teams must hold a .500-or-better overall record.\n\nOregon State was 84th in the NCAA NET rankings, a tool used in the selection process, through Jan. 20 games.\n\nOregon State has become a familiar face in the field of 68 teams for the past decade or so under coach Scott Rueck.\n\nSince 2014, the Beavers have appeared in the Big Dance nine times. Of those nine, five have resulted in Sweet Sixteen appearances. Of those five, three ended in the Elite Eight.\n\nThe 2016 OSU team made it to the Final Four.\n\nWhen Rueck took over the program in 2010, something changed in Corvallis.\n\nRueck’s teams have been ranked in the top 25 in 10 different seasons. Rueck was named Pac-12 Conference coach of the year five times, he’s been nominated for numerous national coach of the year awards and OSU has won the Pac-12 three times.\n\nPrior to Rueck’s tenure, the Beavers had only made March Madness five times in school history.\n\nLandon Bartlett covers Oregon State and high school sports for the Statesman Journal.

    "fullText": "Leadership is the invisible currency of sports. Hard to quantify, but impossible to win without. The Athletic surveyed over 100 industry insiders to find the figures who command the most respect in 2025. From tacticians to culture-setters, these are the names that define the modern standard. Here are the top 15 most admired leaders.\n\nRole: Quarterback, Kansas City Chiefs​\nMahomes makes the list because his leadership is as effortless as his playmaking. He balances supreme confidence with a calming presence that stabilizes the entire franchise when chaos hits. He isn’t just the face of the Chiefs; he is the league’s competitive north star.​\n\nRole: President of Basketball Operations, Boston Celtics​\nTransitioning from the sideline to the front office, Stevens proved that elite basketball IQ translates anywhere.

It should come as no surprise to see that Clemson has been ranked high in Andy Katz's first NCAA Tournament bracket.\n\nThis ranking might look eerily similar to those who followed last season and it would be right to have this mindset. Last year Clemson came in at the 5 seed squaring off against 12 seed McNeese State Cowboys, which lead to a 69-67 upset knocking Clemson out in the first round.\n\nBut this time around the projections is that we would be playing Yale who currently sits second at 3-1 in the conference and 14-3 overall. They are currently in a tight Ivy League title race with Dartmouth. Last year Yale was the #13 seed and was knocked out by the #4 seed Texas A&M Aggies.

    "fullText": "Texas A&M baseball head coach Michael Earley's roster continues to garner national preseason accolades entering his second year at the helm in College Station.\n\nAccording to Perfect Game USA's Top Players by Class list, six Aggies were recognized as some of the best players in college baseball in their respective classes. It includes juniors Caden Sorrell, Chris Hacopian, Gavin Grahovac, and Shane Sdao, sophomore Terrence Kiel II, and freshman Nico Partida. After losing many top contributors to the MLB Draft in the spring of 2025, Earley reloaded well in the transfer portal and maintained decent roster retention.\n\nTexas A&M will look to put last year's woes behind it and turn the page to a new chapter in 2026. To accomplish that feat, it will take talent like Perfect Game USA's Aggie selections to contribute and stay healthy throughout the upcoming season.\n\nSee which Aggies made the @PerfectGameUSA Top Players by Class list this season 🔝 👀#GigEm pic.twitter.com/xOnyFyp13w\n\n— Texas A&M Baseball (@AggieBaseball) January 21, 2026\n\nThe Maroon and White stood atop the national preseason rankings before last season's first pitch, but it didn't last long. While Texas A&M's roster suffered many injuries to open last year's efforts, the team's underwhelming performances led to the Aggies becoming the first preseason No. 1 to miss the postseason since 1991. As a result, some national journalists, such as Baseball America's Jacob Rudner, have avoided ranking the program in the top 25.\n\n\"So, what’s the holdup? The decision to hold Texas A&M out is rooted entirely in last season’s outcome. A year ago, a similarly talented roster opened the season ranked No. 1 and missed the NCAA Tournament altogether. Michael Earley retooled his staff this offseason and early returns have been positive, but until the Aggies translate that talent into consistent results, the benefit of the doubt is withheld. The expectation is not whether Texas A&M belongs in the rankings, but whether or not it will prove it does,\" Rudner said.\n\nTexas A&M's first pitch of 2026 is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 13, against the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles in College Station. Game 1 is set for 6 p.m., with Games 2 and 3 scheduled for 2 p.m. CT on Saturday, February 14, and 12 p.m. CT on Sunday, February 15, respectively.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Dylan on X: @dylanmflippo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M baseball's 2026 roster racking up preseason accolades",

The Sixers will look to get back in the win column following a loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.\n\nIn order to do so, the Sixers will have to avoid a lull that bit them in a big way against the Suns. Philadelphia held a 7-point lead in the third, but Phoenix responded with a 38-18 run to take a 13-point lead into the fourth and the Sixers weren't able to recover. The Rockets present a challenge for Tyrese Maxey and Co., but this has been a resilient group that will have to rely on that in this contest.\n\nHere's when and where you should tune in to see the matchup:\n\nLocation: Xfinity Mobile Arena Philadelphia, PA\n\nChannel: NBC Sports Philadelphia\n\nSixers: PROBABLE: Joel Embiid (right ankle injury management) QUESTIONABLE: Paul George (left knee injury management)\n\nRockets: OUT: Steven Adams (left ankle sprain), Fred VanVleet (right knee ACL sprain) QUESTIONABLE: Aaron Holiday (back spasms)\n\nRockets: Association Edition (White)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers vs. Rockets game preview: How to watch, lineups, broadcast info",

    "fullText": "Jarrett Stidham has started four games in his NFL career and all of them came at the end of losing seasons, so he has no experience with what he's going to experience this weekend.\n\nBo Nix's fractured ankle has thrust Stidham into the starting quarterback spot for the Broncos in this Sunday's AFC Championship Game against the Patriots. The implications of the game for both the Broncos and Stidham are clear.\n\nA win would send the Broncos to the Super Bowl and it would take Stidham from unheralded backup to a household name overnight. On Wednesday, Stidham said he knows this is \"not about myself\" but how he can \"help my teammates succeed on Sunday.\" He said the approach to doing that is by keeping things as routine as possible despite the unusual circumstances.\n\n\"I think what I always go back to — in any game, regular season, preseason, the AFC Championship — it's still the same game,\" Stidham said, via the team's website. \"Obviously, there are implications and winner advances, all that kind of stuff, but at the end of the day, it's still football. That's how I view it. I'm not treating it any differently. I'm not treating my preparation any differently. I'm just going to go out there and play and be myself. I think that's the biggest thing. I'm not going to try to be somebody that I'm not. I know how I can play, and I know the kind of guys I have around me and the kind of team that we have. So, we all just have to play within ourselves.\"\n\nBroncos teammates and head coach Sean Payton have expressed confidence in Stidham's ability to handle being thrown into the fire in a do-or-die situation, but one look at the odds shows how much doubt exists outside of the organization. Stidham won't be able to quiet that before Sunday, so it is something else to ignore as he prepares for the biggest moment of his professional career.",

    "fullText": "It’s always interesting to see how a head coach votes during the final US LBM Coaches Poll, and for Notre Dame’s Marcus Freeman, he certainly tried to make a statement as shared by Tyler Horka.\n\nFor some odd reason, Alabama was still ranked ahead of the Irish, but not according to Freeman, who had the Crimson Tide a spot behind his team at No. 10. He also placed Brigham Young, a Notre Dame 2026 opponent who also was skipped over in the College Football Playoff at No. 11.\n\nThere was a big omission as well, as Freeman opted to leave USC out of his top-25 all-together. This was most likely a jab at the Trojans, who decided that they couldn’t play Notre Dame anymore due to the potential of missing out on the CFP. It was a weak eat out of the storied rivalry, and Freeman made sure they knew it as well.\n\nIt was fun to see how the Irish’s leader opted to vote in the final coaches poll, as he most likely didn’t have one of his staff members submit the picks.\n\nThis is Marcus Freeman’s final Coaches Poll ballot of the 2025 season, via @usatodaysports.\n\nOf note, out of 62 coaches…\n\n-He was one of 16 who had Notre Dame ranked ahead of Alabama.\n\n-He was one of 16 who did not rank USC. pic.twitter.com/T8em4buRBM\n\n— Tyler Horka (@tbhorka) January 21, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: See who Marcus Freeman omitted in his final coaches poll vote of 2026",

    "description": "Iowa State's Joshua Jefferson become the first player in program history to record multiple triple-doubles in a season, ending a two-game slide.",
    "fullText": "Iowa State star Joshua Jefferson had every opportunity to be a football player.\n\nHis father, Ben, played at Maryland along with the NFL and CFL. His two brothers played collegiately, with Cameron winning the Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos.\n\nAll are large humans on the offensive or defensive line.\n\nYet, Joshua chose basketball early. And with his 6-foot-9, 240-pound frame, he’s been a monster for the Cyclones.\n\nAnd the biggest reason for their most recent bounceback.\n\nAfter struggling for two games — both the Cyclones’ first and second loss of the year — he responded with a triple-double in a rout of UCF, becoming the first Cyclone to have multiple triple-doubles in a season.\n\nJohnson had 17 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds. He made 6 of 11 shots and had no turnovers.\n\n“I'm just proud of his ability mentally to lock in on the things that are important for us to be successful,” Iowa State coach TJ Otzelberger said, “and now we just gotta work together and maintain that every night out.\"\n\nIf Iowa State gets that every night from Jefferson, the two-game blip will be forgotten deep into March.\n\nLet’s get to this week’s Big 12 power rankings.\n\nMore: Iowa State basketball gets back to being Iowa State basketball | Hines\n\nThis week: vs. West Virginia (Saturday); at BYU (Monday)\n\nWhat to know: The Wildcats are one of only three unbeaten teams remaining around the country. And it really hasn’t been close in league play. They’ve beaten each team by at least nine points.\n\nThis week: at Texas Tech (Saturday); at TCU (Wednesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Cougars, winners of 11 straight, have won their last three games by an average of 27 points. Twenty-seven! That’s unheard of in the Big 12.\n\nThis week: at Oklahoma State (Saturday); vs. Colorado (Thursday)\n\nWhat to know: The Cyclones uncharacteristically lost two straight games then took out their frustrations on UCF. Getting back to lock-down defense was key, but Jefferson getting right was crucial.\n\nThis week: vs. Houston (Saturday)\n\nWhat to know: The Red Raiders set a Big 12 record with 14 first-half 3-pointers in a demolition of Baylor. They tied a program record with 17 3s in the game. So, now the team with the reigning Big 12 Player of the Year can overwhelm others from deep.\n\nMore: Texas Tech basketball demolishes Baylor behind trio of 20-point scorers\n\nThis week: vs. Arizona (Monday)\n\nWhat to know: Robert Wright III has been an excellent addition for the Cougars. The Baylor transfer is averaging 22.2 points in Big 12 play. He’s been so valuable that he missed one whole minute against Texas Tech, which went on a 6-0 run without him to take control.\n\nThis week: at Kansas State (Saturday)\n\nWhat to know: The Jayhawks have three straight wins but the health of coach Bill Self is the biggest concern. Here’s to hoping he is back on the team’s bench sooner than later.\n\nThis week: at Colorado (Saturday); vs. Arizona State (Tuesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Knights suffered back-to-back losses for the first time all season. Being without Jamichael Stillwell and losing Jeremy Foumena to an injury is a big problem for a team with a NCAA Tournament resume.\n\nThis week: at Baylor (Saturday); vs. Houston (Wednesday)\n\nWhat to know: David Punch is having a breakout season. His latest gem was a double-double and game-winning shot in a wild comeback over Oklahoma State. That avoided a five-game skid for the Frogs.\n\nThis week: vs. TCU (Saturday); at Cincinnati (Wednesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Bears are 1-5 in league play, but they have losses to conference contenders Iowa State, Houston, Kansas and Texas Tech. A softer schedule awaits.\n\nThis week: at Arizona (Saturday); vs. Kansas State (Tuesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Mountaineers are 4-2 in the Big 12, a bit of a surprise. Outside of the upset of Kansas, they’ve topped three of the bottom teams in the league, though.\n\nThis week: vs. Iowa State (Saturday)\n\nWhat to know: The Cowboys have not won at TCU since 2017, a streak that continued with a nine-point collapse this week. That loss will sting come March, especially with Iowa State, BYU and Arizona in three of the next four games.\n\nMore: Oklahoma State basketball collapses late at TCU as David Punch stuns Cowboys\n\nThis week: at Arizona State (Saturday); vs. Baylor (Wednesday)\n\nWhat to know: The Bearcats finally had a Big 12 winning streak, even taking down Iowa State. But nobody beats the No. 1- and No. 2-ranked teams in back-to-back games.\n\nThis week: vs. UCF (Saturday); at Iowa State (Thursday)\n\nWhat to know: The Buffaloes have lost four straight games. In that span, their 3-point percentage has drastically fallen. For a team built on a high-powered offense, that’s a problem.\n\nThis week: vs. Cincinnati (Saturday); at UCF (Tuesday)\n\nWhat to know: Sun Devils coach Bobby Hurley said a stretch of games against Arizona, BYU and Houston is like playing in the Final Four. His team didn’t quite respond well. ASU has lost 7 of 8 games.\n\nThis week: vs. Kansas (Saturday); at West Virginia (Tuesday)\n\nWhat to know: Down to just seven players, the Wildcats topped Utah for their first win in league play. But losing sharpshooter Abdi Bashir Jr. to a foot injury is potentially devastating to a team already struggling.\n\nWhat to know: The Utes have been scrappy, particularly in their last four games. Terrence Brown’s hot play has been a big reason.\n\nJacob Unruh is the deputy sports editor for The Oklahoman. Have a story idea for Jacob?

    "fullText": "The 2025 Ryder Cup will be remembered as one of the most intense and chaotic editions in the event’s history.\n\nFrom the opening tee shot, the atmosphere was raucous, with the European team heckled relentlessly by the home crowd.\n\nWhile some of the comments crossed the line, Viktor Hovland found humour in at least one of them.\n\nThe Norwegian, who played a key role for Europe, shared the moment that stood out most – a rare example of wit amid the noise.\n\nWhile much of the American crowd’s energy was directed toward unsettling Europe, one comment in particular made Hovland laugh.\n\nHe told Dan Rapaport: “One said, ‘Yeah, three Ryder Cups and no girlfriend. Kinda weird.’”\n\nKnown for his calm personality and sense of humour, the 28-year-old admitted that the remark was so unexpected that he couldn’t help but laugh.\n\nThe Norwegian’s reaction stood in stark contrast to some of his teammates, who were visibly frustrated by the constant heckling throughout the tournament.\n\nThe 2025 edition was widely described as the rowdiest Ryder Cup in history, with several moments where crowd behaviour pushed the boundaries of sportsmanship.\n\nStill, Hovland’s ability to stay composed summed up the approach that has made him one of the most popular figures in modern golf.\n\nHovland was asked to put together his version of the ‘perfect golfer,’ combining the best qualities of the players he most admires.\n\nHis choices showed both his respect for his peers and his insight into what separates the elite from the rest.\n\nThe selections reflected Hovland’s deep respect for his peers and his understanding of what makes each player elite in their own way.\n\nFrom McIlroy’s effortless power to Matsuyama’s creativity around the greens, his picks offered a thoughtful glimpse into how one of golf’s sharpest minds views greatness.",

But it looked as though his fate was sealed early - with no appearances in any competition since October and stuck on five games overall.\n\nLiverpool have been linked with a move to bring Elliott back from his nightmare loan spell with Villa having little inclination to activate the £35m clause.\n\nHowever the England under-21 international would be severely limited in his options for the second half of the season if he did come back.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThe Anfield club would be unable to send the playmaker on loan to another European club - as Elliott has already featured for two clubs in the 2025/26 season.\n\nTherefore the midfielder is stuck in a limbo - unable to be fixed up with a new deal and with no chance of first-team football at Villa or Liverpool for that matter.\n\nBut Elliott could be set for an UNEXPECTED Aston Villa reprieve.\n\nFollowing John McGinn’s knee injury against Everton at the weekend Villa are very much down to the bare bones in midfield.\n\nThe Scotland international joins Amadou Onana, Ross Barkley and Boubacar Kamara on the treatment table at Villa Park.\n\nEmery is quickly running out of options in midfield - utilising Dutch defender Lamare Bogarde in the engine room against the Toffees.\n\nWith McGinn sidelined he opted to bring in Evann Guessand and shuffle his deck but he has got nowhere to turn for the upcoming weeks unless he offers the olive branch to Elliott.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what he does over the on-loan Liverpool star for the games against Fenerbahce on Thursday as well as Newcastle at the weekend.\n\nNo one is saying Elliott is going to reach the 10-game threshold in order to facilitate a permanent deal.",

I was ready after five or six weeks, but because it was for a world title, we thought we had to do the full 12.”\n\nWhat might be an issue for Pimblett is that he has become used to longer camps throughout his career, especially in the UFC.\n\nBut being given a world title shot has made this training camp even more intense and is reportedly something that Pimblett has not enjoyed at all.\n\nPimblett explained: “I am very glad I did it for this fight, though, but I’ll never be doing another one unless it’s for Khabib [Nurmagomedov] in his comeback!”\n\nUFC 324 will be a first for Pimblett, as he’s never fought in January before. And if his comments to new UFC host Kate Scott are anything to go by, it’s not something he plans on repeating.\n\nDuring CBS’ coverage of the UEFA Champions League, he made it clear that fighting this early in the year doesn’t suit him at all.\n\nHe also made sure Dana White and the UFC know that future January or February offers will be turned down before they’re even made.\n\n“I’ve never fought this early before. This is the earliest I’ve ever fought,” Pimblett said.\n\n“I’m never, ever fighting in January or February ever again. I just hope everyone at the UFC knows that because it ruined my Christmas and ruined my birthday.\n\nPimblett doubled down on his stance, urging fans not to expect any matches from him so early next year either: “Next year, get on me in March.”\n\nPaddy Pimblett may be glad he didn’t go too heavy over Christmas, especially if it makes the weight cut down to 155 pounds a bit easier.\n\nJust days out from UFC 324, Pimblett gave an update on his progress, saying things are looking good as he aims to hit the championship weight limit for the first time in his career.\n\n“I’ve still got weight to lose but I’ve got less weight to lose now than I did have 12 hours before I fought Michael Chandler,” he said during the same interview.",

    "fullText": "Inter are making significant strides toward a sensational return for Ivan Perisic, with negotiations already reaching an advanced stage.\n\nAccording to Alfredo Pedullà, the Croatian international has given his total approval to a move back to the San Siro. Discussions with Perisic’s entourage are well advanced as the Nerazzurri seek a reliable wide option to bolster Cristian Chivu’s squad, especially given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Denzel Dumfries’ fitness. Questions have been raised about Luis Henrique’s abilities too.\n\nHowever, the timing of the deal hinges on PSV Eindhoven’s European journey. The Dutch side are currently in a delicate stretch of their campaign and will face Bayern Munich next Wednesday in a crucial Champions League clash. If PSV are eliminated from the competition, the path for Perisic’s departure is expected to clear immediately.\n\nThe 36-year-old’s desire to wear the Inter shirt again is the driving force behind the talks, and while the Italian giants remain respectful of PSV’s current commitments, an exit from Europe for the Eredivisie club could bring the transfer to life in the final days of the window.",

    "fullText": "On Monday night, Indiana defeated Miami to win its first ever national championship. With it, the 2025 college football season is now officially in the books.\n\nOn Tuesday, the final AP Poll of the season was released. USC came in at No. 20—four spots lower than where it ranked in the final regular season poll last month. The Trojans dropped their final game of the year, falling 30-27 to TCU in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nUSC was one of six Big Ten teams ranked in the final poll. The national champion Hoosiers were No. 1, followed by No. 4 Oregon and No. 5 Ohio State. In addition, Iowa was ranked No. 17 and Michigan No. 21.\n\nDoes it make sense to have USC three spots behind an Iowa team that the Trojans finished with the same record as and beat head-to-head? No. Is it worth complaining about at this point? Also no. Finishing a few spots higher in the final poll would not have meant much for USC in the scheme of things.\n\nNext season, USC is slated to face three of the top five teams from the final 2025 rankings. The Trojans will visit Indiana and host Ohio State and Oregon. It will certainly not be an easy road next year as USC enters what could be a make-or-break season for head coach Lincoln Riley.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: USC football ranked No. 20 in final AP Poll of season",

    "description": "Marseille 0-3 Liverpool: Goals from Dominik Szobozslai and Cody Gakpo, plus an own goal, ensured the Reds eased past their French opponents on Mohamed Salah’s return after Afcon",
    "fullText": "Liverpool breezed past Marseille with a 3-0 victory at the Orange Velodrome in the Champions League, firing the Reds into the top eight of this season’s league phase.\n\nWith Mohamed Salah making his much-anticipated return to the starting XI after coming back from the Afcon, an audacious free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai broke the deadlock for Liverpool on the stroke of half-time.\n\nJeremie Frimpong forced Marseille goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli to deflect the ball into his own net after 72 minutes before substitute Cody Gakpo managed to add a third in what turned out to be a memorable European night for Arne Slot’s side.\n\nThe last time the French side beat Liverpool was just shy of 20 years ago in 2007, and they didn’t pose any threat to changing that statistic. Liverpool have now extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 13 games and Slot will be hoping that his team will be able to maintain the same composure when they travel to Bournemouth this weekend.\n\nHere are The Independent’s player ratings for Liverpool’s win over Marseille:\n\nKept a clean sheet. He looked in control, commanding his area and comfortably claiming crosses, it was business as usual for the Brazilian veteran. He only had to make one real save from Amine Gouiri in the first half. The Liverpool shot-stopper may not quite be in his prime anymore but he still looks as safe a pair of hands as almost any keeper in world football. He also made a great save from a Mason Greenwood shot where the ball was bouncing awkwardly in front of him and made another good stop from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang late on.\n\nEffective and worked hard in both attacking and defensive positions, did well to get crosses in the box considering Marseille’s very wide shape. He could be shaping up to be one of Liverpool’s best signings this season. Frimpong was the key to Liverpool’s second goal which ultimately killed the game off, beating his man before Rulli parried the shot into his own net. He was everywhere constantly, not giving any Marseille player a moment’s rest, and dealt well with Igor Paixao who came on for Hamed Traore for the hosts.\n\nMissed a header but it wouldn’t have counted anyway so that first career goal still eludes him. Worked well with Virgil van Dijk defensively in the first half, remained composed at the back and calmly dissolved many Marseille attacking chances. The centre-back looked good, especially given Ibrahima Konate has been starting ahead of him for a while now, and could be a more regular partner for Van Dijk moving forward.\n\nDidn’t have much to do in the first half but dealt with Timothy Weah well and produced a typically ice-cool performance. He played his usual lofted passes into midfield, particularly to Dominik Szoboszlai and prevented a good chance with a very timely interception of Weah’s low driven shot in the 66th minute for Marseille.\n\nIt could’ve easily been a hard night for Kerkez to deal with Mason Greenwood down the left flank, but he stood his ground well against the Marseille talisman, although he lacked some quality in his own delivery at times. He undoubtedly could’ve been the best player on the pitch tonight if he’d had more quality in the final third but a classy defensive display from the left-back overall.\n\nTracked back well, didn’t have too much of the ball but made the Liverpool midfield tick. It was the Dutchman who won the free-kick in a dangerous position on the stroke of half-time which resulted in the goal. He played well given he wasn’t playing in his usual box-to-box role, getting an assist for Cody Gakpo in 92nd minute.\n\nCame so close to scoring after just 20 minutes, played well throughout and contributed to some fluid attacking play. Although he’s not as effective as he once was for the Reds, his and Gravenberch’s understanding as a deep two in midfield showed. He linked up nicely with the forwards in the second half and was still kickstarting attacks all the way to the very end of the match.\n\nProduced silky touches and still contributed defensively despite playing in behind Hugo Ekitike and Mohamed Salah as one of the twin 10s alongside Florian Wirtz. He made great runs and linked up well with Van Dijk, plus scored an audacious free-kick on his 100th start for the club, which was perfectly executed under the wall. You have to be a certain class of player to do that under those circumstances in the first of the two added minutes before half time. He then also played a huge part in the final goal, with a gorgeous touch to set Gravenberch away, who then assisted Gakpo. It’s seven goals in all competitions this season for the Hungarian and he is well on his way to becoming a free-kick specialist.\n\nHis first game since returning from Afcon was nothing to shout about for the Egyptian on the whole, although he played a brilliant ball in behind to Ekitike at one point and nearly scored a wonderful flicked goal after jumping high in the air to get on the end of a ball in from the right. However, it ended up on the roof of the net. He didn’t have his signature killer instinct in front of goal, fluffing a chance in the 83rd minute after bizarrely shooting with outside of the boot from close range and other players look like more potent attacking forces for Liverpool currently. Still a case of dusting off the cobwebs at the moment for Salah.\n\nTimid from the German, who lacked sharpness and his normal quick feet. Multiple attacking build-ups ended with him mistiming his first touch, and was set up multiple times by Ekitike, only to miss a decent chance. Despite looking sharper in the second half, he didn’t have his signature class in front of goal in the final third.\n\nSo unlucky, hit the post with a lovely side-footed effort, posed a major offensive threat like he usually does, won multiple fouls and nearly broke the deadlock after 23 minutes when he finished smartly but the goal was ruled out for offside. He showed desire to get in behind, fed clever passes into the likes of Wirtz in 48th minute, who failed to get his shot off in time, and could’ve very easily got an assist or two. He did practically everything but get his goal at the Orange Velodrome.\n\nDidn’t see too much of the ball but put some good runs in behind to stretch a lethargic Marseille side and helped his team see the game out.\n\nAlmost made a quick impact as he played a lovely weighted pass into Salah which could’ve wrapped up a demolition job in the 83rd minute. However he wrapped up it himself with a tidy finish, opening up his body to slot home in injury-time.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid have received a timely double boost ahead of their upcoming La Liga clash against Villarreal, with a report from Melchor Ruiz confirming that both Rodrygo and Brahim Diaz have returned to training.\n\nRodrygo’s comeback is particularly significant given his recent absence from competitive action.\n\nThe Brazilian forward has been sidelined for a period after suffering physical problems during the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nThose issues forced him to miss Real Madrid’s last two domestic fixtures against Albacete and Levante, before also being ruled out of the midweek encounter against AS Monaco.\n\nNow back on the training pitch, Rodrygo’s return gives the coaching staff more attacking options as preparations intensify for the Villarreal match.\n\nWhile his availability for the weekend will depend on how his physical condition responds in the final sessions, his presence alone is a positive sign.\n\nThe 25-year-old remains an important piece in Madrid’s attacking structure, and his recovery comes at a crucial moment in the season.\n\nBrahim’s return carries a very different emotional context.\n\nBrahim Diaz has returned to training. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nThis is because the attacking midfielder has just completed international duty with Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nNotably, this tournament ended in heartbreak, as Morocco lost the final to Senegal, with Brahim missing a decisive penalty.\n\nDespite returning clearly affected by the outcome of that final, those close to the player insist that he also comes back mentally strengthened.\n\nIn many ways, it is a renewed version of Brahim who re-joins the squad, motivated to channel that experience into his club performances.\n\nSportingly, Brahim is once again fighting for something familiar – a place in Real Madrid’s starting lineup.\n\nCompetition is fierce, particularly on the right side of attack, where Franco Mastantuono is also pushing for opportunities.\n\nRodrygo’s return further intensifies that battle, even if the Brazilian is only just working his way back to full fitness.",

    "fullText": "Pitchers and catchers have their first workouts from February 9th to February 13th. This offseason saw many players move in the form of trades and free agency. As anticipation starts for the 2026 season, baseball fans are beginning to home in on their favorite teams.\n\nFans begin to research rosters, minor league prospects, and the 2026 schedules. Spring Training baseball brings hope to fans anxiously awaiting their favorite team to reach World Series glory. Here are the top 10 MLB teams heading into Spring Training.\n\nDetroit rosters MLB’s best starting pitcher in Tarik Skubal. The Tigers could trade their superstar if a long-term extension can’t be reached. If Skubal is traded, the Tigers will be in need of a number one starting pitcher.\n\nThe team’s lineup features young players and blossoming superstar Riley Greene. This offseason, the front office helped strengthen Detroit’s bullpen.\n\nLast season, Houston missed the playoffs for the first time since 2016. The team’s shortcomings were due to injuries, most notably to Yordan Alvarez and team closer Josh Hader. This offseason, the Astros added free agent Japanese pitcher Tatsuya Imai.\n\nImai joins Hunter Brown and Christian Javier in Houston’s starting rotation. The key to Houston’s upcoming season is health.\n\nOn paper, teams are better than the Brewers, but the front office and coaching staff get the best out of the team’s roster. Last season, Milwaukee’s top starting pitching prospect, Jacob Misiorowski, made his debut and took the league by storm.\n\nMisiorowski will join Freddie Peralta at the top of the team’s starting rotation. The Brewers’ lineup will again be led by Christian Yelich, Brice Turang, and last season’s breakout outfielder, Jackson Chourio.\n\nBoston was led by ace starting pitcher Garrett Crochet in 2025. The starter had the best season of his career and will produce more production in 2026. The team lost third baseman Alex Bregman in free agency, but the lineup features Trevor Story, Jarren Duran, Wilyer Abreu, Roman Anthony, and newly acquired hitter Willson Contreras.\n\nThe Red Sox bolstered their rotation, signing starting pitcher Sonny Gray. If Boston can successfully slide prospect Marcelo Mayer into Bregman’s void, they can reach the playoffs again in 2026.\n\nThe Yankees have the lineup to win the World Series, but continue to fall short. Any team with Aaron Judge will always have the chance to win. The Yankees haven’t made a splash in free agency, but the upcoming season will feature the return of starting pitcher Gerrit Cole.\n\nCole will rejoin the starting rotation that features Max Fried, Carlos Rodon, and breakout candidate Cam Schlitter. With Cody Bellinger locked up long-term, the glaring questions are whether shortstop Anthony Volpe can fix his consistency issues and if the pitching staff can stay healthy throughout the season.\n\nChicago started the first half of 2025 as one of MLB’s best teams. However, the Cubs regressed mightily in the second half. This offseason, the team lost outfielder Kyle Tucker in free agency but signed Alex Bregman to fill the glaring hole at third base. The front office acquired starting pitcher Edward Cabrera, and he will join starting pitchers Shota Imanaga, James Taillon, Cade Horton, and Matthew Boyd.\n\nStarting pitcher Justin Steele returns to the starting rotation after missing all of 2025 to elbow surgery. After outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong’s breakout season, the Cubs’ lineup is projected to be one of the strongest in Major League Baseball.\n\nBarring injuries, Seattle’s rotation has the chance to be one of the league’s best. It’s difficult to name a starting five better than the combination of Luis Castillo, Logan Gilbert, Bryan Woo, George Kirby, and Bryce Miller. The group makes up the best strength of the Mariners’ roster.\n\nThey came up short during last season’s playoff push but brings back a lineup that features Cal Raleigh, Josh Naylor, Randy Arozarena, and Julio Rodriguez. Seattle will be the team to beat in the AL West.\n\nThe Phillies are the best National League team to dethrone the Los Angeles Dodgers. Last season, Philadelphia fell to Los Angeles in the NLDS. Unfortunately, the team was without starting pitcher Zack Wheeler and is likely to begin 2026 without its ace. With Ranger Suarez leaving in free agency, the Phillies will look to Christopher Sanchez, Aaron Nola, and Jesus Luzardo as their top three starters.\n\nProspect Andrew Painter will have the opportunity to break Spring Training in the rotation, and he has one of the best arms of any minor league prospect. Philadelphia’s lineup returns veterans J.T. Realmuto, Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Kyle Schwarber, and free agent acquisition Adolis Garcia. Outfielder Nick Castellanos is likely to be traded before Spring Training.\n\nToronto was one of MLB’s top teams throughout the 2025 season. The Blue Jays represented the American League in the World Series but fell to the Dodgers in seven games. This season, Toronto looks to repeat as American League pennant winners. Its starting pitching rotation of Kevin Gausman, Dylan Cease, Shane Bieber, Jose Berrios, and postseason standout Trey Yesavage can be one of the top rotations in MLB.\n\nThey added to their lineup this season, adding Japanese free agent Kazuma Okamoto. The team hopes Okamoto will mitigate lost production following shortstop Bo Bichette’s signing with the Mets. The Japanese free agent will be included in a lineup that features Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Anthony Santander, Addison Barger, Daulton Varsho, and George Springer.\n\nLA enters Spring Training as the top team in Major League Baseball. Their roster features Shohei Ohtani, the league’s best player, and they added Kyle Tucker as a free agent.\n\nTucker joins the best lineup, top to bottom, and is positioned to have the best season of his career. If the starting rotation can stay healthy, the group of Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow, Blake Snell, Roki Sasaki, and Shohei Ohtani can finish as the league’s top-ranked staff.\n\nThe front office brought in free agent closer Edwin Diaz to secure the ninth inning of ball games. For all the negative talk about the front office’s spending, one thing is clear: team ownership wants to win every season.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post Ranking the top 10 MLB teams entering 2026 Spring Training appeared first on The Big Lead.",

They'll be an absolutely hungry side and will want to make a statement.\"\n\nThis could prove a crucial battle for both sides in the race to finish in the top eight and reach the URC play-offs, with the Lions currently seventh and the Ospreys ninth.\n\nCentre Keiran Williams will make his 100th appearance in the much-changed side from the team that lost in the Challenge Cup against Montpellier.\n\nOnly wing Daniel Kasende, centre Owen Watkin, prop Steffan Thomas, lock Rhys Davies and number eight Morgan Morris keep their starting spots.\n\nWales captain Dewi Lake and fellow internationals Dan Edwards, Kieran Hardy, James Ratti and Harri Deaves return, alongside Australian lock Ryan Smith.\n\nLions centre Henco van Wyk will make his 50th appearance for the South African side.\n\nWelsh rugby rallies around crisis-hit Ospreys\n\nOspreys told of Cardiff interest as players walk out of meeting\n\nOspreys: Hopkins; Kasende, Watkin, K Williams, Giles; Edwards, Hardy; S Thomas, Lake (capt), Botha, R Davies, R Smith, Ratti, Deaves, Morgan.\n\nReplacements: L Lewis, C Jones, Hire, L Jones, Moriarty, Morse, Morgan-Williams, Cokanasiga.\n\nJohannesburg Lions: Horn; Davids, van Wyk, Mills, R Kriel; M van den Berg, Smith; Kotze, PJ Botha, Ntlabakanye, Schoeman, Nothnagel, R du Plessis, Hlekani, F Horn (capt).\n\nReplacements: Brandon, RF Schoeman, C van Vuuren, E Oosthuizen, Landsberg, Cairns, Pead, E Cronje.\n\nReferee: Federico Vedovelli (Italy)\n\nAssistant referees: Adam Jones (Wales), Lucas Yendle (Wales)\n\nLegal action considered over Ospreys future as players hit out\n\nWelsh players' body gives bosses 6 February deadline\n\nWRU has 'immense disconnect' with fans, say MPs",

    "fullText": "Everton are still trying to bring in a new striker this month, but it looks like one of their targets has come up on Sean Dyche’s radar too.\n\nThey have not made any signings so far this month.\n\nEven though a forward is needed, the Toffees are not expected to spend much. Loans seem more realistic at this stage.\n\nStill, they are keeping their options open and checking out what might be possible.\n\nThis week, reports came out that Everton had asked about Sunderland’s Wilson Isidor. He has not been getting much playing time and could be available.\n\nBut if Everton do decide to make a move, they will not be the only club interested in him.\n\nAccording to Sky Sports’ Keith Downie, interest in Isidor has been picking up as the transfer window nears its close.\n\nHe mentioned that Everton are interested, and so are Nottingham Forest under Sean Dyche.\n\nDownie posted on X: “Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired on Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor. No concrete approach has been made, as both clubs are waiting and/or considering other targets.\n\n“The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and is one to watch this window.\n\n“25-year-old Isidor’s contract is up in 2028 but he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland.\n\n“Isidor has scored 4 Premier League goals this season, but hasn’t netted since October.”\n\nIt remains to be seen if either club will decide to make a formal offer for Isidor.\n\nEarlier this week, there were reports suggesting that Everton were not actively moving forward with a pursuit of Isidor, which could give Dyche and Forest an opening.\n\nDyche has a clear need for more firepower this month. Only Wolves have scored fewer goals than Forest this season, and adding another option up front could be crucial in the battle against relegation.\n\nForest are just five points above the drop zone at the moment, making every decision in the transfer window even more important.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool icon and CBS Golazo pundit Jamie Carragher has told the story of when he got into it with new Real Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa, at the time, a teammate of Carragher’s at Anfield. The two had to be separated, amusingly, by Arbeloa’s predecessor, Xabi Alonso.\n\nArbeloa moved to Real Madrid from Real Zaragoza as a teenager, and came through at La Fabrica, before leaving for Deportivo La Coruna in 2006. A move to Liverpool followed a year later, and he spent two seasons at Anfield before returning to Real Madrid as a senior player, where he would be for seven years.\n\nSpeaking on CBS Sports‘ Golazo show alongside Thierry Henry, Kate Giles and Micah Richards, Carragher was shown images of the two during a Liverpool clash.\n\n“I’m saying ‘If you even dare to take that job off Xabi Alonso’, and Xabi’s saying, ‘don’t worry about it, they’re all the prima donnas anyway, I don’t want the job!'” he joked over images of Alonso separating him from Arbeloa during a Liverpool game.\n\n“Basically. You go and shake hands off the back of it don’t you? We were going for the most clean sheets. Listen, he was a good player Arbeloa, he wasn’t a great player, he was a good player. And he started thinking he was a great player. So I just needed to rein him back in a little bit. He was attacking too much.”\n\n“He just didn’t want to defend. And that was his job. Just defend. And we get our clean sheet. And I think we won 2-0 that day against West Brom, we got the golden gloves, for Pepe Reina.”\n\nInterestingly, just 24 hours beforehand, Arbeloa had commented on not wanting Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior to do too much defending. The defensive work-rate of their superstar duo was called into question under Xabi Alonso, but it seems Arbeloa will be placing less demands on them in that sense.",

    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov, the country's new defense minister, said his troops are already inflicting 35,000 battlefield kills a month. He wants more.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister has set a new goal for its forces to kill 50,000 Russian troops a month, a sharp increase from the losses that Kyiv says it's inflicting on the Kremlin now.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters on Tuesday, Mykhailo Fedorov said the new figure would be a core \"strategic objective\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"The objective is to impose costs on Russia that it cannot bear. In this way to force peace through strength,\" Fedorov said.\n\nNotably, he specified only battlefield fatalities.\n\nThe new standard comes as Russia intensified its offensive in some areas of the front lines last year, aiming to take key cities such as Pokrovsk. The nature of its operations — often reliant on continuous high-casualty infantry attacks — has led to political discussion in recent months that the Kremlin may soon reach a point where it will lose more soldiers than it can recruit.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in December that his forces had, for the first time, killed and wounded more Russian soldiers in one month than the Kremlin had called up for the same time period.\n\nFedorov, who was confirmed in his role last week, said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops are already documenting 35,000 kills every month via video.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte cited another figure while speaking in Brussels on January 16, saying that 20,000 to 25,000 Russian troops were dying every month.\n\nWhile differing significantly, both figures indicate that Russia is fighting the war at a high cost.\n\nRutte said the death rate has become \"unsustainable\" for Russia, and drew comparisons to the Soviet Union's losses during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, when an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops died every month over nine years.\n\nLikewise, Fedorov expressed hopes that ramping up a focus on lethality will exhaust Russia's war machine.\n\n\"If we reach the figure of 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They treat people as a resource, and problems with that resource are already obvious,\" he said.\n\nRussia does not disclose how many of its troops are wounded or killed during the war. However, international and Ukrainian analyses say the number is likely tracking past 1 million people over nearly four years of war.\n\nThe UK's defense ministry said in early January that the Kremlin may have suffered at least 1.2 million total casualties, which includes both wounded and deceased, since February 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has relied largely on hefty sign-up bonuses to attract local contract soldiers, though it's also been found to sustain troop levels through other means, such as by recruiting from prisons or hiring foreigners via informal channels.\n\nSome of those strategies may be waning. On Tuesday, the Russian independent media outlet Vertska reported that contract soldier sign-ups were slowing in some areas of the country.\n\nData from an unnamed source in the Moscow mayor's office, it wrote, showed that the capital had seen a roughly 25% annual drop in recruitment in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear how Fedorov intends to specifically target increasing combat kills. He said in his opening remarks to Ukrainian lawmakers last week that he intended to divert more staffing to drone units. Drones are thought to be responsible for roughly 70 to 90% of casualties inflicted during the war.\n\nHis new objective also comes against the backdrop of the US attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Many of the Kremlin's latest war actions, such as attempts to take Pokrovsk, have been seen in Ukraine as efforts to posture into a position of strength.\n\nAt 32, Fedorov is Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister. He's begun his new appointment with promises of aggressive reform of the military's structure and how it distributes resources to its fighters.\n\nFedorov was previously Ukraine's minister for digital transformation.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Derek Fulton, 31, a former Nvidia software engineer who quit to found the North Carolina-based cloud startup Carolina Cloud with his wife. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment about its work culture. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been messing around with computers since I got my first MacBook in 2006 at age 11. From building potato cannons to flying drones, I always wanted to solve problems and build things.\n\nAfter college, I worked in data science at a European bank and as a quantitative analyst at a hedge fund specializing in mortgage investments.\n\nWhen a friend from college who worked at Nvidia posted on LinkedIn about a software engineering opportunity, I knew I had to apply. I've always been a technologist at heart, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nWhen I first joined, I felt like I was learning a good bit. It was the first time I was on a team where software was the final product and not just an internal tool — where getting the last mile right really mattered.\n\nBut after a few months, I felt like I wasn't learning anymore. There was a top-down management style and a nitpicky, boxed-in way of working. I worked on a lot of bugs and features, and when I asked to work on different projects that I wasn't familiar with, I was told no.\n\nPeople assume that if you work at Nvidia, you make a lot of money. My package was in the low six figures, and the wide disparities in pay between older and newer employees impacted the culture because we were all playing different games.\n\nThe way I view a job is I want to either be learning or earning. I joined late enough that the money wasn't life-changing, and I felt I could get another job that paid roughly the same amount if it ever came to that. Also, our cost of living is reasonable in the Raleigh-Durham area, and my wife and I are both pretty fiscally shrewd.\n\nI always knew I would launch my own company one day. One of my ambitions was to command my own time by the age of 30 and to have kids who could grow up seeing me do that every day.\n\nMy wife and I invested about $20,000 to found our family-owned cloud provider, Carolina Cloud. We're bootstrapping for now, but aren't opposed to raising a small round down the line if we fill our current server fleet.\n\nCarolina Cloud does offer GPUs, but we're focused on CPUs because we believe they absolutely aren't going anywhere: they're less finicky, use less power, are cheaper, and last for years.\n\nAt previous jobs where we'd rented cloud, the prices were so high compared to what I knew it would cost to actually build one of the computers, so I saw an opportunity to create a provider that delivered value while still making money.\n\nCarolina Cloud is focused on on-demand, high-performance compute. Some of our early customers are hedge funds and genomics companies, particularly in the Research Triangle. We differentiate from hyperscalers with lower pricing, no egress fees, and high-touch support.\n\nQuitting my job at Nvidia has turned out to be a boon for my mental health. After a couple of weeks, I started sleeping better, chatting with strangers in public, spontaneously running errands I'd forgotten about, and calling people I hadn't thought about in years.\n\nI've also been working really hard, but on my own terms, which has allowed me to reconnect with my love for technology.\n\nWhile it takes time to get a business off the ground, I told myself that if we didn't turn a profit in 18 months, I could go back to a traditional job. But right now, early interest has gone as expected and indicates that we should be able to stay the course.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "In a World Economic Forum panel moderated by Business Insider, robotics experts dove into how bots are going to change the world.",
    "fullText": "In a world of AI chatbots and agents, we're not talking enough about physical AI.\n\nAt a Thursday morning Davos panel moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, robotics experts dived into ways bots are going to change the world — and their key limitations.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the World Economic Forum panel, which featured robotics and automation experts and a trade minister:\n\nOne phrase dominated the conversation: digital twins.\n\nExecutives from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a distant possibility is now delivering real productivity gains for companies.\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a physical object, person, or process. They can help organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, allowing them to make better decisions.\n\n\"Digital twins have been around, but the technology has exponentially improved, and the computing power has exponentially improved,\" said Automation Anywhere CEO Mihir Shukla.\n\nHe added, \"Let's say digital twins tell you that there is going to be a problem in manufacturing. You can proactively act on it. It has implications on your inventory. It has implications on your shipping planning.\"\n\nSiemens' CEO Roland Busch said that the productivity boost is showing up in numbers.\n\nHe said that the company's output is 20% higher and that energy costs are 20% lower.\n\n\"You have much, much faster and ramping up, you don't make mistakes,\" if you use a digital twin, he said.\n\nRobots can do work that humans are unable to — or don't want to — do, said Peggy Johnson, the CEO of Agility Robotics.\n\n\"It's very hard to hire for these manual jobs,\" she said. \"They're dull and dirty, and they're dangerous at times because you're lifting over and over again, very repetitive. It's kind of mind-numbing work.\"\n\nFaster progress in robotics means a better quality of life for the humans who are doing such jobs.\n\n\"The injuries are also another thing,\" she said about jobs that require a lot of heavy lifting. \"We have an aging workforce. A lot of young kids don't want to go into environments like this. So the older employees are also getting hurt more.\"\n\nThani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the Minister of Foreign Trade for the United Arab Emirates, echoed that robotics was the future of \"non-skilled\" labor.\n\n\"It's too difficult to attract new young people to start working on the construction,\" he said. \"Robotics is the main solution.\"\n\nBut building robots that are safe to use in human environments is also key, Johnson said.\n\nAl Zeyoudi added that financing AI is only the first step toward AI integration.\n\n\"Sometimes you have the money, but you haven't diagnosed the right solution to the problem that you're having,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the UAE's push for AI includes government appointments, policy development, and research and development, which was the \"main game changer.\"\n\n\"Many, many stakeholders are avoiding that because they say someone else will do it,\" he said, referring to R&D. \"I'll just copy and paste it.\"\n\n\"But when it comes to AI, it's too late,\" Al Zeyoudi added. \"You have to start working on R&D because you ensure to customize things to your own ecosystem, your own environments, your own conditions.\"",

    "fullText": "From Davos to Washington to America's high school classrooms, people are questioning the foundations of our economic system — and we at Business Insider are tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.\n\nPolls show Americans' trust in capitalism is falling fast, as daily life has grown more expensive and less secure. Our own recent survey of readers found that people are worried their wages aren't keeping up with their expenses, that housing feels out of reach, and that the whole system seems shaky. Many employers are leaning even more heavily into a capitalistic approach, deemphasizing loyalty and tenure in favor of ruthless meritocracy. Meanwhile, the US government has taken a more hands-on role in the economy, becoming a shareholder in several companies and upending its place in the capitalist system.\n\nAs questions about the state of capitalism grow, leaders are pitching competing visions of the economy's future. President Trump told a room full of CEOs, executives, and media figures at Davos this week that the US is reshaping the rules to make sure the country comes out of this period of transition \"bigger and better than before.\" Some are pushing for reform, like California governor Gavin Newsom, who called for a \"rules-based, competitive\" model at Davos. Others, like New York City's self-described socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani, want to rethink the system from the ground up — and have a lot of voters on board.\n\nWhile capitalism's future hangs in the balance, Business Insider is digging in. We're exploring how and why the system is being reshaped — by government policy, by companies, and by you.\n\nTell us what you think about the future of capitalism. Test your own understanding. And stick with us as we track how this system is evolving in real time, and what it will look like next.",

    "description": "Apple, Siri, and Google Gemini AI are at the forefront as Apple rebuilds its assistant, betting on AI model commoditization and flexibility.",
    "fullText": "Apple's decision to rebuild Siri around Google's Gemini AI models looks, at first glance, like an admission of failure. After years of promising breakthroughs, Apple is reportedly paying Google roughly $1 billion a year to keep its digital assistant relevant.\n\nLook closer, though, and the move represents something more radical: a giant bet that AI models will become commodities.\n\nTop tech reporter Mark Gurman wrote this week that Apple's revamped Siri, codenamed Campos, will launch later this year as a full-fledged chatbot embedded across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The underlying intelligence will come from Google's Gemini.\n\nThe more important detail is architectural. Apple is designing Campos so that the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time, according to Gurman's report for Bloomberg.\n\n\"That means the company will have the flexibility to move away from Google-powered systems in the future if it so chooses,\" he wrote.\n\nThat design choice tells us a lot about Apple's AI strategy.\n\nRather than trying to win an AI arms race against Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta by spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure, Apple appears to be positioning itself as model-agnostic. Siri remains Apple's direct interface to more than 1 billion iPhone users. The \"brains\" underneath, however, can change.\n\nIf Apple is right, the leading AI models will converge in quality over time, becoming roughly interchangeable. At that point, differentiation shifts away from the model itself and toward distribution, integration, privacy controls, and user experience — areas where Apple already excels.\n\nApple could then choose whichever AI provider is best, cheapest, or most strategically useful every few years. So, Google's Gemini might power Siri today, but tomorrow it could be OpenAI's latest GPT offering, or Claude from Anthropic, or whatever Meta is cooking up next, or xAI's Grok, or Mistral's offerings, or even region-specific models such as DeepSeek or Alibaba's Qwen in China. Services like OpenRouter already demonstrate how models can be swapped in and out.\n\nApple is also playing a longer game. Its search deal with Google, worth an estimated $20 billion a year, shows how valuable iPhone distribution is. If AI models truly commoditize, Apple could eventually flip the Siri relationship the same way: AI model providers could end up paying Apple for access to its massive user base.\n\nThe strategy also saves Apple enormous capital expenditure. While rivals pour huge sums of money into AI data centers and chips, Apple can let others shoulder that cost. For instance, Google spent more than $60 billion in capex during the first three quarters of 2025, while Apple spent $12.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.\n\nIf this AI building boom turns about to be a bust, Apple may dodge a bullet. Of course, it might turn out that underinvesting in your own AI capabilities is a strategic blunder of epic proportions.\n\nWe'll see in the next few years. Right now, Apple just placed a huge bet that the real power in the AI era won't belong to model makers, but to whoever controls the interface.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump repeatedly called Greenland a \"piece of ice\" while speaking at Davos. Three Greenlanders gave Business Insider their responses.",
    "fullText": "For over 56,000 people, Greenland is far more than a \"piece of ice\" — it's home.\n\nThat's what three residents of Greenland told Business Insider on Wednesday after President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the island as a \"piece of ice\" and called it \"Iceland\" on several occasions during a speech to World Economic Forum attendees at the Davos Conference.\n\nOn one occasion, Trump took a more complimentary tone and referred to the autonomous territory of Denmark as a \"big, beautiful piece of ice.\" He added that the US \"alone can defend this giant piece of ice,\" calling it a \"core national security interest.\"\n\nTrump isn't the first US president to want to acquire Greenland. In fact, the US has been discussing it since the 19th century. However, residents across Greenland — in the south, the north, and the capital — told Business Insider they don't appreciate Trump's rhetoric.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"Just calling Greenland a 'piece of ice' is so inaccurate,\" 32-year-old Ole Olsvig told Business Insider. Olsvig, an entrepreneur and tourist guide in Qaarsut in North Greenland, called the rhetoric \"outrageous,\" \"disrespectful,\" and \"commoditizing.\"\n\nTechnically, about 80% of Greenland is covered by a giant ice sheet. That's not what concerns Olsvig, though; it's what the remarks imply.\n\nIt erases people and implies disposability, he said. \"Greenland is like being treated as an asset, not a society of people.\"\n\nTrump has spoken of acquiring Greenland since his first presidential term. In his Davos speech on Wednesday, he called for \"immediate negotiations\" about the US taking control of Greenland, saying, \"We need it for strategic, national security, and international security.\"\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer who lives in Qassiarsuk in South Greenland, told Business Insider.\n\nShe added that she thinks Trump wants Greenland for more than just national security reasons — he also wants access to Greenland's trove of natural resources.\n\n\"We have very strict rules in the mining industry, which is good. So even though he really wants to buy Greenland, it's not just like a place he can just buy and then make a mine,\" she said.\n\nAnother point of contention among Greenlanders is that Trump's portrayal of Greenland as a \"piece of ice\" ignores the territory's rich and distinct culture.\n\nGreenland has its own official language, self-governance, and cultural practices, including hunting, fishing, and sled dogs, Olsvig said. \"Greenland isn't just a blank map.\"\n\nKleist added, \"We're not becoming part of America,\" despite Trump's wishes.\n\nThe attention Greenland has gotten on the world stage has had some positive effects, said 28-year-old Casper Frank Møller, the CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, which is based in Nuuk.\n\nFor example, his company saw a surge in interest from tourists at the start of 2025 when Trump re-raised the topic of acquiring Greenland.\n\nHowever, Møller said that the US's raid on Venezuela has caused further concerns among people in Greenland because \"there was just way more power behind the words.\" He estimates that 20 to 30 customers have postponed travel plans to Greenland as they wait out the situation.\n\nHe added that Trump's aggressive approach toward Greenland has actually made the country a little less polarized and more united toward potential independence.\n\n\"We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?\" he said.\n\n\"We as Greenlandic people, we are democratic, we aim for diplomacy, and we don't want any warfare to be happening here in Greenland. We're looking for diplomatic solutions,\" he added.\n\nMøller, for one, seemed to see some truth in the description of Greenland as a \"piece of ice.\"\n\n\"Greenland for sure has an immense, abnormally big piece of ice in the ice sheet,\" he said. \"It's true.\"\n\nThat said, \"we have some of the most beautiful places on Earth. Some of the most remote, untouched areas that you can imagine,\" he added. \"And I would say, for that big chunk of ice, that's what we call home.\"",

    "description": "The US government wants us to drink whole milk instead of skim, as if that's some treat.",
    "fullText": "I refuse the long arm of the government's reach into my refrigerator: I'm not drinking whole milk!\n\nAnd I readily accept that food is political, so the fact that the latest dietary guidelines from the US government — which say to drink whole milk instead of skim — are being seen as the latest political battle isn't a surprise.\n\nBut there's something in the latest whole milk debate that is truly confusing to me. It's that … whole milk isn't very good? And I don't think many of us have felt we couldn't drink it because of government guidelines. We just don't like it!\n\nSecretary of Health and full-fat dairy booster Robert Kennedy Jr. is a polarizing figure, so people are going to interpret this kind of video in a way that fits their worldview:\n\nThe government is positioning this change as people being desperate to drink whole milk but feeling they weren't allowed to. That they were forced to settle for skim or 2% milk, and finally, thanks to the Trump administration, are allowed the verboten pleasures again.\n\nWhole milk is too sludgy, too thick. It always kind of smells like it's on its way to turning sour. I find the white residue it leaves on the sides of a glass off-putting.\n\nOne-percent milk is crisp, drinkable, watery, cold, and refreshing.\n\nGreat to drink on its own or as a bath for cereal. Personally, I think skim is too watery, and 2% too close to whole, but I accept those options as well.\n\nFor me, it's not any fear of fat intake that has kept me from buying whole milk; it's that whole milk is stinky and gross.\n\nI should note here that the health benefits of whole vs. low-fat milk are a living, breathing debate. Whole milk has more saturated fat, which is potentially \"bad,\" but it has more vitamins and enzymes or whatever, which are potentially \"good.\" (Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist here, people! Don't trust me — do your own research.)\n\nIf you're truly interested in learning more about the details of the health benefits of dairy, I suggest you read this instead of listening to me whine about my personal milk preference. Don't listen to me about healthy food choices; my doctor shook her head sadly and said \"noooooo\" when I told her what kinds of garbage I typically eat for dinner (yes, my cholesterol is high).\n\nFor me, worrying about the milkfat content of my cereal is like worrying about which multivitamin brand to buy when I often go days without eating a fresh vegetable. I'm stuffing so many chemicals and processed garbage down my gullet on the reg that any kind of milk is the healthiest thing I'll consume by far.\n\nLike whole milk? Know that I see you, I accept you, and you are valid. It's fine to have a taste preference.\n\nBut I simply don't believe there are throngs of adults out there who've been feeling forced to choke down 2% when they were dying for whole milk. You're a grownup! Buy whatever milk you like!\n\nOf course, the main point of the latest guidelines isn't really aimed at making suggestions to adults. The actionable part of the guidelines is that they inform the rules for federal food programs for kids, like the National School Lunch Program, which previously only allowed low-fat milk options.\n\nI don't really care if a kid prefers whole or skim milk with their sloppy Joe or PB&J — either option seems better to me than chocolate milk, which, according to my own elementary school children, is what everyone chooses at lunch anyway.\n\nIf the government is going to start meddling more with school lunches, frankly, I'd welcome them to start with the abusive fee structure in some of the digital lunch payment systems that many districts have adopted. My kids' school uses a payment provider for lunches that charges a $3.50 fee every time you add money to your kid's account (and requires separate accounts per sibling). President Trump, please look into that.\n\nFor me, I am not going to change my milk-drinking ways. I was raised in a 1% household. I will continue to buy 1% because it's delicious, and whole milk is gross, and Uncle Sam can't tell me what to do.",

    "description": "Trump agreed to a settlement that would end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Lawmakers raised concerns about pushing borrowers off too soon.",
    "fullText": "Millions of student-loan borrowers could soon be forced off a key repayment plan — and debt relief is on the line.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Tim Kaine, led their colleagues in raising concerns regarding the Department of Education's proposed settlement to end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nOver 7 million borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, which was created by former President Joe Biden and intended to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness. Litigation halted the plan in 2024, and President Donald Trump's administration recently announced a proposed settlement that would effectively eliminate the plan and require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan with higher payments.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for eliminating SAVE by 2028, and this settlement would accelerate that timeline. The lawmakers wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that borrowers are likely to face \"significant hurdles\" switching to a new plan, and those enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program — which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years — are at heightened risk.\n\n\"Forcing these borrowers to transition out of SAVE with little guidance risks further lost time to debt relief and payment increases that could render continued public service untenable,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nBorrowers have not received credit toward PSLF while on the SAVE forbearance. While resuming payments on a different income-driven repayment plan would count toward PSLF, the lawmakers wrote that transitioning millions of borrowers to a new plan in a short timeframe would be a significant administrative burden, and they requested that the Department of Education give borrowers at least six months to switch to a new plan before their next payment comes due.\n\nThe department wrote in its press release that SAVE borrowers \"will have a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan. Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement at the time that \"American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.\"\n\nA slew of changes is on the horizon for student-loan borrowers. While borrowers are still waiting for a court to approve the SAVE settlement, provisions of Trump's spending legislation — including new repayment plans and borrowing caps — are set to be rolled out beginning in July.\n\nThose changes come as over 5 million borrowers are in default on their student loans, following the Trump administration's resumption of collections in May 2025 after a five-year pause. The Education Department announced last week that it is temporarily pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted borrowers. Still, Democratic lawmakers said in their letter that SAVE borrowers are at risk of defaulting should they face challenges transitioning to a new plan.\n\n\"It is imperative the Department take every action possible to ensure the 7 million borrowers currently enrolled in SAVE are provided with the information and resources necessary to avoid delinquency or default in order to avoid an even bigger default crisis,\" they wrote.",

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDarlene: For several years, my brother, Mike, and I talked about wanting to go into business together. We considered a few ideas but hadn't settled on one.\n\nIn February 2022, we rented an Escalade from Turo for a family trip. Almost exactly a year later, we launched our own Turo business, JDM Whipz.\n\nDarlene: Mike dove into research, sending me videos and websites every week. We began meeting on Sundays to discuss launching a Turo business.\n\nI'm a federal government employee, and I still work full-time. Most of my Turo work takes place in the evenings, when I prep cars after my day job. When we started, both of us were balancing full-time jobs.\n\nMike: I'm an IT nerd with 37 years of experience in desktop support, server support, and project management. Now, I'm a full-time Turo project manager.\n\nMike: The Corolla belonged to our mom, who died in June 2022. It's still on the platform; I just had the front end repainted and protective film added.\n\nFrom there, we purchased a 2017 Mazda, a 2017 Chevy Malibu, a 2017 Equinox, and a 2018 Equinox. By the end of our first year, we had 10 cars. We purchased eight with cash and used \"creative financing\" for the other two, purchasing them with 0% credit cards\n\nToday, we have 13 vehicles — we own 12 outright and have one payment on a 2019 Chrysler Pacifica. We've had five cars totaled in the past year, but because I hold a dealer's license and buy vehicles wholesale at auctions, we've been able to replace them and even come out ahead on insurance payouts.\n\nMike: Enterprise once quoted me $805 for an SUV from Friday to Sunday. Turo cost us $360 for four days and 600 miles when we rented that Escalade.\n\nDarlene: We listed mom's Corolla as a trial, but the first renter kept extending her trip week after week, and it ended up being 2.5 months total. The car was gone, and we had nothing to do, so we said, \"Let's add another.\"\n\nFrom the start, we reinvested every dollar back into the business. That's how we grew to 10 cars in a year.\n\nWe choose Turo's 60% protection plan: we keep 60%, Turo takes 40%, but our deductible is lower. Hosts can take up to 90% but risk a much higher deductible. Understanding that trade-off is important.\n\nMike: Day-to-day, I'm checking cars in and out, cleaning, handling inspections, and keeping up with competition in the Atlanta market.\n\nI left my IT job last April after paying off all my debts. I was breathing and dreaming of Turo at work. Now it's my focus.\n\nDarlene: Atlanta is huge, so Mike covers the north side, and I handle the south. We've never had all 13 cars sitting at our homes at once, where we store them.\n\nUsually they're rented out, coming back for a day or two before heading out again. I've learned more about cars in these two and a half years than I ever imagined.\n\nDarlene: We're obsessed with customer service. Over the years, we've both complained about poor service elsewhere. When we started JDM Whipz, I told Mike, \"I want people to feel valued.\" Our reviews consistently mention exceptional service, which is the most rewarding feedback we receive.\n\nMike: I built JDMWhipz.com because Turo's search doesn't show business names. Our site lets visitors view our entire fleet in one place without having to search. When ready to book, they tap a link that takes them directly to Turo to complete the reservation process.\n\nThe biggest challenge for new hosts is capital. Ideally, buy or own your first car outright. Read Turo's Terms of Service carefully to understand the responsibilities of both the host and the guest.\n\nDarlene: Most people start Turo while working full-time. You need excellent planning and time management. We learned the hard way: clean a car as soon as it returns.\n\nEarly on, we'd say, \"I'll do it in the morning,\" and then get a 7 a.m. booking. At 5 a.m., with car washes closed, you're in the driveway scrubbing, photographing, and prepping the car. Now it's a habit: the car comes in, and it gets cleaned.\n\nMike: Revenue now depends on the season and the vehicle. Our Corolla rents for $42 to $46 per day. Some cars earn $800 a month, while others earn $1,200 during peak season in Atlanta, which typically spans from March to September.\n\nWe're still making six figures in profit a year.\n\nDarlene: Check Turo's website for rules, like no cars older than 12 years or with more than 130,000 miles when listed.\n\nWatch videos from Turo hosts on YouTube, but vet their advice. Don't be afraid to ask experienced hosts for guidance. Mike and I mentor people all the time; we love helping new hosts succeed.\n\nOur long-term goal is to become Atlanta's go-to personal car rental company. We're proud of what we've built — and even prouder to do it together as siblings.",

    "description": "Business Insider visited an air base in Lithuania where Spanish jets are deployed to support NATO air policing operations.",
    "fullText": "ŠIAULIAI AIR BASE, Lithuania — The fighter pilots quickly grabbed their gear and stormed out the door of the small command building as alarm bells wailed from a loudspeaker. The countdown had started.\n\nThe Spanish pilots and the support crew piled into two vans, which swiftly shuttled them down snow-covered roads to the hangars. The powerful EF-18 jet engines roared to life, and with pre-flight checks complete, the fighters taxiied out onto the runway.\n\nAs the planes took off into the frigid January sky, the air base fell silent.\n\nFighter pilots from the 15th Wing of the Spanish Air Force deployed to NATO's forward edge have just 15 minutes to get airborne once a quick reaction alert mission is activated, usually in response to a nearby aircraft flying without identification or purposefully dodging international regulations.\n\nFighter jets are frequently sent out on very short notice to intercept Russian military aircraft over the Baltic Sea. NATO’s Air Command recorded more than 500 such rapid-response launches, known as scrambles, across allied airspace last year as part of air policing missions and other operations.\n\nAt Šiauliai Air Base in Lithuania, Business Insider observed Spanish fighter jets taking off for what began as a training sortie. Once they were airborne, though, the flight became an \"alpha scramble,\" meaning they were tasked with responding to something suspicious — potentially a real threat.\n\nLt. Col. Fernando Allen, the commander of the Spanish detachment, could only say that the target was an unidentified aircraft. Recent NATO scrambles have intercepted Russian aircraft, including fighter jets and surveillance planes.\n\nAllen said that he and his fellow airmen are deployed to Lithuania \"to make safe skies for partner nations and allies.\"\n\nNATO launched the Baltic Air Policing mission in 2004 following the accession of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the alliance. Member states take turns deploying fighter jets to Šiauliai and two other bases in the region on a four-month rotational basis.\n\nThe mission is to protect the airspace above and around the three Baltic states — often referred to as NATO's front lines — amid anxiety over Russian activities in and near allied skies.\n\nSpain's 15th Wing deployed at the start of December to Šiauliai Air Base, where it is contributing to the air policing mission and the Eastern Sentry operation that NATO launched in September after Russian drones violated Polish airspace.\n\nThe Spanish detachment arrived with just over 200 personnel and 11 EF-18M fighters, upgraded versions of the American-made F/A-18 Hornet that only Madrid operates. The jets are armed with air-to-air missiles and equipped for round-the-clock operations, including night flights, with pilots using night-vision goggles.\n\nAlpha scrambles follow a step-by-step procedure. Control centers are monitoring the airspace 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If crews detect an unidentified radar track or an aircraft failing to follow international rules, they relay the information to one of NATO's combined air operations centers.\n\nWhen commanders decide to launch an alpha scramble, the pilots receive an order to take off and must be airborne within 15 minutes. They normally complete the task well ahead of time.\n\nThe scramble alert can come in at any moment, so pilots and support crews are always on standby. Some might be resting or even sleeping, but when the alarm bells ring, airmen are ready to get moving.\n\n\"You don't have time to think about what's happening. You only think about getting dressed and running to the airplane,\" Lt. Jesus Ortín, one of the Spanish EF-18 pilots, told Business Insider during a visit to Šiauliai this week. \"We are not waiting for it. We are on alert.\" There is an expectation that even at rest, they're ready.\n\nLt. Arturo Guitán, another EF-18 pilot, said his reaction to a scramble order is automatic in his brain, drilled in through extensive preparation before the deployment. \"I think it's quite easy to scramble,\" he said, \"because we train every day.\"\n\nFor identification and intercept missions, NATO fighter jets — regularly scrambled in pairs or fours — fly alongside aircraft until they move farther out into international airspace. Intercepts commonly occur over the Baltic Sea, a busy route linking mainland Russia with its heavily militarized Kaliningrad exclave between allied countries Poland and Lithuania.\n\nNATO has said that Russian aircraft often approach or fly near allied airspace without using transponders, having filed an official flight plan, or communicating with air traffic control. However, the culprit behind a scramble alert isn't always Moscow; civilian planes can trigger an alpha scramble as well.\n\nMembers of the 15th Wing couldn't disclose exactly how many alpha scrambles they have carried out since their deployment began. Allen, the detachment commander, said there were lots in December, but 2026 started off relatively quiet.\n\nSome weeks may trigger five scrambles, while others may see only two, the 15th Wing said. They appear random, and while intelligence officers are trying to map out any patterns, they've been unable to do so.\n\n\"We are proud to be here, and it's an honor to help our allied partner countries,\" Allen said. \"I know we're farther in the east, but we are doing the same mission that we were performing in our own country.\"",

    "description": "Fisayo Che is the founder of Elisamama, a brand that's sold at Saks. She's finding a path forward as the department store goes through bankruptcy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Fisayo Che, the founder of women's wear brand Elisamama. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified Che's statements, including the amount Saks owes, with documentation she provided.\n\nSaks Global filed in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows it to continue operating while undergoing a court-supervised reorganization of its debt. In a statement, Saks said it is committed to \"trusted relationships with brand partners,\" and that funding it secured through the bankruptcy will \"facilitate go-forward payments to brand partners.\"\n\nBecoming a fashion designer was never a part of my vision board. When I founded Elisamama, I was still working a corporate job.\n\nI felt like I wanted to live a life of more meaning and purpose. My family is from Nigeria, and I spent time there growing up. I got the idea to start a brand that supports women artisans in the country.\n\nElisamama is a women's wear and children's brand inspired by African artistry and prints. At first, I sold the clothing at flea markets; later, I listed on Etsy and promoted it on social media.\n\nSaks really gave my business a platform to grow. Now, it's going through bankruptcy and hasn't paid me for some of my inventory. I'm not sure how to trust the company going forward.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, someone found us on Instagram and, unbeknownst to me, dropped our name with a Saks buyer. When the department store initially reached out, I thought it was a scam, and I didn't respond. Then, a vice president from the company DM'd me on Instagram.\n\nI freaked out and was very scared. I thought: How are we going to do this? I even told them I needed time to figure it out because I didn't want to mess up this opportunity.\n\nSaks really walked alongside us, gave us guidance, and helped us dip our toes slowly into its world. It was rapid-fire learning, trying to understand all the vendor requirements, including shipping and routing guidelines.\n\nWe hired more artisans in Nigeria. We beefed up our production. We worked on our supply situation. Everybody was winning; it helped us help other people grow their own businesses.\n\nIn 2023, Saks selected us to join its New Wave program for emerging designers. We came to New York, connected with industry experts and the press, and the company gave us a grant.\n\nAt the end, we had our products placed in the window at Saks' flagship store in New York. That was a remarkable moment for me and my team in Nigeria, who are so proud of this work. It was nothing that I could even have imagined for Elisamama.\n\nThe exposure it gave us was significant and gave us confidence.\n\nWe signed with a showroom and started selling in retailers like Shopbop, Tuckernuck, and several specialty boutiques. Things were ramping up, and the more I did this work, the more joy I found in it. In 2024, I left my corporate job.\n\nSaks has been a great partner to us. It has placed orders with us every season since 2020. It's 50% or 60% of our business.\n\nThe problems started in February of last year, when Saks sent vendors a memo about paying in installments. Prior to that, we were consistently paid on the agreed-upon payment terms.\n\nI thought: We can wait a few months to get paid. They're important partners.\n\nWe got a check for a couple of hundred dollars in July, and in August, we were paid a more substantial amount. I thought we were back on track and kept sending inventory. Then, no other payments came in.\n\nWe fulfilled two additional orders after that, operating on faith that things would shake out properly. The company kept saying it would get back to us with updates.\n\nNow, Saks owes us six figures. I'm considering cutting half of our team to stay viable.\n\nI employ 20 people full time in Nigeria; we have some consultants and contractors, as well. The amount Saks owes us means a lot.\n\nWhen Saks' bankruptcy was announced in January, the ax dropped. Because of the proceedings, Saks said it'd prioritize debts incurred after January 13 and get back to us on other payments owed.\n\nI have been trying to expand my partnerships and sales channels to protect my business, as we've been hearing about Saks' struggles for a long time.\n\nI want to see Saks win, but I don't believe the company anymore. We're sitting on Saks' most recent order, given the situation.\n\nI've told the buyers that any future shipments would have to be paid for before we ship. I'm also considering asking them to send back the inventory they have on hand, so at least we can cut our losses.\n\nSaks is so powerful and significant in the fashion space that partnering with it is valuable. What's happened is a disappointment, but it's also grief and sadness.\n\nSaks needs to restore trust with its suppliers by putting money behind its orders. If it did that, brands would continue to send goods because it's that important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Saks? Email Madeline Berg at mberg@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "OpenAI has rapidly scaled its robotics lab over the past year and plans to open up a second lab, insiders say.",
    "fullText": "Last year, Sam Altman posited that the world hadn't yet had its \"humanoid robots moment\" — but, he said, \"it's coming.\" In the background, his AI company has been gearing up to make that happen.\n\nOpenAI quietly built up a humanoid robotics lab over the past year, insiders with knowledge of the program told Business Insider. The lab operates out of the same building as the company's finance team in San Francisco, and employs around 100 data collectors. They're teaching a robotic arm how to perform household tasks as a part of a larger effort to build a humanoid robot.\n\nOpenAI explored robotics during its early years and built a robotic hand capable of solving a Rubik's Cube. The company closed the project in 2020; a company spokesperson said at the time that it had chosen to \"refocus the team on other projects.\"\n\nThe inner workings of the new robotics lab haven't been previously reported.\n\nOne person with knowledge of OpenAI's strategy said the company is working on several new hardware projects, including robotics, that are in the early phases of development, and so far, none are core to the company's mission.\n\nLast week, OpenAI put out a request for proposals from companies that manufacture in the US that could act as partners for the company's push into consumer devices, robotics, and cloud data centers. The company did not specify how much it intends to spend or provide a timeframe for the work.\n\nA representative for OpenAI declined to comment.\n\nThe lab has more than quadrupled in size since it launched in February 2025, insiders said.\n\nIn December, the company told employees it plans to open a second lab in Richmond, California. A December job posting for a \"robotics operator\" with the company's contracting agency lists Richmond as the location.\n\nThe lab has a humanoid robot that multiple people described as \"iRobot-like\" on display, but the bot is mostly collecting dust, and few have seen it in operation. The vast majority of the work in the lab is focused on teleoperating robotic arms.\n\nOpenAI has data collectors using 3-D printed controllers, called GELLOs, to operate two Franka robots. These metal arms have pincers at the end and perform household tasks like putting bread in a toaster or folding laundry.\n\nWhen the data collection program began in February, work focused on teaching the Franka robot how to put a rubber duck in a cup. Since then, it has shifted to increasingly more sophisticated tasks.\n\nOpenAI's lab offers a rare glimpse into how one of the world's most influential AI companies is approaching robotics.\n\nCompetitors like Tesla put on flashy demos and often train with full humanoid robots controlled by motion capture suits and virtual reality headsets. OpenAI is taking a quieter path, scaling contractor-driven data collection to train robotic arms on basic tasks.\n\nBoth approaches show how far leading AI companies remain from building functional household robots, and how much of that work still relies on human labor.\n\nWired reported last fall that OpenAI had begun hiring robotics engineers. The company has at least a dozen engineers on the project, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nIn December, a project supervisor said that the lab needed to increase productivity and efficiency to get more hours of functional data, people with knowledge of the program said. Over the past few months, the lab has nearly doubled expectations for data collection, they said.\n\nOpenAI has previously invested in other robotics companies, including Figure, 1X, and Physical Intelligence. Its 2024 partnership with Figure was designed to build \"next generation AI models for humanoid\" robots, but Figure CEO Brett Adcock said in February 2025 that the company was exiting the deal.\n\nWhen the first robotics project ended in 2020, it was widely believed that the company was focusing more intensely on ChatGPT. Now, OpenAI has indicated it plans to expand into devices, and it could use its ChatGPT knowledge base to teach a robot how to interpret and interact with the world.\n\nThe earlier program focused on reinforcement learning — a trial-and-error approach in which robots learn through a reward system. Now, the company is collecting large amounts of data to train the robots.\n\n\"Everyone is fighting for a way to develop large data sets,\" Jonathan Aitken, a robotics expert with the University of Sheffield, told Business Insider. \"We know we have AI algorithms that are capable of being trained to do stuff using big data sets. The issue has always been getting that data set.\"\n\nOpenAI's data collection strategy differs from the robotics efforts at companies like Tesla or Figure, where workers record full-body movement and use motion capture suits and virtual reality headsets to operate full-sized humanoid robots.\n\nOpenAI's data collection efforts mirror a study published in 2023 by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, that describes a low-cost and scalable system for collecting robotics data using teleoperated arms. One of the researchers joined OpenAI in August 2024 and works on \"Building the Robot Brain,\" according to LinkedIn.\n\nAlan Fern, an AI and robotics expert at Oregon State University, told Business Insider it's a standard setup that allows the robot to learn by mimicking its operator. Aitken said OpenAI's GELLO strategy could present an advantage over AI companies that use motion capture suits. It's cheaper, he said, and because each controller maps directly to a robot arm, the robot can more easily learn how specific human movements translate into its own motions.\n\nIn San Francisco, OpenAI runs three shifts and a few dozen workstations that collect data around the clock, people with knowledge of the lab said. Cameras record both the operator and the robot performing tasks, and workers are rated on how many \"good hours\" of functional training data they can generate.\n\nThe reliance on contract workers and performance metrics mirrors how AI companies, including OpenAI, have historically scaled data labeling for their large language models.\n\n\"A lot of companies are hoping if you collect enough of this data, you can translate it into robot motions, and they will get a scaling effect and have this ChatGPT moment,\" Fern said.\n\n\"That's something that hasn't been proven out yet,\" he added.\n\nThe company is setting up new robot stations with robotic arms that more closely mimic how a human moves, insiders said.\n\nOpenAI also uses some of the data to train robots in computer simulations and regularly tests the robot arms to see how well they perform, the people said.\n\nIt's unclear how quickly OpenAI plans to translate this data into a full humanoid robot, or how its low-cost, arm-based approach will fare against companies investing heavily in full humanoid systems.\n\n\"It does seem to be very early in the process,\" Aitken said. \"From a technical standpoint, it's a really beautiful and configurable interface to lots of different types of robots.\"\n\nDo you work for OpenAI or have a tip?

    "title": "Wall Street is losing its appetite for Oracle's data center debt",
    "description": "Appetite for loans tied to Oracle's data center partnership with OpenAI has diminished, reflecting concerns over credit risk and AI investment scale.",
    "fullText": "Oracle and OpenAI have aimed to build $500 billion of data centers by the end of the decade to power their artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nBut the massive initiative, called Stargate, may be exhausting the supply of available capital.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, the bank that recently led a pack of lenders to extend roughly $38 billion of debt for the construction of two planned Stargate data center campuses in Texas and Wisconsin, has encountered diminished interest as it has sold off pieces of the loan to other financial players, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe person said that the two projects are fully financed, the syndication effort by JPMorgan had been successful overall, and that the slowdown in new participants hadn't alarmed bankers given that it was at the tail end of such a large debt offering.\n\nBut the person acknowledged that banks and institutional investors had also grown wary in recent months of taking on too much exposure to Oracle, a tech giant whose credit rating sits below some of its peers in the AI race, including Microsoft and Google.\n\nThe reticence among lenders and investors to continue bankrolling Stargate raises questions about whether the mega-project will meet its lofty objectives.\n\n\"We are hearing from market participants that in some cases, there may be banks that could be approaching the exposure levels they're comfortable with when it comes to certain data center projects,\" said Dhaval Shah, a director at S&P Global Infrastructure Ratings.\n\nThe current unprecedented data center development cycle has been dominated by just a handful of leading players, testing whether lenders and investors will remain willing to continue to accrue heavy exposure to borrowers like Oracle. Oracle declined to comment.\n\nIn November, credit default swaps that insure against losses on Oracle's corporate debt rose in cost, a reflection of the concerns around the company's enormous spending on AI.\n\nOpenAI, the AI chatbot maker that will anchor the Stargate facilities, meanwhile, produces revenue that is just a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars annually that would be necessary to justify the cost of its infrastructure.\n\n\"Oracle has become a proxy for OpenAI's ability to raise significant amounts of capital,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson. \"It's a very precarious position.\"\n\nOpenAI announced Stargate a year ago, stating that it would partner with Oracle and others, to build a total of 10 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2029 — roughly the equivalent power footprint of New York City on a day of peak electrical consumption.\n\nIn October, OpenAI announced that it had arranged for the construction of six Stargate sites with a total planned capacity of roughly 7 gigawatts, stating that the pipeline \"puts us on a clear path to securing the full $500 billion,10-gigawatt commitment\" it had announced at the beginning of 2025.\n\nMuch of the financing for the project, so far, has been provided by major financial institutions that have banded together to share its immense costs — as well as its risks — in what are known as syndication deals. JPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group led the syndication effort for the two Stargate projects in Shackelford, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin. Both banks declined to comment.\n\nBank of America is leading a syndication to finance another Stargate data center campus in Michigan. A person familiar with that effort said that it has attracted interest from syndication takers.\n\nAnother group of lenders provided about $18 billion of financing for another Stargate facility in New Mexico, according to Bloomberg.\n\nInitial players in large syndication deals often seek to sell off portions of their loan commitments to other players, including other banks and institutional investors.\n\nBut the sale of these positions, which is done to reap quick profits and lower exposure, has become trickier in the case of Stargate.\n\nTwo bankers and a financing executive who are familiar with the syndication market said that the rising perception of risk around Stargate meant that lenders now wanted higher yields to lend to it. That has placed recent Stargate syndicators in a position where they can no longer profitably sell off debt that was arranged at tighter spreads just a few months ago.\n\nStargate borrowing rates may not come down any time soon.\n\nIn September, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Oracle's rating at BBB but said it was considering a cut due to the company's enormous planned spending on AI infrastructure. A downgrade below BBB minus would place a junk rating on Oracle debt, raising its borrowing costs significantly.\n\n\"I am very surprised these loans were even underwritten at the time,\" Luria said. \"The market has indicated this is not investment-grade debt.\"\n\nHowever, Luria said one scenario in particular could make the loans less risky. OpenAI is now in the process of trying to raise as much as $100 billion, according to reports, giving the Stargate venture a potential cushion of equity and making its debt easier to sell, he said.\n\n\"If that happens,\" he said, \"everybody's dreams come true.\"\n\nOther bankers who spoke with Business Insider said the slowdown did not indicate acute trouble in the syndication market, but acknowledged that the pool of investors who still have an appetite for the Stargate debt has shrunk.\n\n\"Do we have enough digestive capacity\" in the market for investors to buy all of the debt that will be required, said David Tawil, a partner at transaction insurance advisory firm Castle Harbour. \"That's the market's real concern: the size of this whole movement.\"",

    "description": "AI isn't yet impressive enough to replace the core work done in the finance industry, but Wall Streeters are still using AI to streamline their day.",
    "fullText": "For all the hand-wringing about what AI will do to the white-collar workforce, the technology might not be impressive enough to replace the core work done in the finance industry yet, but Wall Street pros say it definitely has its uses.\n\n\"If you're doing it for self-education, it's one thing, but I think it's quite hard to rely on a chatbot for fiduciary purposes if you're facing clients,\" said Maurits Pot, the founder of Tema ETFs.\n\nOther cite issues with AI \"hallucinations,\" which can be a headache if you need to be precise with figures and data.\n\n\"You don't use AI to do sophisticated things,\" said David Trainer, the founder of New Constructs, adding: \"It's more trouble for me to use something and find out later that it's hallucinated than it is for me to just go get it from the source to begin with.\"\n\nAnd yet, a lot of people are using AI, and there are some creative ways Wall Street pros are deploying the technology.\n\nHere's how Wall Streeters say they are using chatbots to save them time and get an edge.\n\nOne of the more interesting examples I heard comes from Lance Roberts, the CIO at RIA Advisors, which oversees around $2 billion. His team programmed 14 different AI agents to think like top investors, including Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, Benjamin Graham, John Bogle, Cathie Wood, and others.\n\nThese agents provide insights on anything from their views on the S&P 500 to individual stocks, Roberts said, and can help provide different perspectives when thinking about an investment case.\n\nAnother use case comes from Rob Arnott, the famed investor and founder of Research Affiliates. Last year at around this time, he was going to have his team read Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" to prepare for Trump's second term. Trump has cited it as one of his favorite books, with one of its main takeaways being to find a way to get what you want without fighting. Instead, Arnott figured he'd send them a ChatGPT summary to ensure they'd get the main takeaways without having to take too much time out of their busy schedules.\n\nArnott has also said he uses AI for detailed feedback on his papers, with his preferred chatbot being Perplexity.\n\n\"Perplexity is my preferred search engine, and has been for a couple of years now,\" he said in an email. \"I try the other LLM's from time to time. The nice thing about Perplexity is that it's an AI of AIs: it chooses which AI is best suited to whatever question I have.\"\n\nIts biggest use case, however, seems to be administrative tasks, or assignments that lower-level staffers might have once tackled. As Seth Klarman, the CEO of Baupost Group, described it last summer: \"essentially a capable assistant, a summer intern.\"\n\nDavid Elder, a wealth manager at Merit Financial Advisors, gave an example of a smaller task he might use a chatbot to save time on.\n\n\"I'm doing a presentation right now on intellectual property,\" Elder, who uses multiple chatbots including ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gamma, said. \"I can have an interview with me and an intellectual property or business attorney, talk about it from multiple angles, dump that kind of recording into an AI, and turn that into a presentation.\"\n\nFor Chase Doyen, who works in business development for the London Stock Exchange Group in New York, it's an organizational tool. His firm has a subscription to Claude, Anthropic's chatbot.\n\n\"I use it for administrative tasks mostly,\" Doyen said. \"I use it for organizing and planning out my day. I use it for organizing my notes. If I write down a lot for a presentation I'm in or a meeting, Claude cleans it up very well.\"",

    "fullText": "The power of TikTok propelled one user's content to primetime television, and people are loving it.\n\nTikToker Romeo Bingham, 25, is receiving an outpouring of support after their viral Dr Pepper jingle was picked up by the brand and used in a commercial that aired during Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship game. Social media users quickly caught onto the audio and praised the partnership.\n\nSO proud of you @Romeo!! Well deserved! 🥹❤️ #drpepper #goodandnice #drpepperjingle #nationalchampionshipgame #espn\n\n\"Dr Pepper, baby, it's good and nice,\" Bingham sang in a TikTok video posted December 23.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the post had over 44 million views and 50,000 comments from users and brands alike. Bingham's video gained traction on TikTok before the jingle was featured in a TV commercial, prompting some users to predict a collaboration was on the horizon.\n\n\"I am waiting for Dr Pepper to offer a massive contract,\" one commenter said on December 29.\n\n@Dr Pepper please get back to me with a proposition we can make thousands together. #drpepper #soda #beverage\n\nBingham and Dr Pepper did not reveal the terms of their deal and did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSeveral companies, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera Bread, and Hyundai, have also pounced on Bingham's comments and requested jingles for their brands.\n\nBingham created a song for Vita Coca, which the beverage brand posted on TikTok on January 16.\n\n@Romeo jingle stays on repeat #vitacoco #fyp #coconutwater #jingle #vitacocotreats\n\nThe partnership between Bingham and Dr Pepper appeared to be in the works for a few weeks leading up to the game, which ESPN reported attracted over 20 million viewers in 2025. On December 31, Dr Pepper commented under Bingham's video, telling them to check their DMs.\n\nSupport for Bingham has continued, with users sharing videos and comments congratulating them on the collaboration. Others have chimed in, saying they hoped Bingham got a good payday.\n\nI hope that girl who did the Dr. pepper jingle got paid very well. Cause I just saw the commercial.\n\nAnd the marketing strategy seems to be working for Bingham. As of Wednesday, Bingham is operating a website offering the Dr Pepper effect to brands.\n\n\"I'm buying a Dr Pepper just because,\" one user wrote on TikTok.",

    "description": "Tesla's Elon Musk is asking job applicants to share their biggest tech wins via three simple bullet points.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to see your results, not your résumé.\n\nThe Tesla CEO this week requested that people who want to work on the company's Dojo3 AI chip email three bullet points describing the \"toughest technical problems you've solved.\"\n\nMusk's just-the-facts approach, outlined in a post on X, reflects a focus on problem-solving over fancy résumés or cover letters.\n\n\"He's basically just trying to cut through the noise of the job market,\" said Michelle Volberg, a longtime recruiter who is the founder of Twill, a startup that pays tech workers to recommend peers for key jobs.\n\nShe said that résumés or LinkedIn profiles don't always make it clear to employers where a person's skills lie. Asking a job seeker to lay out a trio of battles won can help hiring managers get to the meat of someone's abilities, Volberg told Business Insider.\n\nIt's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt.\n\n\"Elon is showing the way that the job market is going to go,\" she said.\n\nAlready, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas.\n\nVolberg said that hiring managers at large companies have told her that they're sick of relying on résumés so tailored to a job opening that they reveal little about candidates themselves. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said.\n\n\"They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT,\" Volberg said.\n\nBullets over bona fides is, of course, a departure from the conventional approach of stuffing a résumé with bolded job titles, years of experience, and skills.\n\nAsking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call \"skills-based hiring.\"\n\nMusk's no-frills call for applicants appears to build on his prior statements about being open to candidates from nontraditional backgrounds. For years, the billionaire has said that people didn't need a college degree to work for Tesla. Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of \"exceptional\" ability or achievement.\n\nHe also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking \"world-class\" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles.\n\nAn application portal linked to the post contains a field instructing applicants to include two or three bullets \"showcasing exceptional ability,\" and to upload a résumé.\n\nVolberg said the bullet method is similar to guidance that her company already gives job seekers: Focus less on adjectives and more on outcomes.\n\nFrom a hiring manager's perspective, she said, the central question is whether a candidate can make their job easier by solving real problems.\n\nThe corollary, Volberg said, is fakers beware: \"If you say that you've solved these three things, you'd better be able to talk about them in detail.\"\n\nShe said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said.\n\nBeyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews.\n\nAsking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work.\n\nMurray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.\n\n\"What he is asking people to do is to market themselves,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "description": "Cisco's chief people officer said companies should encourage AI adoption by framing it as a tool that will help workers get part of their day back.",
    "fullText": "Has using AI meant you've ended up with more work on your plate?\n\nAt this early stage of adoption, Cisco's chief people officer, Kelly Jones, told Business Insider that the \"worst thing\" companies can do when trying to encourage AI adoption is to pile additional work on employees once they've freed up time.\n\n\"When you get into the space of AI experimentation, one of the most important things to do is not kill innovation when you're starting it,\" Jones said.\n\nJones is touching on the reality of AI adoption at many companies. Even as firms report productivity gains from AI tools, employees' days haven't necessarily gotten any shorter.\n\nOne Microsoft manager previously told Business Insider that AI tools cut his coding time — which used to make up the overwhelming majority of his workload —by 70%, yet his overall workload didn't shrink. Many leaders have also said that AI will free up employees' time, so they can focus on more \"deep work,\" rather than suggesting that workers might get more free time overall.\n\nJones said that when leaders push AI adoption, they need to make it \"really relevant\" to the day-to-day work of employees, rather than making it another ask from their manager. It should be framed as a tool that helps employees reclaim a percentage of their day, the CPO said.\n\nMost employees would be glad to save time spent on work, and she said companies get it wrong by saying, \"here's three new things that we need you to do.\"\n\nWhile the traditional 9-to-5 workday may not be undergoing a drastic overhaul, some employees have found ways to shave hours off their schedules using AI tools, freeing up time for other pursuits — whether or not they tell their employers. For instance, one worker told Business Insider he used AI to complete about half of his software engineering tasks and spent the rest of his day on Reddit and YouTube.\n\nJones said that if employees are doing better work in less time, \"there's no negative to that.\" At this point in the innovation cycle, people should use AI to get work tasks done more rapidly if they can, she said.\n\nWhile Jones discouraged automatically adding more to employees' plates, she said that figuring out what to do with reclaimed time is a more complicated question. Determining how work changes, how it should be redistributed, and how companies and employees make those calls is what HR is likely to focus on over the next year or two, she said.\n\n\"We are really at this precipice where we're going to be moving from managing jobs to redesigning work,\" Jones said.\n\nShe said the role of HR will shift into helping organizations figure out what work is allocated to humans and what work is done by AI — and how the two work together.",

    "title": "How Netflix's stock lost its FANG-era mojo",
    "description": "The streaming giant is putting a lot of cash to work, and it's not growing as quickly as investors want.",
    "fullText": "The last decade in the stock market has been dominated by two distinct eras.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, \"FAANG stocks\" were all the rage. The elite crew of Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) represented the big winners of the mobile and cloud-computing explosion.\n\nIn more recent years, the Magnificent 7 — populated by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — has taken the reins. Driven by immense optimism over the future profitability of AI, the group has become a market-moving behemoth.\n\nSomewhere, during that transition, one piece of the FAANG cohort lost its elite status and did not roll over into the Mag 7: Netflix.\n\nThe exclusion makes sense. Netflix isn't known as an AI stock, so it doesn't naturally fit with the Mag 7. And based on the relative underperformance of Netflix shares over the last five years, compared to every stock in the group but Amazon, it's clear investors have accepted its spot away from the \"cool table\" in the cafeteria.\n\nSo what exactly is up with Netflix lately? Its latest earnings report from this week offers a good encapsulation of the company's recent issues:\n\nNetflix's pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery is expected to add hundreds of millions in costs in 2026. This comes alongside plans to boost TV-show and film spending by 10%.\n\nThe company is forecasting revenue growth of roughly 13% this year, down from 16% in 2025. And it's going to get more expensive to sustain that growth if Netflix continues its push into pricier new areas like live sports — a key push in its battle with YouTube over viewer eyeballs.\n\nThe $11 billion of free cash flow forecasted by Netflix missed analyst estimates.\n\nShares dropped as much as 6% before finishing 2% lower, at a one-year low. The prolonged decline can be traced back to mid-2025.\n\nNetflix's two prior earnings reports, in July and October, were among the main culprits. The company faced many of the same issues as its elite Mag 7 peers — namely sky-high expectations, sensitivity to heavy spending, and surprise tax charges.\n\nThe main difference is that Netflix doesn't have the backstop of the AI trade. It hasn't been given the same benefit of the doubt that its big spending will translate into gold-plated earnings growth.\n\nStill, on the heels of Netflix's multimonth slump, analysts are predominantly bullish. 65% of analysts have a \"buy\" on the stock at current levels, while just 4% have a \"sell.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley says the company's progress towards quickly building a $3 billion-plus advertising business is being underrated by the market. Other firms, meanwhile, simply think the stock has fallen so much that its valuation looks attractive.\n\nThe question now becomes if investors will buy in and start pushing Netflix back to the great heights it once enjoyed.",

    "description": "Ina Garten swears by her easy yet delicious avocado and fried egg tartine. The dish, an elevated avocado toast, is simple enough to make on a weekday.",
    "fullText": "To make Garten's recipe for four, you'll need:\n\nI preheated the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and placed my prosciutto on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.\n\nGarten recommends roasting the prosciutto for seven to nine minutes, until it starts to brown. So I set a timer and popped the pan into the oven.\n\nI was able to get 2 tablespoons of juice from a small lemon.\n\nGarten's recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of Kosher salt and ½ teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.\n\nI pressed down on the mixture with the fork's prongs to get that chunky texture that's perfect for avocado toast.\n\nGarten recommends frying all four of your eggs over medium heat in a 12-inch sauté pan, cracking each egg on opposite sides of the pan.\n\nI decided to fry two eggs at a time instead, sprinkling each one with some salt and pepper. Per Garten's recipe, I cooked the eggs for one minute, until the whites started to set, then turned the heat to medium-low and covered the pan. (Pro tip: Garten says you can use a larger pan or even a sheet pan if you don't have a lid.)\n\nI cooked the eggs for three more minutes, until the whites were completely set but the yolks were still runny. This trick made my fried eggs look perfect and was worth the minimal extra effort.\n\nI evenly spread the avocado mixture on the bread slices before I began cooking my eggs, so they'd be ready to go.\n\nThen I carefully placed each egg right on top.\n\nWhat I love about Garten's elevated twist on avocado toast is the amount of color the tartines bring to the breakfast table. You've got the bold green from the avocado, the sunshine yellow of the egg yolk, and that burst of crimson from the roasted prosciutto.\n\nThey just look so fresh and healthy, and are definitely Instagram-worthy.\n\nGarten's fresh spin on avocado toast is so simple to make, but she adds those special touches that make the recipe taste elevated.\n\nThe roasted prosciutto adds some great crunch, the eggs are cooked to perfection thanks to her special frying trick, and the lemon juice and Sriracha give the avocado both a lift and a kick. Each bite is full of flavor, and the tartines somehow have the freshness of a summer dish while still being comforting enough to get you through winter.\n\nWho doesn't love a recipe that's perfect for any time and season?",

    "title": "Chipotle's new PAC signals a change in how the company engages in politics",
    "description": "Ahead of the midterms, Chipotle has filed to form a political action committee, in a departure from its prior \"Government Affairs Engagement Policy.\"",
    "fullText": "Chipotle Mexican Grill has filed paperwork to form a political action committee, marking a shift in how the burrito chain engages in US politics.\n\nThe filing, a Statement of Organization submitted to the Federal Election Commission early this month, establishes a corporate PAC, a vehicle that allows companies to collect voluntary political donations from employees and executives and give that money to federal candidates.\n\nTwo corporate governance and political campaign finance experts said that, for a consumer-facing brand that has previously kept its distance from direct campaign giving, the move signals a more formal and proactive approach to federal politics — just as the 2026 midterm elections are heating up.\n\nThe decision also represents a departure from Chipotle's prior stance. In versions of its Government Affairs Engagement Policy dating from 2021 and 2024, the company said it did not operate a PAC, though it noted that it could form one in the future.\n\n\"As Congress debates critical issues in 2026, the PAC is a meaningful way to give our 130,000 employees a voice in the political process that impacts their lives, communities, and our business, on a day-to-day basis,\" Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe timing of Chipotle's move is notable. The 2026 midterm elections are expected to be exceptionally competitive, in part because several states have undertaken mid-decade redistricting — a move that can make races more unpredictable and more expensive.\n\n\"When elections are heavily contested, they tend to cost more money,\" Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor of law at Stetson University College of Law and a Brennan Center fellow, told Business Insider. \"Candidates for Congress are subject to hard money limits, so they may want money from corporate PACs to run their campaigns.\"\n\nCorporate PACs can also serve longer-term strategic goals. Companies may give to lawmakers with influence over issues that affect their business, or to candidates they believe will appoint regulators aligned with their interests.\n\n\"Rather than just lobbying, a PAC allows a company to directly influence the election of officials, ensuring that legislators understand the company's specific business interests,\" Anat Alon-Beck, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, whose research focuses on corporate law and governance, said.\n\nWhile corporate PACs are common across many sectors, restaurants have historically been smaller players in federal campaign finance. Trade groups like the National Beer Wholesalers Association and companies like American Crystal Sugar have been among the more active PACs in the food and drink space, but restaurant brands themselves have not ranked among the top corporate PAC spenders.\n\nThat context makes Chipotle's filing less about joining a dominant political force and more about signaling a shift in posture.\n\nSome clues can be found in Chipotle's previous government affairs contribution reports, which outline the company's contributions to political organizations and in support of state and local ballot measures.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, Chipotle as a company gave $50,000 each to both the Democratic and Republican Governors Associations and $25,000 to the Democratic Mayors Association. It also made annual contributions of $150,000 to the National Restaurant Association, in addition to $625,000 in 2024 and $408,000 in 2023 to Save Local Restaurants, a coalition led by the National Restaurant Association to lobby for pro-restaurant legislation.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association has its own PAC that has historically donated primarily to Republican candidates, according to OpenSecrets data.\n\nCorporate PACs — formally known under federal law as \"separate segregated funds\" — exist because corporations are barred from donating money from their own treasuries directly to federal candidates.\n\n\"That ban comes from the Tillman Act of 1907,\" Torres-Spelliscy said. \"To avoid that ban, corporations ask people who are associated with the company, typically executives, to donate up to $5,000 to the corporate PAC.\"\n\nThose funds can then be donated directly to candidates within federal contribution limits — $5,000 per candidate per election if the PAC contributes to at least five candidates, or a maximum of $3,500 if the PAC supports fewer than five candidates.\n\nOne advantage of corporate PACs, Torres-Spelliscy said, is transparency. \"Everyone who donates knows that the money is going into politics,\" she said. \"And the public can see who has given to the corporate PAC and who the corporate PAC has donated money to.\"\n\nSince 2010, corporations have also been able to spend money through Super PACs, which can accept unlimited funds — including corporate treasury money — as long as they operate independently of candidates. Creating a Super PAC requires a separate filing with the FEC, which Chipotle had not submitted at the time of publication.\n\n\"The catch is a Super PAC spends money independently of a candidate,\" Torres-Spelliscy said.\n\nThat independence can be a drawback for companies that want a more direct relationship with lawmakers. While Super PACs allow for far larger sums, they can't coordinate with campaigns or give directly to candidates.\n\nIn practice, the biggest corporate donors to Super PACs in recent election cycles have come from industries like cryptocurrency and fossil fuels — not restaurants or food companies, according to data from OpenSecrets.\n\n\"A corporation may still want to have a corporate PAC if it wants to make donations directly to federal candidates,\" Torres-Spelliscy said.",

    "description": "DJ Tina Technotic enjoys all-night raves, cuts meetings short, and cleans house when she needs to think.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 61-year-old Tina Woods, the CEO and founder of Collider Health, an organization developing public-private partnerships for healthy aging and longevity. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a 61-year-old CEO moonlighting as DJ \"Tina Technotic\" I am not one of those executives with a strict bedtime or daily routine.\n\nA few years ago, as I was finishing writing my book, \"Live Longer with AI,\" and starting hormone replacement therapy for menopause, I decided to enact some lifestyle changes aimed at improving my longevity. I learned how to DJ, to keep me in the groove while recovering from foot surgery, and I also started practicing a low-key form of intermittent fasting. Now I enjoy more all-night dance parties than I did before surgery!\n\nBiohacker Bryan Johnson would probably not approve of my all-night raves, but they bring me such joy and are a big part of my own personal longevity protocol. While stepping out of the routine energizes me and fuels my creativity, there are still a few things I do just about every day to help anchor me and drive results.\n\nMy morning ritual usually starts with a cup of Earl Grey tea followed by a proper oat milk latte. I like to turn on BBC Radio 4 and listen to what's happening in the world while I'm caffeinating. Even though a lot of what we hear every day is bad news, I think it's important to feel connected to what is reverberating around the world and tap into the zeitgeist.\n\nMost people in my circle have a house cleaner, but I consider housecleaning an integral part of my morning, and I usually do a bit right after the coffee hits.\n\nI have a schedule for which rooms get cleaned every day, with special emphasis on high-use areas like the bathrooms and the kitchen. I enjoy it, the physicality of polishing a window or scrubbing something — and I find the movement provides a great time to get new ideas, because my mind is able to free-associate more than when I'm at my desk.\n\nDuring the day, I am on a lot of scheduled Zoom calls, chatting with interesting folks around the world, cementing partnerships, or planning longevity events like the recent JoyScore experiment I piloted in San Francisco in December, alongside my DJ partner and Longevity Rave cofounder Yukari Takehisa. We are partnering with wearable brands, longevity spaces, in talks with The PlayaAI Foundation (from Burning Man) and also various resorts around the world to see how we might better measure how joy, longevity, and health are so interconnected.\n\nIn the old days, I would say yes to a meeting at four in the morning, knowing it was important for my job advancement. But now I can afford to be a little bit more ruthless, and I try to avoid any and all pointless meetings — of which there are many in this world. If someone invites me to a meeting that's an hour long, I say, \"Well, listen, I've got half an hour.\"\n\nOf course, being a good business leader is also about knowing when you do need the time to have a more expansive meeting, and creating that flex in your schedule. Even though I have a packed schedule, I always make time for people with interesting ideas. I'm intrigued by the unusual and the underdogs, the people who are the mavericks, and so I will always make time for those people, whether they be students with new and unusual proposals, someone wanting to start a new company, or another entrepreneur asking me to join their board.\n\nI use a ton of technology to help me get through the day: databases, mail mergers, accountancy software, website design, and ChatGPT. This is a way that I've created space for myself.\n\nIn the old days, you would have assistants doing all your stuff. You spend a lot of time getting people, recruiting people, training people, and then briefing people and checking on their work, taking up a huge amount of time. I've got rid of all that, and now with what spare time I have, I try and build in a little time each day for exploration and learning.\n\nMy day-to-day typically involves me trying out some kind of new technology related to longevity. Last year, I did a biological age workup at a clinic in Poland where one measure of biological aging, the Glycan Age test, put me at 35 years old. But I didn't stop there, knowing that one biological age measurement is only a snapshot at best, a single measure that looks at how I'm aging in certain ways, but not others. Just the other day, I went to a London skin clinic and got my skin age measured. After analyzing wrinkles, UV damage, and the like, my biological \"skin age\" was clocked at 54. Another immune age measurement I took recently had me at 51, a full decade lower than my real age, and an aging rate on par with centenarians.\n\nThe great thing about being your own boss is that you get to set your schedule. I don't mind taking a late-evening call or an early-morning conference with people in other time zones, but I am vigilant about making my schedule work for me.\n\nI am writing a new book chapter on the future of work, and have found that one of my best times to write is after a Saturday mid-morning Zumba class.\n\nI don't mind having work calls on Saturdays either, because the reverse of that means that I can go out for a run any time I want. I can build a calendar around what works best for my work life and health.\n\nI generally I'm not a real purist about this, though. I don't make it absolutely rigid that I do not have a single element of food between the time I wake up and the first meal of the day, which is generally dinner in the evening. I might have a handful of nuts and seeds or a little bit of lean meat as a snack. By mid-afternoon, I may enjoy a cup of miso soup to tide me over until dinner.\n\nI make it a priority to get in an hour of exercise six days a week. I typically work out between 5 and 8 p.m., doing a mix of running, rowing, and strength training. My mind travels off in all sorts of different directions when I'm running and listening to music, so it's a great time to get bright ideas.\n\nI find that the hour just before and just after my workout is a great time to let my brain free roam and do creative work, free from distractions.\n\nI generally give myself one day off a week — especially if I was out raving the night before.\n\nDinner is a great time to unwind and connect after a long day. Sitting down with my husband, having a good old chat about our day, that's probably the thing that I do most religiously. You'll often hear longevity experts advising people to eat dinner early, aiding digestion, but because of our schedules, dinner usually ends up being between 8 and 9 p.m., and I'm fine with that.\n\nAs I age, I am focusing more on protein in my meals, with plenty of chicken, fish, seeds, and nuts. I still indulge now and then with a piece of beautiful dark chocolate, and I won't turn down a good glass of Champagne on special occasions. I think that's part of the fun and the joy in life.\n\nThe idea of having a rigid sleep hygiene schedule is crazy for me — it just doesn't work for the life that I lead, and I want to lead. That being said, I do make sure to get enough rest. I try to listen to my body when it's tired, and allow myself to sleep in if I've been out dancing the night before. I usually get about six hours of sleep, and that feels great for me.\n\nSome people would consider getting on the dance floor an indulgence. I see that as an absolutely essential part of my schedule. That feeling that you get on the dance floor, the connection, the power of the music, the synchrony, the euphoria, those are very, very powerful things.\n\nMy husband is my chief raving partner, which is absolutely fantastic. In general, we both have a thirst for adventure: climbing mountains, traveling to new places, getting out into the wild and natural world. Surrounding yourself with an energy that is bigger than you is such an important and sustaining part of my longevity routine.",

    "description": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.",
    "fullText": "A large multicentre clinical trial led by King’s College London with 150 children and adolescents has shown that a device cleared by the US FDA to treat ADHD is not effective in reducing symptoms.\n\nThe device – which uses an approach called trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) - was cleared for use by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to treat ADHD in 2019 based on a small study. These new findings from a larger multicentre trial, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggest authorities should revisit the original evidence that supported the FDA clearance. Notably, TNS is currently not recommended for use in the UK by NICE guidelines.\n\nThe trial was run in collaboration with University of Southampton and funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, a partnership between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC), with further support from the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects five to eight per cent of school-age children worldwide and is associated with age-inappropriate problems with attention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that can impair everyday functioning. Stimulant medications improve symptoms in 70 per cent of those who take them in the short term but there is less evidence of their long-term effects.\n\nTo provide an alternative to medication researchers have developed and trialled approaches that use non-invasive stimulation of the brain, working on the regions that have been identified as influential in ADHD.\n\nOne of these approaches involves stimulating the trigeminal nerve (TNS), targeting a branch of this facial nerve which is thought to activate the brainstem and from there other brain regions that may be relevant to ADHD, in particular the locus coeruleus, which plays a role in arousal which is typically diminished in people with ADHD. TNS is thought to stimulate other brain regions associated with attention such as frontal and thalamic areas via the brainstem in a bottom-up manner.\n\nA previous small trial in the US with 62 children diagnosed with ADHD has shown that when TNS is applied every night for eight hours for one month it is effective in reducing symptoms – this research led to its clearance by the FDA for use in the US. However, the control condition involved no stimulation, and blinding was not tested after one month, raising questions about a potential placebo effect.\n\nThis new UK clinical trial across two sites in London and Southampton tested TNS in a wider range of 150 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD aged between eight and 18 years old and applied a more rigorous placebo condition. Half of the sample received real TNS for about 9 hours every night for four weeks through battery-powered electrodes applied to the forehead. The other half of the sample received the ‘sham’ condition where electrodes were still applied to the forehead every night for four weeks but participants only received 30 seconds of stimulation every hour at a lower frequency and pulse width, which are thought to be non-effective and hence act as a “control” condition.\n\nOur study shows how important it is to design an appropriate placebo condition in clinical trials of brain therapies. There is a large placebo effect with high-tech brain therapies, in particular for patients and families that have an expectation that they can adjust brain differences associated with ADHD. It is hence paramount to control for placebo effects in modern brain therapies to avoid false hopes.\n\nDr Aldo Conti, postdoctoral researcher at IoPPN and at Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, King’s College London and first author on the study said: “This multicentre trial was designed to address key limitations of the previous pilot study that informed FDA clearance of TNS for ADHD, particularly by using a rigorously controlled sham condition that supported successful blinding across the treatment period. Unlike the earlier study, which was limited to younger children, we also included adolescents, a clinically important group given well-documented challenges with long-term medication adherence. These design choices enabled a more robust and clinically relevant evaluation of TNS.”\n\nThe trial showed that TNS was safe with no serious adverse events and most participants considered it a mild or no burden to use. However, the results showed no significant change in ADHD symptoms, objective measures of hyperactivity, attention and associated behaviours around mood and sleep.\n\nProfessor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at University of Southampton and study lead for the Southampton site, stated: “Rigorous evidence, such as that generated by this study, is essential for supporting shared decision-making regarding interventions for ADHD. It empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to make informed choices about the treatment of ADHD. Clinicians, individuals with ADHD, and their families need to know which treatments work, and which do not based on the best evidence.”\n\nThe trial was run by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit and recruitment involved the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinics within the following NHS trusts: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Healthcare (previously known as SOLENT NHS Trust), Central and North-West London NHS Foundation Trust, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust and South-West London and St. George’s Mental Health NHS Trust.\n\nExternal trigeminal nerve stimulation in youth with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled, phase 2b trial by Conti, A.A. et al was published in Nature Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04075-x\n\nProfessor of Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate",

She's not fit or available to play. She wants to go,\" Sorensen said before Everton's match against Brighton (Friday, 19:00 GMT).\n\n\"She has a release clause in her contract so the club that wants her can just pay that and she is free to go.\n\n\"From my understanding, it's like 10% of that release clause that has been submitted, so I don't think she's going anywhere.\"\n\nAsked if there is a chance Gago will play for Everton again this season, Sorensen added: \"I don't know at this point. We have to see how everything plays out.\"\n\nClub sources say an internal investigation following up on Gago's claims cleared staff of any wrongdoing.\n\nThey also believe claims that meetings were missed and that Gago was forced to sign a contract extension last year are false.",

    "description": "FPL managers will be worried about Erling Haaland's recent form - is it time to move away from the Manchester City striker as a captain choice?",
    "fullText": "What should FPL managers do with Erling Haaland?\n\nThe one-time perma-captain has just 14 points and one goal from his past five games.\n\nIn his 17 games before that, the Norwegian netted 19 times, and a closer look at his underlying data shows a bit of a decline too\n\nA home fixture versus Wolves would normally be a prime time to captain Haaland and potentially play a Triple Captain chip.\n\nBut his form is worrying, and there's always the threat he gets a rest - the striker has played every league game for City and started on Tuesday in the Champions League too.\n\nEgypt striker Omar Marmoush is back from the Africa Cup of Nations and could take Haaland's place.\n\nThere's no benefit from benching Haaland - more than three in four FPL manager own him - but this is definitely the time to consider handing the captain's armband to someone else.\n\nAnd that's what I've done in this team of the week.\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nDon't miss our FPL special Q&A with expert Holly Shand, live on the BBC Sport website on Friday, 23 January at 15:30 GMT.\n\n'Ridiculous amount of games' - has Haaland played too much football?\n\n'Battered in Bodo' - is this more than just a blip for Man City?\n\nA low-scoring week for most managers but returns from Florian Wirtz (10 points), Gabriel (8), Nordi Mukiele (6) and Enzo Fernandez (6) led the team to 45 points, five higher than the average score.\n\nJordan Pickford, Everton, keeper, £5.6m - Leeds (h)\n\nPickford is the top-scoring FPL keeper again, with 100 points already.\n\nIn the past five games, Everton have a league-high three clean sheets and, while they've struggled a bit at their new stadium, they face a Leeds side who are low scorers on the road, with just 11 goals in 11 games.\n\nJames Tarkowski, Everton, £5.6m - Leeds (h)\n\nAnother Everton asset worth the investment is Tarkowski, who has the second-most defensive contribution points (defcon) this season (32) and is fourth in the defender rankings with 108 points.\n\nA decent pick in any Toffees home game.\n\nGabriel, Arsenal, £6.8m - Manchester United (h)\n\nUnited's attacking performance in the Manchester derby last week doesn't exactly fill you with confidence of an Arsenal clean sheet - they were mighty impressive and could have scored five or six.\n\nBut Arsenal at home is a different matter, with just five goals conceded.\n\nAnd Gabriel is probably the most reliable FPL asset right now, with goal threat and a chance of defcon.\n\nMarc Guehi, Manchester City, £5.2m - Wolves (h)\n\nNew City defender Guehi is likely to be a popular choice, given his price and the attacking returns he has had so far this season.\n\nWolves have only scored five goals on the road - this is a huge clean sheet chance.\n\nNathan Collins, Brentford, £5m - Nottingham Forest (h)\n\nContinuing a theme of centre-backs with high defcon and attacking return potential, Collins has been an FPL gem recently with 10-point and 13-point hauls in his past three games.\n\nHe is worth a shot in another nice home fixture.\n\nFlorian Wirtz, Liverpool, £8.3m - Bournemouth (a)\n\nThe German has three 10-point performances in his past five games and only Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes has more points (38) than his 36 in that time.\n\nBournemouth have only conceded 11 in 11 home games, so this isn't an easy game for Liverpool.\n\nHowever, Wirtz leads all Liverpool players for xG (2.31) and expected assists (1.45) in those five games - he is bang on form.\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Manchester City, £7.6m - Wolves (h)\n\nCity have just three points from their past four league games but at some point they are going to put that right and a team is going to be on the receiving end of a hiding.\n\nIf you were going to handpick an opponent to give City a \"get-right\" game, it would be bottom-of-the-table Wolves.\n\nWith doubts over whether Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki start, Semenyo is the safest City bet from midfield.\n\nHarry Wilson, Fulham, £5.9m - Brighton (h)\n\nWilson has 10 FPL returns in his past 10 games and is probably the best-value pick in the game.\n\nHe's been very efficient, with five goals from 11 shots on target and five assists from three big chances created.\n\nA bit like Chris Wood last season, he's in a category of players where you shouldn't even worry about looking at statistics.\n\nWilson is a fine pick for the rest of the season given the price.\n\nErling Haaland, Manchester City, £15.1m - Wolves (h)\n\nHaaland still makes the team but the fear of a benching, Wolves' improved form and his recent blanks put me off captaincy.\n\nIgor Thiago (captain), Brentford, £7.2m - Nottingham Forest (h)\n\nOnly Haaland (8.18) has more FPL points per home start among strikers than Thiago (6.09).\n\nThe Brazilian has has five double-digit hauls this season, with four of those coming at home.\n\nAnd Sean Dyche is yet to turn Forest into a water-tight defence.\n\nYes, they have produced some fine performances, such as beating Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield and holding Arsenal to a 0-0 last week at home.\n\nBut they've also been whalloped by the likes of Aston Villa and Everton on the road and only the Gunners and Manchester City have scored more at home than Brentford.\n\nThierno Barry, Everton, £5.7m - Leeds (h)\n\nHe took a while to get going but the big Frenchman now has three goals in four games and is emerging as a solid budget forward choice, especially for those of you thinking of wildcarding.\n\nMartin Dubravka, Burnley, keeper, £4m - Tottenham (h)\n\nEnzo Fernandez, Chelsea, midfielder, £6.5m - Crystal Palace (a)\n\nJoachim Andersen, Fulham, defender, £4.6m - Brighton (h)\n\nGranit Xhaka, Sunderland, midfielder, £5.2m - West Ham (a)\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

I'm sorry,\" former world number one Osaka replied.\n\n\"She's a great player.

    "title": "Well, There Goes the Metaverse",
    "description": "The metaverse is on its last legs as VR is eclipsed by AI. But that's not the only thing that went wrong for Meta's VR ambitions.",
    "fullText": "Meta’s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It’s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.\n\nAs industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.\n\nIn part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z’s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook’s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.\n\nMeta’s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta’s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.\n\nFast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.\n\nAccording to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel’s Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard’s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire.\n\nAnd last week, The Verge noted that Meta’s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.\n\nThe news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department’s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.\n\nUnlike the news of Meta’s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company’s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit.\n\nIn total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you’d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.\n\nBesides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn’t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.\n\nThat model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.\n\nMeta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers.\n\nSpecifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta’s revenue through their app stores.\n\n“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we’ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company’s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I’ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”\n\nHe proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.\n\nMeta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren’t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta’s size.\n\nThough there’s no external visibility into Meta’s own VR app store, you can look at Meta’s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.\n\nFrom a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that’s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.\n\nFor comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\n\nOf course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook’s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook’s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)\n\nBut this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google’s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.\n\nEven before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.\n\nAs bad, Meta wasn’t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.\n\nIn May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors’ behavior.\n\nAt the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.\n\nThese types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn’t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn’t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”\n\nAlso around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we’d guess there weren’t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it’s not a bad bet!)\n\nAnother nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta’s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week.\n\nWith an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)\n\nWith other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass.\n\nCombined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app’s growth, and large language models.",

    "fullText": "In BBC Sport's new Eat & Yap series, Alex Scott meets some of the best Women's Super League players to share the food they love and grew up eating, and talk about life on and off the pitch.\n\nWatch the interview in full now on BBC iPlayer\n\nOlivia Smith will forever be the women's game's first seven-figure player.\n\nAged 15, she won her first senior Canada cap while playing college football in her homeland.\n\nAged 18, she signed her first professional contract with Portuguese club Sporting, announcing her arrival with a goal and an assist on her debut.\n\nAged 19, she moved to the Women's Super League (WSL) to play for fallen giants Liverpool, starring on the right wing as the two-time champions avoided relegation back to the second tier.\n\nIn July 2025, European champions Arsenal broke the broke the world record to bring 20-year-old Smith to north London.\n\nIn the first episode of Eat & Yap the Arsenal and Canada superstar sat down with Alex Scott to tuck into some tasty dishes that reflect her life growing up in Canada and her Caribbean roots, while revealing her footballing idols, a love of Yorkshire puddings and much more.\n\nAlex Scott: So I was told I have to bring maple syrup.\n\nOlivia Smith: Yeah, you're a gem. Maple syrup. Lovely. First of all, I always have, for example, pancakes before a match. I just like pancakes and I always need to have maple syrup. Honestly, I eat this with everything.\n\nAlex: When was the last time you were actually at home in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Oh - probably in the summer, as I spent my Christmas here.\n\nAlex: What do you think of home? Can you build a picture for me of what life was like for you growing up back home?\n\nOlivia: I have a younger sister, so we grew up together. My family were all kind of goofballs I would say. So just playing games a lot, we're always outside, we have dogs as well. So I've grown up with dogs and just go to the park, play football, play with the dogs. That's kind of like what a typical day would look like.\n\nAlex: So your sister plays football?\n\nAlex: What position does she play?\n\nOlivia: Midfielder, winger, striker.\n\nAlex: So does she look up to you and want to follow in your footsteps?\n\nOlivia: I hope so, but she claims she's better than me!\n\nAlex: Does she literally watch your games and say \"You should have been doing this\" or \"You should have scored that goal\"?\n\nOlivia: Yes - she sends me snapchats of my game and says \"Why did you do that?\" I'm like, well, \"What would you have done?\"\n\nAlex: What did she think when you made your move to Arsenal?\n\nOlivia: She was so excited. I mean she also looks up to a team like Arsenal, she loves watching me play so then for me to get the opportunity and really be a role model for her playing with girls like Alessia [Russo] and Leah [Williamson], it's amazing. She's really excited for me.\n\nAlex: Who do you look up to back in Canada?\n\nOlivia: Christine Sinclair. She's a huge legend in the game of course, and also Marta. Then I love watching the men's game as well, so I was always looking up to Neymar, Ronaldinho, Messi, players like that.\n\nAlex: What did your family make of you playing football?\n\nOlivia: I think my dad really grew me into football and he kind of paved the way for me. He made so many sacrifices for me to be where I am today. I also wanted it and he could see that.\n\nAlex: How would your family and friends describe you?\n\nOlivia: Oh, ambitious, crazy... just attacking-minded. My dad always described me whenever I'd play as I'd just take the ball off my own team-mates to go score a goal!\n\nAlex: What was it like for you to make that transition when you finally moved away from Canada playing football?\n\nOlivia: It was quite tough, although I had been away from home for a bit before that. But going to Portugal, for example, it's a whole new world. Different language, different style of football. So having to learn that really on my own was quite tough. But the support system that I had around me was great, so I was able to adapt, I'd say, quite quickly, which is nice.\n\nAnd then, obviously, coming over to England, then that's a whole other environment, style of play, different kinds of people. And obviously it just takes a little bit [of time] to get comfortable. Once you make friends and you're happy, it makes a world of difference on the pitch and off the pitch.\n\nAlex: What would you say is the biggest thing you've learned about yourself?\n\nOlivia: I would say I always thought I was quite independent, but coming here and my ability to make relationships with people on my team and outside of football as well, it has really helped me to acclimatise to what life is like here.\n\nAlex: So we need to explain your background. The Jamaican food - your dad - Jamaican roots, right? And I learned your mum has Chilean and Peruvian roots. What was dinner like at home?\n\nOlivia: Dinner looks different pretty much every day and especially when my grandparents would come by to cook. That's when you know it's on top. So we'd have jerk chicken and my grandpa would make oxtail and my grandmother would make something called seco.\n\nOlivia: It's like a [Peruvian] meat stew and rice, and it's in a green sauce - it's really nice.\n\nAlex: And your grandads played football?\n\nAlex: So when they come round, were there football matches? Were you watching them?\n\nOlivia: I was always playing with them when we went on vacation to the Dominican - we always found a pitch and then we would play pick-up games with random people. My grandparents would join, I would join, my dad and my sister - it was always fun.\n\nAlex: What's your typical day off looking like?\n\nOlivia: It depends on the day and how I feel, but I do pretty much like to stay at home. I like to watch movies, binge watch, I also play video games as well. So, yeah, games, probably a little bit of shopping because I love to shop.\n\nAlex: Right. So if you're not playing football, you are..?\n\nAlex: If one song could be playing when you score a goal, what would it be?\n\nOlivia: I'm going to go with A Milli [by Lil Wayne] because I have that on my pre-match playlists. I think every game.\n\nAlex: The last thing you wrote in your phone notes was?\n\nOlivia: Oh. A bunch of numbers. I was playing an escape room game, so I needed to write down all these numbers so I could put it into a code.\n\nAlex: Since moving to England, what's one thing that you're just like \"I absolutely love this\"?\n\nOlivia: I fell in love with Yorkshire puddings and a Sunday dinner. It's my favourite thing - I absolutely love them now.\n\nAlex: Not many people love Yorkshire puddings.\n\nOlivia: Well, initially I wasn't sure. I was very hesitant because I had in my mind, like gravy on bread. And when I tried it for the first time I thought - how do you even describe Yorkshire puddings?\n\nAlex: Let's think about when we're looking ahead to the season, what are your goals and ambitions?\n\nOlivia: Ultimately, I want to become a better version of myself as a player. I know there's a lot of things I need to develop on, and being at Arsenal that will definitely help me. And ultimately I want to win things.\n\nAlex: Do you feel that you've settled in and the reasons that made you want to come to the club are starting to open up to you?\n\nOlivia: Yeah, 100%. I think the first couple of months it was a lot to really take in, but the girls have been amazing making me feel comfortable.\n\nAlex: Talk me through that first day when you arrived at Arsenal.\n\nOlivia: I was absolutely terrified, yeah, because every time we played Arsenal it was just a massive game. Obviously you never know what the environment is like from the outside, and I didn't know what to expect. And walking in, it was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be - everyone was just so welcoming.\n\nAlex: Who's the MVP, the person that if they weren't there tomorrow you'd be thinking \"this feels strange\"?\n\nOlivia: Less [Russo] really. She just has that personality and that vibe that you can feel at the training ground. It's just very comfortable and you can speak to her about anything. She's just very sweet.\n\nAlex: Renee [Slegers] has just signed a new three-year contract. In terms of the other managers that you've played for, how is she different?\n\nOlivia: She's just very ambitious and I feel like that goes for all around the club. Her values match [the club] and match the players as well, so I think that's just a really great thing to have, and also stability - knowing that she's going to be here for the next three years. To have a female empower us - I think that's her big thing as well, that she wants the players to feel empowered and use our voices - which every time that I've spoken to her I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.\n\nAlex: Do you know about my history with Renee? I used to be her teacher when she first came over. I was a teacher at the Arsenal Academy at the time so it's kind of full circle to see her go on to manage the team. She knows what being at the club means for everyone.\n\nAlex: Talking of the next thing, when you're looking at you and your career, what is it that you want to tick off? What do you want to achieve?\n\nOlivia: Oh, there's plenty of things I want to achieve. I want to win everything, ultimately. And again, the biggest thing is I just want to keep developing and growing as a person and a player. I think that's really important to me, just continue to develop my character, meeting more people and just learning.\n\nAlex: You said meeting more people. How have the Arsenal fans embraced you?\n\nOlivia: They've been amazing. I attended the [Arsenal Women fan engagement project] Block by Block, external consultation a couple of weeks ago where we discussed how we can make matchdays better.\n\nIt was really fun because I got to interact with the fans more on a personal level rather than them being up in the stands and just clapping - actually having a conversation and seeing what we can do to make the experience better for them, but also for us as players. Whether that's music, fireworks, just making it more fun.\n\nAlex: I bet the fans must have been buzzing. Did they know that you were turning up?\n\nOlivia: I'm actually not sure, but they seemed quite shocked when I pulled up!\n\nWatch: Arsenal v Chelsea in the Women's Super League on Saturday, 24 June (12:30 GMT) on BBC One and BBC iPlayer\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Quake Brutalist Jam began as a celebration of old-fashioned shooter level design, but its latest version is one step away from being a game in its own right",
    "fullText": "Quake Brutalist Jam began as a celebration of old-fashioned shooter level design, but its latest version is one step away from being a game in its own right\n\nA lone concrete spire stands in a shallow bowl of rock, sheltering a rusted trapdoor from the elements. Standing on the trapdoor causes it to yawn open like iron jaws, dropping you through a vertical shaft into a subterranean museum. Here, dozens of doors line the walls of three vaulted grey galleries, each leading to a pocket dimension of dizzying virtual architecture and fierce gladiatorial combat.\n\nWelcome to Quake Brutalist Jam, the hottest community event for lovers of id Software’s classic first-person shooter from 1996. First run in 2022, the Jam started out as a celebration of old-school 3D level design, where veteran game developers, aspiring level designers and enthusiast modders gather to construct new maps and missions themed around the austere minimalism of brutalist architecture.\n\nThis third iteration of the Jam goes much further. In an intense six-week session, contributors designed 77 brutalist-themed maps where players fight new enemies with new weapons. For context, the original Quake, built by legendary game designers such as John Carmack, John Romero, Tim Willits and American McGee, featured 37 levels when it was first released.\n\nBen Hale is the event’s concierge, a professional game developer working as seniorenvironment artist on the forthcoming survival game Subnautica 2. As a child, Hale learned to build Quake levels with the encouragement of his older brother. “He was very supportive, despite how often I bluescreened his computer,” Hale recalls.\n\nThe idea for a brutalism-themed “jam” – a hobbyist term for an intensive, community game development session that takes place over several days or weeks – came from another Quake mapper named Benoit Stordeur, inspired by a set of concrete textures Hale designed for Quake. “I posted a poll [of themes] for the community to vote on, with brutalism as a choice. Brutalism won by a wide margin,” Hale says.\n\nThe first Quake Brutalist Jam captured the community’s imagination, with participants producing 35 levels in two-and-a-half weeks using Hale’s concrete textures. In a game that already features oppressive gothic and industrial environments, the moody stylings of brutalism proved powerful creative fuel. “So many brutalist buildings look like cool sci-fi structures or evil lairs,” Hale says. The second jam ran in 2023, spawning 30 more proudly grey levels for players to blast through.\n\nBut as he began planning a third jam, Hale ran into some health issues. “I pitched to my friend, Fairweather, to be my cohost this year,” Hale says. “They made the suggestion that we do something a little different this time.”\n\nFairweather is Lain Fleming, a veteran modder who has led numerous community Quake projects including Dwell, Remix Jam and the Coffee Quake series. Rather than simply make new levels for Quake, Fleming suggested giving the Jam’s participants some new tools to work with. “When we began, we simply wanted to visually overhaul some weapons and monsters. But as we did more and more, ideas began to grow,” Fleming says. “We analysed mechanical gaps in the arsenal and enemies, which resulted in many new enemy paradigms you rarely see in Quake.”\n\nThis type of mod, known as a total conversion, proved far more ambitious than Hale or Fleming anticipated. “What was supposed to be a quick six-month mod to host a jam in became a two-year monstrosity. The list of people contributing grew bigger over time, with a team of about 15 near the end,” Hale says.\n\nDespite the challenges, the team ultimately produced an almost entirely new toolset for Quake. Virtually every available weapon is new or heavily modified, including a shotgun with bouncing projectiles, a gun that launches iron rebars, and a cluster-missile launcher. Enemies, meanwhile, mix redesigned Quake staples with entirely new foes.\n\nThe overhaul proved hugely successful. Quake Brutalist Jam 3 had more than double the number of participants for previous jams – so many that Hale had to radically alter his plans for the Start map, the playable mission-select screen that’s something of a Quake tradition. “I opted for a museum or gallery approach,” Hale says. “We had to pack the maps very tightly, which I struggled with a lot.”\n\nThe range of levels contributed by the community is enormous. There are quickfire experiments that last a matter of minutes, high-intensity “slaughtermaps” designed to test player reflexes, ambitious, narrative-driven exploration levels that pay tribute to the form and shape of virtual architecture, and gargantuan gun-fests that last an hour or longer.\n\nIndeed, the featured map, Escape from KOE-37, is almost a game in its own right – an epic three-hour affair heavily inspired by Half-Life with its own storyline and more than 1,000 enemies to fight. Its creator, who goes by the online handle Mazu, is a veteran of the Quake mapping community who spent about 400 hours building it. “Environmental puzzles and set-pieces are just really fun to do. [I] really wanted to have interactive environments for players to explore,” he says. “I just allow my creativity to put ideas into my map without axing too many of them. Doubts would lead to slower progress.”\n\nMaps such as KOE-37 highlight the remarkable work that community members have been doing for years in a space that professional game design has long since abdicated. Once the most popular genre around, linear, single-player first-person shooters have become relatively rare in mainstream game development, pushed to one side in favour of sprawling open worlds and multiplayer experiences. As such, the particular level design that games like Doom and Quake specialise in – complex 3D mazes where navigation is as much a part of the challenge as combat – is at risk of becoming a lost art.\n\nYet events such as QBJ3, alongside other Quake mods such as Arcane Dimensions and The Immortal Lock are not only keeping this style of virtual architecture alive, they often surpass the achievements of the old masters, twisting and warping and spooling out 3D geometry in ways that wouldn’t have been possible 30 years ago: “With these games, you have such a rich, decades-long history of levels to play that you can refine your own designs to a razor’s edge,” Fleming says.\n\nQuake Brutalist Jam 3 isn’t just for hardcore Quake fans and shooter addicts. This year’s Start map has a section dedicated to newcomers with little to no mapping experience. At the other end of the spectrum, it has also seen contributions from industry professionals such as game designer and former teacher at New York University’s Game Centre, Robert Yang.\n\n“It’s the underground Met Gala of concrete murderzone design, the biggest event on the Quake calendar,” Yang says. “Everyone shows off, everyone nurtures the new faces, everybody eats. I love it.”\n\nFor his contribution, One Need Not Be a House, Yang created an open-ended map that, were it not for all the heavily armed soldiers milling about, wouldn’t look out of place in an adventure game like Myst. “My map started as a study of the architect Louis Kahn’s ‘brick brutalism masterpieces – the National Assembly complex in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad [in India],” he says.\n\nOpen-ended levels can be tricky, and highly unusual for a Quake map. To help solve this problem, Yang looked to one of the most famous levels from Halo: Combat Evolved – The Silent Cartographer. “I wanted to make a similar non-linear map but with many branching paths, so you can mix and match your own route, get powerups out of order, and feel like you’re getting away with something.”\n\nYang says he doesn’t particularly like playing Quake as a shooter, but he admires how Quake Brutalist Jam 3 hints at a potential alternative way of making games, one that is driven by community rather than profit. “Brutalism, especially in the UK, is about building for the public. You don’t need to add beautiful ornaments because building and nurturing the future is already beautiful,” he says. “And that’s what Quake Brutalism is about too, a socialist utopia where handcrafted video games are a free public good that brings people together.”\n\nIt may not be long before Hale, along with Fleming and the other organisers, put such an idea into practice. Their next planned project is their own video game, one that’s fully independent of id Software’s shooter. “After this jam, we’re taking a bit of a break from modding and mapping for Quake,” Hale concludes. “We love the community and the continuous celebration of each other’s work and aren’t going anywhere. But also, we want to just make a game. We’ve been wanting to do that for so long it’s starting to hurt.”",

    "fullText": "Deadly ‘reverse’ cells can destroy us unless scientists stop them\n\nResearchers are close to making “reversed” cells that may wipe us off the planet\n\nLet’s say it’s 2036, and scientists are working on a new class of drugs. These medications are mirror-image versions of the molecules your body uses to fight disease. Their big advantage is that reverse compounds last longer in the body because destructive enzymes don’t recognize them and rip them apart. Yet the compounds are still effective against invading microbes. Clinical trials have been promising, and the team is eager to scale up production.\n\nThe researchers turn to engineered mirror bacteria—single cells made of reversed molecules—for the job. Bacterial factories aren’t a far-fetched idea. Today, for instance, pharmaceutical companies use bacteria to manufacture synthetic insulin for diabetics. Curious about whether mirror cells could be used in a similar way, the scientists experiment on a mirrored version of the common bacterium Escherichia coli.\n\nUnfortunately, a researcher with a small cut on her thumb from dry skin forgets to put on her gloves and touches a surface contaminated with just a few of these cells. The bacteria get into her blood.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nHer immune cells, which usually kill off intruders, don’t recognize the mirror proteins on the novel bacteria and fail to react. The mirror microbes multiply and spread within her. Defensive antibodies never appear. After a few days at home, the scientist falls gravely ill. She’s taken to a hospital, where she’s loaded with antibiotics that can’t make up for the massive failures of her immune system. Three days later she dies.\n\nBut while in her house, she had already spread the bacteria around. Her cat carries some into the garden, where they grow in the soil. Worms and insects become infected and transmit the mirror microbes throughout the neighborhood. Her children bring the bacteria to school. More and more people fall ill and begin to die. New outbreaks start in other locations as people and animals travel. A process of exponential and irreversible growth has begun—one that could quickly cover the world.\n\nThe scenario sounds like a sci-fi movie. But it is much closer to reality.\n\nScientists have been making rapid progress on technologies that could make it possible to build mirror organisms in the coming decades. Already biochemists can create increasingly complex mirror molecules, including enzymes that build mirror RNA. In the near future, similar enzymes could make reversed DNA. At the same time, synthetic biologists are getting closer to building regular bacterial cells from scratch. If progress in these two fields converges, it will be possible to build mirror bacteria.\n\nA little more than a year ago I and 37 of my colleagues published a warning about this potential catastrophe in Science, insisting on a halt to this work. But how do we stop or control research that can take place in dozens of laboratories in many countries all over the world? This is the story of that challenge—and our plan to prevent a terrible future.\n\nThe first glimpse of that future emerged in 1848, when a young Louis Pasteur took the podium at the French Academy of Sciences in Paris and announced a remarkable discovery. Pasteur had been looking closely at the crystals of an acid found in wine. These compounds could take one of two forms that, despite being chemically identical—made of the same chemical building blocks and bonds—had opposite configurations. Hold your two hands in front of you, palms up. Their components are equivalent (four fingers, a thumb, a palm, etcetera), but they point in two different directions.\n\nIt turns out that almost all the basic molecules of life can exhibit this intriguing duality, as if one is the mirror image of the other. This property is called chirality. Other molecules, in contrast, are perfectly symmetrical; those are called achiral. Most large biological molecules are chiral, like our hands. No matter how you turn and twist molecules that are chiral opposites, you cannot make them overlap completely. But if a large group of people stacked their identically chiral left hands on top of one another, in the same orientation, the hands would overlap. Groups of chiral molecules are usually referred to as “left-handed” or “right-handed,” depending on which orientation they have in common. All life on Earth—everything that has descended from our last primordial common ancestor, which lived four billion years ago—builds its classes of molecules from only one of these two possible forms. Nineteen of the 20 amino acids that make up proteins are left-handed, for instance, whereas DNA and RNA twist to the right.\n\nThese microbes would have a strong claim to be the most dangerous biological threat ever known.\n\nBut there’s no reason that mirrored versions of these building blocks can’t exist, and indeed, many are found in nature. Although almost all amino acids are left-handed, right-handed amino acids D-alanine, D-methionine and D-leucine (the D prefix comes from the Latin dextro, meaning “right”) appear in bacterial cell walls. Some others are being made in labs: right-handed versions of short amino acid chains are being synthesized as candidates for new drugs. As noted, their unusual orientation renders them resistant to enzymes that would otherwise latch on and destroy them. Astrobiologists have long thought life could have conceivably evolved in the opposite configuration—and, intriguingly, both left- and right-handed amino acids were found on the asteroid Bennu in approximately equal quantities.\n\nScientists have already made a few mirror components. In 1993 researchers then at Johns Hopkins University reported making a right-handed version of the typically left-handed protein rubredoxin. More incremental work of this type has continued in the ensuing decades. Then, in 2022, other researchers announced they had built parts of a mirror-image enzyme that made a reverse RNA molecule. RNA is the essential template for most proteins, and it also plays crucial roles in numerous other processes essential to life. This engineering feat brought us much closer to making mirror components and assembling them into a functional mirror bacterial cell.\n\nBut it would be a killer mirror. Microbes like these would have a strong claim to be the most dangerous biological threat we’ve ever known. They could survive and grow on a range of naturally occurring nutrients in the environment. Yet they would probably be resistant to the many predators—viruses and protozoans—that keep populations of bacteria in check in the natural world. Such predators, after being selected during millions of years of evolution to recognize one protein shape, would not detect the opposite configuration. For the same reason, mirror cells could evade many parts of the immune system, causing infections likely to be fatal in people, animals and plants. They could spread and evolve rapidly in the environment, acquiring mutations that would enable them to grow on other nutrients, which would make them even more dangerous. And they could be impossible to eradicate, becoming a perennial source of infections that no human, plant or animal could fight.\n\nWhen I first heard of this idea, about two years ago, I thought it must be science fiction. I figured the initially constructed mirror organism would be too fragile to live and reproduce. The closest things we have to synthetic life today are flimsy and delicate: test-tube-bound, not suitable for natural ecosystems and environmental pressures. Surely the mirror versions of artificial life-forms would be doubly so. For instance, what would they eat? Most of the molecular food sources that power life on Earth are chiral, too—wouldn’t mirror bacteria need similarly oriented nutrients when they first escaped into the wild and starve if those nutrients didn’t exist?\n\nWhen some colleagues and I started to look into it, I learned that we were dangerously wrong. There are indeed many nutrients that mirror bacteria could digest, including many achiral symmetrical ones. Experiments have shown that populations of some natural bacteria, such as E. coli, can grow on only achiral nutrients, and mirror bacteria would be able to do the same.\n\nNor would a mirror organism necessarily be as fragile as the highly modified, close-to-synthetic cells we have today—cells like the ones my colleague John Glass’s team at the J. Craig Venter Institute has constructed with a minimal number of genes or organisms like those that George Church’s group at Harvard University has “recoded” with slight alterations in their DNA. These are the product of thousands of engineering steps that make them much more delicate than bacteria that thrive in the environment. In contrast, mirror bacteria could be identical to robust natural bacteria in all ways but one, confounding our intuitions about the fitness of engineered life outside the lab.\n\nWhat would happen if mirror bacteria got even a tiny foothold in the natural environment? The result could look a lot like the work of my mentor, evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski of Michigan State University. He has conducted experiments in which a dozen cultures of naturally chiral lab-grown E. coli are given a fresh glucose meal every morning. He found that even genetically identical microbes would quickly evolve and diversify, becoming distinct communities.\n\nMy work with infectious bacteria has shown that permanent and meaningful diversification may require only hundreds of generations. Mirror bacteria could evolve in the same way. It wouldn’t be a one-and-done event: you’d create a second tree of life that would trace its own evolutionary paths through diverse ecosystems, finding niches wherever it could. An accidental release could cross an irreversible threshold.\n\nPeople would be on the wrong side of that passage. Ordinarily, the trillions of bacteria living in our gut provide an early defense against normal-chirality pathogens: some produce antibacterial molecules that directly inhibit or kill pathogens, and some help to trigger immune responses such as the production of antimicrobial peptides or antibodies. But if you ingested mirror bacteria, many of these defenses would likely fail.\n\nYour gut’s microbiome probably wouldn’t be able to spot mirror bacteria’s reversed molecules, so it won’t trigger the production of antibacterial compounds. Even if they were produced, these substances almost certainly wouldn’t be able to bind to mirror molecules, just as a left glove doesn’t fit on a right hand. Perhaps worst, the failure of these early defenses means it’s unlikely your body would trigger the downstream immune responses required to successfully fight off an infection.\n\nOur immune systems have evolved complex and layered immune responses to bacteria, recognizing the molecular signatures (called pathogen-associated molecular patterns) that are common to many of them and triggering immune responses to limit their invasion. Our bodies would be unlikely to spot invaders with reversed molecular structures. Even if they did, they wouldn’t be able to attack the microbes with their full arsenal of immune defenses, many of which also rely on chiral interactions.\n\nFor example, one critical early part of the immune response is the activity of cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, which “eat” bacterial threats and digest them by attacking chiral bacterial molecules with a chiral enzyme. Their digestive enzymes wouldn’t be able to break the chemical bonds of mirror cells, because they have evolved to grab and break those cells’ opposites. It’s likely that macrophages and other immune cells would be less effective at killing mirror bacteria.\n\nThat’s only one problem. Your immune system also has an adaptive system of specialized immune cells and antibodies that attack and destroy invading microbes. This system remembers what those intruders look like so it can mount a stronger response if the threat returns.\n\nSuch adaptive immune memories rely on chiral molecules. We can’t directly study what a mirror-bacterial infection would look like, but the diseases of people born with genetic defects in parts of the immune system provide clues. One such group of patients has a dysfunctional form of a receptor called MHC-II. Normally this receptor captures fragments of pathogens and signposts them for T cells, but the receptor doesn’t work properly in these patients. Similarly, mirror proteins could not be broken down into those fragments, so MHC-II would not be able to signpost them. Mirror infections therefore might resemble the infection of an MHC-II-deficient patient.\n\nThe comparison is not reassuring. These people often die in childhood, overwhelmed by infections caused by the common bacteria and viruses all around us. And this is a case study of failure in just one part of the immune system. Mirror bacteria would probably evade several parts at the same time.\n\nThe concern is that, freed from the pressures of immune constraints and the competition of the natural microbiome on our skin and in our gut, mirror bacteria could replicate faster than they are cleared and then, riding the bloodstream, deposit bacterial cells throughout the body. The inside of the human body has enough achiral nutrients for mirror bacteria to grow. A mirror bacterium engineered to use a natural-chirality diet would fare even better. The body would then become a petri dish, like a cadaver—unprotected by living immune cells. What this strange infection would look like precisely is unclear, but the expected result is sepsislike inflammation and death.\n\nAs the danger of mirror cells became more apparent, a team of scientists began working on what to do.\n\nAstonishingly, it gets worse. The natural world is full of bacteria—a million cells in a gram of seawater, a billion in a gram of soil. They don’t overwhelm the planet, because they have predators that rely heavily on chiral processes. Viruses called bacteriophages enter bacteria by latching onto surface proteins that they match the configuration of like a key fitting into a lock. The phages kill bacteria, limiting their threat. But if there is no match between a phage and a surface protein, the phage can’t get in. Even if one did get inside a mirror bacterium, none of its replication machinery or genetic material would work there. The bacteriophage would be stuck, alone and isolated, incapable of replicating inside the cell.\n\nAmoebas and other microbial predators, meanwhile, track and swallow bacteria and digest them whole. They’d face the same problems as macrophages in the human immune system: they would be less able to detect mirrored molecules, and even if they managed to swallow one, they’d probably struggle to digest it and use the mirror component parts as nutrients. Even at larger scales—those of plants and other animals—immunity consistently relies on chiral interactions. As a result, many animal and plant species might be unable to fend off mirror bacteria.\n\nThere could also be enormous environmental consequences. Cyanobacteria are simple organisms that derive nutrition directly from sunlight and carbon dioxide, and they often don’t require any chiral nutrients. The same would be true for mirrored versions if any were built. But because they would probably be resistant to viruses, there would be much less downward pressure on their populations. As they grew in number, they would compete with other bacteria for scarce ocean nutrients such as iron or phosphorus, significantly reducing the population of natural-chirality bacteria, which would leave species such as marine krill with much less to feed on. If krill populations collapsed, that could in turn drive many larger species such as whales to extinction.\n\nHow do we stop this? As the steps toward danger became more apparent in the past several years, a team of more than 150 scientists in different disciplines assembled from around the world and began working to figure out what to do. We gathered in Paris last June to make a plan.\n\nThe agreement among researchers in Paris was widespread: mirror organisms should never be created. Laws will be needed to ensure they aren’t, and we must draw red lines around the most dangerous technologies that could enable their synthesis. In the meantime, research funders can help by confirming they won’t support work aimed at building mirror cells—much as they have already committed to not funding research into human cloning.\n\nI started out confused and dubious about this threat, and then I became very concerned. But today I find myself invigorated about our ability to ward off catastrophe—because we’ve spotted this threat so early.\n\nYes, scientists have made small chiral molecules. But making a complete, functional mirror cell would take extraordinary effort: synthesizing longer and longer biomolecules, making a bacterial chassis from scratch, and creating all the component parts of cellular life, such as ribosomes. Then everything would have to be assembled into a living, working cell. Despite decades of work since the early 1990s, nobody has built an entire standard cell from scratch. We estimate it would require the kind of effort and resources of scientific megaprojects such as the Human Genome Project—which has cost billions of dollars—to make a completely new entity such as a mirror microbe. Building mirror bacteria is a bit like building a skyscraper twice the height of today’s tallest structures: we know technically what needs to be done, but it would be an extremely complex feat of engineering. This fact gives us a golden opportunity to tackle the risk long before it materializes.\n\nActing now is our leverage. There aren’t many examples of scientists identifying issues with the development of technology before issues emerge. Chlorofluorocarbons were retired from use only after they’d torn a hole in the ozone layer. Thalidomide stopped being prescribed for pregnant women only after thousands of infants were born with birth defects. But we have identified this problem.\n\nIn addition to a moratorium on mirror-cell work, we can develop strong modes of governance with international entities that identify and control the chemical constituents of mirror molecules and cells. These agencies could spot whether a lab or a country was accumulating unusual amounts of these compounds, just as they sound the alarm today if a country is stockpiling the components of chemical or nuclear weapons.\n\nYet we don’t want to limit science in this area completely. Some research in synthetic biology could help with the design and manufacture of novel drugs that could benefit the world. For instance, it may be a good idea to allow scientists to work with certain small mirror molecules but ban the stockpiling of mirror compounds that exceed a certain length. The longer ones can be more easily used to assemble an entire mirror cell.\n\nWe won’t figure out where to draw the line or how to solve all these challenges in one go. We can’t make any final decisions on an issue of this importance at any single conference. Much more work is needed to understand the best governance methods that will ensure that the risks can be avoided. But I’m tremendously encouraged by how quickly a large group of scientists and biosecurity experts—more than 300 people attended the Paris meeting either in person or virtually—recognized there was a huge problem and agreed on the urgency of finding a solution.\n\nThe risks of this technology are great, but it’s easy to see the people who are working hard to eliminate them. All we have to do is look in the mirror.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

Amazon Leo, with 180 satellites in space so far, has a similar customer strategy.\n\nA handful of Chinese companies are swiftly deploying similar satellite networks to get up to pace with Starlink, which has proved key for remote communications and geopolitical conflicts. China is developing new reusable rockets that can loft thousands of these satellites over the next several years for lower costs, a playbook first written by Musk’s SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nBlue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, which has launched twice but has been slow to achieve a rapid flight rate, will likely be a vital part of TeraWave’s deployment.\n\nUnlike Starlink, the planned network appears off-limits to individual consumers, according to Blue Origin’s statement.\n\nBlue Origin’s statement said: “TeraWave enterprise-grade user and gateway terminals can be rapidly deployed worldwide and interface with existing high-capacity infrastructure, providing additional route diversity and strengthening overall network resilience,” leaving unclear what types of existing infrastructure the network can work with.",

    "fullText": "Salt, a restaurant located at 7408 Pittsford-Palmyra Road in Perinton, was heavily damaged after a car crashed into the building late Jan. 20.\n\nNews of the crash was first shared on the restaurant’s Instagram page.\n\n“To say that we are devastated and heartbroken would be an understatement,” the post read in part. “The only saving grace right now is that none of our staff or patrons were injured.”\n\nAccording to the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office, the vehicle was traveling east on Pittsford-Palmyra Road when it crossed into the westbound lane, left the roadway and struck the restaurant, along with support cables connected to a nearby utility pole.\n\nBoth the building and the vehicle sustained extensive damage, according to authorities.\n\nA passing motorist called 911 to report the crash. The caller did not witness the incident itself, deputies said, and investigators later determined the driver had left the scene.\n\nDeputies searched for the driver with assistance from a drone and the Rochester Police Department K9 unit, but the individual has not been located or identified.\n\nThe investigation remains ongoing. Authorities said there is no threat to the public.\n\nSalt opened in April 2024 in the space previously occupied by TJ Noonan’s.\n\nReporter Marcia Greenwood covers general assignments and has an interest in retail news.

    "description": "Luke Abrahams died on Jan. 23, 2023, just days after medics said he didn't need to be taken to the hospital",
    "fullText": "An amateur soccer player from England died from sepsis and a flesh-eating disease in January 2023\n\n20-year-old Luke Abrahams had his symptoms dismissed as tonsillitis and sciatica by several medical professionals in the days leading up to his death\n\nAhead of a court investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death, Abrahams' parents remembered him as a kind man who \"got on with everyone\"\n\nAn amateur soccer player was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics just days before his death from a bacterial infection and a flesh-eating disease.\n\nAn investigation into his death was opened at Northampton Coroner's Court in England on Tuesday, Jan. 20, following the death of 20-year-old Luke Abrahams on Jan. 23, 2023, per a post on the North Northamptonshire Council website.\n\nThe BBC reported that the inquest was opened after Abrahams, from Northampton, which is about 70 miles north of London, died of sepsis and necrotising fasciitis.\n\nPer the Cleveland Clinic, \"Necrotizing fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating disease, is a bacterial infection that affects the tissue under your skin called fascia.\"\n\nThe site adds that the infection can be \"treated with antibiotics and surgery to remove damaged tissue.\"\n\nIn the week before his death, Abrahams was in contact with numerous doctors, as well as the emergency room and paramedics, per ITV. He also called 111 [the U.K.'s non-emergency medical number].\n\nAfter Abrahams was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics, his condition deteriorated and leg pain left him unable to move, according to the BBC. Three days before his death, Abrahams had a video consultation with an out-of-hours doctor on Jan. 20, 2023, with the medic diagnosing sciatica. Per Mayo Clinic, sciatica refers to pain that travels along the path of the sciatic nerve from the buttocks and down each leg.\n\nAlthough Abrahams had a high temperature and high blood sugar levels, an ambulance crew said he didn't need to go to the hospital when his family called them 12 hours after his sciatica diagnosis. He was admitted to the hospital two days later, but died the following day, the BBC added.\n\nBefore his death, attempts had been made to save Abrahams by amputating his leg, ITV reported.\n\nSpeaking before the court investigation into his death, Abrahams' father, Richard, said, \"It’s so frustrating — they know they could have treated him better than they did,\" per ITV.\n\n\"We want justice and accountability. Someone has to be held responsible,\" he added.\n\nAbrahams' mother, Julie, said, \"We would just like to know where they went wrong, how they let Luke down, and for them to be honest and to show accountability, so we can properly grieve and let Luke rest in peace properly,\" ITV reported.\n\nSusan Jevons, head of patient safety and coroner services for East Midlands Ambulance Service, admitted during the court investigation that Abrahams should've been taken to the hospital, per the BBC.\n\nJevons said, \"If you look at Luke's presentation, it was not normal. Blood sugar and pain score warranted a transfer to [the] hospital,\" she said, adding, \"He was an unwell man.\"\n\n\"He'd been treated and it wasn't working. Leaving him at home wasn't going to get the treatment he required,\" she concluded.\n\nIt was confirmed during the court investigation that a paramedic involved had since left the ambulance service after being supervised for some time after the incident, the BBC stated.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn a November 2024 article, the BBC noted that an investigation into Abrahams' death had been opened, but the coroner had adjourned the court hearing until May 2025 after stating he had died of \"natural causes.\"\n\nThe previous report stated that a serious incident investigation at the East Midlands Ambulance Service Trust had found that the crew failed to follow guidelines and policies before Abrahams' death, the BBC reported, adding that his symptoms should have indicated a life-threatening condition and resulted in a transfer to the hospital.\n\nThe investigation also said that the fact that Abrahams wasn't taken to the hospital meant there was a \"missed opportunity\" for him to get medical help, which could have prevented \"deterioration,\" per the outlet.\n\n\"He just got on with everyone, he had a second for everyone,\" Abrahams' parents told the BBC of their son before Tuesday's court investigation. \"He used to go out at 11 at night because his friend needed a chat. He would make time for everyone, just bringing everyone together. That was Luke,\" they added.\n\nNHS Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board didn't immediately respond when contacted by PEOPLE for comment and additional information.\n\nAn East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesperson told PEOPLE in an email, \"With the [investigation] underway, and we believe currently planned to continue until Thursday, we will be waiting until the Coroner has concluded before sharing a statement.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Northampton Coroner's Office confirmed to PEOPLE that the [investigation] may conclude on Thursday, Jan. 22, or Friday, Jan. 23.",

    "title": "Kyle Rittenhouse hit with call for arrest after posing with gun in Minneapolis post",
    "description": "Rittenhouse returned to social media December and it has been a rough go for him there since.",
    "fullText": "When Kyle Rittenhouse returned to social media back in December, he promised there were big things to come.\n\nA month later, those big things don’t seem to have materialized for him, yet. Instead, Rittenhouse who is famous for shooting three people, killing two, during a racial injustice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 2020 before claiming self-defense and being acquitted of all charges, appears to be using his time on social media mostly posting slurs and teasing the idea of going to Minnesota as ICE is met with protestesters there.\n\nHis latest version of that came Tuesday as he shared a photo posing with a High Ground Defense M134HG Minigun on X.\n\n“Thinking of taking this to Minneapolis,” Rittenhouse wrote. “Thoughts?\n\nFolks were quick to respond, and it didn’t go well for him.\n\n“@FBI lock him up,” one person replied.\n\n“We get it your schtick is ‘I murdered a guy and got away with it, so let me joke about murdering more Americans,’” Skyler Shuler replied on X.\n\n“You look dumber every year!” another wrote. “Congrats dude.”\n\n“You take way too much joy in killing human beings — that’s not a compliment,” Colorado Mick wrote on X.\n\n“You should repent and save your soul while you still can,” Jesse Brenneman suggested.\n\n“Take it and keep it to yourself,” Michael Woods commented. “Bad karma to be agitating like this.”\n\n“Dude, no,” Braden Pace replied. “You got a W with that acquittal. As you should have. But don’t do this. You’re making responsible gun owners look bad.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Rittenhouse has joked about the scene in Minnesota.\n\n“FAFO — don’t try and hit a ICE agent with your vehicle and you won’t end up in the forever box,” he wrote on X after ICE office Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis. “It’s pretty simple.”\n\nHe followed that up with another post that read, “After thinking about it, should I travel across the state line to Minnesota?”\n\nThat, of course, kicked up a social media stir then, too.\n\n“How do you even look yourself in the mirror in the morning?” one person replied.\n\n“Someone was murdered you (expletive) (expletive),” another wrote. “There is nothing to laugh about you (expletive) truly are evil and I can’t wait for karma to catch up.”\n\nRittenhouse announced in December that he was returning to social media saying that the assassination of Charlie Kirk convinced him he “couldn’t sit on the sidelines anymore.”\n\n“So I’m back,” he wrote. “Not quietly. Not halfway. I’m coming back in a big way.”\n\nBut just a week into his return he found himself getting ripped online by a Republican Sheriff from Florida.\n\nThat came after he filmed a video of himself standing in front of the Walton County Jail while claiming that Michael Rediker “used Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law to lawfully defend himself when his life was put in jeopardy.”\n\n“Michael did nothing wrong, and he deserves all our support,” Rittenhouse said in the video which he pinned to his X page.\n\n“We are expecting an outright not guilty under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law,” he added.\n\nWalton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson did not take kindly to Rittenhouse’s claims. He reshared the video via the Walton County Sheriff Office’s official X account, and issued a video of his own scathing response.\n\n“I don’t normally do this,” Adkinson said. “I don’t normally take the time to speak to public comments on cases, certainly not open cases. But in this particular situation, a murder that occurred yesterday in Walton County, I feel compelled to respond to what I can only call wildly irresponsible. I would say motivated by many factors, none of them in the interest of justice in which individuals, particularly Kyle Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, are attempting to frame the murder here in Walton County on Thursday of Mr. Keen as a Stand Your Ground case or wrapping it in the Constitution or that it is Second Amendment case.”\n\n“After 30-something years of doing this, I very rarely get personally offended, but I’m actually just kind of disgusted with them,” the sheriff continued. “There was a man who lost his life yesterday. A father, a husband with two small children, who was murdered, unarmed on his own property, unprovoked by an individual who drove a tractor over a half a mile onto the victim’s property. Once there, batters his wife in front of eyewitnesses. When the husband, whom there had been no confrontation with, gets out to come over and help pick his wife up off the ground the suspect shoots him in the face. He was unarmed. There was no fight between them. There was no attack, and as he is laying dying on the ground, this suspect, Michael Rediker, stood over him and made some comments for which he is going to answer to in court. At the same time, he committed aggravated assault on multiple other people because he murdered this man in front of witnesses that watched this as this man was murdered. Again, unarmed, on his own property, after his wife had been battered, and no confrontation.\n\n“Now, somehow out of that, Mr. Rittenhouse and his attorney, Anthony Sabatini, have determined that this is the great Stand Your Ground case,” Adkinson continued. “Well, I’ll tell you this. I’ll bet my badge on this. Not only is that not a stand your ground, Mr. Rediker will face either the ultimate penalty in the state of Florida or God willing the rest of his natural life in prison. Because, come Christmas morning in two weeks, there are two little boys elementary school age, two children, that are not going to have their father, and there’s a wife whose not going to have her husband all so these two idiots can get more likes on their Facebook and call it a Constitutional issue.”\n\n“I think both of you are jokes, and I don’t think you should make a damn cent off the suffering of someone else,” he said. “So, if you don’t like that, well you can file that under I don’t really give a damn. I know people aren’t’ going to like this, and I don’t care about that either. I’m so disgusted and sad for the Keen family and their loss and the fact that these two yo-yos are going to try to make money and news on it. And I probably shouldn’t give them this, but I think the public deserves to know this doesn’t have a damn thing to do with the Second Amendment or Stand Your Ground. So, I hope that many of you will reach out and tell these two jack-wagons what you think about what they are doing to this family suffering.\n\n“Don’t let them make on penny off a like.”",

    "fullText": "For decades, McDonald's customers have complained that the fast-food giant reserves its most fun and innovative menu items for international markets, leaving its home country with the same predictable seasonal releases.\n\nAs frustrating as that may seem, there is a deliberate strategy behind this madness.\n\nMcDonald's tailors its menu in each country based on cultural preferences, ingredient availability, and what can be executed efficiently at scale. The same applies to limited-time and seasonal items.\n\nWhile menus vary around the world, a small set of core products remains consistent, including the World Famous Fries, the classic Hamburger and Cheeseburger, the Big Mac, McNuggets, and the Vanilla Cone.\n\nThis localization strategy reduces operational risk and improves return on investment, which is why each country maintains its own lineup with exclusive offerings.\n\nHistorically, McDonald's has taken a cautious approach to bringing international items to the U.S., testing them selectively and tailoring availability based on regional preferences and past performance. In most cases, localized items had stayed local.\n\nMcDonald's has revealed an entire lineup of international menu items coming to U.S. restaurants nationwide in 2026, marking one of the company's most ambitious cross-market rollouts in years.\n\nHere is the full list, with all items set to launch within the next few days.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) first introduced its Hot Honey Sauce in Australia in March 2025, aiming to capitalize on what it described as \"the hottest trend everyone is talking about,\" according to a company press release. The sauce was later rolled out in New Zealand and Canada, each for a limited-time run.\n\nNow, less than a year later, it is headed to the U.S.\n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce blends honey with red bell peppers and cayenne peppers, finished with a hint of tangy vinegar. Alongside it, McDonald's is debuting three new menu items featuring the trendy sauce.\n\nHot Honey Bacon McCrispy: A crispy chicken filet topped with thick-cut applewood smoked bacon, crispy jalapeños, shredded lettuce, creamy mayo, and Hot Honey Sauce, served on a toasted potato roll \n\nHot Honey Snack Wrap: A McCrispy Strip topped with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, and Hot Honey Sauce, all wrapped in a tortilla \n\nHot Honey Sausage Egg Biscuit: A pork sausage patty and a folded egg, topped with Hot Honey Sauce, on a biscuit brushed with real butter \n\nThe Hot Honey Sauce and all three new menu items will be available for a limited time beginning January 27 at participating U.S. locations and can be added to any menu item, according to the Snackolator Instagram page.\n\nAlthough the new products have not officially launched, they already appear on the McDonald's website.\n\nThe Big Arch burger debuted in Portugal in July 2024 and quickly gained traction, prompting McDonald's to expand it into Canada, Germany, Australia, the UK, Ireland, and France.\n\nDuring an earnings call in mid-2024, McDonald's acknowledged the burger's strong performance and universal appeal, which led it to accelerate its expansion.\n\n\"The pilot of our larger burger offering, Big Arch, now in three international markets, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, shows that we're listening to consumer tastes and delivering,\" said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings call.\n\n\"We'll work with franchisees and partners to deploy the Big Arch faster into more international markets in 2025.\"\n\nFollowing its positive reception abroad, McDonald's tested the Big Arch in the U.S. at its headquarters restaurant in Chicago for a limited time.\n\nThis massive burger features two quarter-pounder patties, three slices of white cheese, crispy onions, slivered onions, pickles, lettuce, and Big Arch Sauce, all sandwiched between a sliced sesame and poppy seed bun.\n\nWhile the Double Quarter Pounder comes close, it's not the same. McDonald's is positioning the Big Arch as a more premium, value-driven option.\n\nIn Canada, a Big Arch meal costs about $12.59, or roughly $9 in the U.S. Despite the higher price, the company says the burger delivers greater value, an increasingly important selling point as consumers grow more cautious of their spending.\n\nMcDonald's credits the Big Arch as a key traffic driver in several markets, helping boost global comparable sales by nearly 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAfter extensive testing, the Big Arch will make its nationwide U.S. debut in early March 2026, according to The Street.\n\nLike much of the fast-food industry, McDonald's has faced mounting pressure in recent years, particularly in the U.S. Slower foot traffic, rising food costs, and weaker spending have weighed on results.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nMcDonald's making major drive-thru change\n\nMcDonald’s expected to bring back beloved childhood favorite in 2026\n\nFive Guys debuts alcohol and all-day breakfast\n\nDuring the quarter ending June 2025, foodservice traffic declined 1%, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana. However, value menu traffic rose 1%, marking the first positive growth in three years.\n\nCircana also found that value-focused diners are 33% more likely than non-value buyers to purchase value menu items when visiting other restaurant chains, underscoring how aggressively consumers are hunting for savings and deals.\n\nIn response to consumers' cautious spending, McDonald's has rolled out several value-focused initiatives, including the Extra Value Meals, McValue menu, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\nIn March 2025, the company launched the Restaurant Experience Team, combining operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency. It also created three new global Category Management teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverages/desserts to further specialize innovation within its food products.\n\n“Value is rarely defined only by price,” said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. “Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.”\n\nThose efforts are beginning to pay off. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, U.S. comparable sales increased 2.4%.\n\nDespite improvement, McDonald's remains cautious.\n\n\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" said McDonald's CEO Christopher J. Kempczinski in an earnings call.\n\n\"It’s a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.\"",

    "fullText": "Viking Therapeutics' price target implies a juicy upside from its current levels.\n\nThe stock's most important catalysts will likely have to wait until next year.\n\nThe drugmaker is somewhat risky, but it could deliver massive returns.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Viking Therapeutics ›\n\nLast year was a challenging one for Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX), a mid-cap biotech. The company made little clinical progress and, in fact, one of the major data readouts it released was not well received by the market, leading to a sell-off. Over the trailing 12-month period, Viking Therapeutics' shares have lagged the S&P 500. But could Viking perform much better this year?\n\nPlenty of analysts on Wall Street think so. The company boasts an average price target of $93.39 (according to Yahoo! Finance), implying an upside of 175% from its current levels. Can Viking Therapeutics soar by that much in 2026?\n\nViking Therapeutics' leading candidate is VK2735, an investigational GLP-1 medicine it is developing for weight management. A subcutaneous version of this therapy is currently in a 78-week phase 3 study. Viking's phase 3 results for VK2735 will be the most significant event for the company in a long time, potentially leading to its share price soaring overnight, provided the results are strong.\n\nHowever, considering the trial completed enrollment in late 2025, we are unlikely to see full results anytime soon. The biotech will likely reveal those in 2027. Could we see an interim analysis in 2026? Maybe, but it's not clear. Viking Therapeutics is also running a phase 1 maintenance study for VK2735, testing daily oral, weekly oral, and monthly injection regimens in a small number of patients who have already achieved weight loss with VK2735.\n\nWhy is this important? Losing weight and keeping it off are two different things. Many GLP-1 patients regain much of what they lose, and drugmakers are increasingly developing strategies to help with that. If Viking can show that continuing VK2735, in a different formulation (oral) or at different intervals (monthly versus weekly), can help keep the weight off, that would be an interesting differentiator for the medicine.\n\nIt would take a lot for Viking Therapeutics' shares to jump by 175% this year. The maintenance study is unlikely to get it there, since phase 1 studies tend to prioritize safety and tolerability (things that won't significantly jolt the stock price even if they are strong) over efficacy. So, even if this maintenance study goes well, it won't help Viking's shares more than double this year.",

    "title": "The Indian couple who won a $200,000 settlement over 'food racism' at US university",
    "description": "The dispute began after the couple defended their right to heat palak paneer in a campus microwave.",
    "fullText": "A dispute that began over heating a dish in a microwave has ended with two Indian students winning a $200,000 settlement from a US university.\n\nAditya Prakash and his fiancee, Urmi Bhattacheryya, told the BBC they filed a civil rights lawsuit against the University of Colorado, Boulder, after they faced a series of \"microaggressions and retaliatory actions\" following the microwave incident.\n\nThe harassment began, the lawsuit alleged, after a university staff member objected to Prakash heating up his lunch of palak paneer - one of northern India's most popular dishes, made of pureed spinach and paneer (considered an Indian equivalent of cottage cheese) - in a microwave on campus, because of the way it smelled.\n\nIn response to the BBC's questions, the university said it could not comment on the \"specific circumstances\" surrounding the students' claims of discrimination and harassment due to privacy laws, but added it was \"committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all students, faculty and staff regardless of national origin, religion, culture and other classes protected under US laws and by university policies\".\n\n\"When these allegations arose in 2023, we took them seriously and adhered to established, robust processes to address them, as we do with all claims of discrimination and harassment. We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.\n\nPrakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\"\n\nThe lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.\n\nSome have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.\n\nAnd it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.\n\nPrakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.\n\nPrakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months.\n\nIn May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a \"pattern of escalating retaliation\" against them.\n\nIn September, the university settled the lawsuit. Such settlements are usually arrived at to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles for both parties.\n\nAccording to the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to give the students their degrees but denied all liabilities and banned them from studying or working there in future.\n\n'Indian food is terrible' tweet sparks hot debate\n\nIn its statement shared with the BBC, the university added: \"CU Boulder's Anthropology Department has worked to rebuild trust among students, faculty and staff. Among other efforts, department leaders met with graduate students, faculty and staff to listen and discuss changes that best support the department's efforts to foster an inclusive and supportive environment for all.\"\n\n\"Individuals who are determined to be responsible for violating university policies preventing discrimination and harassment are held accountable,\" it added.\n\nPrakash says that this isn't his first brush with discrimination over food.\n\nWhen he was growing up in Italy, his school teachers would often ask him to sit at a separate table during lunch breaks because his classmates found the smell of his food \"off-putting\", he says.\n\n\"Acts like isolating me from my European classmates or stopping me from using a shared microwave because of how my food smells are how white people control your Indianness and shrink the spaces you can exist in,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that there is a long history of food being used to put down Indian and other ethnic groups.\n\n\"The word 'curry' has been conflated with the 'smell' of marginalised communities who toil in kitchens and peoples' homes and has been turned into a pejorative term for 'Indian',\" he says.\n\nBhattacheryya says that even someone like former Vice-President Kamala Harris isn't immune to being insulted over food.\n\nShe points to a 2024 social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer saying that if Harris became president, the White House \"will smell like curry\". Loomer has denied being racist.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context.\n\nDuring the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone.\n\nBhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the \"systemic racism\" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024.\n\nBelow the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, \"go back to India\", \"decolonisation was a mistake\" and \"it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know\".\n\nPrakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being \"othered\" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way.\n\nThey claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this.\n\nThey have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US.\n\n\"No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time. The precarity is acute and our experience at the university is a good example of this,\" Prakash says.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "fullText": "Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK will not yet be signing up to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.\n\nCooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but \"won't be one of the signatories today\" at a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nThe board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.\n\nCooper described the board as a \"legal treaty that raises much broader issues\" than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and critics say the board appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations.\n\nSome of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.\n\nThe UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.\n\nBut launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.\n\nTrump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".\n\n\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"\n\nTrump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\".\n\n\"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nPresident Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.\n\nBut the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.\n\nPutin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nLive: World leaders sign Trump's Board of Peace papers\n\nTrump to meet Zelensky as US envoy says ending war with Russia down to one issue\n\nPutin invited to join US-led Gaza 'Board of Peace', Trump says\n\nWho is on Trump's 'Board of Peace' overseeing Gaza's reconstruction?\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\n\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.\n\nBut she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.\n\n\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"\n\nShe said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".\n\n\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.\n\nBut Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.\n\nCooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.\n\nBut when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.\n\nAs talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are due to meet in Davos on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump repeated his often-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.\n\nTrump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.\n\nBut the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.\n\nThe text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".\n\nThe leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.\n\nThe charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.\n\nLast Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nMore have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nThe Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.",

It's also natural to wonder if your employer is breaking the law.\n\nSurprising as it may sound, your employer is not typically under any legal obligation to let you keep working once you’ve announced your plans to retire.\n\nAn AARP analysis of data examined by the Urban Institute and ProPublica from a Health and Retirement Study (HRS) report found that 13% of older workers entered retirement unexpectedly, which the researchers say suggests workers were likely forced out of their jobs (1).\n\nThat's because most states have at-will employment laws. An at-will employee can be fired at any time for any reason and without warning — no “just cause” required.\n\nBut you may have some legal recourse if you have evidence that your employer fired you to stop your pension from “vesting” or as a direct result of age-base d discrimination. These would violate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and you may have a case on your hands.\n\nYou have a few options if you're terminated before your official retirement date.\n\nYour company may offer severance pay as a way to get you to waive your right to file certain lawsuits against your former employer. Aim to negotiate the fairest possible severance package, including asking your employer to continue subsidizing your health coverage.

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI/MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's largest refining complex, is set to receive sanctions-compliant Russian ​oil in February and March after a one-month pause, four sources familiar ‌with the matter said.\n\nReliance last received Russian crude in December after securing a one-month U.S. concession that ‌allowed it to wind down dealings with the sanctioned Russian oil producer Rosneft beyond a November 21 deadline.\n\nLike other Indian refiners, Reliance will buy Russian oil from non-sanctioned sellers, the sources said, without elaborating on the number of February and March cargoes that the ⁠refiner has booked.\n\nIt is not ‌clear if the private refinery will continue to buy Russian oil beyond March.\n\nReliance did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.\n\nREFINERS ‍BOOST MIDDLE EAST CRUDE IMPORTS\n\nDespite Reliance's return, India's overall Russian oil imports are expected to stay subdued through February and March, the sources added.\n\nReliance had been importing Russian crude under a ​long‑term agreement with Rosneft for 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) for its 1.4 million ‌bpd Jamnagar refinery complex in Gujarat.\n\nThe European Union has said from January 21 it will not take fuel produced at refineries that received or processed Russian oil 60 days prior to the bill-of-lading date.\n\nReliance has said it will process the cargoes that arrived after November 20 at its India-focused 660,000 barrels per day plant, allowing it to ⁠continue selling fuels to the EU from its ​704,000 bpd export-oriented refinery.\n\nRefiners in India, which became ​the top buyer of discounted Russian seaborne crude following the 2022 outbreak of war in Ukraine, are recalibrating their crude import strategies, raising ‍Middle Eastern purchases as ⁠they shift away from Russia.\n\n\"We have faced instances where sanctions were imposed suddenly and we had to cut back,\" Srinivas T, chief operating officer, refinery ⁠and marketing, at Reliance, said last week.\n\nReliance had ramped up purchases from national oil companies elsewhere ahead ‌of time to avoid spot market disruptions, he said.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) traded higher on Thursday as global risk sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump walked back his plan to impose new tariffs on European allies amid his push to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation (BTC-USD) rose about 1% over the past 24 hours to hover near $90,000 (£66,902), moving in tandem with equities in Asia and Europe. The broader cryptocurrency market cap climbed 2.7% to $3.18tn over the same period, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signalled a diplomatic shift on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying he would not pursue military action to acquire Greenland and had reached “the framework of a future deal” on the Danish territory with NATO allies.\n\nThe remarks injected fresh volatility into crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to an intraday low near $87,300 before rebounding back toward $90,000 as traders reassessed US trade policy risks and broader macro conditions. More than $625m in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated over 24 hours, split roughly evenly between longs and shorts across about 150,000 traders, according to Coinglass market data.\n\nAnalysts said the episode underscored how digital assets are reacting more directly to geopolitical and macro headlines.\n\n“Today’s sharp price swings highlight how closely crypto markets are tracking geopolitical and policy developments,” said Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, noting that Trump’s signals on Greenland negotiations and a pause on potential EU tariffs “briefly improved global risk sentiment, prompting a rapid rebound in bitcoin alongside US equities”.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance UK, Lin added that while the move was headline-driven, “they reflect a deeper shift in market structure”, describing bitcoin (BTC-USD) as “increasingly behaving like a macro asset, reacting to changes in policy expectations and broader risk appetite”.\n\nOver the longer term, she said, institutional participation is supporting bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) evolution as “a maturing and globally relevant asset class, even amid elevated volatility”.\n\nGlobal equities rallied as Trump withdrew his threat to impose additional 10% tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK, after receiving what he called the “framework of a future deal” in NATO discussions regarding Greenland.\n\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei gained nearly 2%, while South Korea’s Kospi broke above the 5,000 level for the first time. European markets opened higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.7% at the open.",

    "fullText": "Online conservative figures are throwing a fit over newly inaugurated Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger implementing her policies.\n\nThe online right has been lamenting Spanberger’s first week as governor, claiming she was just acting as a moderate while running for office and has now taken a far-left turn.\n\nIn her first few days as governor, Spanberger signed several executive orders, one of which ended state and local cooperation with federal immigration agents, a policy proposal that she said she would enact if elected.\n\nConservatives are expressing outrage over Spanberger’s first moves, equating her to a villain, a witch, and one of the “most dangerous people in our society.”\n\nSpanberger’s overall agenda as governor, outlined on her campaign website, also aligns with her three terms as a House Democrat.\n\nThe Virginia-based Lepanto Institute, a Catholic organization, compared Spanberger to the White Witch in the Chronicles of Narnia in a post on X.\n\n“White liberal women are the most dangerous people in our society,” MAGA activist Laura Loomer posted to her 1.8 million followers on X.\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, called Spanberger “a Bond villain.”\n\nRepublican Arizona Congressman Abe Hamadeh posted on X that “What’s happening in Virginia should be a lesson to all Congressional Republicans. If Democrats regain power, they will unleash the most radical and transformative legislative agenda in our nation’s history.”\n\n“We won’t even recognize our country, and we may never get it back,” Hamadeh, who is known for introducing a bill that would mandate states only provide English-language voting ballots, claimed.\n\nSpeaking on Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News, Josh Holmes, co-host of the Ruthless podcast, said of Spanberger, “She’s there for a cup of coffee, and all of a sudden, we have a Communist manifesto in front of us. This is going fast and furious, but it is how Democrats govern, regardless of what they say.”\n\nConservative nepo-baby Meghan McCain came under fire for posting a photo of Spanberger during the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection attempt, during which she was wearing an emergency escape hood.\n\n“Virginia is f---ed,” the post, which she deleted, said.\n\n“Screw any and all of you who lied to low information voters and sold Abigail Spanberger as some kind of moderate,” McCain said in a follow-up post. “She’s been in office like 6 hours and is already trying to turn Virginia into Minneapolis.”\n\nOther MAGA figures went further with their criticism of Spanberger, firing off theories about the Democrat governor and calling for certain Virginia counties to secede.\n\nMichelle Maxwell, a self-described “Proud Virginia Constitutional Conservative,” claimed that the Democratic Party is “grooming” Spanberger to run for president and that she would be the “new Hillary.”\n\n“Being governor is just a stepping stone. So while everyone is distracted with Gavin [Newsom] she is the plan,” she posted to her more than 330,000 followers, adding “Spanberger is the country’s problem now&we better not take her lightly.”\n\nMaxwell also claimed that New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill, who is seen as comparable to Spanberger in terms of policies and demeanor, was also being groomed by the Democratic Party.\n\n“The fact that its 3 counties outside of DC that decide for the entire state should be grounds for the rest of the state to secede. We have no representation,” a producer for the far-right TimCast posted, adding, “Many aren’t even born in America. They’re trying to enshrine foreign control with that degradation of voting integrity.”\n\nThat claim was quickly slapped down as another user pointed out that even if Northern Virginia counties, where a significant portion of Virginia’s population lives, had not voted in the 2025 election, Spanberger still would have won the race.\n\nSpanberger beat her opponent, former Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, by over 15 percentage points, or more than 520,000 votes, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control in the commonwealth’s 2025 gubernatorial election.\n\nDespite their current outrage over Spanberger, Virginia Republicans heavily doubted Earle Sears’ candidacy, as she frequently unraveled during interviews, and Trump snubbed her in the high-profile race, withholding his endorsement.",

    "fullText": "A major, widespread winter storm will lash much of the South, Midwest and Northeast on Friday, Jan. 23 through Monday, Jan. 26 with heavy snow likely for tens of millions of people from New Mexico to New England, according to Weather.com.\n\n\"It’s not hyperbole to call this storm a monster,\" said Washington Post meteorologist Ben Noll on X on Jan. 21. \"At its peak on Sunday (Jan. 25), 55 percent of all people in the United States are forecast to simultaneously experience snow, sleet or freezing rain. That’s more than half the population, at the same time,\" he said.\n\nWidespread travel disruptions are likely across the country this weekend, according to AccuWeather. \"Icy and snow-covered roads could force highway closures lasting for hours,\" said Jonathan Porter, AccuWeather chief meteorologist, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Key east-to-west interstates that are critical for travel, commerce, and deliveries, including Interstates 20, 30, and 40, could experience closures around the same time, compounding challenges for travelers and supply chains.\"\n\nAs for snowfall totals, heavy snow of 6-12 inches is likely in the heart of the Plains, with over 2 feet possible in parts of the Appalachians, AccuWeather said in an online forecast.\n\nHow much snow falls in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will depend on the storm's exact track, but a significant and plowable amount − likely up to or over a foot − is possible.\n\nThe heaviest snow, potentially up to a foot, is expected across central Oklahoma on Friday, Jan. 23 and Saturday, Jan. 24, according to AccuWeather. Lesser amounts, likely 3-6 inches, will fall in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nIn Arkansas, there is a 30-50% chance of exceeding 6 inches of snow over central and northern parts of the state, the weather service said. In Tennessee, the highest probabilities for at least 6 inches of snow favor areas north of Interstate 40, the weather service said.\n\nSnow, sleet and ice could sink even a bit farther south in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, while it picks up in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia and parts of the Carolinas, said Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman in an online forecast.\n\nWintry precipitation will end in Texas, Oklahoma and the lower Mississippi Valley by midday Sunday, Jan. 25, but will persist from the Ohio Valley to the piedmont of Virginia and the Carolinas into the Northeast, according to Weather.com. Some areas of heavy snow are also possible in parts of the Ohio Valley.\n\nThe winter storm \"has the potential to bring widespread heavy snow to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast this weekend,\" according to Weather.com.\n\nMaps posted by Weather.com showed totals of as much as 2-3 feet of snow in southern Virginia, with widespread 1-2 feet across a wide swath of the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\"Latest model trends show the higher snow totals shifting north into Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. The heaviest snow looks to fall Saturday night, Jan. 24 into Sunday, Jan. 25, making travel difficult to impossible. Snow may even linger across New England on Monday Jan. 26, depending on where the storm is positioned,\" Weather.com said.\n\nUpdate 01/21/2026 AM forecast for Winter Storm Fern. This is the forecast at this point and it shifted north some. \n\nPlease understand this forecast will likely change again and for who gets what and how much but understand this will be a huge winter storm and if you live in… pic.twitter.com/kf0pf4jScK\n\n— Charles Peek (@CharlesPeekWX) January 21, 2026\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, \"confidence is high that a significant storm will occur, but not on specific details for the storm track, timing and precipitation amounts.

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nThe Suns entered Wednesday’s matchup coming off a 113-108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors on Monday. With rookies Rasheer Fleming and Khaman Maluach, along with two-way player Jamaree Bouyea, assigned back to the team, the Valley hoped the trio would provide the spark needed to get back on track.\n\nFleming and Maluach had been traveling with the Phoenix Suns throughout the six-game road trip, earning minutes whenever the team needed them.

Maluach added eight points and six rebounds but dealt with foul trouble, picking up three fouls before halftime. Bouyea struggled early but found a rhythm late in the half, finishing with nine points, two rebounds, and two assists at the break.\n\nDespite limited minutes, Bouyea’s strong finish to the first half suggested he was simply shaking off rust.\n\nThe Suns opened the second half on an 18-0 run, partly by Bouyea’s eight points. He finished the night with 27 points, while Fleming finished with 19 points and Maluach finished with 23.\n\nNov 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Rasheer Fleming (20) against the Houston Rockets at Mortgage Matchup Center.

Head coach Paul Jesperson acknowledged their earlier game struggles, especially Bouyea, as Wednesday was his first official night in a Valley Suns uniform.\n\n“We knew there was probably going to be a little fatigue there and a little bit of those guys just having to feel the game out a little bit as it progressed,” he said post-game. “I think [Bouyea] did exactly that. Kind of found his spots, got comfort level [and] got a little energy to him.”\n\nThe Suns finish out the week with a matchup against the Texas Legends on the road on Friday, Jan. 23, at 6:30 p.m.\n\nWM Phoenix Open brings golf to streetwear with Samba shoe collab",

    "fullText": "Defending champion Madison Keys continues her Melbourne run, but not without a reminder of how quickly momentum can shift at a Grand Slam. The American booked her place in the third round of the AO with a 6-1, 7-5 win over compatriot Ashlyn Krueger, later opening up about the pressure and privilege that comes with returning as the titleholder.\n\nLast year, after her historic AO triumph, Keys admitted she would be lying if she said she never had doubts about whether she would ever have another shot at realizing her Grand Slam dream. She did it at 29. Now, a year later, it’s time to see if she can defend her crown in Melbourne. Her recent win against Krueger was her ninth consecutive win at AO. How does she feel to be back in Melbourne and continue her incredible winning streak? “It feels amazing being back as defending champion, and you know, I always had amazing memories here. It was my first SF of a Grand Slam here. So it felt very fitting to win my first Grand Slam here in front of all these amazing people.”\n\nMadison Keys admitted she loves coming to Melbourne, and to be able to lift that trophy last year was amazing. But coming to all the expectations surrounding her 2026 AO campaign, she added, “Everyone keeps asking if I’m gonna do it again – hopefully – but at the same time, that was such an amazing experience, and no one can ever take that away from me. So, whether or not I do repeat it, I still get to keep Daphne [the Australian Open trophy] at home.”\n\nEven earlier this week, after her 7-6(6), 6-1 win over Ukraine’s Oleksandra Oliynykova, Keys spoke about a wide range of topics. And one of them was, obviously, her title defense.\n\n“I was talking with Lindsay Davenport yesterday. She reminded me that few players get the chance to defend a Grand Slam title and that I should fully enjoy it. Despite my initial nerves, I’m thrilled to be back and to have won this match.”\n\nMadison Keys‘ love affair with Australia continues to deepen. She’ll now face the former world number one and a two-time finalist at the majors, Karolina Pliskova, in her next match. Pliskova’s best record at the AO has been reaching the SF in 2019. Both these players have faced each other only once before in their careers. It was at the 2020 Brisbane International where the Czech star took down Keys in a three-set thriller.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see who gets the edge in their second meeting on the Tour. But what did Keys say about her performance in the second-round match against Ashlyn Krueger?\n\nMadison Keys looked in complete control early on at John Cain Arena, racing through the opening set in just 23 minutes. She struck seven winners, converted all three break points, and barely allowed Krueger a foothold. But the match took a turn in the second set as the ninth seed fell behind 2-5, plagued by a string of double faults that handed the 21-year-old two service breaks.\n\nJust when doubts appeared to creep in, Keys responded with the calm authority of a champion. She reeled off five straight games, rediscovered her aggression, and closed out the contest in straight sets to keep her title defense on track.\n\n“I think I started really well, and Ashlyn started a little bit slow. And then I was fully expecting her to raise her level, which she did. It just kind of got away from me a little quickly. I just wanted to, even if I lost the (second) set, make sure I tried to get back in the set and try to figure out where my game kind of went and be able to get a few more points on the board. Once I kind of got back momentum, I just tried to sink my teeth into the set and do whatever I could to get back into it.”\n\nMadison Keys’ run at the AO last year included four wins over top ten seeds. Now, with the action coming thick and fast in Melbourne, fans are waiting to see how many she gets this year.\n\nWith confidence growing and perspective firmly in place, Keys appears determined to enjoy every step of her title defense. Whether the Melbourne story ends with another trophy or not, the defending champion is once again reminding everyone why Australia has always brought out the very best in her.\n\nThe post Madison Keys Admits Reality of Defending Her Australian Open Title After a Strong Start in Melbourne appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's late January, and college football analysts are already predicting what next season may look like.\n\nFormer ESPN analyst David Pollack is already locked into the immediate future and is zeroing in on the five best teams he could see overtaking the preseason discussions come August.\n\nEven though the Indiana Hoosierswon the national championship against the Miami Hurricanes Monday night, Pollack opted not to put them in his personal preseason rankings.\n\nInstead, one of two Big Ten teams Pollack is dead set on rebounding is the Ohio State Buckeyes as his No. 2 team.

Ok, offense is going to be easy.  Bo Jackson is back, the offensive line is back.  Chris Henry Jr., I played with his dad; he looks like the next freak (at OSU), so that’s another 1-2 punch [at receiver]. They’re going to lose a lot of guys, but I trust Ohio State to be back in the Top 5.”\n\nLuckily for Pollack, every player he mentioned is projected to return to Columbus. The Buckeyes are only a year removed from winning a national title, so it certainly isn't out of the question for them to be back in the mix again this fall and for years to come.\n\nSimilar to other teams around the league, the Buckeyes are now trying to live up to the blueprint the Hoosiers have set for themselves after completing an undefeated season.\n\nEven though it's unclear if the Hoosiers can maintain this level of dominance, the Buckeyes certainly want to prove they can return to the top of college football.\n\nCome August, they'll have a clean slate to make it happen.

    "title": "Mets' trade for Freddy Peralta completes whirlwind week that changes offseason perception and outlook",
    "description": "In a span of a week, David Stearns reshaped the Mets roster into a contender with the signing of Bo Bichette and the trades for Luis Robert Jr. and Freddy Peralta.",
    "fullText": "From the depths of December to the jolt of activity over the last five days here in January, David Stearns turned a disappointing offseason into one that offers reason for even the most disgruntled fans to believe 2026 could be a good year, after all.\n\nWith the trade for top starter Freddy Peralta from the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday night, Stearns made what is likely to be his last high-impact acquisition of the winter, and in doing so obtained the top-of-the-rotation starter the Mets desperately need to be considered genuine contenders again.\n\nOn the heels of the signing of Bo Bichette and the trade for Luis Robert Jr., the Peralta deal completes a whirlwind week for Stearns that changes the perception of the offseason and presumably makes it safe for him to go out for dinner in the big city without being heckled by Mets fans.\n\nHey, I get it, there are still going to be fans out there who aren’t happy with Stearns, and to some degree Steve Cohen, for essentially cleaning house and allowing Pete Alonso and Edwin Diaz to walk away while also trading Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil.\n\nIn the case of Alonso, especially, it will be fascinating to see whether Stearns was right in choosing not to offer him more than a three-year deal, as well as how much the Mets will miss his power bat in trying to win a championship over the next few years.\n\nBut what’s more relevant at the moment is that, after a seemingly endless wait this offseason, at least Stearns made the big-splash moves that should ensure the Mets of being contenders next season. Actually, they should be talented enough to battle the Philadelphia Phillies and the Atlanta Braves for the NL East title if they get some key turnarounds from veteran pitchers to go with Peralta and Nolan McLean.\n\nSo why now? Why the sudden flurry of activity? Was it simply the market moving to an inevitable conclusion for the likes of Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger that led to the signing of Bichette and the trade of Robert Jr.?\n\nOr, to put it another way, was this always the plan, waiting to mid-January to throw huge money at the likes of Tucker and Bichette, or did the outrage of Mets fans over losing Alonso and Diaz reach such a crescendo that Cohen, in particular, decided he needed to react and flex his financial muscle to stem the tide?\n\n“Steve can certainly be reactive to situations like that,” said one person who knows Cohen on a personal level, more as the hedge-fund billionaire. “He’s very aware of public perception in everything he does.”\n\nSo it’s possible he ordered the Code Red, if you will, that finally jump-started the Mets’ offseason. Yet, to be fair, it’s also possible that the timing of the big moves coincided with Stearns’ plan to wait for the prices on both free agents and trades to fall enough to warrant sudden activity.\n\n“The offseason has a life of its own,” was the way an executive from another team put it Wednesday night. “I’d lean toward believing the Mets waited until they felt the time was right, and then one move leads to another move and so forth.”\n\nWhatever the impetus, the additions of Bichette, Robert Jr., and Peralta all filled important needs for the Mets and are impactful enough to make the case that the Mets now have a better team than they did before this offseason began.\n\nFor that matter, with Bichette being introduced at Citi Field on Wednesday, some 12 hours after Stearns swung the deal to gamble on Robert Jr.’s high ceiling in center field, Stearns decided to have a Michael Corleone kind of day and settle all family business of sorts by making the trade for Peralta on Wednesday night.\n\nAgain, why now? Was it because he decided Framber Valdez wasn’t going to settle for a high-AAV, three-year deal?\n\nWere the Brewers running out of suitors and thus lowered their asking price on Peralta?\n\n“The Mets weren’t giving up (Brett) Baty, I can tell you that,” one person close to the deal said. “That may have been a sticking point at least for a while.”\n\nWhatever, in giving up Brandon Sproat and Jett Williams, the Mets still paid a high price, considering they’re only guaranteed one year of Peralta, who can be a free agent next winter -- though they also received Tobias Myers, who should be a useful bullpen arm.\n\nAnd while it could give the Mets a chance to lock up Peralta to a long-term deal if he adapts to New York and is pitching well next season, he could also be something of an afterthought in that regard if the Mets decide they’re going all-in on Tarik Skubal.\n\nStill, I think Stearns made the right move. Jonah Tong has a higher upside than Sproat and was likely more desired by the Brewers, and while Williams is a blue-chip prospect, he doesn’t have anywhere to play in the Mets’ infield, where he is considered best-suited. Especially since the Mets see Baty as a valuable utility man, having proven athletic enough to play second base last season, even while blossoming into a very good third baseman.\n\nAnd finally, while Stearns surely was all business in making the trade, you couldn’t blame him if he has a soft spot for Peralta. In his first trade as Brewers GM, in December of 2015, Stearns dealt veteran first baseman Adam Lind to the Seattle Mariners for a package of young players, including Peralta, then a 19-year-old in rookie ball.\n\nHe was a lottery ticket then who paid big dividends for the Brewers, and now Stearns brings him to the Mets with high expectations. At age 29, turning 30 next June, Peralta is coming off the best season of his career, as he pitched to a 2.70 ERA and threw a career-high 176.2 innings over 33 starts.\n\nThat averages out to 5.1 innings a start, which is the only knock against him, according to one scout I spoke to.\n\n“His fastball is electric and he can dominate any lineup when he’s commanding his off-speed stuff to go with it,” the scout said. “But he needs to go deeper into games to really be an ace. He tends to be a little too fine at times and because of that, his pitch count elevates. But he’s also a guy you feel good about putting out to start a postseason game.”\n\nA week ago, many Mets fans were bracing for the worst next season, convinced Stearns’ value-driven approach would doom them to fourth place in the NL East.\n\nAnd there are still plenty of questions about the ’26 Mets, to be sure. But I have to believe most fans are now willing to give Stearns -- and Cohen -- credit for turning the offseason of dismay into at least some level of success.",

It’s no different to watching Maresca’s Chelsea so far under Liam Rosenior, but perhaps even worse!\n\nBut thank god for Moises Caicedo hey? In the end he popped up to grab the crucial goal and stop any boos at the end of the game from the home fans.\n\nMoises Caicedo in Fulham draw. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nJoe Cole believes Caicedo is now Chelsea’s most important player and to be honest, I think he probably has been for a while now anyway. At least in terms of consistency and regular form, he’s been the best.\n\nCole told TNT Sports that he now thinks the honourof most important player at Chelsea belongs to Caicedo after watching him dominate in midfield against Pafos, as well as find the only goal.\n\nHe said: “He’s fast becoming the most important player at this club, and that £100m looks like a snip now.”\n\nA shout out for Enzo Fernandez as well, he is playing some consistent stuff lately and becoming very important for the team.",

We are so blessed to be the 2026 state champions,\" said Olympus coach Hailie Caso.\n\nSalem Hills had won the all-girls state title each of the past three years, but Olympus denied the Skyhawks a 3-peat. Fremont ended up finishing second runner-up in the all-girls division, with Salem Hills in third.\n\nOlympus was the only team to place in the top three in all three categories (Dance, Cheer, Show).\n\nOlympus won the Dance category, while Salem Hills won the Cheer category and Fremont the Show category.\n\nMembers of the Olympus team are: Sally Ames, Paislie Barton, Zuri Caldwell, Lily Flitton, Caroline Garriott, Jocilynn Hansen, Bella Hartsfield, Whitney Holm, Sadie Hornung, Gwen Jensen, Maybelle Kent, Addison Kinnersley, Vivian Lambert, Miki Madsen, Coco McBride, Kaileigh Melonas, Lucy Nadauld, Grace Nelson, Jane Nelson, Aida Nielsen, Olivia Patten, Stella Paxton, Scarlett Ransom, Cameron Reese, Ella Toomer, Bella Tullis, Autumn Turpin, Jillian Wolfenbarger, Jane Wood and Nora Zimmerman.\n\nIn the co-ed division, Cedar Valley won last year’s state championship but it’s now competing in 6A. That opened the door for Maple Mountain, which narrowly beat Northridge for the title.\n\n“We are so proud of this amazing team. They showed up with incredible discipline, resilience and heart all season. They put in the early mornings, late nights and teamwork. They trusted each other and performed brilliantly today. They earned every bit of this sweet moment. We made history today. Let’s go Eagles,” said Maple Mountain coach Aubree Earnest.\n\nMaple Mountain finished first in the Show category in second in the Dance category. And despite not finishing in the top 3 in the Cheer category, it still claimed the title.\n\nNorthridge finished in the top three in all categories, including winning Dance. Box Elder finished first in the Cheer category.\n\nMembers of the Maple Mountain team are: Kyndee Anderson, Braylee Atwood, Hallie Britain, Maddie Caldwell, Seeli Christensen, Josee Cope, Caylin Daugherty, Kenai Durstler, Ava Earnest, Kenzie Evans, Brityn Fuller, Lexi Hansen, Kennady Hoyt, Wesley Jackson, Capri James, Jayden Jones, Ava Knudsen, Maeve Larsen, Zoe Larsen, Sophie Monson, Joslyn Nance, Daisy Orgill, Halle Owen’s, Michael Parrotti, Eva Peterson, Jilli Petersen, Kena Pierce, Jaden Oropeza, Catrina Robison, Kaleb Sanders, Nikki Sircable, Sofie Snyder, Ethan Steveson, Elena ten Bosch, Lexi Thorpe, Macy Trapnell, Lily Vansickle, Bryn Ward, Kate Warren, Gracie Wilson and Oaklee Wilson.\n\nAlong with Earnest, the assistant coaches are: Payton Marshall, Jenny Larson and Nathan Ramirez.",

    "fullText": "Thursday night brings one of the busiest NBA slates of the week. January 22 features playoff contenders, rising young teams, and a few matchups that could swing late with one hot quarter. Home court, recent form, and injury updates all play a role in shaping how these games may unfold. So, let’s have a look around each game of the night. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nOrlando enters this game with a strong home record. The Magic are 14-7 at home and sit near the top of the Southeast Division. Free throw scoring is their biggest strength. They lead the league with 22 made free throws per game, which often keeps them ahead late.\n\nCharlotte has struggled with consistency. The Hornets are 16-28 and have dropped multiple road games this season. Three-point shooting remains their main weapon, ranking third in makes per game. Defensive issues continue to hurt them, especially allowing high shooting percentages.\n\nOrlando’s defense limits perimeter shots well, allowing under 12 threes per game. That directly challenges Charlotte’s main scoring path. The Magic also hold an edge in recent form despite a rough loss to Memphis.\n\nPredicted winner: Orlando Magic\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nHouston has quietly been one of the better road rebounding teams. They lead the West in offensive rebounds, which helps offset shooting slumps. Even with key injuries, the Rockets control the glass well.\n\nPhiladelphia remains dangerous at home but has been inconsistent. Tyrese Maxey continues to carry the scoring load, averaging 30 points. Joel Embiid is listed day to day, which impacts interior defense and scoring balance.\n\nThe Rockets shoot nearly 48 percent from the field, which is slightly above what Philadelphia usually allows. Houston also comes into this game on a three-game winning streak, while the Sixers are hovering around .500 at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nWashington has one of the weakest defenses in the league. They allow over 123 points per game and struggle to contain efficient offenses. Home games have not helped much, as they remain below .500 in Washington.\n\nDenver has been excellent on the road. The Nuggets are 17-7 away from home and average over 121 points per game. Even with Nikola Jokic sidelined, Jamal Murray has stepped up in recent games.\n\nThe Nuggets already beat the Wizards earlier this month. That win came by six points and featured strong perimeter shooting. Washington has also dropped eight of its last ten games, which points to ongoing problems.\n\nPredicted winner: Denver Nuggets\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nVenue: American Airlines Center\n\nGolden State is on a four-game winning streak and scoring at a high level. Over the last ten games, the Warriors average more than 123 points per night. Ball movement and three-point volume remain elite.\n\nDallas has talent but remains injury-hit. Several key rotation players are out, including Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis. Cooper Flagg has played well, yet the Mavericks struggle defensively against strong shooting teams.\n\nGolden State already beat Dallas earlier this season by double digits. The Warriors also rank near the top in made threes per game, while Dallas allows one of the highest three-point totals in the West.\n\nPredicted winner: Golden State Warriors\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nMinnesota has been dominant at home with a 15-6 record. The Timberwolves score heavily in the paint and have multiple scoring options. Anthony Edwards continues to average close to 30 points per game.\n\nChicago scores well but struggles defensively on the road. The Bulls allow 120 points per game, which becomes a problem against high-tempo teams. Minnesota already beat Chicago by 35 points earlier this season.\n\nThe Timberwolves are also trying to stop a three-game losing streak. That adds urgency to their performance at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nSan Antonio has been one of the most balanced teams in the West. They move the ball well and rank high in assists per game. Victor Wembanyama continues to anchor both ends of the floor.\n\nUtah allows the most points in the league. Defensive issues remain a constant problem. Even after a strong scoring night from Keyonte George, the Jazz still struggle to close games.\n\nThe Spurs already beat Utah earlier this week by double digits. San Antonio also holds a clear edge in efficiency and defensive rating.\n\nPredicted winner: San Antonio Spurs\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nThis matchup remains tight every season. The Clippers won the last meeting by 15 points. Home court has helped them recently, winning three straight in Inglewood.\n\nThe Lakers rely heavily on Luka Doncic and LeBron James. They perform well in close games, staying undefeated in contests decided by fewer than four points. Injuries remain a concern, especially in the backcourt.\n\nThe Clippers score less overall but defend better at home. That balance explains the narrow line.\n\nPredicted winner: Los Angeles Clippers\n\nDate: Thursday, January 22, 2026\n\nPortland has won eight of its last ten games and plays well at home. Rebounding has been a major strength, led by Donovan Clingan. The Trail Blazers also limit opponent scoring better than earlier in the season.\n\nMiami struggles on the road with an 8-14 record. Shooting efficiency has dipped over the last ten games. Tyler Herro remains out, which reduces scoring punch.\n\nPortland already lost a close game to Miami earlier this season. Recent form suggests a different outcome this time.\n\nPredicted winner: Portland Trail Blazers\n\nJanuary 22 is packed with games that could quietly shift the standings. Some favorites look steady, while a few underdogs have enough momentum to keep things close. Home floors matter tonight, especially in Minnesota, Denver, and Orlando. Late games in Los Angeles and Portland may come down to execution in the final minutes. It is a slate where smart matchups matter more than big names.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 22: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to recent football and men’s basketball matchups which all resulted in losses, BYU fans have learned to really loathe Texas Tech.\n\nThus, Cougar Nation should be mighty proud of what its women’s basketball squad accomplished Wednesday night.\n\nBYU scored a 73-61 upset victory over the No. 19-ranked Lady Raiders at the Marriott Center, toppling the Big 12’s top team for Lee Cummard’s first ranked win at the helm of the Cougars’ program.\n\n“I’m just really proud of the group and glad to see their hard work paying off and be rewarded for how close of a group it is, and how hard they work and prepare for these games,” Cummard told reporters after the win. “(We) had a great couple days of practice, great shoot around this morning. I just want (the players) to know that, you know, they’re a really good team and they’re rewarded for that tonight.”\n\nBYU trailed for less than a minute to open the night before quickly pulling ahead and never looking back, leading by as many as 17 points against a Texas Tech team that had yet to lose on the road and was 19-1 prior to arriving in Provo.\n\n“I felt like at least tonight, regardless of who they have, our five were more connected and tighter as a group, and we were the better five on the court,” Cummard said.\n\nThe Cougars shot a collective 47.3% from the field and 44.4% from 3-point range — a far cry from their previous season average of 29.7% — while feasting down low for 36 paint points.\n\nshots are fallin' ☔️\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/HaKZkEFic9\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\nBest exemplifying BYU’s fight was center Lara Rohkohl, who finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and a game-high plus/minus of +15, refusing to let the ultra-physical Lady Raiders push her around in the post.\n\n“They were a little aggressive down there, but you know, we stood against it and we did a good job down there,” Rohkohl said. “The guards were giving me perfect passes into my hands, and I just had to go up and finish it.”\n\nFeeding Rohkohl often was star sophomore point guard Delaney Gibb, who fought through double teams for 18 points, five rebounds and six assists while swiping four steals on the defensive end of the floor.\n\nAutomatic🔥\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/E5ruG3c7mP\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“I know that if I’m getting hounded and double-teamed, I can kick to shooters and pass to Lara and they’re gonna make plays out of it,” Gibb said. “And so I think we played super connected tonight and just moved the ball really well, which opened up great looks for us.”\n\nSome of that ball movement came from Rohkohl, who cashed in two assists by kicking outside to Gibb for a pair of 3-pointers.\n\nBullseye Delaney🎯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Dn4lsb6UJ6\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“Being in the paint and kicking out to a 3, in my opinion, is the best shot that there is,” Gibb said. “It’s really easy to make, all your momentum is going to the hoop. (Rohkohl) was fighting hard in the paint, and so for her to unselfishly spray out to shooters on the outside is never going to go unnoticed.”\n\nBYU’s leading scorer was freshman guard Olivia Hamlin, who put up the best performance of her young career — especially considering the competition — by posting 20 points of 9 of 15 shooting with four rebounds and two steals.\n\nEleven of Hamlin’s 20 points came in the first quarter to set the tone for the remainder of the contest, and she ended the night with six fourth quarter points to help bury Texas Tech for good.\n\n🤯🤯🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/XSatpyvczA\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“She was on it from the jump,” Cummard said of Hamlin. “... Tonight it was hard to keep her off the court. She was hugely impactful on the defensive end with those steals early, but even late, just with constant pressure.\n\n“People have a really hard time going around her, and people have a really hard time keeping her in front. (She is a) huge, huge asset to the group every game, but tonight she just brought it, you know, played with force and made plays for the group.”\n\nDefensively, BYU was outstanding, holding the Lady Raiders to 33.3% shooting and scoring 24 points off of 21 forced turnovers. The Cougars clamped down hardest in the fourth quarter, allowing just three makes on 16 field goal attempts.\n\nROBBED 'EM🤯\n\n📺ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Jl3Aw4Ioyr\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026\n\n“It was the most connected we’ve been all year defensively,” Cummard said. “We’ve been a pretty good defensive team, you know, visually, but also metrically speaking.\n\n“... I just thought that we minimized some of the lapses that we’ve had in some of our losses. ... It shows growth in what we’re doing, but just overall, the connectivity on that (defensive) end was really, really good as a group.”\n\nWith the win, BYU is now 15-4 on the campaign and has already matched last year’s mark of four victories in Big 12 play — a number Cummard’s Cougars will certainly increase given their 11 remaining conference contests, along with the newfound confidence from toppling a team such as Texas Tech.\n\n“I feel like we’ve had a pretty tough schedule thus far, and so it’s kind of like a breath of air (to win),” Gibb said. “I feel like this game is going to bring so much confidence to our team. We have a ton of young players, some of which this is their first year of college basketball, and so I think this kind of just reminds us that we can compete at the highest level. I think going into our next conference games, we’re going to be hungry to do the same thing every single night.”\n\nWIN CAM👐 pic.twitter.com/0H7qG1QNUo\n\n— BYU Women's Hoops (@byuwbb) January 22, 2026",

    "description": "The concept of natsukashii permeates Japanese culture, from traditional alleyways in Tokyo to the popularity of stores selling film cameras.",
    "fullText": "The concept of natsukashii permeates Japanese culture, from traditional alleyways in Tokyo to the popularity of stores selling film cameras.\n\nDuring my childhood summers spent in Yokohama, Japan, my obaachan (grandmother) would take me on afternoon strolls through her neighbourhood and teach me the names of all the flowers we came across. The cicadas would shriek over her soft voice and the humidity would cling to my body like a second layer of skin. When we returned home, the two of us would cool off over ice-cold glasses of mugicha (barley tea). “Am I your favourite grandchild?” I would ask her. My obaachan would smile and whisper, “Yes.”\n\nMy obaachan passed away in April 2019, and last summer was my first one without her. Now the taste of mugicha takes me back to our precious summer strolls. “Natsukashii,” I always think as the taste hits my tongue.\n\nNatsukashii is a Japanese word used when something evokes a fond memory from your past. It’s a word you exclaim as a smile creeps across your face. For instance, when you hear a song you loved as a teenager, or when you come across an old train ticket stub in your pocket.\n\nIn some cultures, nostalgia is often full of sadness. But natsukashii – which derives from the verb “natsuku”, which means “to keep close and become fond of” – indicates joy and gratitude for the past rather than a desire to return to it. In Japan, natsukashii is a reminder that you are fortunate to have had the experiences you’ve had in life. The fact that you cannot return to those experiences makes them all the more poignant.\n\n• Is this the world's cleanest culture?\n\n• China's strange and baffling quirk\n\n• Why Japan values 'naked communion'\n\n“A positive frame put around longing is the essence of natsukashii,” said Christine Yano, professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii, whose research focuses on Japanese popular culture. “It’s part of the emotional foundation of Japan. A glass half empty is a glass that’s full and beautiful.”\n\n“I think in Japan, nostalgia has to do with an aesthetic,\" she continued. \"This is the aesthetic that sees beauty in imperfection, in something not being quite complete, in longing, in yearning, in evanescence, in impermanence, wistfulness, in melancholy. It is an aesthetic invested with emotion and beauty at the same time.”\n\nAesthetic concepts in the traditional Japanese arts were developed in pre-modern Japan. One of the earliest to emerge was wabi-sabi, a Japanese philosophy rooted in Buddhism that finds beauty in imperfection and impermanence; examples include deliberately misshapen bowls used in tea ceremonies and bonsai trees displayed even after they’ve shed their leaves. Yano suggests that Japan’s approach to nostalgia is akin to wabi-sabi – but it’s life, rather than objects, that’s being celebrated for its imperfections.\n\nSumie Kawakami, a writer who teaches liberal arts at the International College of Liberal Arts (iCLA) at Japan’s Yamanashi Gakuin University, echoes that sentiment. She describes natsukashii as a bittersweet form of reminiscing. “We miss the time – but it’s better that way,” she said.\n\nIn today’s digital age, people seem to be more obsessed than ever with nostalgia. But in Japan, paying tribute to the past goes far beyond sharing the occasional #ThrowbackThursday post on social media or binge-watching an ‘80s TV show reboot.\n\nOn any given night of the week, Tokyo businessmen can be found blowing off steam in yokocho, traditional alleyways containing bars and restaurants. These cramped, cash-only establishments surrounded by glowing lanterns and cigarette smoke are a portal to another era, as they were originally part of black markets that cropped up in the city following World War Two.\n\nAnd last summer, Japanese Twitter went wild after someone shared a video they made using an app that replicated the VHS camcorder recording quality of the 1980s. Tens of thousands of people rushed to find out what the app was (VHS Cam), then share their own videos using it.\n\n“It always surprises me, the degree to which natsukashii comes up,” Yano told me. “One could say, ‘Oh, that’s mainly for old people.’ But it’s amazing how quickly a young person becomes ‘old’ in terms of natsukashii. An 18-year-old may feel natsukashii for kindergarten days.”\n\nKawakami compares the sentiment to the English phrase \"the good old days”. \"But there may be a slight difference,\" she noted. \"When Japanese say 'natsukashii’, they want to confirm that togetherness, rather than simply being nostalgic to a particular event or person. [It's like] 'Yeah, we were together on this!'\"\n\nThe demand for natsukashii experiences is so strong throughout Japan that there are companies that specialise in creating them. In 2002, Masahito Itami founded Dousoukai Net, a company that organises reunions for alumni across the country. High school and university reunions are commonplace in many parts of the world, but Itami also runs events for former elementary school peers and co-workers from defunct businesses.\n\n“Even if it’s getting together with people you used to work with, there is a sense of intimacy and connection you get from being with the people who’ve shared the same experiences as you,” Itami explained. “Whether they’re good or bad experiences, they all blossom into great stories to look back on together.”\n\nYumi Hisano, an Osaka native who has attended not one, but four high school reunions organised by Dousoukai Net over the past 20 years, agrees.\n\n“It was so meaningful to meet with people I hadn’t seen since getting married and leaving Osaka,” she recalled of the first reunion, which got her hooked. “I wanted to hear their stories and find out how they’d lived since the glory days when so many possibilities lay before us.”\n\nJapan’s love affair with the past, however, goes far beyond people occasionally reuniting with their classmates. This is a culture where people actively seek out natsukashii experiences to add meaning to their lives. An important part to the start of the year is to send nengajo (New Year's greeting cards) to not only close family and friends, but to people they’ve encountered briefly in their lives.\n\nAnother nostalgic tradition falls on New Year’s Eve, when most Japanese stay at home and watch Kōhaku Uta Gassen, an annual TV special featuring musical performances. Even as the show increasingly focusses on contemporary pop idols, it always saves room for enka artists, who sing sentimental ballads about traditional Japanese life and are generally thought of as musicians for older generations. As Yano notes, “In Japan, the past is always kind of a constant hum.”\n\nThat hum even influences consumer behaviour. Despite Japan’s love for modern technology, Bellamy Hunt, a Tokyo-based British camera broker who goes by the nickname “Japan Camera Hunter”, has made a living tracking down, repairing and selling rare film cameras. He says that there’s even been a recent increase in demand for black-and-white film and darkroom rental services in the country.\n\n“To give you a sense of how popular film camera lifestyle is in Japan, there is a major national magazine called Film Camera Style, and it’s just really fancy pictures of [old] cameras and how they’re used and how to use them,” Hunt said.\n\nBut it’s not that the Japanese are shunning their smartphone cameras. Hunt says that about 90% of his clients live abroad, and that part of the reason they’re drawn to Japan is because the culture places such an emphasis on the past and its relics.\n\n“People here look after their stuff,” he said. “I think we’ve lost track of that in the West a little bit.” We’ve taken things for granted and not seen the true value of them.”\n\nThe concept of natsukashii is, ultimately, a reflection of how ingrained gratitude is as a value in Japanese society. The past, whether it’s full of joy or pain, is valuable. It is to be remembered and appreciated. It should comfort us. It should strengthen our relationships. As Kawakami told me, “Sharing something precious from the past can connect me, as a person, to others.”\n\nWeeks after my obaachan passed away, my family sifted through her belongings and found a small notebook containing beautiful sketches of flowers and trees. It also included meticulous notes about their characteristics.\n\n“Did you know that obaachan used to take me on walks in the summer and teach me the names of all the flowers?” I asked my mother after examining several of the journal entries.\n\nMy mother, who has an aversion to Japan’s relentlessly hot summers, replied in amusement, “Kurushisou [seems painful].”\n\n“It was. We would drink mugicha afterwards though,” I replied.\n\nMy mother laughed with delight. “Mugicha in the summertime!” she cried. “Natsukashii.”\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or \n\nIf you liked this story, com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

    "description": "Image by Carl Van Vechten, via Wikimedia Commons\r\n“How did Faulkner pull it off?” is a question many a fledgling writer has asked themselves while struggling through a period of apprenticeship like that novelist John Barth describes in his 1999 talk 'My Faulkner.' Barth “reorchestrated” his literary heroes, he says, “in search of my writerly self... downloading my innumerable predecessors as only an insatiable green apprentice can.” Surely a great many writers can relate when Barth says, “it was Faulkner at his most involuted and incantatory who most enchanted me.",
    "fullText": "“How did Faulkn­er pull it off?” is a ques­tion many a fledg­ling writer has asked them­selves while strug­gling through a peri­od of appren­tice­ship like that nov­el­ist John Barth describes in his 1999 talk “My Faulkn­er.” Barth “reorches­trat­ed” his lit­er­ary heroes, he says, “in search of my writer­ly self… down­load­ing my innu­mer­able pre­de­ces­sors as only an insa­tiable green appren­tice can.” Sure­ly a great many writ­ers can relate when Barth says, “it was Faulkn­er at his most invo­lut­ed and incan­ta­to­ry who most enchant­ed me.” For many a writer, the Faulkner­ian sen­tence is an irre­sistible labyrinth. His syn­tax has a way of weav­ing itself into the uncon­scious, emerg­ing as fair to mid­dling imi­ta­tion.\n\nWhile study­ing at Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­si­ty, Barth found him­self writ­ing about his native East­ern Shore of Mary­land in a pas­tiche style of “mid­dle Faulkn­er and late Joyce.” He may have won some praise from a vis­it­ing young William Sty­ron, “but the fin­ished opus didn’t fly—for one thing, because Faulkn­er inti­mate­ly knew his Snopses and Comp­sons and Sar­toris­es, as I did not know my made-up denizens of the Mary­land marsh.” The advice to write only what you know may not be worth much as a uni­ver­sal com­mand­ment. But study­ing the way that Faulkn­er wrote when he turned to the sub­jects he knew best pro­vides an object les­son on how pow­er­ful a lit­er­ary resource inti­ma­cy can be.\n\nNot only does Faulkner’s deep affil­i­a­tion with his char­ac­ters’ inner lives ele­vate his por­traits far above the lev­el of local col­or or region­al­ist curios­i­ty, but it ani­mates his sen­tences, makes them con­stant­ly move and breathe. No mat­ter how long and twist­ed they get, they do not wilt, with­er, or drag; they run riv­er-like, turn­ing around in asides, out­rag­ing them­selves and dou­bling and tripling back. Faulkner’s inti­ma­cy is not earnest­ness, it is the uncan­ny feel­ing of a raw encounter with a nerve cen­ter light­ing up with infor­ma­tion, all of it seem­ing­ly crit­i­cal­ly impor­tant.\n\nIt is the extra­or­di­nary sen­so­ry qual­i­ty of his prose that enabled Faulkn­er to get away with writ­ing the longest sen­tence in lit­er­a­ture, at least accord­ing to the 1983 Guin­ness Book of World Records, a pas­sage from Absa­lom, Absa­lom! consist­ing of 1,288 words and who knows how many dif­fer­ent kinds of claus­es. There are now longer sen­tences in Eng­lish writ­ing. Jonathan Coe’s The Rotter’s Club ends with a 33-page long whop­per with 13,955 words in it. Entire nov­els hun­dreds of pages long have been writ­ten in one sen­tence in oth­er lan­guages. All of Faulkner’s mod­ernist con­tem­po­raries, includ­ing of course Joyce, Woolf, and Beck­ett, mas­tered the use of run-ons, to dif­fer­ent effect.\n\nBut, for a time, Faulkn­er took the run-on as far as it could go. He may have had no inten­tion of inspir­ing post­mod­ern fic­tion, but one of its best-known nov­el­ists, Barth, only found his voice by first writ­ing a “heav­i­ly Faulkner­ian marsh-opera.” Many hun­dreds of exper­i­men­tal writ­ers have had almost iden­ti­cal expe­ri­ences try­ing to exor­cise the Oxford, Mis­sis­sip­pi modernist’s voice from their prose. Read that one­time longest sen­tence in lit­er­a­ture, all 1,288 words of it, below.\n\nJust exact­ly like Father if Father had known as much about it the night before I went out there as he did the day after I came back think­ing Mad impo­tent old man who real­ized at last that there must be some lim­it even to the capa­bil­i­ties of a demon for doing harm, who must have seen his sit­u­a­tion as that of the show girl, the pony, who real­izes that the prin­ci­pal tune she prances to comes not from horn and fid­dle and drum but from a clock and cal­en­dar, must have seen him­self as the old wornout can­non which real­izes that it can deliv­er just one more fierce shot and crum­ble to dust in its own furi­ous blast and recoil, who looked about upon the scene which was still with­in his scope and com­pass and saw son gone, van­ished, more insu­per­a­ble to him now than if the son were dead since now (if the son still lived) his name would be dif­fer­ent and those to call him by it strangers and what­ev­er dragon’s out­crop­ping of Sut­pen blood the son might sow on the body of what­ev­er strange woman would there­fore car­ry on the tra­di­tion, accom­plish the hered­i­tary evil and harm under anoth­er name and upon and among peo­ple who will nev­er have heard the right one;

    "title": "mRNA cancer vaccine shows protection at 5-year follow-up, Moderna and Merck say",
    "description": "The vaccines are tailor-made to target each patient's unique cancer.",
    "fullText": "In a small clinical trial, customized mRNA vaccines against high-risk skin cancers appeared to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death by nearly 50 percent over five years when compared with standard treatment alone. That’s according to Moderna and Merck, the two pharmaceutical companies that have collaborated on the experimental cancer vaccine, called intismeran autogene (mRNA-4157 or V940).\n\nSo far, the companies have only reported the top-line results in a press release this week. However, the results align closely with previous, more detailed analyses from the trial, which examined rates of recurrence and death at earlier time points, specifically at two years and three years after the treatment. More data from the trial—a Phase 2 trial—will soon be presented at a medical conference, the companies said. A Phase 3 trial is also underway, with enrollment complete.\n\nThe ongoing Phase 2 trial included 157 patients who were diagnosed with stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma and were at high risk of having it recur after surgical removal. A standard treatment to prevent recurrence after such surgery is immunotherapy, including Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab). This drug essentially enables immune cells, specifically T cells, to attack and kill cancer cells—something they normally do. But, in many types of cancers, including melanoma, cancer cells have the ability to bind to receptors on T cells (called PD-1 receptors), which basically shuts the T cells down. Keytruda works by physically blocking the PD-1 receptors, preventing cancer cells from binding and keeping the T cells activated so they can kill the cancer.\n\nIn the trial, all 157 patients received Keytruda, a standard treatment. But they were randomized in a 2:1 ratio so that some would also get the customized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines were tailored specifically to each patient’s melanomas, carrying genetic instructions to build up to 34 unique markers of their mutated cancer cells. Once in the patient, healthy cells produce those markers and use them to train T cells to identify and attack the cancer cells.\n\nPrevious data from the trial reported that 107 participants received the mRNA vaccine and Keytruda treatment, while the remaining 50 only received Keytruda. At the two-year follow-up, 24 of the 107 (22 percent) who got the experimental vaccine and Keytruda had recurrence or death, while 20 of 50 (40 percent) treated with just Keytruda had recurrence or death, indicating a 44 percent risk reduction. The companies did not report the breakdown of the two groups in the press release this week for the five-year follow-up, but said the risk reduction was 49 percent, which is also what the companies reported for the three-year follow-up.\n\nAs for side effects, the companies reported that little had changed from previous analyses; adverse events were similar between the two groups. The top side effects linked to the vaccine were fatigue, injection site pain, and chills.\n\nThe results “highlight the potential of a prolonged benefit” of the vaccine combined with Keytruda in patients with high-risk melanoma,” Kyle Holen, a senior vice president at Moderna, said.\n\nThey also “illustrate mRNA’s potential in cancer care,” he said, noting that the company has eight more Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials going for mRNA vaccines against a variety of other cancers, including lung, bladder, and kidney cancers.\n\nMarjorie Green, a senior vice president at Merck, called the five-year follow-up data a “meaningful milestone” and “encouraging.”\n\n“[W]e look forward to late-stage data from the INTerpath clinical development program with Moderna, across a range of tumor types where significant unmet needs remain,” she said.\n\nWhile the top-line results appear positive, conclusions can’t be drawn until the full data from the trial are published. The vaccines are also being developed amid a political environment hostile to mRNA vaccines. Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has railed against mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, making false claims about their safety and efficacy. In August, Kennedy unilaterally canceled $500 million in grant funding for the development of mRNA-based vaccines against diseases that pose pandemic threats.",

    "fullText": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting tidbit on a possible change in the company’s cloud strategy. Specifically, Mark Gurman says Apple and Google are discussing running the next-generation Siri models directly on Google’s servers, not Apple’s.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple is set to launch the first new LLM Siri features, using models running in Private Cloud Compute based on an older generation of Gemini. But the Siri chatbot coming in the iOS 27 cycle will apparently be based off the newer, smarter, Gemini 3 models. Running these latest-gen models seemingly requires higher performance servers than what Apple can deliver right now through its own Private Compute cloud infrastructure …\n\nAs such, Apple user conversations with the new Siri chatbot experience would be trafficked through Google’s (much larger) cloud infrastructure for every request.\n\nThat would represent a big departure philosophically for Apple, which talked up Private Cloud Compute as a way to extend the privacy bubble of the personal data on your iPhone into Apple’s cloud. However, the Private Cloud Compute idea was designed under a prior regime. When Apple was promoting Private Cloud Compute at WWDC 2024, it had not conceived needing to license Gemini models from Google at all.\n\nAs such, it’s not unthinkable that other elements of its AI plan may be in flux. While Apple would probably like to keep as much of its processing running on its cloud, rather than a third-party, the new heads of Siri — Craig Federighi and former Vision Pro exec Mike Rockwell — seem to be choosing practicality over idealism. There is clearly pressure to ‘catch up’ and deliver modern Siri features to users as soon as possible, even if that means reneging on some parts of their prior published vision.\n\nAfter all, the company was also previously downplaying the premise of a chatbot experience altogether, but plans change and Apple is clearly responding to the proven market success of services like ChatGPT. It’s also probably safe to assume that Apple would negotiate the Google cloud server arrangement such that sensitive user data is not logged or retained by Google, sufficiently siloed from Google’s advertising and data collection units.\n\nBehind the scenes, parts of iCloud have depended on providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform since its inception. These third-party data storage partners enable features like iCloud Photos to operate and scale, all the while Apple holds the encryption keys. Back in 2021, it was reported that Google’s cloud hosted an enormous 8 exabytes of iCloud content.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

Not 13 because a rogue agent has discovered a “creative” alternative.\n\nThere is a veritable CambrAIn explosion of orchestration tools, but they all seem to be:\n\nI wanted something that would slot into any existing process with the most minimal ritual and configuration possible.\n\nRundown transforms markdown documentation into interactive, stateful workflows that guide agents and enforce process.\n\nI can safely say that working as the human-in-the-loop is at least an order of magnitude more productive than working alone.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the Rundown components includes:\n\nI haven’t typed a single line of code.\n\nI haven’t even looked at the code outside of code review.\n\nAgents wrote the code. Other agents reviewed the code.\n\nMy job was structure, architecture, and approach. The shape of the thing. I made decisions.\n\nAnd I attempted to keep the machine on track, with mostly mixed results.\n\nResearch is optional, but incredibly valuable as a tool to help the human with enough domain knowledge to keep the machine in line.\nTypeScript is not my thing - so I have spent quite a bit of time determining what good is meant to look like.\n\nThe process is front-loaded with detailed planning and refinement.\nThe \n\nApart from the more formal upfront waterfall, the process really mirrors normal development:\n\nIs a very different type of development, but it is very productive, and it is incredibly addictive.\n\nI built Rundown with Claude Code and Codex and Gemini so I could orchestrate Claude Code and Codex and Gemini to build more … other stuff.\n\nThe tool built the tool that improves the tool.\n\nWelcome to software development in 2026.\n\nAlso you should check out Rundown.",

    "description": "\"Let's talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around.\"",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday regarding President Donald Trump’s move to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa D. Cook, with whom the court appeared likely to side.\n\nThe New York Times’s Ann E. Marimow summed up the arguments before the court and reported that “justices from across the ideological spectrum questioned whether the allegations President Trump lodged against Ms. Cook — an unproven assertion that she engaged in mortgage fraud before taking office — were serious enough to allow the president to fire her.”\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, offered some of the most skeptical questions to Trump Solicitor General D. John Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh went so far during his questioning to suggest that if the court found in Trump’s favor, it would mean the president could fire all independent agency officials “at-will” – ending the “for cause” legal requirement.\n\nKavanaugh argued “the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029 if there’s a Democrat president…then we’re really at-will removal.”\n\nBelow is a transcript of that exchange:\n\nKavanaugh: For present purposes, you accept the constitutionality of the for-cause removal provision for the Federal Reserve, and that is what protects the independence of the Federal Reserve. What, in your view, is the purpose of that independence?\n\nSauer: It protects the governors. Exactly reflecting the plain text of the statute, it protects the governors from removal for policy disagreement or for no reason at all.\n\nKavanaugh: What is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: To preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nKavanaugh: And what is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: Well, there are a number of reasons that are discussed by the amici, and I think not disputed by us, which is that there is, you know, a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of, you know, executive influence, and we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing in that statute. And again, we are not disputing the validity of the for-cause removal restriction here.\n\nKavanaugh: And why is that independence important in your view?\n\nSauer: We don’t dispute the importance of that for many of the reasons that the amici say, but we emphasize that there’s a balance struck here. This is not an ironclad “you can never be removed.” There is a cause removal authorization.\n\nKavanaugh: But on that, in your position that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines—that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve that we just discussed.\n Sauer: We disagree with that, and I would point to the point you made that this is a low bar for cause. In a sense, it’s a very high bar.\n\nIt is a very strong protection, because it does protect them from the one thing that Congress was apparently most worried about, which is—\n Kavanaugh: But it would be in the view of the president—the president who might have a policy disagreement—and there’s no judicial review, and the president can just define it on his or her own.\n\nSauer: One of the strongest traditions in this court’s jurisprudence is the sort of presumption of regularity to the president’s actions that has applied to this provision, I think, effectively for 112 years, and it continues to do so.\n\nKavanaugh: Let’s talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033. And then we’re really at at-will removal. So what are we doing here? What is—you know, we started—that’s why I started with what’s the purpose of the independence and the for-cause removal. If we accept all these—no procedure, no judicial review, no remedy—you know, that’s what’s going to happen, I think. And then where are we? So do you dispute that that is, you know, the real-world effect?\n\nSauer: I can’t predict what future presidents may or may not do, but the argument strikes me as a policy argument.\n\nKavanaugh: Well, history is a pretty good guide. Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides, and usually more the second time around. And I think that’s what we have to make sure we’re—again, that can’t drive the decision necessarily. We have to be aware of what we’re doing and the consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Kavanaugh Warns ‘What Goes Around Comes Around’ If Court Lets Trump Have ‘At-Will Removal’ Power first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A tasty invasive species population has exploded in the Chesapeake Bay area, and Maryland officials are encouraging people to add it to their diet.\n\nAccording to The BayNet, blue catfish have become a serious problem in Maryland's waters. Once believed to be just a freshwater fish, the species has proved to be resilient enough to inhabit saltwater as well.\n\nThe fish was introduced into Virginia's river systems in the 1970s for recreational fishing and to increase the food supply. However, by 2000, they were present in the Chesapeake Bay and the Patuxent and Potomac Rivers.\n\nIn 2024, an estimated 4.7 million blue catfish were harvested from the area, per the publication.\n\nBlue catfish prey on blue crabs, American eels, white perch, and almost anything else they can swallow, reminiscent of other ravenous invasive species, such as American bullfrogs. This harms the native ecosystems of the rivers and bay, depleting resources and pushing out local species.\n\nA 2025 study found that blue catfish consume thousands of pounds of blue crab annually, and they hunt them year-round. They also eat juvenile crabs that have yet to reproduce, further restricting the crab populations.\n\nBlue crabs are a staple food in Maryland, and more than a third of the country's blue crab supply comes from the Chesapeake Bay. Fishermen rely on them for their livelihood; people rely on them as a food source; the state relies on them as a cultural symbol.\n\nMany other species in these bodies of water also prey on the crabs. When blue catfish hoard them, other species suffer from food shortages.\n\nBut there's a silver lining. Since the species are overrunning the rivers and bay, people are strongly encouraged to buy or catch them, and eat them.\n\nBoth commercial and recreational fishermen can, potentially by law soon, go all out on reeling them in. It also means fried catfish and other catfish dishes should be on everyone's menu.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nBranson Williams, the invasive fishes program manager and freshwater biologist with the Department of Natural Resources, told The BayNet, \"We're fortunate that blue catfish taste good. … They're a mild, white-fleshed fish, and there's definitely a market for them.\"\n\nInvasive species are destructive and must be mitigated. Thankfully, controlling this species means plenty of fish for everyone, helping the local economy and ecosystems at the same time.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "\"It's a really important opportunity for sheep farmers.\"",
    "fullText": "Sheep farmers in Britain are finding an unexpected lifeline through solar grazing, where flocks feed on grass growing under energy panels, reported the Guardian.\n\nThe arrangement works like this: solar installations need the vegetation under their panels controlled. Traditionally, operators spend up to $67,000 per year on mowing and herbicide treatments.\n\nSheep do the job for far less. Unlike heavy machinery, the animals can access tight spaces and keep working regardless of weather conditions.\n\nFor farmers, the deal is even sweeter. Many solar operators offer grazing rights at no cost, opening doors for producers who would otherwise be priced out of the industry.\n\nHannah Thorogood, who started her Lincolnshire farm from scratch, has experienced this firsthand.\n\n\"When I first started out, 18 acres and 20 sheep was as much as I could afford,\" she told the Guardian. \"Now, because I can graze this land for free, I have 250 acres and over 200 sheep. Solar grazing has given me a massive leg-up.\"\n\nUK sheep populations have hit record-low numbers as producers face rising input costs, volatile markets, and shrinking margins. Free grazing access gives struggling farmers room to expand without shouldering land expenses.\n\nDr. Liz Genever, who farms in southeastern Lincolnshire, grew her flock threefold after gaining access to nearby solar land.\n\n\"If I could increase my flock to the full potential offered by the local solar site, I could potentially increase my income from sheep from £20,000 to £60,000,\" she told the Guardian. \"It's a really important opportunity for sheep farmers.\"\n\nGrazing sheep enrich the soil and encourage a wider variety of plants to grow, and they eliminate the need for chemical treatments. Solar sites offer added security through on-site cameras, and the panels themselves block harsh sun and winter storms for the animals below.\n\nIf you live near a solar installation with grazing programs, connecting with local operators could open doors for your own agricultural ambitions.\n\nIf you were to install home solar panels, which of these factors would be your primary motivation?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Jeff Bezos' space venture, Blue Origin, has unveiled a satellite network aimed at challenging Elon Musk's SpaceX dominance in orbit.",
    "fullText": "Jeff Bezos has unveiled his plans for a massive satellite network, mounting a direct challenge to Elon Musk's grip on internet infrastructure in orbit.\n\nThe project, called TeraWave, would deploy 5,408 satellites into orbit to serve data centers, governments, and businesses worldwide, Bezos's space venture, Blue Origin, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nLaunches are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027.\n\nTeraWave is designed to deliver \"data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second anywhere on Earth,\" enabled by advanced optical communications between satellites, the company said.\n\nThe network is \"optimized for enterprise, data center, and government customers\" and would serve up to 100,000 customers, it added.\n\nThe announcement comes after Bezos' other company, Amazon, rebranded its consumer satellite network Leo in November. Formerly known as Project Kuiper, the initial constellation design includes more than 3,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites providing standard broadband service.\n\nThe launch of TeraWave raises the stakes in a billionaire-led fight over space-based internet infrastructure. Starlink, led by Elon Musk, dominates the field with roughly 10,000 satellites in orbit. The subsidiary project of SpaceX targets consumers, businesses, and governments, and serves more than 6 million users globally.\n\nIn a reply to an X user on Monday, Musk said \"Starlink space to ground laser links will exceed this,\" referring to the data speeds touted by TeraWave.\n\nSpaceX has also begun laying the regulatory groundwork to scale its satellite operations. In a January filing with the US Federal Communications Commission, the company said satellite systems should be treated as essential infrastructure for future wireless networks as the US seeks to maintain leadership in next-generation space-based services.\n\nBeyond internet access, the satellite race is increasingly tied to the future of computing, as tech leaders point to satellite networks as potential infrastructure for future data centers in space.\n\nResponding on X to an article about building data centers in space, Musk said in October that \"simply scaling up Starlink V3 satellites, which have high speed laser links would work.\"\n\n\"SpaceX will be doing this,\" he added.\n\nMusk has also discussed the idea internally. During an xAI all-hands meeting in December, he said he sees data centers eventually moving off Earth, raising the possibility of space-based facilities that could be operated by Tesla Optimus robots, people with knowledge of the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nJeff Bezos has voiced a similar long-term view, predicting that data centers could shift to space within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November that the concept may sound \"crazy,\" but \"when you truly step back and envision the amount of compute we're going to need, it starts making sense and it's a matter of time.\"",

    "description": "Ukrainian interceptors on the market can typically fly at speeds of up to 200 mph, but they'll need to be faster to catch Russia's newer Gerans.",
    "fullText": "As the Ukraine-Russia drone arms race rages, hobbyists far from the war are pushing the limit for how quickly these small quadcopters can fly.\n\nA father-son duo in South Africa set a new Guinness World Record by reaching a ground speed of 408 mph with their custom, battery-powered remote-controlled quadcopter, the Peregreen V4.\n\nLuke and Mike Bell performed the record-breaking flight on December 11, 2025, the Guinness World Records organization said in a statement in January.\n\nWhile drones built for war are constrained by additional factors, the Bells' achievement expands the possibilities of how these devices might one day perform on the battlefield.\n\nIt also lays bare how accessible new war-relevant technology is becoming for civilians. The Bells documented their design and build process on YouTube, filming themselves using a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts to create the Peregreen V4.\n\nTheir drone's design features a dome-shaped head and four propellers extending from the lower body — much like many of the interceptor drones available on the Ukrainian market today.\n\nThese drones, developed primarily as a low-cost way of countering Russian Shahed-type loitering munitions, have become a pillar of Ukrainian air defense.\n\nSome of the fastest interceptors available to Ukrainian forces can reach 200 mph, which is also the typical velocity of a bullet train.\n\nUkrainians are trying to push their quadcopters to fly even faster. Flight speed is key for these interceptors because they're designed to chase and crash into Shaheds, and Russia has been continually ramping up the speeds of its attack drones.\n\nThe Geran-2, a Shahed-type drone that Russia launches more commonly, can carry an explosive warhead for hundreds of miles at top speeds of 115 mph. Newer, jet-powered versions of Shaheds are estimated to fly up to 230 mph in some conditions.\n\nA major issue with faster drones is that their components tend to overheat when pushed to the limit — whether it's the propeller motors, wiring, or batteries.\n\nIn their YouTube videos, the Bells repeatedly recorded their drone or its individual parts catching fire during tests.\n\nDrone makers also have to juggle other design factors, such as the drone's aerodynamics and propeller efficiency.\n\nUkrainian war manufacturers face additional constraints: Their drones need to carry an additional payload — often 200 grams to 1 kg of explosives. They must also be maneuverable enough to pivot and catch a flying enemy target, and be mass-produced.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was already producing 1,000 interceptor drones a day.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bells' flight record involved a single drone that flew largely in a straight line.\n\nThe duo's latest certification is the third time they've attained the fastest-drone record. The previous holder of the achievement was Australian drone maker Ben Biggs, who built a drone that reached 389 mph late last year.\n\nBefore Biggs' record, the Bells' earlier quadcopter, the Peregreen V3, had flown at up to roughly 363 mph in the summer of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, the pair set a record of 298 mph with a similar drone design.\n\nGuinness World Records requires aspiring drone record-breakers to fly their device in two opposing directions and then calculate the average speed to account for wind.",

Deloitte had 181,500 employees in the US as of May 31, 2025.\n\nThe firm also announced a new leadership role during Wednesday's meeting.\n\nCurrently, the most senior titles at the firm are partners, principals, and managing directors — known as PPMD. Starting in June, a role titled \"leaders\" will join the group, according to the presentation.\n\n\"We are modernizing our talent architecture to provide a more tailored experience reflective of our professionals' broad range of skills and the work they do,\" a Deloitte spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe overhaul of titles comes as Deloitte and its peers face existential questions posed by AI in the consulting industry. The technology is changing what it means to be a consultant, affecting long-held talent structures, pricing models, and the work that clients want from their consultants.\n\nIn the internal presentation, Deloitte frames the changes as a necessary modernization for a changing market.\n\nAfter a slide titled \"why now?\" the firm explains that its current talent architecture is \"outdated\" and unable to \"support our business of tomorrow.\"\n\nThe current structure was designed for \"a more homogenous workforce of 'traditional' consulting profiles,\" according to the presentation. \"But so much has changed.\"\n\nDeloitte's workforce and business have grown, employees are seeking more tailored talent experiences, and \"our clients are demanding new skills and capabilities,\" the presentation said.\n\nDay-to-day work, leadership, and the firm's \"compensation philosophy\" will all stay the same, according to the presentation.\n\nConsultants at Deloitte have traditionally followed a progression path of analyst, senior analyst, consultant, senior consultant, manager, and senior manager, before promotion to the top echelons of the firm.\n\nUnder the new system, these titles will become more specific and include reference to a \"job family\" and \"sub-family,\" which are another new feature introduced in the talent overhaul.\n\nIn an example from the presentation, an employee with the current job title of \"senior consultant\" could become \"senior consultant, functional transformation,\" \"software engineer III,\" or \"project management senior consultant\" on June 1.\n\nInternally, employees will also be assigned an alphanumeric reference to indicate their job level, such as L45 for what is currently a senior consultant and L55 for current managers.\n\nThese more specific titles will \"drive greater clarity and market relevancy,\" according to the presentation.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Federal prosecutors charged a man with wire fraud, alleging a \"Catch Me if You Can\"-reminiscent scheme.\n\nUS Attorney Ken Sorenson said in a Tuesday press release that a Canadian man was charged over allegations that he pretended to be a pilot and a flight attendant to get hundreds of free trips.\n\nAccording to court documents, 33-year-old Dallas Pokornik from Toronto was arrested in Panama earlier this month and extradited to the US.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty Tuesday after being arraigned in federal court in Hawaii, where he was indicted last October on wire fraud charges. A magistrate judge ordered him to remain in custody.\n\nPokornik's public defender did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe indictment filed at the District Court of Hawaii alleged that Pokornik worked as a flight attendant for a Toronto-based airline from 2017 to 2019. After leaving the job, prosecutors alleged he used fake employee identification from that carrier to obtain tickets reserved for pilots and flight attendants on three other airlines.\n\nThe indictment also alleged Pokornik \"used and presented a false and fictitious identification\" as a current pilot or flight attendant to claim travel benefits typically offered to airline staff when seats are available.\n\nProsecutors alleged in the complaint that the airline companies are based in Honolulu, Chicago, and Fort Worth, Texas, but did not name them. They also did not name the Toronto-based airline they alleged he worked for.\n\nRepresentatives for Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nProsecutors also said Pokornik at times requested access to the cockpit \"jump seat,\" which is generally reserved for off-duty pilots, trainees, or inspectors. Court filings do not indicate whether any of those requests were granted, and the US Attorney's Office did not comment.\n\nThe indictment includes two counts of wire fraud tied to tickets issued in Hawaii in 2024. If convicted, Pokornik could face up to 20 years in prison, fines of up to $250,000, and supervised release.",

    "description": "Friends and family often ask Deidre Donnelly, \"When are you coming back?\" As she gets closer to 50, she finds the question hard to answer.",
    "fullText": "My late 30s were hard. Living alone in Cape Town, South Africa, I was holding out for a partner and children while my friends moved through weddings and baby showers without me.\n\nMy parents and sisters (including my twin) lived in another province, freelance writing work was drying up, and as 40 approached, I felt stuck — single, lonely, and unsure what came next.\n\nSo I made a deal with myself: If the picket-fence dream hadn't happened by 40, I'd leave. I didn't have a family of my own, but I had freedom, English, and nothing to lose. I packed up my life and accepted a yearlong EFL teaching job in Vietnam.\n\nI took a one-way flight to a city I'd never heard of in a country I'd never visited.\n\nVietnam's humidity, population density, and traffic overwhelmed me. In Haiphong, the industrial port city in northern Vietnam that I now call home, foreigners are rare, and not many locals speak English. Some older locals don't take kindly to outsiders, so I had a few terse encounters with taxi drivers and traders.\n\nBut after three months, the adventure took hold. I went from living and working alone to having housemates, socializing the way I had back at university, learning a new language, and connecting with kids and teens.\n\nWhen COVID hit halfway through my contract, some younger coworkers left, many were urged by their parents. I stayed.\n\nIn my time here, I've seldom been lonely. I'm surrounded by younger expat friends who are mostly single. I started a book club and a foodie club. There are daily moments of laughter across language divides with strangers.\n\nBeing a middle-aged woman with no husband or children is an anomaly here, but becoming \"Teacher Dee\" has helped me put aside some of the sadness of being childless — not by choice, but by circumstance.\n\nI've gone from lamenting not having children to being surrounded by them. Neighborhood children shout \"Helloooo!\" as they whizz past on their bikes. In shops, parents nudge their kids to practice English with me. I get happy high-fives from spunky students.\n\nEarly on, I often directed my interior monologue to my twin sister, narrating my new life to her in my head. These days, I connect with other South African friends who feel similarly torn. We even support our country during rugby matches, something I rarely did back home.\n\nVietnam has been good to me. I've gained teaching experience, become more sociable, and feel less financially stressed.\n\nNow, nearing seven years of what began as a \"break\" from life back home, I'm contemplating what's next. Friends and family often ask, \"When are you coming back?\" The question looms larger as I edge closer to 50.\n\nHome is no longer one place, but two. I pay for storage in Cape Town while accumulating more than I can fit into two suitcases in Haiphong. I exist in a constant state of longing for one place while living in the other.\n\nI miss the nature, familiarity, and diversity of Cape Town, but I know I'd grieve the freedom, safety, and financial security I've found here. People say, \"It'll always be there, waiting.\" I worry instead, \"Has that door closed?\"\n\nI panic at the thought of missing all that's uniquely Vietnamese — a place that pulses with energy and possibility. Life spills out through open front doors, down alleys, onto sidewalk stools, into food markets and coffee shops, and onto the backs of zippy scooters. Most of all, I'd miss the people — especially the children.\n\nI see myself eventually settling back in Cape Town, but not yet. For now, I'm betwixt and between — juggling two career paths, with my head and heart stretched across continents.\n\nAfter enough time abroad, returning can feel as daunting as leaving once did. My belongings are split between two homes, and so am I.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad? Contact the editor at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Granted New Zealand citizenship last year, James Cameron says part of the country's appeal is that it 'believes in science.'",
    "fullText": "James Cameron says he had talked about moving to New Zealand for years before finally following through in 2020.\n\nOn Wednesday's episode of \"In Depth with Graham Bensinger,\" the filmmaker said he first fell in love with the country in the '90s, but the US response to the pandemic ultimately pushed him to make the move.\n\n\"I went to New Zealand for the first time in '94. I was on my way to the South Pole, and we wound up getting stuck there because the flights were grounded because of ice conditions,\" Cameron, 71, told podcast host Graham Bensinger.\n\nThe flight delay gave him time to explore the Christchurch area, and he ended up falling in love \"with the country, the scenery, the people, the kind of way of life there,\" he said.\n\n\"I made myself a promise. I'm going to come live here someday,\" he said.\n\nCameron added that when he and his now-wife, Susie, were first getting serious, she was also open to the idea of eventually moving to New Zealand. However, life got in the way as they went on to have kids and settled down in Malibu and Santa Barbara.\n\n\"That conversation, you know, had to be amended slightly, but we did say, you know, after 'Avatar,' let's make this happen,\" Cameron said.\n\nThe couple bought a farm in New Zealand in 2011 and spent years traveling back and forth between the two countries.\n\n\"We were shooting in New Zealand. We came back for Christmas, then COVID-19 hit, and we didn't get back down there,\" Cameron said. \"So then I had to move mountains to get our production unit back up and running in New Zealand, and we just decided at that point in time that it was time to make the move as a family.\"\n\n\"This is why I love New Zealand. People there are, for the most part, sane as opposed to the United States,\" he said, pointing to what he described as stark differences in attitudes toward vaccines and public health.\n\n\"Are you kidding me? Where would you rather live?\" Cameron said. \"A place that actually believes in science, and is sane, and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody's at each other's throats, extremely polarized, turning its back on science, and basically would be in utter disarray if another pandemic appears?\"\n\nWhen Bensinger said New Zealand had beautiful natural landscapes, Cameron replied, \"I'm not there for the scenery. I'm there for the sanity.\"\n\nIn February, the filmmaker told New Zealand outlet Stuff that the US under Donald Trump was \"a turn away from everything decent.\"\n\n\"There's something nice about the New Zealand outlets — at least they'll put it on page three. I just don't want to see that guy's face anymore on the front page of the paper. It's inescapable there, it's like watching a car crash over and over and over,\" he said.\n\nCameron was granted New Zealand citizenship in August, a spokesperson for the filmmaker told The New Zealand Herald.\n\nHe isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has left the US for political reasons.\n\nRosie O'Donnell said in a TikTok video in March that she moved from the US to Ireland with her youngest daughter just days before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country,\" she said. \"And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that's when we will consider coming back.\"\n\nDuring a July public appearance at a theater in the UK, Ellen DeGeneres said she and Portia de Rossi moved to England following the 2024 election results.\n\n\"We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, 'He got in.' And we're like, 'We're staying here,'\" she said, per the BBC.",

At that point, the company blamed the manufacturing error on an incomplete testing protocol.\n\nThis is not the first time Wilson has publicly criticized the brand since he left the company's board in 2015.\n\nHe slammed the company's succession plan after CEO Calvin McDonald, compared its trajectory to a \"plane crash\" and a \"sinking ship.\"\n\nIn December, he launched a proxy fight to shake up the company leadership. As the largest shareholder, he nominated three new board members of his choosing.",

    "fullText": "The AI race doesn't need to be a zero-sum game, says Satya Nadella.\n\nOn an appearance of the \"All-In\" podcast recorded in Davos on Wednesday, the Microsoft CEO said current competition is intense — but that's not a bad thing.\n\n\"The way I always think is it's always helpful when you have a complete new set of competitors every decade because that keeps you fit,\" he said. He added, \"It's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.\"\n\nNadella said that when he joined the computer giant in 1992, Novell, a Utah-based software and services company, was the \"big, existential competitor\" Microsoft had.\n\nNovell's dominance declined in the late 1990s, and it was acquired in 2011.\n\nNadella said that the tech industry as a whole will continue to dominate economically.\n\n\"At the end of the day, when I look at it as a percentage of GDP, five years from now, where will tech be? It will be higher,\" he said, referring to gross domestic product. \"So we're blessed to be in this industry. It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum as some people make it out.\"\n\nNadella said that his approach is a different take on Peter Thiel's advice. He said Microsoft avoids competition by understanding what customers really want from the company rather than treating everybody like a competitor.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO's embrace of competition matches the approach one of his predecessors, Bill Gates, and top rival, former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, took toward competition.\n\n\"Competition is always a fantastic thing, and the computer industry is intensely competitive,\" Gates said in a 2005 interview. \"Whether it's Google or Apple or free software, we've got some fantastic competitors, and it keeps us on our toes.\"\n\nJobs famously shifted his perspective on competition after returning to Apple in 1997. He went from dismissing Microsoft's taste and originality to saying that Apple needed to focus on its own success rather than Microsoft's failure.\n\n\"If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose,\" he said at the 1997 Macworld Expo.",

    "description": "Subaru's decision is part of a broader industry trend.",
    "fullText": "Subaru has unveiled a new all-electric vehicle that could help lower the barrier to EV ownership for drivers on a budget.\n\nAccording to CarScoops, the automaker confirmed that its 2026 Uncharted crossover will be in U.S. dealerships early next year with a starting price of $34,995, making it the most affordable EV Subaru has ever offered.\n\nThat price places the Uncharted well below Subaru's current electric model, the Solterra, and undercuts several competing compact EVs.\n\nIt's part of a broader industry trend, as more automakers roll out lower-cost electric and hybrid models in response to rising consumer demand for EVs.\n\nThe entry-level Uncharted Premium FWD is also the brand's first front-wheel-drive vehicle sold in the U.S. in decades.\n\nThe 74.7-kilowatt-hour battery is paired with a 221-horsepower electric motor, delivering an estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge. Fast-charging allows the battery to jump from 10% to 80% in less than half an hour, making longer trips more practical.\n\nInside, the Uncharted features a streamlined cabin with a 14-inch touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, heated front seats, and Subaru's EyeSight driver-assistance suite.\n\nFor drivers, the benefits of making your next car an EV are compelling. EVs cost far less to fuel than gas-powered cars and require less routine maintenance since there are no oil changes, spark plugs, or fuel systems to worry about.\n\nThey also run quietly and produce no tailpipe pollution, helping improve local air quality and public health.\n\nCharging at home can be cheaper than relying on public chargers, saving drivers hundreds of dollars per year. Companies like Qmerit help homeowners install Level 2 EV chargers with free, instant installation estimates.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nPairing your EV with rooftop solar can boost those savings even further by reducing electricity costs. If you're interested in exploring solar options, check out our Solar Explorer to compare vetted installers and save up to $10,000.\n\nMeanwhile, services like EnergySage help simplify the process by connecting homeowners with competitive solar quotes.\n\nCommenters were mostly excited about the reveal.\n\n\"This EV move is right for them because making Boxer engine forever and Nissan transmissions don't cut it anymore,\" one said.\n\n\"It looks great and the Toyota sibling got very good reviews in Europe....very capable and very well fit and finish,\" added another.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "description": "Wilson was convicted of the 2019 murders of Kristine Melton and Diane Ruiz",
    "fullText": "Wade Wilson killed Kristine Melton and Diane Ruiz in October 2019\n\nWilson confessed his crimes to his biological father, who alerted authorities\n\nWilson and the murders are the focus of the Paramount+ docuseries Handsome Devil: Charming Killer\n\nIn June 2024, Wade Wilson was found guilty of killing two women within hours of each other in Cape Coral, Fla.\n\nWilson — who has been referred to as the “Deadpool Killer” because of their shared name — already had a few run-ins with the law by that point. But he escalated to murdering on Oct. 7, 2019, when he killed Kristine Melton, 35, in her sleep and Diane Ruiz, 43, on the street while on the way to her job.\n\n“The evidence showed both murders were heinous, atrocious and cruel,”  20th Judicial Circuit Court Judge Nicholas Thompson said during Wilson’s 2024 sentencing hearing in Florida. “And that the second murder was cold, calculated and premeditated.”\n\nNow, Wilson’s crimes and the subsequent online attention are explored in the Paramount+ docuseries Handsome Devil: Charming Killer. The three-part show, which premiered on Jan. 20, investigates why Wilson committed the murders and how his mugshot spurred an online frenzy.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Wade Wilson’s crimes and arrest.\n\nWilson was born to teenage parents in Florida on May 20, 1994, according to The News-Press. He was adopted by a couple named Steve and Candace Wilson shortly after and was raised in Tallahassee, where he attended Chiles High School, Newsweek reported.\n\nDuring Wilson’s murder trial, his biological father, Steven Testasecca, testified that the pair reconnected when Wilson was 18 and remained in “sporadic” contact, per The News-Press.\n\nPrior to his conviction in Melton and Ruiz’s murders, Wilson amassed a criminal record by the time he was in his 20s, including for offenses including burglary and battery.\n\nIn early 2019, about nine months before his arrest for the murders, his ex-girlfriend accused him of stealing her laptop and cellphone, kidnapping and raping her.\n\nHowever, they were under a no-contact court order and authorities ultimately chose not to investigate the kidnapping and rape allegations, according to The News-Press.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 2019, Wilson killed Melton and Ruiz within hours of each other in separate incidents.\n\nMelton was living and working as a waitress in Cape Coral, Fox 4 reported. After meeting Melton at a local Fort Myers bar the night prior, Wilson returned home with her, where he later strangled her to death in her sleep, according to the outlet. Wilson then stole Melton’s car and fled the scene.\n\nWhile driving around, Wilson spotted Ruiz walking to work and stopped to ask for directions. A mother of two and engaged to be married, Ruiz was working as a bartender at a local Cape Coral eatery.\n\nAfter luring her into his car under false pretenses, Wilson beat and strangled Ruiz before pushing her out of the vehicle and running her over multiple times, according to USA Today.\n\n“This case was about killing for the sake of the killing,” Assistant State Attorney Andreas Gardiner said during the closing arguments of Wilson’s trial in June 2024, per Fox 4. “Strangulation is the epitome of life slipping through someone’s hands.”\n\nWilson was arrested on Oct. 8, 2019, after confessing to the murders in a series of phone calls with his biological dad, Testasecca, The News-Press reported.\n\n\"The first time, he said he needed help. He had done something that he couldn’t take back,\" Testasecca recalled, per Fox 4. \"There was two people gone that would not be back. He said I'm a killer.\"\n\nAfter Wilson described the murders and aftermath, Testasecca contacted authorities and alerted them to his son’s confessed crimes. He then convinced Wilson to surrender \"peacefully.\"\n\nFollowing a lengthy trial, Wilson was found guilty by a Florida jury in June 2024.\n\nHe was convicted of six charges, including battery, burglary and two counts of first-degree murder, according to USA Today. In August 2024, he was subsequently sentenced to death.\n\nAfter Wilson was found guilty, Cape Coral Police Chief Anthony Sizemore released a statement regarding the Ruiz and Melton families’ reaction to the verdict.\n\n“This afternoon in the Lee County Courthouse, I sat with the families of Diane Ruiz and Kristine Melton as the verdict was read: Wade Wilson was found guilty on all counts,” Sizemore said. “The families expressed to me their gratitude for the hard work of our team.”",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 21 (Reuters) - China rejected speculation on Wednesday that it would compete for influence in the West as a U.S. bid to ​take control of Greenland threatens to reshape the power dynamics of a ‌decades-old transatlantic security alliance.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from Denmark has rattled ‌NATO members and prompted a rethink of Europe's traditional security dependence on the United States.\n\nAsked if Beijing welcomed the \"chaos\" over Greenland, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry, told a regular news briefing, \"We have no intention of competing for influence with ⁠any country, nor would we ‌ever do so.\"\n\nTrump has also threatened to rain trade tariffs on Europe if it resists his demand to acquire the Arctic ‍island.\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, cautioned that transatlantic tariffs would play into the hands of China and Russia, both of which would benefit from \"divisions among allies\".\n\n\"We engage in friendly ​exchanges with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and equality, ‌and remain committed to being a positive, stabilising and constructive force,\" Guo said.\n\nYet Chinese state media did not hold back comments this week, urging Europe to reassess its dependence on the United States for security.\n\nEurope has grown excessively dependent on the United States while sidelining cooperation with partners such as China and Russia, the Global ⁠Times tabloid backed by the ruling Communist Party ​said in an editorial.\n\n\"The situation underscores the necessity ​for Europe to review the nature of transatlantic relations and reduce its reliance on the United States as a pillar of support for ‍its security,\" an ⁠editorial in the state-run China Daily added.\n\nThe Greenland crisis is a call for Europe to bolster strategic autonomy and diversify partnerships, it said.\n\n\"By doing so, Europe ⁠can ensure that its future is not dictated by the diktats of a bully, but is instead ‌shaped by its collective interests.\"",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico sent 37 cartel members to the United States at the request of the U.S. Justice Department, with President Claudia Sheinbaum saying Wednesday that it was a “sovereign decision” by her government.\n\nSheinbaum responded to criticism from analysts and opponents who said that the transfers on Tuesday were the result of mounting pressure from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action on cartels.\n\nSheinbaum said that although the transfers were made at the request of the U.S. government, the decision was taken by the National Security Council after analyzing what was “convenient for Mexico” and in terms of its “national security.”\n\n“Mexico is put first above all else, even if they ask for whatever they have to ask for. It is a sovereign decision,” she said at her regular morning news briefing.\n\nSheinbaum, who has been praised for her level-headed management of relations with Trump, has been forced to walk a fine line between making concessions to the Trump administration and projecting strength both domestically and internationally.\n\nObservers say that the Mexican government has used the transfers as a sort of pressure valve to offset demands by Trump and show authorities are cracking down on criminal groups. Tension has only mounted since the U.S. carried out a military operation in Venezuela to capture then President Nicolás Maduro to face charges in the United States in an extraordinary use of force that set leaders across Latin America on edge.\n\nThose sent to the U.S. on Tuesday were alleged members of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, known by its Spanish acronym CJNG, and the Sinaloa Cartel, which Washington has designated as terrorist organizations, and a number of other groups. It’s the third such transfer of capos over the past year. Mexico’s government said it has sent 92 people in total to the U.S. in total.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday said that the transfer was a “landmark achievement in the Trump administration’s mission to destroy the cartels.”\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said that the move was an “important step” by Mexico's government and that collaboration was in both countries' shared interest.\n\n“These 37 cartel members — including terrorists from the Sinaloa Cartel, CJNG, and others – will now pay for their crimes against the American people on American soil,” Bondi said in a statement with other U.S. Justice Department officials.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had already indicted at least one of the people transferred, Armando Gómez Núñez, who was accused of being a senior leader of CJNG. He is charged with drug offenses and the possession of weapons like machine guns and “explosive devices.”\n\nIn August, Mexico's security minister acknowledged that some of the cartel leaders sent to the United States at that time were continuing criminal operations from prison and that their transfer was agreed upon because there was a risk they could be released because of judicial rulings.\n\nMatthew Lee contributed to this report from Washington.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "Forecasters say it could be one of the most significant winter events this season.",
    "fullText": "A major winter storm is forecast to bring heavy snow, sleet, freezing rain and frigid temperatures from Texas to Massachusetts through the weekend, according to meteorologists. It’s expected to affect more than 180 million Americans and could become one of the most significant storms of this winter season.\n\nMajor metro areas in the storm’s path include Dallas, Austin, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, forecasters say.\n\nImpacts from the snow and ice could cause power outages, widespread travel shutdowns and school closures. Following the storm, frigid temperatures will prolong the impacts of the snow and ice. “Potentially hundreds of thousands of people may go without electricity and heat for days,” AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter said.\n\nWinter storm watches have been issued for at least 70 million people from New Mexico to North Carolina and as far south as Texas, according to the National Weather Service. The agency advises people to “start preparations now for an impactful and prolonged winter storm.”\n\n“Expect heavy snow for the Southern Rockies and the south-central Plains eastward through the mid-Atlantic,” the weather service said. “Snow-covered roads and low visibility will cause widespread travel disruptions.”\n\nIn the Central Plains, 6 to 12 inches are forecast, with over 2 feet possible in parts of the Appalachians. Snow totals in the Northeast will depend on the storm's exact track, but a significant and plowable amount is possible, meteorologists say.\n\n“Broad swaths of freezing rain and sleet are expected south of the all-snow zone over the Southern Plains, Mid-South and Carolinas,” the NWS said. “Treacherous travel conditions, prolonged power outages and tree damage are likely.”\n\nIn the South, a thick glaze of ice will sweep across Texas to the Carolinas, which will weigh down trees and power lines.\n\nThe Plains will be impacted by snow, sleet and freezing rain by late morning or early afternoon, according to the Weather Channel. This includes parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and northern and western Texas and could extend as far east as western Tennessee and northern Mississippi.\n\nSnow, sleet and freezing rain could dip farther south in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi while the storm heads toward the Northeast, affecting Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and parts of the Carolinas.\n\nMore than 4,000 flight cancellations are to be expected nationwide this weekend due to the heavy snow and ice buildup, according to AccuWeather. School closures are also likely across multiple states as the storm lingers in some areas.",

    "description": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.",
    "fullText": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.\n\nTrump spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday after he spent weeks demanding that Denmark hand over Greenland. The president cited “national security” reasons even though a 1951 treaty allows the U.S. to expand its military presence on the island, where it already maintains a base.\n\nIn his address, Trump said he wants “right, title, and ownership” of the territory. Afterward, the president announced he and European leaders had arrived at a “framework” and a “concept of a deal” regarding Greenland. He gave no specifics, but conservative commentators hailed the mystery agreement as the stuff of a modern-day Metternich.\n\nOn Wednesday’s AC360, Haberman said signs indicate that the deal in question is “something that is already in existence.”\n\n“So, Maggie, is it clear to you what, if anything, President Trump is getting from Denmark in Greenland that the U.S. doesn’t already have de facto control over?” Anderson Cooper asked.\n\n“No. And look, Anderson, we don’t know the answers to these questions,” Haberman replied. “There’s a lot left unsaid. The president didn’t answer this.”\n\nHaberman went on to say that based on what little information has been provided about the “framework,” it appears to be a reflection of the preexisting arrangement among the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland.\n\n“As of now, based on what they’re talking about, it looks as if they’re talking about something that is already in existence,” she continued. “And in fact, the U.S. used to have a greater military presence in Greenland. It got scaled back after the Cold War.”\n\nShe noted that in his Davos speech, Trump maligned NATO and questioned if it would ever come to the defense of the U.S. In fact, the only time NATO’s collective defense provision was invoked was on behalf of the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n“Article 5 [of the NATO treaty] was invoked once, and it was after 9/11,” Haberman said. “And someone who is from New York, it’s surprising that they don’t recall that. And so, he is speaking about this completely in transactional terms. And you can see that this is not over. I understand that [NATO Secretary-General] Mark Rutte is trying to calm things down, but European leaders are still very alarmed. And leaders in Denmark have been very alarmed for weeks and weeks now before this really became much more public.”\n\nThe post Maggie Haberman Says Trump’s Greenland ‘Deal’ Appears To Be ‘Something That Is Already in Existence’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A woman has been found guilty of keeping another woman with learning difficulties captive for 25 years and using her as a slave.\n\nMother-of-10 Mandy Wixon made the vulnerable woman clean her squalid and overcrowded home in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and forced her to live off scraps.\n\nWashing-up liquid would be squirted down the victim's throat, bleach splashed on her face, and she had her head repeatedly shaved against her will.\n\nAt Gloucester Crown Court, Judge Ian Lawrie said there was a \"Dickensian quality\" to the case as Wixon was found guilty of false imprisonment, requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\n\nThe BBC has only now been able to report details of the case due to reporting restrictions.\n\nThe court heard that the woman - who the BBC is calling K - was born into a troubled family and, when she was about 16 in 1996, was given to Wixon, who had a loose connection to her family.\n\nNow in her 40s, K was found by police on 15 March 2021 after one of Wixon's sons raised concerns for her welfare.\n\nThe court heard K was regularly beaten and also hit with a broom handle, knocking out her teeth.\n\nHer food was limited by Wixon and she could not leave the house and was forced to secretly wash at night.\n\nOfficers described K's bedroom as looking like a \"prison cell\", with other bedrooms also untidy and dirty.\n\nAt times, there were at least 13 people living in the house.\n\nLike many in the home, K had lost many of her teeth due to poor dental hygiene.\n\nWhen she was discovered by police, she had scarring to her lips and face from being splashed with bleach, and large calluses on her feet and ankles from being constantly on her hands and knees cleaning floors.\n\nK told officers: \"I don't want to be here. I don't feel safe. Mandy hits me all the time. I don't like it.\"\n\nDoctors found the victim was malnourished, while a dentist noted she would have been in agony for years due to untreated infections and abscesses.\n\nDet Sgt Alex Pockett said: \"When the police arrived, the victim had her head held down, it was clear she was extremely scared.\"\n\nSam Jones, prosecuting, told the jury: \"By the late 1990s it appears the woman disappeared into a black hole. Not a single meeting that left a record or a single sighting of her outside the house.\"\n\nSince being rescued, K is now living with a foster family, attending college and has been on holidays abroad.\n\nWixon was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on 12 March.\n\nAs she left court she was asked what she had to say to her victim and replied: \"Not a lot.\"\n\nAsked if she was sorry, she said: \"No. I never done it.\"\n\nReporters asked if she was a \"monster\", as she stopped to light a cigarette, and she replied: \"Say what you think.\"\n\nSince being rescued, K is now living with a foster family, attending college and has been on holidays abroad.\n\nDet Con Emma Jackson from Gloucestershire Police said she was \"flourishing\" and living a healthy life.\n\nLaura Burgess, a senior prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, added: \"The progress she has made since being removed from this oppressive environment is a testament to her strength.\n\n\"Our thoughts remain with her as she continues to rebuild her life, and I hope she can find some comfort in seeing justice delivered today.\"\n\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

That revelation from owner Creston Thornton — made on his Facebook page — is the result of an expansion to Meridian.\n\nThe Revolution Concert House is moving — to a new, modern facility at 1170 S. Silverstone Way in Eagle View Landing, city documents show. It will be near Topgolf and three hotels, and have access to over 1,000 shared parking spaces, Thornton wrote on social media.\n\nThe original Revolution venue, 4983 N. Glenwood St., will remain open “while we build the next generation and final home for the Revolution Center,” Thornton posted. Construction has not begun on the Meridian project known as Revolution 2.0.\n\nThornton, a longtime Eagle resident who co-founded The Big Easy in 2000 — now called the Knitting Factory Concert House in downtown Boise — is the president of promoter Live Nation’s mountain region.\n\nLike Garden City’s Revolution Concert House, the new Meridian venue will have a capacity of 2,200: 1,900 in the main concert area downstairs, Thornton wrote, and 300 upstairs in a VIP area with reserved seats on three levels.\n\nThere also will be a 120-capacity “Box Office bar” open daily and for smaller shows, he added.\n\nHiring for the new Revolution Concert House is expected to begin in the third quarter of this year, according to Thornton.",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — In two decades of kicking in doors for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Joseph Bongiovanni often took on the risks of being the “lead breacher,\" meaning he was the first person into the room.\n\nOn Wednesday, he felt a familiar uncertainty awaiting sentencing for using his DEA badge to protect childhood friends who became prolific drug traffickers in Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I never knew what was on the other side of that door — that fear is what I feel today,” Bongiovanni, 61, told a federal judge, pounding the defense table as his face reddened with emotion. “I've always been innocent. I loved that job.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo sentenced the disgraced lawman to five years in federal prison on a string of corruption counts. The punishment was significantly less than the 15 years prosecutors sought even after a jury acquitted Bongiovanni of the most serious charges he faced, including an allegation he pocketed $250,000 in bribes from the Mafia.\n\nThe judge said the sentence reflected the complexity of the mixed verdicts following two lengthy trials and the almost Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of Bongiovanni's career, in which the lawman racked up enough front-page accolades to fill a trophy case.\n\nBongiovanni once hurtled into a burning apartment building to evacuate residents through billowing smoke. He locked up drug dealers, including the first ever prosecuted in the region for causing a fatal overdose.\n\n“There are two completely polar opposite versions of the facts and polar opposite versions of the defendant,” Vilardo said, assuring prosecutors five years behind bars would pose a considerable hardship to someone who has never been to prison.\n\nDefense attorney Parker MacKay noted the judge had acknowledged Bongiovanni as a “beacon” of the Buffalo community. The government's request for a 15-year sentence, he added, was “completely unmoored to the nature of the convictions.”\n\n“As Mr. Bongiovanni told the judge at sentencing, he is innocent, and we look forward to continuing to work with him to prove that,” MacKay told The Associated Press.\n\nA jury in 2024 convicted Bongiovanni of four counts of obstruction of justice, counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's “little dark secret” caused immeasurable damage over 11 years. They likened him to Jose Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent serving a 12-year federal sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels.\n\nBongiovanni upheld an oath not to the DEA, they argued, but to organized crime figures in the tight-knit Italian American community of his North Buffalo upbringing. During sentencing, Bongiovanni’s family dissolved into tears on the front row of the packed courtroom in downtown Buffalo.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's corruption involved as much inaction as calculated coverup. They pointed to a turning point in 2008 when Bongiovanni could have acted on intelligence about traffickers he knew whose operation would evolve into a large-scale organization with links to California, Vancouver, and New York City.\n\nHe also was accused of authoring bogus DEA reports, stealing sensitive files, throwing off colleagues, outing confidential informants, covering for a sex-trafficking strip club and helping a high school English teacher keep his marijuana-growing side hustle. Prosecutors said he brazenly urged colleagues to spend less time investigating Italians and focus instead on Black and Hispanic people.\n\n“His conduct shook the foundation of law enforcement — and this community — to its core,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi told the judge. “That's what a betrayal is.”\n\nThe ex-agent's downfall came amid a sex-trafficking prosecution that took sensational turns, including an implicated judge who killed himself after the FBI raided his home, law enforcement dragging a pond in search of an overdose victim and dead rats planted outside the home of a government witness who prosecutors allege was later killed by a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\nIt also involved the Pharoah’s Gentlemen’s Club outside Buffalo. Bongiovanni was childhood friends with the strip club’s owner, Peter Gerace Jr., who authorities say has close ties to both the Buffalo Mafia and the violent Outlaws Motorcycle Club. A separate jury convicted Gerace of a sex trafficking conspiracy and of paying bribes to Bongiovanni.\n\nThe prosecution also cast a harsh light on the DEA after a string of corruption scandals prompted at least 17 agents brought up on federal charges over the past decade. Last month, prosecutors charged another former agent with conspiring to launder millions of dollars and obtain military-grade firearms and explosives for a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nFrank Tarentino, the DEA’s northeast associate chief of operations, said Bongiovanni’s sentence “sends a powerful message that those who betray their badge will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”",

    "fullText": "Atlético Madrid’s horrid away form continued Wednesday, as the Rojiblancos now have won just one of their last five away matches in the Champions League. Atlético squandered a golden opportunity to all but secure a top eight-position in the final Champions League table. “Squandered” may actually be an understatement based on what I witnessed. If you can think of more extreme adjectives to describe the performance, feel free to drop them in the comments.\n\nAtletii looked far and away the better side for the first hour of the match. Giuliano Simeone was rewarded for his relentless energy and effort with a lovely headed goal, Marc Pubill kept Victor Osimhen firmly in his pocket, even while playing on a yellow card for most of the match, and the midfield played with cohesion and confidence. Los Colchoneros were unfortunate to concede an own goal that deflected in off Marcos Llorente. The Spaniard ultimately redeemed himself, however, clearing away a wide open chance for the Turkish club in the dying moments that would have seen Atleti return to Madrid empty handed.\n\nLet’s dive into some takeaways.\n\nYou could make the argument that Atleti’s chances of finding a winning goal ended the moment Robin Le Normand replaced Pablo Barrios. Over the course of the 2025 26 season, it has become abundantly clear that Barrios is Atlético Madrid’s most important player, and the match changed entirely once he left the pitch.\n\nThe decision to remove Alexander Sørloth for the final 30 minutes while continuing to send long crosses toward the 5’9” pairing of Antoine Griezmann and Álex Baena was head scratching, to say the least. With Julián Alvarez enduring a slump in form, Atléti are unfortunately reliant on Sørloth to consistently generate goal scoring chances.\n\nAnd with Alvarez, it is becoming glaringly obvious that he is not anywhere close to the level he showed last season. However, substituting him for a still-recovering Nico González is simply not a sound tactical decision. Alvarez has been poor, but he remains Atlético Madrid’s best attacking option. In a situation where a goal is needed, you have to live and die with La Araña.\n\nWhen you’ve built your attacking system around a very limited #9 your problems run very deep. https://t.co/lJ2AiOZmHT\n\n— Into the Calderón (@intothecalderon) January 21, 2026\n\nBetween the poor form of Baena and Alvarez, the growing dependence on Sørloth, Thiago Almada failing to become the signing many had hoped for and prime Griezmann feeling like a distant memory, Atlético Madrid have a serious problem in attack.\n\nToday’s match saw Baena and Almada turn in uninspired 45-minute halves. The former has struggled to find his place in the team over the past several months, while the latter continues to be linked with a move away from the club.\n\nWith Baena, the quality is clearly there, and it is hard to believe that two unfortunate injuries earlier in the year suddenly stripped him of it. Prior to donning the red and white stripes, Baena ranked among the league leaders in chance creation. Simeone simply cannot seem to unlock that same style of play for him. The flashes are there, but time is starting to run out and Atleti need answers.\n\nAlmada possesses excellent skill on the ball, but the fundamentals are lacking. The signing did not make much sense at the time and was met with mixed reviews from supporters, despite the player’s obvious talent. Personally, I do not see a clear path forward for the Argentina international.\n\nOn the topic of Argentines, Julián Alvarez has extended his goalless games streak to seven. We’ve talked about this countless times on this website. The world is starting to take notice. What can be done to pull Julián out of this slump?\n\nMy admittedly-novice take is that Simeone appears to be deploying Alvarez in more of a 10 role rather than the 9 position where La Araña is most comfortable. The intent seems to be for Alvarez to replicate the late 2010s Antoine Griezmann role, when the Frenchman was competing for Ballon d’Or honors and Atlétic0 were challenging for LaLiga and Champions League trophies. Perhaps a tactical adjustment could see Baena drop into the 10 role, a position in which he truly excels. Simeone needs to explore every option.\n\nI laugh as I type this, but Alexander Sørloth has become Atlético Madrid’s primary attacking option, and the club has grown far too dependent on the Norwegian, particularly during Alvarez’s slump. In the first five matches of 2026, Atléti have scored just five goals. Who has accounted for four of them? You guessed it.\n\nBarring a masterful Griezmann free kick against Deportivo La Coruña, that tally very easily could have been four goals in four matches and an elimination from the Copa del Rey. Sørloth is a fine player who has shown his quality, but he cannot be the main option if Atlético Madrid expect to compete for trophies.\n\nLos Colchoneros currently sit 12th with 13 points in the Champions League table. A win against Galatasaray would have seen them climb into the top five. The top eight is far from guaranteed at this stage, even with a victory against Bodø/Glimt.\n\nWhat are the scenarios in which Atlético qualify for the top 8? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nFirst, Atlético Madrid need to win their match against Bodø/Glimt to reach 16 points.\n\nA win by multiple goals is a necessity, as Atlético have just a plus-3 goal difference after seven matchdays.\n\nFour teams from the group PSG, Newcastle, Chelsea, Barcelona, Sporting and Manchester City will need to lose or draw. PSG face Newcastle, which guarantees at least one drop, possibly two if they draw.\n\nChelsea clash with Napoli, Barcelona face Copenhagen, Sporting take on Athletic Club and Manchester City play Galatasaray.\n\nNapoli, Copenhagen, Athletic, and Galatasaray all have Champions League play-off qualifying positions to fight for.\n\nAre Atlético out of contention for the top 8 in the Champions League? Absolutely not. Is it going to be easy? Absolutely not. Is anything with this team ever easy? Absolutely not.\n\nNext up for Atlético Madrid is an early afternoon Sunday kickoff at home against Mallorca, who are battling relegation.",

    "description": "Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate was predicted to be drafted into a good situation in NFL, per ESPN's Mel Kiper.",
    "fullText": "Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate shouldn't have to wait long to hear his name on draft night.\n\nTate recorded 51 catches for 875 yards and nine touchdowns on the Buckeyes, helping the program make it to the College Football Playoff quarterfinal.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper is projecting Tate to be a top-five draft pick. Most players drafted that early go to teams with bad situations.\n\nHowever, Tate might have luck in store for him in his rookie season.\n\nKiper thinks the New York Giants will take Tate with the No. 5 pick. Tate would be an intriguing addition to an offense that already boasts a star receiver in Malik Nabers, and those two could cause matchup nightmares for opposing defenses.\n\n\"The Giants have a lot of needs, but similar to Tennessee, they have a second-year quarterback looking for help,\" Kiper wrote. \"Yes, wide receiver Malik Nabers (knee) and running back Cam Skattebo (ankle/leg) will be back on the field, but wideout Wan'Dale Robinson is a free agent, and Nabers can't be the target on all of Jaxson Dart's throws.\n\n\"Taking a first-round wide receiver wouldn't be new to recently hired coach John Harbaugh; in Baltimore, he used four Day 1 picks starting in 2015 on the position (Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman, Hollywood Brown and Breshad Perriman).\"\n\nThe Giants went all-in for former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. With Tate, New York's offense could be a threat to go along with a defense that should improve in 2026 under Harbaugh.\n\nHarbaugh took the job with the Giants in part because he believes Dart can be an elite passer in the league.\n\n\"It starts with the quarterback for sure,\" Harbaugh said, via the Giants' website. \"You build your team around your quarterback. You build your team around your players and what they do well. I like the way (Dart) plays.\n\n\"I like his talent, skill set, all the things he's accomplished, but more than that, I like who he is and what he's about. To me, he's about football. This young guy loves football. He wants to talk football all the time and that's kind of what I like doing too.\"\n\nTate would certainly help accelerate Dart's development.\n\nIf Tate goes at No. 5, he'd join Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka as former Buckeyes to go in the first round.\n\nThose players are making big impacts on their respective teams.",

    "description": "Titans opt for another candidate, keeping Nagy in Kansas City amidst offensive struggles and potential Mahomes absence.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs won’t need to go looking for another offensive coordinator, at least for now, as current OC Matt Nagy lost out to Robert Salah to become the next head coach of the Tennessee Titans on Tuesday.\n\nNagy interviewed with the Titans over a week ago, causing many rumors of a departure to Tennessee that’d force the Chiefs to find a new OC in 2026. Perhaps that wouldn’t be the worst outcome for Kansas City, however, as the last couple of seasons haven’t been great in Kansas City on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nWe've completed in-person interviews with the following candidates. pic.twitter.com/Mctvgl2U5K\n\n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) January 20, 2026\n\nThere was no sign of the same dominant offense in Kansas City this past season. The Chiefs finished the season with 320.6 yards per game, only enough for 20th in the NFL. It’s only the second time the Chiefs haven't finished with at least 350 yards per game since Mahomes took over at QB.\n\nIt becomes even more alarming with the fact that the other season under 350 yards per game was in 2024, meaning the offense hasn’t been great in Kansas City for two consecutive seasons now. There’s no denying that the Chiefs, despite their dominance in the early 2020s, no longer instill the same fear into opponents from the offensive side of the ball.\n\nIt’s unfair to say the offensive troubles last season were entirely the fault of Nagy, however. In 2025, injuries and suspensions played a big role in the Chiefs’ failures. It’s why Nagy has garnered a lot of interest this offseason as a name to fill the head coaching vacancies around the league.\n\nNagy has been with the Chiefs for several years, first starting with the team back in 2013. After his stint as the head coach for the Bears, Nagy immediately returned to Kansas City, playing a role in its last three Super Bowl appearances.\n\nIt looks like he’ll be returning once again in 2026 despite the interest from the Titans, who ultimately chose Salejh, the defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. With Mahomes likely out for at least a portion of the 2026 season and several other question marks surrounding the offense, Nagy will certainly have his hands full come fall. In an offseason where there are looking to be several huge changes to the team, the Chiefs being able to keep Nagy will come as a breath of fresh air for the front office.",

Yes, it's absolutely, absolutely the goal,\" the Briton said after avoiding the question from host Greg James. \"Certainly, winning one gives you a lot more confidence. It's different for everyone, right? You've got to find your own way of doing things, and you have people with more confidence, people with less.\n\n\"I've never been the one to have the most confidence in myself. I certainly have more of it now, that's for sure. I've always been a seeing-is-believing kind of guy, but that's even for myself. So I've always had to see myself on the top step, see myself winning to finally believe that I can do it. But certainly last year, I managed to realise that before I achieved it.\n\n\"Already halfway through the season, I felt like I had everything I needed. The people around me, the team, the car, and my own ability to go out and win the championship.

After previously noting his Heisman Trophy win, Mendoza updated his page again to reflect being named the 2025 College Football National Championship MVP.\n\nIt was a fittingly unconventional move for a quarterback known as much for his process-driven approach. Mendoza has said he deleted most social media apps during the season, keeping only YouTube and LinkedIn. He has described the professional networking platform as a “positive place,” one where he prefers to share milestones rather than scroll.\n\nOn Monday night, Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to the first national championship in program history, capping a perfect season. He completed 16 of 27 passes for 186 yards and repeatedly extended drives on critical fourth downs.\n\nNone bigger than his 12-yard touchdown run on fourth and 5 in the fourth quarter. It was a play that sealed Indiana’s victory over the Miami and became an instant highlight of the CFP era.\n\nTwo days later, Mendoza explained the moment in a LinkedIn post that blended sincerity with humor.

    "description": "LSU football extended an offer to the son of a program legend this week. The LaFell legacy could continue on in purple and gold.",
    "fullText": "LSU football extended a scholarship offer to BJ LaFell, the son of LSU legend Brandon LaFell, on Wednesday.\n\nThe younger LaFell is a part of the 2029 recruiting class, coming off an impressive do-it-all freshman campaign at Shadow Creek High School. According to MaxPreps, he attempted nine passes in the 2025 season, completing five for 72 yards. He also saw 10 carries, rushing for 151 yards and four touchdowns. Lastly, LaFell did a fair amount of work as a receiver, with four catches for 82 yards and a touchdown.\n\nLSU isn’t the only SEC team racing to build a relationship with the young talent, as Ole Miss and Missouri have already extended him offers. It’s a surprise that the Tigers weren’t first in line, though, given the talent his father was during his time in Baton Rouge.\n\nAlthough LSU football has long been known as “Wide Receiver University,” with names such as Malik Nabers, Justin Jefferson, Ja’Marr Chase, Odell Beckham Jr., and Jarvis Landry in recent history, LaFell was one of the school’s first elite receivers. He’s one of the most productive pass-catchers in program history, ranking fourth all-time in receptions (175), sixth in receiving yards (2,517), and second in receiving touchdowns (25).\n\nAfter his four seasons as a Tiger, LaFell carved out a nine-year NFL career, recording 406 catches, 5,398 receiving yards and 31 touchdowns during his time as a pro.\n\nLaFell’s impressive playing career certainly sets a high bar for his son, but Tiger fans should hope that BJ is up to the challenge of trying to exceed the expectations that come with his last name -- and if so, that he plans to do so in Baton Rouge.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football offers scholarship to son of program legend",

    "title": "After 4 NFC title game losses with Packers, Davante Adams resumes chase of 'mythical thing' for Rams",
    "description": "Davante Adams reached the NFC championship game four times during his eight seasons with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.  Every time, Green Bay came up just short of the Super Bowl — and Adams still feels the pain.  “It just feels almost like a mythical thing to me at this point,” Adams said Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Davante Adams reached the NFC championship game four times during his eight seasons with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.\n\nEvery time, Green Bay came up just short of the Super Bowl — and Adams still feels the pain.\n\n“It just feels almost like a mythical thing to me at this point,” Adams said Wednesday. “You do everything you can to get there, and it’s been so hard. Been working so hard at it.”\n\nAfter an ensuing three years spent nowhere near a Super Bowl, Adams is back for his fifth shot when his Los Angeles Rams (14-5) visit the Seattle Seahawks (16-3) on Sunday for another NFC title game.\n\nThe 33-year-old Adams is still going strong as the league leader in touchdown receptions and a key component of the NFL's top offense. But when the decorated receiver says he craves that final, ultimate team success far more than individual accolades, it's clear he's among the rare athletes who absolutely mean it.\n\n“Forgive me if I’m not smiling ear-to-ear after the first win or the second (playoff) win, having been here so many times and understanding what it takes to get where we’re ultimately trying to go,” Adams said. “We’re close, and we’ve just got to finish it off.”\n\nAlthough Adams has been waiting the longest, he's far from the only Rams player who will be playing for a chance at a Super Bowl debut when they face the top-seeded Seahawks for the third time this season.\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a championship four seasons ago, but only a handful of players are left from that team — just two on defense.\n\nMatthew Stafford, tight end Tyler Higbee and cornerback Darious Williams are the only players left who made major contributions to that Super Bowl title run and also played extensively for the current team. Williams left and returned to the Rams, as did linebacker Troy Reeder and center Coleman Shelton.\n\nReeder now plays mostly special teams, while Shelton and starting left tackle Alaric Jackson were backups in 2021. Receiver Tutu Atwell was injured as a rookie and right tackle Rob Havenstein is injured now.\n\nBut nobody has been waiting longer than Adams for his first shot at a championship ring. He is one of the most consistent receivers of his generation, posting eight seasons with at least 997 yards while moving up to 26th in NFL history with 12,633 yards.\n\nHe almost certainly would have recorded another 1,000-yard season with Los Angeles, but Adams injured his hamstring in December. The Rams fell out of the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC during his three-game absence to close the regular season, most notably blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in Seattle.\n\nAdams has been vocal about the rejuvenating effect of working with Stafford and McVay, but he also knows his career is closer to its end than its beginning. After struggling along with his entire offense during an OT victory last week at Chicago, he's hoping to play a major role in what's likely to be a career-defining game in Seattle.\n\n“I started off with a great experience with the Packers and didn’t have anything else to compare it to, so you kind of, in a sense, take it for granted,” Adams said. \"I don’t think I was taking it for granted, but you go to a situation where you struggle a little bit \n\n“Being back in a position where you’re with a great team and a great situation, you definitely have a greater appreciation for times like this, for sure.”\n\nNOTES: The Rams only held a walkthrough practice at their training complex. ... LB Byron Young (knee soreness) wouldn't have practiced if the Rams had a full workout, McVay said. But Young, the Rams' sacks leader, is still expected to play Sunday. ... S Quentin Lake stayed home with an illness.",

    "fullText": "Liam Delap toiled up front for most of last night’s game against Pafos, again coming off without having found the net.\n\nAfter the game, his manager Liam Rosenior had to field questions about the striker. He’s been a big backer of the youngster in his early days as coach, but the pressure is on after the summer signing drew another blank.\n\nWhen asked if the striker was low on confidence, Rosenior denied that as an issue:\n\n“I wouldn’t say so. Liam’s an outstanding player,” the manager said after the game.\n\n“It’s very difficult for a centre-forward to find spaces when a team defends as deep as Pafos did. I think Liam prefers open spaces to run into and use his speed and his pace. But no, he did a lot of really good things today with and without the ball. I wouldn’t say he’s lacking confidence at all.”\n\nChelsea’s team to fact Pafos, fairly generic group. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWe’d largely agree with that – there have been times when we’ve seen the striker lacking belief, but recently we’ve seen him looking better, just not getting the service he needs. The way the team plays just doesn’t seem to suit anyone who plays up top. The issues of Enzo Maresca’s game style have continued here.\n\nDelap seems trusted ahead of Joao Pedro as the first choice 9, which is giving him more confidence. If he can score against Crystal Palace this weekend, we could see him finally break out.\n\nMoises Caicedo was the hero once again for Chelsea, scoring a crucial header to win the Blues the game and put them back into the Champions League top 8.\n\nLiam Rosenior has continued to use Malo Gusto inverted as a number ten in this game – something fans don’t love. We’re with them on that one.",

    "title": "Israel Adesanya bemoans 'bland' state of UFC middleweight division: 'It just doesn’t feel the same'",
    "description": "The two-time champ hopes to re-inject some excitement into the landscape at UFC Seattle.",
    "fullText": "Israel Adesanya isn’t chasing ghosts anymore. Not belts, not validation, not the version of himself that once ruled the UFC middleweight division with theatrical dominance and cultural gravity.\n\nAt this stage of his career, the former two-time UFC middleweight champion speaks like a man who has already climbed the mountain twice, seen the view from the top, and now understands the terrain in ways few ever will. The hunger still exists. The artistry still matters. But any entitlement is gone. So is the illusion, which, from his vantage point, clears up a less-than-stellar 185-pound landscape.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday's edition of \"The Ariel Helwani Show,\" Adesanya assessed his division at present.\n\n\"I [was champion] twice. It can happen again. I'm still me,\" Adesanya told Uncrowned. \"The middleweight division right now is not really the same as when I was in the game. I know they like me as champion, but it's not really my main focus. When it comes, it comes.\n\n\"What was the last exciting thing at middleweight? Where people were talking about it. It's good to have Khamzat [Chimaev] as champion — that was the last exciting thing. Since then, there's not really been anything that feels [interesting].\n\n\"It just doesn’t feel the same as when I was in the game,\" Adesanya added. \"I gave people someone to love, I gave some people someone to hate — I gave people something to feel, whether they loved me or hated me. But right now it just feels bland. Other divisions are way more exciting.”\n\nAdesanya’s critique isn’t rooted in bitterness; it’s more observational, almost clinical. He understands the business, the cycles of star power and the vacuum that forms when a division loses its gravitational pull. During his reigns, middleweight wasn’t just competitive — it was emotional. Rivalries carried narratives. Fights carried consequences. The division moved because Adesanya moved it.\n\nNow, he returns not as a savior or new superstar atop the weight class, but as a dangerous variable dropped back into the ecosystem of 185 pounds.\n\nThat variable meets Joe Pyfer in UFC Seattle's main event on March 28 — a matchup that feels intentionally volatile. Pyfer brings raw physicality, a knockout threat and the hunger of a rising contender looking to make his name. Adesanya recognizes exactly what the assignment represents.\n\n“It is just what I need to come back to — a dangerous opponent that they’re trying to feed me to,\" Adesanya said.\n\n\"This is a game. This is what happens. I’ve watched this game for years. I just know how they try and succeed, they try and fail, but this is just how the nature of the beast is.”\n\nAdesanya, 36, has been the hunter, the champion, the hunted, the measuring stick, and now — perhaps most intriguingly — the litmus test for the next wave. He doesn’t resist that role. He understands it.\n\nMore than anything, his perspective reflects a fighter who has shed the pressure of legacy-building and replaced it with presence. Time away has recalibrated him.\n\n\"I'm tainted because I've seen the game from the inside now, so I don't have the rose-colored glasses, obviously, but I love the pure art. The pureness of fighting,\" Adesanya said. \"This is one thing; I've taken a lot of time off. This is the biggest hiatus of my career.\n\n\"The end is always around the corner. F***, we could all go outside and get run over by a f***ing bus. The end's always around the corner, so I just try and live in the moment and take each moment as it comes. Enjoy the moment, really soak it in. I can do that now. There's no pressure to worry about other people. I just worry about myself.\"\n\nThat freedom — mental, emotional, competitive — may lead to the most unpredictable version of Adesanya yet. No chasing. No proving. No forced urgency. Just clarity.\n\n\"I feel freer than I ever have,\" Adesanya said. \"I know the game — I can’t be mad at the game, and you can’t be jaded. I’m just tainted, but I’m also blessed that I got to see the game from the inside, and I got to see it at the very top. The tippy, tippy, tippy top. I'm still right there, but I understand how the game is played, so I play accordingly, and I play it very well. This is just a new level that I haven't hit yet. So, just play my part.\"\n\nWhether that part leads back to gold or simply to moments worth savoring, Adesanya has already shaped an era. Now he’s navigating the next chapter with open eyes and a rare sense of peace. He'll step into Seattle not to reclaim the throne, but to remind the division that the artist is still very much alive.",

Even though I wasn’t able to return to play due to my knee injury, I’m incredibly thankful for the unwavering support from the club throughout this whole process the past two years. While this chapter is coming to an end, the people and experiences will stay with me forever. And I can’t wait to see all of the accomplishments this team achieves this year.”\n\nWright was the 13th overall selection in the 2021 NWSL Draft from Texas Tech University.\n\nDue to a knee injury suffered in the 2024 preseason, Wright has not been able to play in the past two seasons.\n\n“It’s devastating that KD has to step away from the sport like this. She had great talent and we hoped she would have a much longer career in Louisville,” Racing general manager Caitlyn Flores Milby said. “That said, we’re so happy that she’s taking this next step in her journey. She is a fantastic person and a wonderful mother and we’re proud to say she will always be a member of the Racing family.”\n\nOverall, Wright earned 39 NWSL appearances (25 starts) for Racing. She scored six goals and recorded two assists.\n\nWright gave birth to her first child in October 2025.\n\n“KD has given so much to this club over the years and has worked tirelessly to come back. She’s been an incredibly positive presence within our environment for a long time,” Racing head coach Bev Yanez said. “While we’re sad to see her step away from the game, we know she leaves at peace, having given everything she had. We’re so grateful to have been part of her journey and wish her nothing but the very best always. She’s an amazing person and truly deserves it all.”",

    "title": "Bo Bichette explains why Mets were ‘obvious’ choice in free agency",
    "description": "Bo Bichette was introduced by the Mets at Citi Field on Wednesday after signing with New York in free agency.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK — The image of the Dodgers pouring out onto the field at Rogers Centre, celebrating a victory over the Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series last fall, will be ingrained in Bo Bichette’s mind forever.\n\nHe still hasn’t gotten over the end of that game — and the Blue Jays’ remarkable playoff run — in the months since.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bichette was in a new jersey, introduced to his new team, in a new city. And, in some ways, he was able to relieve that pain from November.\n\nHe firmly believes that his new team, the Mets, will give him an opportunity to get back to that stage again, as early as this year, with a real chance to finish the job this time around.\n\nThat, Bichette said, was part of what tipped the scales in his negotiations with multiple teams in free agency. It’s what made it “very obvious” that he wanted to be a Met.\n\n“My first priority is winning,” Bichette said, donning his No. 19 Mets jersey for the first time. “This organization is doing everything they can to do that.”\n\nBo Bichette was asked today how long it took for him to get over Game 7 of the World Series with the Blue Jays:\n\n\"I don't know if I have yet. This is probably helping. But yeah, to be that close, you never know when you're gonna get that opportunity again, but I think this team…\n\n— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) January 21, 2026\n\nBichette signed a three-year deal with the Mets last week, a $126 million pact that contains opt-outs after both his first and second seasons. It was reported that Bichette was close to a seven year, $200 million deal with the rival Phillies, but he chose the Mets hours later.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday if he is treating his contract with the Mets as a one-year deal, one of Bichette’s agents — Greg Genske — chimed in.\n\n“His commitment is to the Mets,” Genske said. “His desire is to be here. His desire is compete for championships here.”\n\nMany fans will question that logic. The Mets missed the playoffs in 2025 and seemingly took steps back during the first half of this offseason. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, were two outs away from winning the World Series in the ninth inning of Game 7 less than three months ago. They won their division last season and advanced to the Fall Classic without Bichette, who was sidelined by a left knee sprain that kept him out until the World Series. Toronto has been active in bolstering their roster this winter. Plus, other high-spending contenders — like the Phillies — were contenders in the Bichette sweepstakes.\n\nBichette’s reasoning is rooted in the actions of owner Steve Cohen and Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns. He thinks the Mets have a roster that supports their offseason initiative to turn this franchise into a true perennial championship contender.\n\n“Mr. Cohen and David have put together an organization that is looking to win every single year, has an opportunity to win a World Series every single year and a roster that backs that up,” Bichette said. “It’s very exciting to be a part of this city, one of the best cities in the world — maybe the best city in the world. The fans, some of the best fans in the world. All of that is something I’ve always wanted to be a part of.\"\n\nThat’s part of the calculus in Bichette’s willingness to change positions heading into the 2026 season, too. He’ll be moving from shortstop to third base with the Mets, something he was open to throughout his dip into free agency, so long as he was signing with a team that gave him a good chance to win.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge,” Bichette said. “It’s just like anything else, it’s gonna take work to be good at something. I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it.”\n\nBichette will land in the middle of a formidable lineup that includes Fransisco Lindor, Juan Soto, Marcus Semien and Luis Robert, Jr., whom the Mets acquired Tuesday night in a trade with the White Sox.\n\nStearns isn’t concerned about Bichette being used at the hot corner for the first time in his professional career. He trusts that Bichette’s range at shortstop will translate to third and that he can handle the longer throws. Stearns has been prioritizing run prevention and defensive improvements all winter. Even with Jorge Polanco making a similar transition this year to now starting at first base for the Mets, Stearns is confident in this new-look group (with Semien at second and Lindor returning at shortstop).\n\n“There are going to be certain days this season, probably a lot of days this season, where we’re playing four shortstops on the infield, and that’s a pretty distinct advantage,” Stearns said. “The majority of that learning curve is going to be where to be on certain plays. Frankly, some things that may not be completely perceptible. We’re probably going to make a mistake or two. But we’re also going to have elite range around the infield and that’s pretty exciting.”\n\nBichette singled out positioning, bunt plays and a new type of throw across the diamond as the biggest challenges of this transition. Mets manager Carlos Mendoza, who will play a key role in helping Bichette with his defense this spring, has faith that the 27-year-old can pull it off.\n\n“It’s a different angle that you could take from there,” Mendoza said, “But he’s athletic and has work ethic, a lot of the things that will make the transition hopefully a lot smoother.”",

    "description": "The 2A Greater St. Helens League initially rejected the merger proposal, a coach told The News Tribune.",
    "fullText": "Winning the Class 2A Greater St. Helen’s League football title just got harder. Tumwater is coming to town.\n\nThe 2A Evergreen Conference (EvCo) is merging with the 2A GSHL for football beginning in the 2026 high school football season, The News Tribune has learned. The merger will include the 2027 season, as well.\n\nFor competitive reasons, Centralia High School was granted to play a 1A schedule in the 1A Evergreen, leaving the 2A EvCo with four schools: Tumwater, W.F. West, Black Hills and Aberdeen.\n\nAside from the comical optics of having a tiny four-team league, the larger issue for the 2A EvCo’s members is scheduling, forcing the remaining programs scrambling to find non-league games for over half of the season — a challenge when most teams around the state are getting into the league portion of their schedules by Week 3, and in some cases even earlier.\n\nTumwater High School football coach Willie Garrow told The News Tribune the 2A EvCo petitioned to join the GSHL for the 2026 and 2027 seasons last December and initially was rejected. The 2A EvCo resides in the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association’s (WIAA) “District 4,” one of the six geographic districts in the state.\n\nDirectors from District 4 reversed the decision on Tuesday, mandating the merger.\n\nGarrow told The News Tribune the 2A GSHL didn’t provide an official reason for initially rejecting the merger proposal.\n\n“There are lots of potential things that could be cited,” he said. “I’m sure travel was one of those concerns, the potential for travel changes. Aberdeen to Washougal, for example, that’s a trek. Sub-varsity games, that could be long and expensive. That kind of thing.”\n\nThe new 12-team league will consist of:\n\nTumwater, a perennial state tournament contender in Class 2A, has played in the 2A state championship game each of the past three seasons, falling to Anacortes in 2023 and 2024 and losing to Archbishop Murphy last fall. Tumwater won the 2A title in 2019, beating the Emeka Egbuka-led Steilacoom Sentinels.\n\nW.F. West also has been a regular state tournament contender. It reached the state semifinals in 2011 and 2022.\n\nFor Garrow and the other 2A EvCo schools, it solves the issue of having to schedule six non-league games.\n\n“They were really, really, really hard to fill,” he said. “It’s extremely difficult to find six non-league opponents. Most leagues in the state are eight or so teams, so they don’t have byes in Weeks 4, 5 and 6. Then the number of schools that do have byes, you have to convince them to play you.\n\n“From a high school football perspective as a head coach over the next two years, I enjoy the fact that we’re gonna have league stability, we know we’re gonna have opponents.”\n\nThe format of the league has yet to be determined. As a 12-team league, not every team will be able to play each other during the regular season. Multiple formats are being considered: two six team divisions, as well as a “pod system” with three pods of four teams.\n\nThe league merger will remain in place through the 2027 season, before the WIAA’s next four-year reclassification cycle, which will begin in the 2028-29 school year.",

    "description": "Broncos players rally behind backup QB Jarrett Stidham, confident he's prepared to lead Denver to AFC Championship glory after starter's injury.",
    "fullText": "There isn’t as much optimism as you’d expect from the fanbase of a team playing in the AFC Championship for fans of the Denver Broncos, but they’re under unique circumstances this week. All of the luck and good fortune that helped the Broncos to the No. 1 seed in the AFC has gone out the window after quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle in the final moments of the divisional round win against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWith Nix out, backup Jarrett Stidham will be under center on Sunday as Denver takes on the New England Patriots. It’s not ideal by any stretch of the imagination, but success in such a situation has been achieved several times before.\n\nNick Foles was the most recent success story to lead his team to a Super Bowl after stepping in for the injured starter. He won multiple playoff games for the Philadelphia Eagles and ended up winning Super Bowl LII.\n\nThe greatest quarterback of all time, Tom Brady, also got his first shot in the NFL after replacing starter Drew Bledsoe in 2001. He went on to lead the Patriots to a great regular season record and all the way to the Super Bowl, where he also earned a win.\n\nNot that Stidham is going to be the next Brady by any means, but just because Denver is relying on their backup doesn’t mean Sunday’s outcome has already been decided. The Broncos’ players have their full confidence in Stidham, who has been in Denver under head coach Sean Payton’s system for three years now. Defensive edge Zach Allen has full confidence in the 29-year-old.\n\n“He's the first guy in the building every day, and he prepares like a starter, so we're really excited to see what he does,” Allen said on Monday. “And obviously, he goes against the defense in practice all the time, and he's great. He's definitely a really good quarterback in this league. So excited to see what he does this week.\"\n\nRight tackle Mike McGlinchey is also confident in Stidham’s ability heading into the biggest game of his career.\n\n“He's been ready for his opportunity, whenever that may come,” he told reporters. “He stays in his routine every single day for three years straight, not knowing when that opportunity is going to come around. I know that our team and our staff and everybody has got the utmost confidence in Jarrett to play well and lead our team forward.\"\n\nThe Broncos will be hoping for an early return from running back J.K. Dobbins, who has had his 21-day activation window opened. If Stidham can lead Denver to a win this week, Dobbin’s possible return for the Super Bowl would be a huge bonus to a squad without its starting quarterback.\n\nFocusing on this Sunday, however, Stidham is the type of backup you’d hope for in this situation. Though his play style is a bit different from Nix’s, he’s very familiar with how Payton operates and what he expects from his quarterback. All the eyes of the football world will be on Stidham and the Broncos this weekend, waiting to see if Stidham can become the next backup QB to lead his team to glory.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe college football national championship game pitted the Big Ten's Indiana against the ACC's Miami.\n\nIt's something that has been discussed plenty by ESPN's college football czar, Paul Finebaum, himself an SEC guy.\n\nAnd that representation may have shown itself most in the days following the natty.\n\nAwful Announcing analyst Matt Yoder wondered if ESPN was partaking in \"a changing of the guard.\"\n\nAfter Indiana won the title, Finebaum didn't appear on First Take the next day.\n\nInstead, it was E.J. Manuel, who played at the ACC's Florida State, and Desmond Howard, who played at the Big Ten's Michigan.\n\n\"Of course, given the title game represented both conferences, it made all the sense in the world to showcase two analysts who know them well,\" Yoder wrote. \"But given that First Take has highlighted SEC loyalist Paul Finebaum all year, it was also quite the statement for where ESPN might go from here.\"\n\nESPN's decision to use Manuel might suggest they have a bigger role for him in the future.\n\nBut it'd be surprising to see Finebaum go too far away.\n\n\"Finebaum has been a ubiquitous presence on ESPN’s college football coverage over the last few years and for good reason,\" Yoder wrote. \"Love him or love to hate him, he is a dynamic personality who has been around the sport for decades. But while he and the SEC have had to eat a lot of crow this postseason, the end of their dominance over the sport might represent an opportunity for others to make their voices heard.\"\n\nHoward isn't as much of a surprise, as he's already on College Gameday.\n\nWe'll see if this translates to the offseason and the season ahead.\n\nMORE: Toosii's plans to play college football at Syracuse take a twist",

    "description": "Maye has fumbled six times in their first two playoff games.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his first two career playoff starts, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye has experienced his share of growing pains. Still, Maye has delivered key plays that have helped New England reach the AFC Championship Game.\n\nWith a trip to the Super Bowl now on the line, Maye’s teammates continue to express confidence in the young quarterback despite some recent mistakes.\n\n“Our quarterback continues to show up, especially in those moments where things can go left or right,” wide receiver Stefon Diggs said. “He’s making the right reads. He’s making the right throws. He’s rolling with the punches.\n\n“Playoff ball — it’s not going to be pretty. I’ll take an ugly win any day.”\n\nMaye has fumbled six times and lost three over the Patriots’ first two postseason games. Nonetheless, he has shown a short memory, bouncing back to make pivotal plays — such as fourth quarter touchdown passes to Hunter Henry against the Chargers and Kayshon Boutte versus the Texans — in order to secure a pair of wins.\n\n“I think none of his plays are really bad plays. It’s just part of football. I watch him, and his demeanor and his temperament throughout the game, it never changes. I think he’s consistent,” Diggs said. “The more people that band behind him, you see it. Once he gets rolling, he’s real scary. He’s a young quarterback but he has had a maturation process second to none in my opinion.”\n\nAs Maye and the Patriots now prepare for a Denver Broncos defense that led the league in sacks, ball security will be a major point of emphasis. That focus extends beyond Maye, as well, as the quarterback has not always been the primary cause of the fumbles.\n\n“We have to be able to not get careless with the football. We can’t be reckless,” head coach Mike Vrabel said. “A lot of it is operation. We had two turnovers where we all weren’t on the same page. Not only is that a negative play if you don’t have everybody on the same page, but even worse, you lose the football or if you don’t have somebody on the same page and they blitz, somebody gets hurt. Those are the things we talk about when we’re not on the same page. I think that the operation is going to be critical.”",

See:\n\nAt least he didn’t fail in another clear opportunity he had at the 30th minute of the second half.\n\nCalleri received a beautiful assist from Pedro Ferreira and, face to face with the goalkeeper, made it 1-1.\n\nThe final stretch of the match at Morumbis didn’t hold back on excitement.\n\nPortuguesa regained the lead after Renê converted a penalty and Maceió made it 3-1.\n\nThere was still time for Calleri to score his second goal of the game and push São Paulo into a final surge, but Lusa managed to hold on for the win.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "It took some time, but it finally happened.\n\nThe Vikings have announced that defensive coordinator Brian Flores has signed a contract extension. His three-year deal ran through the end of the 2025 regular season.\n\nThe Vikings were confident Flores would stay, if he didn't get a head-coaching job elsewhere.\n\n“Brian has a unique ability to connect with players, understand their skill sets, and put them in positions to maximize their impact on the field,” coach Kevin O'Connell said in a release. “The identity of our defense is a reflection of his leadership and preparation. On a personal level, I’ve really valued the relationship we’ve built over the last three years, and that shared trust, alignment and high standard will continue to be critical to our success.”\n\nFlores interviewed with both the Ravens and Steelers for their head-coaching vacancies. The Pittsburgh interview happened on Wednesday. It's unclear whether the Vikings' announcement means he has withdrawn from consideration for either job.\n\nFlores, who coached the Dolphins from 2019 through 2021, also interviewed for the vacant defensive coordinator position in Washington.\n\nThe Vikings believed the Cowboys might make a run at Flores for their vacant defensive coordinator job. He was never interviewed, which possibly means the Cowboys knew what he wanted financially, and weren't willing to pay it.\n\nRegardless, the silence has been broken. The Vikings have a new deal with Flores. They presumably wouldn't have announced it if they thought he may be leaving.",

    "fullText": "Ex-Deion Sanders five-star Sa’vell Smalls: Playing at Colorado nearly left me paralyzed originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSa’vell Smalls did everything football ever asked of him, and more.\n\nHe was a five star recruit, a consensus national prospect, and a player once spoken about as a future star at the highest level. His path took him from Washington to Colorado in 2023, following opportunity, belief, and the promise of a fresh start under Deion Sanders.\n\nInstead, the game nearly took his life.\n\nIn a deeply personal message shared publicly, Smalls revealed that he has medically retired from college football after learning he was born with spinal stenosis, a condition that dangerously narrows the spinal canal. The diagnosis came only after a series of terrifying moments that no athlete expects to experience.\n\n🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/2fYpWQLfaN\n\n— Sav’ell Smalls 🧬 (@SavvySmalls_9) January 21, 2026\n\nSmalls described episodes of transient quadriplegia, temporary paralysis in his arms and legs, occurring during routine plays he had executed thousands of times. At first, he did what many athletes are conditioned to do. He stayed quiet. He pushed through numbness. He told himself it would pass.\n\nMORE: Meet Abella Danger—The one Miami celebrity fan Curt Cignetti won't tell you to Google\n\nEventually, the symptoms became impossible to explain away. Medical evaluations revealed the seriousness of the condition. Spinal fusion surgery was discussed, but even that came with no certainty. Doctors warned that continuing to play football carried a real risk of permanent paralysis.\n\nFor Smalls, the choice became brutally clear.\n\nSanders has not publicly responded. However, the decision dates back to last fall, when Smalls was advised that continuing to play carried serious risk.\n\nMORE: Malachi Toney admits he’d be playing in the SEC if not for a coaching change\n\nWhat stood out just as much as what was said was what was not.\n\nIn a message filled with gratitude for family, doctors, and those who supported him through the hardest decision of his life, Smalls did not mention Coach Prime or the Colorado coaching staff. That absence is notable, especially in a sport where public thanks are often extended even in far less personal moments.\n\nOnce viewed as an immediate impact defender and a future NFL prospect, Smalls exited the game quietly. There was no press conference. No farewell moment. No orchestrated goodbye. Just a decision made privately, months earlier, with life itself hanging in the balance.\n\nMORE: D’Angelo Ponds’ father sends 'BTA' message to Michael Irvin after Indiana's title win\n\n“I medically retired,” Smalls wrote. “Ending my athletic career for good.”\n\nThe words are simple.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — From hitting in the clutch to testing free agency, Bo Bichette has soaked up plenty of baseball advice from his big league dad over the years.\n\nDante Bichette doesn't have much to offer about handling the hot corner, though.\n\nAfter signing a $126 million, three-year contract with the New York Mets, the younger Bichette was formally introduced by the team Wednesday and pulled on a No. 19 jersey at a packed Citi Field news conference.\n\nA two-time All-Star shortstop with the Toronto Blue Jays, Bichette will shift to third base with the Mets, who have Francisco Lindor entrenched at shortstop. Bichette said he hasn't played third since travel ball as a teenager.\n\n“I’m excited for the challenge. I mean, it’s just like anything else: It’s going to take work to be good at something, and I’m willing to put in that work and we’ll get after it,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there’s different positioning, different plays you have to deal with at third base that I’m going to have to get used to and learn, but I think that’s all attainable.”\n\nDante Bichette, in attendance Wednesday along with other family members, was a four-time All-Star outfielder from 1988-2001. Known much more for his bat than glove, he played one inning at third base for Milwaukee in 1991.\n\n“I didn’t know he did that. I had no idea,\" Bo Bichette said with a grin. \"That would be interesting to watch.”\n\nHousehold jabs aside, the new-look Mets are confident Bichette can make the switch successfully.\n\nHe didn't grade well at shortstop last year, and Bichette entered free agency this offseason willing to move to second or third. He plans to call former Toronto teammate Matt Chapman, a five-time Gold Glove winner at the hot corner, to get some thoughts about manning third.\n\n“This is a player who is universally respected for his aptitude and his work ethic on the field,\" Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said about Bichette. \"And so when you combine those two things it generally gives you comfort that they can make adjustments, make changes, and Bo is very confident that he’s going to be able to do this, and everything we’ve seen backs that up.”\n\nBichette spurned the NL East rival Philadelphia Phillies to sign with the Mets and gives them a proven hitter with a potent right-handed bat to help complement lefty slugger Juan Soto.\n\nBichette batted .311 with 18 home runs, 94 RBIs and an .840 OPS in 139 games last year for the Blue Jays, who fell one win short of a World Series title.\n\nHe hit a three-run homer off Shohei Ohtani in Game 7 of the Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and is a .330 career hitter with runners in scoring position — the third-best mark in the majors among qualified hitters since 2019.\n\nBichette batted .381 with RISP last season.\n\n“I don’t know if my eyes light up or anything like that, but definitely probably get a little bit more focus,\" he said. \"And my dad taught me a lot about it. That’s all I heard about growing up was driving in runs, so I’ve put a lot of work into it.”\n\nBichette, who turns 28 in March, gets a $40 million signing bonus payable March 15 and a $2 million salary this year. He has $42 million player options for 2027 and 2028. If he declines either option, he would receive a $5 million buyout, payable in $1 million installments each July 1 from 2036-40.\n\n“We had a lot of conversations about the different structure of the deal, and Bo had his choice of long-term deals, shorter-term deals, opt outs,\" agent Greg Genske said. “His priority was finding a place where he felt like he could get better as a player and have a chance to compete for championships.”\n\nNew York signed right-handed reliever Luis García to a $1.75 million, one-year contract. He can earn $1.25 million in performance bonuses for games pitched: $100,000 for 25, $150,000 each for 30 and 35, $175,000 for 40, $200,000 for 45, $225,000 for 50 and $250,000 for 55.\n\nGarcía, who turns 39 this month, went 2-2 with a 3.42 ERA and two saves in 58 combined appearances last season with the Dodgers, Nationals and Angels. He is 28-30 with a 4.07 ERA and 17 saves in 13 major league seasons.\n\nTo open a spot for García on the 40-man roster, infielder Tsung-Che Cheng was designated for assignment.\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.",

It's the most important things. I don't have problems with them outside the cage. One of the reasons why we don't like each other is because if we fight we're going to smash each other. If someone would retire, we won't have issues to be in conflict. I think that position (is the one) taken by all fighters. Nobody will fight with friends.\"\n\nDespite his eagerness to take a crack at the current UFC titleholder, Nurmagomedov doesn't appear in a rush. Even should he get through former UFC flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo on Saturday, Nurmagomedov said he has a hunch he'll have to fight one more time before a title shot is awarded to him.\n\n\"I don't feel (Sean O'Malley) is even going to be next,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"Maybe after this fight, we're going to fight for the title. Merab and Petr will maybe fight in a rematch. But for me, it doesn't matter. Any option, I will be ready.\"\n\nShould he beat Figueiredo, Nurmagomedov has already penciled in the event and location on his calendar in which he could punch his ticket to a UFC title fight.\n\n\"It's going to be good, (if I fight in October in Abu Dhabi),\" Nurmagomedov said. \"I can fight main event five rounds. If it's going to Sean O'Malley, for example, it's going to be a big fight.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Umar Nurmagomedov clarifies Khabib's comments about Petr Yan",

I just want to talk it out,” Simmons said. “I feel like I’ve been in a really good spot with the Seattle sports fan bases. Sunday night, doing a live pod on Netflix. A lot of stuff going, coming off Bears-Rams, head’s spinning, all these different directions. We’re talking about Super Bowl matchups, and I say the Seahawks never won a Super Bowl.\n\n“Now, you could say I’m old. I would go with brain fart because I would say I know the Seahawks won a Super Bowl. I was writing for Grantland at the time. I was doing podcasts and writing about that Super Bowl year. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them kick Peyton Manning’s a--. If I had thought about it for a split second, I would have remembered they won. But I think I brain-farted and mixed them up with the Mariners. So I’m here to ask for forgiveness.”\n\nMORE: Bills have no choice but to trade Keon Coleman now\n\nHis brain very likely mixed them up with the Mariners, which is fair given they nearly made the World Series in October. The Mariners have never even made it to the World Series, let alone won one.\n\n“My standard response for this stuff is, it is hard to host a pod. You’re not going to bat a thousand,” Simmons said. “…I was thinking afterwards, I was like, ‘Why did I say that? What happened to my brain?’ But then I realized the Rams, Bears, and the Bills game probably broke my brain.”\n\nMORE: Could the Raiders trade the No. 1 pick and Fernando Mendoza?\n\nThose games were pretty wild. It broke a lot of brains.\n\nStill, though, the Seahawks won pretty recently. Simmons won't make this mistake again.\n\nBrowns can draft the brother of a Cavs' NBA star\n\nThe 2027 Super Bowl is on Valentine's Day\n\nNew perspective on Tua Tagovailoa and his head injuries\n\nThe lastest on how Travis Kelce's wedding to Taylor Swift impacts retirement\n\nJohn Harbaugh should already have a $100 million regret\n\nThis throw is why the Bears drafted Caleb Williams 1st overall",

Fighting Illini head coach Brad Underwood shared the tough injury news on Boswell earlier this week.\n\nBoswell has been one of the best guards in the Big Ten so far this season, averaging 14.3 points and 3.4 assists per game this year. He is a big reason for why Illinois is among the elite Big Ten teams this year, with an overall record of 15-3 and 6-1 mark in conference games.\n\nMichigan State is set to host Illinois on February 7 as the lone regular season meeting between the Spartans and Fighting Illini. That game would be within the expected window of time Boswell will be out, so his injury certainly could impact that game in a few weeks. Illinois is a well-rounded team this year, but we will see how they handle this unfortunate injury news.\n\nDamn tough break.

    "fullText": "With the brutal news after the Denver Broncos divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills of Bo Nix being done for the year with an ankle injury, the need to get healthy for the AFC Championship Game became a critical need. Two names are on that list for us to watch for: J.K. Dobbins and Luke Wattenberg. With Nix out, those first two are probably code red needs for this game. Surprisingly, both wide receivers Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant were at practice today as well.\n\nGreat news there on all injury fronts. First, Dobbins was practicing today for the first time since injuring his foot in Week 10. The rehab time on that felt like a iffy maybe for the Super Bowl at the time, but he’s well ahead of schedule and seemingly back at the most critical time for this football team. Wattenberg’s status is a little more questionable as the team did open his 21-day practice window today, but I should note he was the only guy of the four who was a full participant.\n\nThough, when asked, head coach Sean Payton was adamant that he would not comment on any player’s expected return time from injury. So practicing is a good sign, but we won’t know if they are game-ready until Friday or even possibly until 90 minutes before kickoff with the gameday inactive report.\n\nHere is your full practice report for Wednesday.\n\nBOLD – Indicates change in status; NIR­- Indicates not injury related; *- Team conducted a walk-through / report is an estimation\nSTATUS DEFINITIONS: Did not participate (DNP); Limited: means less than 100 percent of a player’s normal repetitions; Full—100 percent of player’s normal repetitions; Out: will not play; Doubtful: Unlikely to play; Questionable: Uncertain to play",

    "fullText": "Yoane Wissa does not have to look too far for inspiration.\n\nAlan Shearer, Jackie Milburn, Andy Cole, Malcolm Macdonald and Les Ferdinand are just some of the prolific strikers who have worn Newcastle United's iconic number nine shirt.\n\nWissa is the latest in a long line to inherit it, and he offered a reminder why in his side's 3-0 Champions League win against PSV Eindhoven at St James' Park.\n\nOn a night supporters unfurled a banner urging their side to \"write the next headline\", Wissa certainly did so.\n\nNot only did he open the scoring after just eight minutes, the forward also set up his side's second goal with the aggressive manner in which he pressed slack PSV defender Yarek Gasiorowski.\n\nNo wonder the man of the match left the field to a standing ovation after he was taken off by head coach Eddie Howe midway through the second half.\n\nThe prospect of sampling such moments under the lights had long served as inspiration after Wissa suffered a knee injury while on international duty with DR Congo back in September.\n\n\"It's been a tough start for him here,\" Howe said. \"For any new player to come and get a serious injury, having not even done a training session, that's really tough mentally.\n\n\"So it's taken us a while to get him to a level that's close to his best, and I still feel he's got some more to come.\n\n\"A big night for him tonight because in part that's why he came to the club - for these nights - and I'm just pleased that he's made a positive impact.\"\n\nIt has taken Wissa time to deliver such performances.\n\nWissa, who had already had a disrupted pre-season, following his protracted departure from Brentford, has only scored three goals since making his debut for Newcastle last month.\n\nThe forward has looked rusty at times, failing to take a big chance to open the scoring in the defeat against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-finals last week.\n\nBut Wednesday night showed what he can bring to this side.\n\nHowe had called on Wissa to \"max out\" before the game, and he led the press effectively against a naive PSV side, who repeatedly played out from the back.\n\nThat certainly did not go unnoticed by fellow goalscorer Harvey Barnes.\n\n\"He's had a tough start since he's come here,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"Obviously injured for a long time. I had a similar start here. I know how tough it is just watching from the stands, so I know how delighted he will be.\n\n\"A first Champions League goal. I thought he played really well so I'm buzzing for him.\"\n\nThe challenge for Wissa, of course, is to start scoring more regularly.\n\nBut he is a poacher in a differing mould to the towering Nick Woltemade, who likes to come in deep.\n\nOf those forwards to have played a minimum of 250 minutes in the Premier League this season, Wissa ranks first for cross option runs per game.\n\nThese are defined by Opta as runs to get into the penalty area to make yourself available for a cross while your team-mate has the ball in a wide area.\n\nWissa also ranks 15th for runs in behind.\n\nGiven their differing qualities, Howe felt it was \"transformative\" to have Wissa available after Woltemade had to shoulder the burden up front in his absence.\n\nIt had always been the plan for the pair to share the load after Newcastle lost top scorer Alexander Isak to Liverpool last summer, and Wissa's Premier League experience helps explain why Newcastle paid such a hefty £55m fee.\n\n\"Yoane's career at Brentford was brilliant to watch from afar because I thought he was outstanding for them, scoring a number of massive goals,\" Howe said.\n\n\"I loved his attitude and the way that he played, the determination and aggression that he played with.\"\n\nSuch aggression is one of the reasons Wissa is likely to line up from the off against holders Paris St-Germain next week.\n\nNewcastle are in a strong position going into that final game of the league phase, and sit in seventh place in the standings.\n\nNewcastle have already secured a last 16 play-off spot, and still have the chance to reach the knockout stages automatically with a landmark result in the Parc des Princes next week.\n\nWhile Howe refuted talk of \"revenge\" after a controversial stoppage-time penalty was awarded against his side on their last visit to the French capital in 2023, the visitors certainly won't need any added motivation.\n\n\"We know what we can do when we turn up against teams,\" Barnes added.\n\n\"We had a sour taste after the game a couple of years ago, and it's one we will want to go and put right.\n\n\"It's a massive challenge - they're a quality side - but why not?\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

And while there's apparently nothing to it, the 49ers won't shrug it off.\n\n“What I would tell you, because it deals with allegedly the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,\" G.M. John Lynch told reporters on Wednesday. \"So, our guys have been — we've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and by coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means. That's what we know exists. We've heard that debunked. So yes, we will look into it. We have. The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pour into it. Our ownership, [CEO] Jed [York], tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened. We aren't going to turn a blind eye. We'll look into everything.”\n\nThe 49ers have practiced in the same facility since 1988, winning three Super Bowls in the first seven years there. And even if there's nothing to the electricity angle, the 49ers have had too many injuries in recent years.\n\n\"The health and performance of our players is at the utmost priority each and every year,\" Lynch said. \"You know, this year it was tough and it took a toll on our team. We'll continue to look. Now, having said that, we've spent a lot of time and effort in recruiting really quality people and I think being at the forefront of injury prevention. I think this year probably because the star players that that went down there was a lot of attention given on that. The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game. And so, what we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries, and I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. That process has begun. It never frankly stopped, but yes, we'll look at everything and we'll examine everything.\"\n\nA certain amount of injuries are unavoidable. Still, training and nutrition and flexibility can be factors in the ability of players to stay healthy. Whatever the reason for two straight years of too many injuries for the 49ers, they need to get to the bottom of the problem, and fix it.",

    "description": "For those wondering if the Houston Texans will be moving off another offensive coordinator this offseason, don't bet the house on it happening.",
    "fullText": "For those wondering if the Houston Texans will be moving off another offensive coordinator this offseason, don't bet the house on it happening.\n\nTexans general manager Nick Caserio said Wednesday that he anticipates first-year playcaller Nick Caley to get a second season running the offense when the Texans return to NRG Stadium next season.\n\n\"I think Nick learned a lot, [in his] first opportunity as a playcaller,\" Caserio said. \"I would say, offensively, probably the last two to three months of the year played pretty good football and did a lot of good things, so there was growth and improvement.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Texans coach DeMeco Ryan sparked a bit of controversy among fans when he said that he would be “evaluating everything throughout the week” when asked about Caley’s future, which echoed a similar feel to that of former coordinator Bobby Slowik in 2024.\n\nNick Caserio when asked if Nick Caley will return in 2026:\n\n“Yeah I would anticipate Nick being here next year. Nick learned a lot, first opportunity as a play caller. Offensively, probably the last 2-3 months of the year, played pretty good football.” pic.twitter.com/GnfmGoHv62\n\n— Houston Stressans (@TexansCommenter) January 21, 2026\n\nWhile Caserio did say that nothing was final about any coach's return, he mentioned that he and Ryans speak daily and felt he wasn’t speaking out of line when dicussing the long-term status of the former New England Patriots tight ends coach.\n\n\"All of us are just trying to improve and do what we can to make the team and the organization better,” Caserio said.\n\nCaley replaced Slowik after an underwhelming second year running the offense with quarterback C.J. Stroud. Much to Caserio's comments, the offense did improve after a vastly underwhelming start, which resulted in an 0-3 record and four-game stretch where Stroud never scored a red-zone touchdown.\n\nWhile Caley's offense never took a colossal leap forward, the unit went from 23rd to 20th in total yards (319.7 to 327.0) and 21st to 13th in scoring (21.9 points per game to 23.8). Perhaps the biggest win came in the team's turnover ratio, which rapidly diminished from 19 in 2024 to just 12 in 2025 during the regular season.\n\nBut the playoffs are where Stroud and the overall struggles really reached a low for Caley's faults in year one. Over a two-game stretch, Stroud tossed five interceptions, including four first-half turnovers in the divisional round loss to the New England Patriots. He also had five fumbles and three turnovers in a wild-card round win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n#Texans GM Nick Caserio said he does expect OC Nick Caley to be back next season as the play-caller pic.twitter.com/8Y86EmOcr7\n\n— SportsTalk 790 (@SportsTalk790) January 21, 2026\n\nStroud seemed to be on board with a reunion for Caley in 2026 after seeing regular-season improvements the team's first 12-win season since 2012.\n\n\"Yeah, definitely. I love Cales,\" Stroud said. \"I think there's growth in our relationship, there's growth in his ability to call plays, growth and DeMeco trusted him.\"\n\nThe Texans also expected to have offensive line coach Cole Popovich back for next season after his promotion led to major changes to the trench play. Behind a makeshift offensive line that saw 13 different combinations, the Texans only allowed 31 total sacks and 113 pressures, which ranked 20th in the league.\n\n\"Overall, I would say that group certainly improved,\" Caserio said. \"I think Cole did a phenomenal job with that group, him and Coach [Zach] Yenser.\"\n\nThe Texans own the No. 28 pick in the upcoming NFL draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: Texans GM Nick Caserio 'expects' OC Nick Caley to return for 2026",

    "description": "Exclamation marks, ellipses and ‘haha’ can’t fix our growing inability to communicate.",
    "fullText": "“How Many Exclamation Points Are Too Many in an Email? A Psychologist Weighs In.” A psychologist! This article appeared in Parade last summer, but you could find the same question being asked, at varying levels of desperation, in any season over the past decade. It is widely understood that exclamation points must be inserted into the modern professional email at precise intervals — just enough to create a tone of eagerness and warmth without tipping over into sounding fake, sycophantic or batty. So people appeal to the internet, terrified they’re hindering their careers by striking the wrong balance; they seek advice from job coaches; they joke about their obsessive budgeting of exclamations. They fear seeming overexcited, yes — but they also know the risks of the plain old period. Too brusque. Too cold. Too testy.\n\nIt has been this way since soon after the smartphone arrived, when older Americans started getting the unwelcome news that ending their messages with periods was a grave faux pas. This must have been a baffling experience, like being called gross for drinking water or flossing. But a new tonal consensus really had emerged: The period seemed pointed, stern, passive-aggressive. By 2013, this shift was ingrained enough that The New Republic ran an article celebrating the period’s newfound role as a jerk.\n\nSince then, our anxieties about tone seem to have skipped right over the content of our messages to the characters that end them. There has been a long parade of replacements for the period. The writer of that New Republic piece thought ellipses were nice. (They’re not; younger people find them not only Boomerish but also horror-movie ominous.) For a while, young people preferred the nervous chuckling of a “lol” or “haha.” (“Why Do Millennials Feel Compelled to Write ‘Lol’ After Everything?” asked Huffpost last fall — to which one answered that it was “like a tension-breaking mechanism,” while another pointed out that texting “I think I love you, lol” allows you to pretend you were kidding if you don’t get a favorable response.) Emoji, too, had their turn as sentence-enders — all except that subset, like the thumbs-up and the “OK” hand signal, that came to be associated with the same passive-aggressive terseness as the period, the equivalent of a clipped verbal “fine.”\n\nSome of these habits are still considered informal or even immature, but they have also aged their way up into typical workplace communication, and some people would love to impose a new consensus around them, too. “It’s impossible to convey emotions through text, and this helps the reader understand your intent,” someone posted on Reddit years ago, regarding lols and hahas. “I have coworkers who sound dead inside when we IM, because they believe any kind of informal slang is reserved for childish teens.”\n\nOveruse has taken the shine off some tactics, with young men in particular getting mocked for reflexively haha-ing in an effort to seem coolly unbothered. (“Men are always communicating like this via text-based platforms haha,” Kelly Conaboy once wrote on the website The Hairpin. “Why? haha. You don’t have to haha.”) In the workplace, though, more upscale methods of period avoidance have thrived. Consider, for instance, the application of question marks to non-questions we’re hoping to advance gently — the same wheedling uptalk used when we fake-wince and tell a colleague “I don’t know if that will work?” As speech, this habit is so associated with corporate management that it’s mocked in comedies like “Office Space” and early stories by George Saunders, who once had a police officer explain an apparent grave-robbing with the line “Typically it’s teens?” And yet in text it has irresistible utility.\n\nTo monitor one’s tone is human, but why are we this scared of sounding brusque in routine emails? The usual explanations revolve around the difficulties of conveying tone in writing. It’s a bit much to say that it’s “impossible to convey emotions through text” — I mean, literature exists — but the lack of access to vocal inflections, facial expressions and listener feedback does create challenges.\n\nIf the issue were just writing, though, you’d expect the rise of short-form video to solve it. Making a TikTok or YouTube video restores all of the inflection and expression people claim to be lost without. And yet the people on these platforms are not exactly bringing back deadpan or disdain. For the most part, they evince a manic desire to be ingratiating, with everything from lulling hand movements to singsong speech designed to be immediately liked.\n\nThe issue, in other words, isn’t the writing. It’s the lack of context — the fact that more and more of what we communicate is aimed at somebody we don’t know or rarely speak to, with little base line of what we’re normally like. This is true of social media audiences, but it may be equally true of a colleague from accounts payable — someone with whom we might, in another time, have been forced to negotiate some in-person rapport, but now interact with largely via bursts of typing. No amount of tone-marking seems likely to resolve our worries over this arrangement. Even the habits we make socially mandatory will just become invisible obligations that have to be augmented with even friendlier signals. And if this level of social anxiety has infiltrated the act of typing a message, you might as well embrace the full experience: Walk over to accounts payable and say it directly, in whatever expressionless monotone you like. If nothing else, you won’t have to wonder how your new friend reacted.",

However, the gradient estimator in the distillation stage usually suffers from two sources of bias: (1) biased teacher supervision due to score estimation error incurred during pre-training, and (2) the student model's score estimation error during distillation.

    "title": "Spotify Lawsuit Triggered Anna's Archive Domain Name Suspensions",
    "description": "Spotify and several major record label have taken legal action against the unknown operators of Anna's Archive.",
    "fullText": "Anna’s Archive is generally known as a meta-search engine for shadow libraries, helping users find pirated books and other related resources.\n\nHowever, in December, the site announced that it had also backed up Spotify, which came as a shock to the music industry.\n\nWhile Anna’s Archive initially released only Spotify metadata, and no actual music, the industry was on high alert. Over Christmas, Spotify and the major labels prepared a legal response in U.S. federal court.\n\nOn December 29, Spotify, UMG, Sony, Warner, and other labels filed their complaint at the Southern District of New York. They accuse Anna’s Archive of mass copyright infringement, breach of contract, DMCA violations, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Anna’s Archive “brazenly” circumvented Spotify’s DRM. The site scraped 86 million music files and metadata for 256 million tracks from Spotify, which would all eventually be released publicly.\n\n“…Anna’s Archive has threatened to imminently mass-release and freely distribute its pirated copies of the sound recording files to the public, without authorization from or compensation to the relevant rights holders. Such widespread and illegal infringement would irreparably harm the music industry..,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe complaint comes with a request for a preliminary injunction and a restraining order that aim to take Anna’s Archive offline. All these documents were filed under seal, as the shadow library might otherwise be tipped off and take countermeasures.\n\nThese documents were filed ex-parte and kept away from Anna’s Archive. According to Spotify and the labels, this is needed “so that Anna’s Archive cannot pre-emptively frustrate” the countermeasures they seek.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was unsealed recently, explains directly why Anna’s Archive lost several of its domain names over the past weeks. The .ORG domain was suspended by the U.S.-based Public Interest Registry (PIR) in early January, while a domain registrar took the .SE variant offline a few days later.\n\n“We don’t believe this has to do with our Spotify backup,” AnnaArchivist said at the time, but court records prove them wrong.\n\nThe unsealed paperwork shows that the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on January 2, which aimed to target Anna’s Archive hosting and domain names. The sealed nature of this order also explains why the .ORG registry informed us that it could not comment on the suspension last week.\n\nWhile the .ORG and the .SE domains are suspended now, other domains remain operational. This suggests that the responsible registrars and registries do not automatically comply with U.S. court orders.\n\nWhile the TRO was not public, a preliminary injunction that was issued by U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff on January 16th shows how broad the granted powers are.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, and without a defense, the court concluded that the music companies’ copyright infringement claim will hold up. Therefore, the court ordered that Anna’s Archive is enjoined from ‘hosting, linking to, [or] distributing’ the copyrighted works.\n\nSince it’s uncertain whether Anna’s Archive will comply, the injunction also targets many third-party intermediaries, including domain registries and registrars, hosting companies, and other service providers.\n\nThese companies should assist in stopping the infringing activity on Anna’s Archive.\n\nTo avoid uncertainty, the court explicitly mentions that the targeted companies include the Public Interest Registry; Cloudflare Inc.; Switch Foundation; The Swedish Internet\n\nFoundation; National Internet Exchange of India; Njalla SRL; IQWeb FZ-LLC; Immaterialism Ltd.; Hosting Concepts B.V.; and Tucows Domains Inc.\n\nThe addition of Cloudflare stands out because the company operates a proxy service, without hosting Anna’s Archive’s content permanently. However, that was sufficient for the court to issue the order.\n\nWhile the unsealed documents resolve the domain suspension mystery, it is only the start of the legal battle in court. It is expected that Spotify and the music companies will do everything in their power to take further action, if needed.\n\nInterestingly, however, it appears that the music industry lawsuit may have already reached its goal. A few days ago, the dedicated Spotify download section was removed by Anna’s Archive.\n\nWhether this removal is linked to the legal troubles is unknown. However, it appears that Anna’s Archive stopped the specific distribution of Spotify content alleged in the complaint, seemingly in partial compliance with the injunction’s ban on ‘making available’ the scraped files.\n\nWhether this will mean that all troubles are now over has yet to be seen. For now, the copyright infringement allegations and other claims remain unresolved in court.\n\nA copy of the unsealed complaint filed by Spotify and the labels is available here (pdf). The preliminary injunction can be found here (pdf).",

    "description": "Data centers are shifting from NTP to PTP for precise time synchronization, enabling real-time workloads but requiring complex network upgrades.",
    "fullText": "Data centers are shifting from NTP to PTP for precise time synchronization, enabling real-time workloads but requiring complex hardware and network upgrades.\n\nFor decades, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been the gold standard for synchronizing time across data center networks. But increasingly, that’s no longer the case. Modern networking demands greater precision than ever, and the venerable NTP often falls short.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, data centers are now migrating to alternative methods for maintaining network time, such as the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) – an approach that is more complex to implement but worth the extra effort, enabling a whole new level of timing synchronization accuracy.\n\nNetwork time refers to the synchronization of time across devices connected to a network.\n\nTo exchange data accurately and avoid errors, all devices on a network must be synchronized. Otherwise, issues can arise, such as one server mistakenly treating data it received from another server as late due to inconsistencies in each server's time settings.\n\nKeeping network time in sync is important on any network. But it’s especially critical in data centers, which are typically home to large numbers of network-connected devices, and where small inconsistencies in network timing could snowball into major network synchronization problems.\n\nSince the 1980s, the main approach to synchronizing time across networks has been the Network Time Protocol (NTP). NTP works in a simple, straightforward way: devices on a network periodically check in with an NTP server, which tells them the correct time. If the time on a device is not in sync with the “official” time according to the NTP server, the device updates its time settings.\n\nNTP works very well in situations where networks can tolerate timing inconsistencies of up to a few milliseconds (meaning thousandths of a second). But beyond this, NTP-based time syncing is less reliable due to limitations such as:\n\nPeriodic check-ins: With NTP, devices only check in with NTP servers periodically – and often, several minutes can go by between verification events. In the meantime, devices may drift out of sync because their local clocks deviate from NTP-based time.\n\nNetwork latency issues: Even if devices were to poll NTP servers very frequently, delays in the time it takes for the server to respond over the network could contribute to inaccurate time readings. They may be measured only in small fractions of a second, but that’s still a problem for data centers that require incredibly precise network timing.\n\nComputational delays: Polling an NTP server and polling time data also takes time because it requires computational resources – and here again, although the delays may be extremely small, they can still matter.\n\nThese challenges render NTP unsuitable for data centers hosting workloads that demand true real-time data exchange – such as those that support real-time financial trading, robotic process coordination or the management of autonomous vehicles. To support cases like these, data centers need to maintain time with microsecond-level accuracy. (A microsecond is one-thousandth of a millisecond.)\n\nFortunately for data center operators facing challenges like these, there’s an alternative to NTP: the Precision Time Protocol (PTP).\n\nUnlike NTP, PTP doesn’t rely solely on a server-client model for syncing time across networked devices. Instead, it uses time servers in conjunction with a method called hardware timestamping on client devices. Hardware timestamping involves specialized hardware components, usually embedded in network interface cards (NICs), to track time.\n\nCentral time servers still exist under PTP. But rather than having software on servers connect to the time servers, hardware devices optimized for the task do this work. The devices also include built-in clocks, allowing them to record time data faster than they could if they had to forward it to the generic clock on a server.\n\nThe result is that, in most cases, PTP is much faster and more reliable than NTP. While timing inconsistencies may still occur, they’re usually much smaller under PTP.\n\nComprehensive statistics about the use of PTP are elusive. But some sources suggest that in real-time financial trading, for example, 85% of workloads now rely on PTP. Others predict that the market for PTP solutions will grow by a CAGR of about 8.5% through 2031.\n\nWhile PTP is more powerful and accurate than NTP, it’s also more complex (and, in many cases, more expensive) for data centers to implement. This is mainly because – whereas data center operators can implement an NTP server using just freely available software – PTP requires two key types of hardware components:\n\nNICs with hardware timestamping capabilities. As noted above, these play a key role in enabling PTP-based time measurement.\n\nA centralized, highly accurate clock that can feed time data to the PTP server. This is important because PTP is only accurate if the PTP server’s time readings are also accurate – and to achieve highly precise time readings, it works best to deploy a local time-keeping device, such as an atomic clock, directly within a data center. It’s also possible to retrieve time from remote time servers, but doing so usually introduces microsecond-level networking delays – and if your time readings are a few microseconds out of sync, you’ve defeated the whole purpose of using PTP in the first place.\n\nOn top of this, small inefficiencies in internal data center networking, such as congestion or packet loss issues that delay PTP time polling, can also make PTP inaccurate. Thus, to use PTP effectively, data center operators must optimize their networks and deploy the necessary hardware components.\n\nNone of this is easy. But again, it’s increasingly necessary for data centers aiming to redefine the meaning of “real time” and support workloads that just can’t tolerate the syncing delays of a network timing protocol designed forty years ago.\n\nAs workloads demand ever-greater precision, PTP is becoming the new standard for data center time synchronization. While its implementation is complex and costly, the benefits of microsecond-level accuracy far outweigh the challenges for data centers supporting real-time applications.\n\nChristopher Tozzi is a technology analyst with subject matter expertise in cloud computing, application development, open source software, virtualization, containers and more.

Russia says the killings amount to acts of state terrorism.\n\nUzbek national Akhmadzhon Kurbonov and three accomplices were found ‍guilty of various crimes related to the Kirillov killing, including terrorism and the illegal trafficking of explosives, Russian investigators said on Wednesday.\n\nThe three accomplices were given jail sentences in maximum security correctional prison ​camps ranging from 18 to 25 years, the Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, ‌said in a statement.\n\nKurbonov, who is now due to spend the rest of his life in a special regime correctional prison camp, pleaded guilty to the charges, while the others did not, Russian media reported. Reuters was not able to contact lawyers for the men.\n\nThe Investigative Committee said Kirillov's murder had been planned in Ukraine.\n\nThe perpetrators had smuggled the ⁠explosives into Russia from Poland, and one of ​the four men, Robert Safaryan, had stored the components ​at his home in Russia, it said.\n\nKurbonov had then assembled the bomb, planted it and remotely detonated it as Kirillov and Polikarpov stepped out of ‍the building.\n\nA string of ⁠senior Russian military figures have been killed since the start of the war in Ukraine nearly four years ago.\n\nThe latest was Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, head ⁠of the Russian General Staff's army operational training directorate, who died after a bomb planted under his car ‌went off last month.\n\nUkraine has not claimed responsibility for Sarvarov's death.",

    "fullText": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Canadian beef will be exported to China following the relaxation of an import ban that had been in ​place since 2021, the agriculture minister said, though analysts cautioned it will likely ‌be in small amounts.\n\nThe reopening of what could be a vital market for Canadian beef follows the visit ‌of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who reached an agreement with China's leadership to lower tariffs and do more business on a number of agricultural commodities, including canola.\n\n\"We know that there's a large company that's shipping its first load of beef to China next week,\" said Canadian ⁠Agriculture Minister Heath MacDonald on ‌Tuesday. Earlier on social media he said \"China has lifted market access for Canadian beef.\"\n\nChina's customs agency did not immediately respond to a request ‍for comment.\n\nThe move is not expected to have an immediate major impact on Canadian beef exports or prices because North America has a shortage of domestic beef and prices are historically high.\n\nSylvain Charlebois, a ​food market expert known as The Food Professor, said: \"China reopening or expanding access for ‌Canadian beef won't move food prices in Canada in any meaningful way.\n\n\"The volumes involved are relatively small, and Canada simply doesn't have the scale to divert large amounts of beef away from the domestic market without disrupting other exports first.\"\n\nHowever, China is an important market for certain cuts of beef, so the reopening is important for Canadian farmers and ⁠beef exporters.\n\nBeef market analyst Jerry Klassen said: \"It's very important ​for Canadian beef farmers to have access to as ​many markets as possible. The Chinese market is very important because it has potential for significant growth.\"\n\nKlassen and the Canadian Cattle Association said the ‍details on the reopening ⁠were not yet available, so the full implications would only be understood once they were. However the association celebrated the resumption of trade.\n\nChina was Canada's fourth largest ⁠beef market in 2021, before being suspended in December of that year.\n\nChina can be a vital export market ‌for Canada when North America has a beef surplus and domestic prices ‌are low.",

    "fullText": "A tense scene unfolded in Willowbrook after a federal agent opened fire during an immigration operation on Wednesday morning, prompting a large response from local and federal authorities.\n\nA federal agent opened fire while conducting an operation in the parking lot of an apartment building near the intersection of 126th Street and Mona Boulevard. No one was hit, but it triggered a large response from authorities as crowds of people gathered amid the chaos.\n\nShortly after 7 a.m., U.S. Border Patrol informed the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department that the agency was conducting an operation in the area, according to LASD. The shooting occurred shortly afterward.\n\nIn a statement provided to ABC7, the Department of Homeland Security said the targeted operation began in nearby Compton, \"to arrest a violent criminal illegal alien from El Salvador, William Eduardo Moran Carballo, who is involved in a human smuggling operation and has two prior arrests for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.\"\n\nAn immigration judge issued Carballo a final order of removal in 2019, according to DHS.\n\nDHS says Carballo tried to evade arrest around 7 a.m. on Wednesday and rammed his vehicle into law enforcement. That's when one of the agents fired at Carballo, missing him, and he was taken into custody.\n\n\"In a dangerous attempt to evade arrest, this criminal illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement,\" the Homeland Security statement read. \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots. The criminal illegal alien was not hit and attempted to flee on foot. He was successfully apprehended by law enforcement. The illegal alien was not injured, but a CBP officer was injured.\"\n\nFurther details on the officer's injury were not provided.\n\nVideo provided to Eyewitness News by a neighbor shows the man leaving the apartment building, getting into his car and driving away. Seconds later, neighbors say Border Patrol tried to take him into custody, and that's when the shooting occurred.\n\nAlong with several federal agents in tactical gear, sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers responded to the scene.\n\n\"This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming,\" DHS said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI told ABC7 that the agency was not a part of the operation and said that an evidence response team was being sent to the scene.\n\nA large group of residents and activists gathered near the scene late Wednesday morning as more agents arrived, denouncing their presence.\n\nIncredibly tense situation in #compton right now. Residents and activists are confronting agents performing immigration enforcement @ABC7 pic.twitter.com/s1C0JXGwWz\n\n— Josh Haskell (@abc7JoshHaskell) January 21, 2026\n\nSome were seen holding Mexican flags and filming videos on their phone. At one point, the group was yelling at members of the sheriff's department.\n\n\"I saw the car crash... it was just crazy,\" said one resident who lives in the area. \"It's just crazy how they're coming over here and interrupting everybody's livelihood and their lives... this is just their lives.\"\n\nSome of the people who showed up are TikTokers who said they're working to be a voice for those who may be afraid.\n\n\"The federal ones... they like to come and go,\" said Angie Vargas, a local TikToker and live streamer. \"They like to move quick, so the fact that they're here and this incident happened, I think honestly, they came to the wrong city. A lot of us are out against what's going on, but yes, they are around our city, and I think there's a lot of us out here... supporting the community, being an extra set of eyes for them. That's why we're here. We're filming. We're bringing everything... the truth of what's going on, because there's a lot of people that are scared to come out and see what's going on.\"\n\n\"People are not going to work. They're causing disruptions. It's heartbreaking. It hurts. Why are you all here?\" said neighbor Andre Smith. \"I heard this is border patrol. If this is border patrol, ya'll need to go and patrol the border.\"\n\n\"It brings a lot of chaos to the kids, to people that have no citizenship. They're just here to work. That's why we're here to support our people,\" said Eric, whose family lives nearby. \"They've been taking people with citizenships just because of the color of our skin. We're tired of it already. We need them out of here.\"\n\nThere were some tense moments between the federal agents and protesters, but it appears no less-than-lethal rounds were fired and no protesters were arrested.",

    "fullText": "NASA astronaut Suni Williams, who famously stayed in space for an extended nine-month visit because of problems with an experimental capsule, has retired after 27 years, NASA said Tuesday.\n\nWilliams retired effective Dec. 27, NASA said in a statement. Williams, a former Navy pilot, joined NASA in 1988.\n\n\"Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in the statement.\n\nWilliams went on three missions to the International Space Station, the first of which was in 2006 and in which she was carried aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA said.\n\nBut it was the most recent, in 2024, in which the planned one-week stay stretched from June until March 2025 because of concerns over Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, which was on a test mission.\n\nStarliner launched June 5, 2024, taking Williams and Butch Wilmore to the space station on its first crewed flight. But there were problems with the capsule's thrusters during the docking process, and eventually, in September, NASA decided to return the capsule with no one on board.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore spent 286 days aboard the International Space Station.\n\nA SpaceX Dragon capsule was then sent up to bring the pair, as well as two other astronauts who were wrapping up a six-month mission, back to Earth. The Dragon capsule left the space station on March 18 and splashed down in the ocean off Florida.\n\nOver her career, Williams logged 608 days in space, which is the second-longest cumulative time in space in NASA history, the space agency said.\n\nShe also logged the most spacewalk time of any female astronaut, at 62 hours and 6 minutes, which is the fourth-most time of any NASA astronaut, it said.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have said they enjoyed their extended time living and working at the orbiting outpost, even though it was longer than expected.\n\n\"The plan went way off for what we had planned, but because we’re in human spaceflight, we prepare for any number of contingencies,” Wilmore said in late March, after they returned to Earth. “This is a curvy road. You never know where it’s going to go.”\n\nWilliams said her recovery on Earth after the longer-than-intended space stay was helped by her previous space flights.\n\n“Though it was longer than any flight either one of us have flown before, I think my body remembered,” she told NBC News in an interview alongside Wil\n\nWilliams called her career and the opportunities to serve at NASA an \"incredible honor.\"\n\n\"Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,\" she said in NASA's statement.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "Cruise passengers sailing to ports in Mexico should take note of a strict new law that just went into effect in the country.",
    "fullText": "Packing for a cruise comes with a lot of considerations — from what you’ll need on board the ship and in ports of call to what you shouldn’t bring for lack of space in your compact cabin or due to cruise line rules.\n\nCruise lines prohibit an array of items on their ships to ensure safe sailings, but those aren’t the only items that could get you into trouble for bringing on a cruise. The destinations you visit on a cruise also have their own sets of rules that cruise passengers need to keep in mind. Laws can change at any time, so it’s important to always double check travel guidance for your ports of call before a cruise, even if you’ve visited the destinations in the past.\n\nPassengers who are visiting cruise ports in Mexico, including Cozumel, Costa Maya, and Cabo San Lucas, on 2026 cruises are being warned about a strict new law that just went into effect in the country that applies to something many cruisers may have in their bags when coming ashore in ports of call.\n\nDoug Parker shared more details on the new ban in Mexico that cruise travelers visiting the country need to know about, and more cruise news, on the Jan. 21 edition of Cruise News Today.\n\nWant the latest cruise news and deals? \n\nCruise News Today with Doug Parker.\n\nGood morning, here's your cruise news for Wednesday, January 21st.\n\nA cruise passenger is missing after jumping overboard from a ship in the South Pacific. A 66-year-old American man jumped off of Star Breeze, operated by Windstar Cruises, early Sunday while the ship was sailing in French Polynesia.\n\nLocal reports say the incident followed an argument with his wife. The ship conducted an immediate search, joined later by French Navy patrol boats. The man has not been located, and the investigation is ongoing. The ship has since continued its itinerary.\n\nThis is the second man overboard of 2026.\n\nAnd cruise passengers heading to Mexico are being warned: leave your vapes on the ship.\n\nAs of January 17th, Mexico has banned the import, sale, and marketing of vapes and e-cigarettes. That means bringing a vape ashore during a port stop, even for personal use, could be considered illegal importation. Penalties include confiscation, fines up to $12,500, or even jail.\n\nCruise lines say vapes are still allowed on board in designated areas, but not ashore in Mexican ports. It should be noted that this is for all cruise ports in Mexico, not just Cozumel.\n\nAnd a follow-up to that story we brought you Monday, where opposition is growing against a proposed cruise port near the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay.\n\nNow, a Change.org petition started just four days ago has already collected more than 6,300 signatures. Local residents and environmental advocates say the development threatens fragile marine ecosystems and could overwhelm area infrastructure.\n\nThe 328-acre site near Rattlesnake Key is still very much in the planning stages. If approved, it would take three to five years to complete.\n\nAnd cruise stocks were down on Tuesday. Carnival Corporation: down 3.1%, 28.02, Royal Caribbean: down 2%, 270.01, Norwegian: down 7.5%, 20.37, and Viking: down 1.6%, 68.35.\n\nIf you have a lead on a story, let us know: tips@cruiseradio.net.\n\nI'm Doug Parker with Cruise News Today. Have yourself a great Wednesday.\n\n(The Arena Group will earn a commission if you book a cruise.)\n\nMake a free appointment with Come Cruise With Me’s Travel Agent Partner, Postcard Travel, or email Amy Post at amypost@postcardtravelplanning.com or call or text her at 386-383-2472.",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station say a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during the medical crisis.\n\nDuring their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused Wednesday to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason. It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of human spaceflight.\n\nNASA’s Mike Fincke said the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled. The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy.”\n\nIt was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights. “It really helped,” he said.\n\n“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises. But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.\"\n\nThe space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX. She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.\n\nJapanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.\n\n“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”\n\nJoining them on what turned out to be a 5 1/2-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched last August from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off the San Diego coast last week.\n\nWelcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who aren't due to launch until mid-February. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.\n\n“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Shortly after his arrest in early October, Little Village construction worker Juan Espinoza Martinez was led by three federal agents into a windowless interview room, still dressed in a green work T-shirt and carrying a small bottle of water.\n\n“You’re probably a little confused about what’s going on today, so I’m gonna try to explain it all to you,” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Christopher Perugini told Espinoza Martinez at the outset of the Oct. 6 videotaped interview, which was played for a federal jury Wednesday. “Feel free to ask me any questions you want.”\n\nThen, the agents laid it on Espinoza Martinez, a 37-year-old father of three, why he was there.\n\n“Murder for hire?” Espinoza responded, holding up his hands questioningly.\n\n“Correct, so that’s what the charge you’re charged with,” Perugini said. “I’ll explain it to you as we’re going.”\n\nThe agents then confronted Espinoza Martinez with text messages he’d sent an acquaintance that included a photo of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who was then the face of Operation Midway Blitz, along with what agents characterized as cash bounties for Bovino’s kidnapping and murder.\n\nOver the course of the interview, the agents pressed Espinoza Martinez repeatedly on how he thought the messages looked. He said over and over he meant nothing by it, that they were nothing more than social media chatter, and that he had no intention of making any actual offer for Bovino’s killing.\n\n“I’m really confused about this,” Espinoza said at one point in the interview. “I have no gang affiliation…I’m not nowhere around there. I work for a living every day. I’m a union worker. I work concrete, so I don’t know.”\n\nPortions of the videotaped interview were played for jurors in court Wednesday as the trial of Espinoza Martinez got underway before U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who has lived in Chicago for years but is not a U.S. citizen, is charged in an indictment with a single count of solicitation of murder for hire, which carries up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Espinoza Martinez told an acquaintance from the construction business, Adrian Jimenez, after an immigration agent shot a woman in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood on Oct. 4 “that he had dispatched members of the Latin Kings” to the area of 39th Street and Kedzie Avenue in response to the shooting.\n\nJimenez, who had worked as a government informant on and off for years, called up Homeland Security and shared the Snapchat messages that Espinoza Martinez had sent him saying, “2k on information when you get him” and “10k if u take him down,” along with Bovino’s photo, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney Minje Shin said the case was not about someone charged with “expressing strong, even angry, views about immigration enforcement policy” or a hatred of Bovino.\n\n“Make no mistake – the evidence in this case will show that what the defendant did was not a joke, not just mouthing off, not just him blowing off steam behind a keyboard, not political discourse … what the defendant did was a solicitation of murder,” Shin said.\n\nShin said Espinoza Martinez was “fixated” on Bovino, who was “the face of the threat” to arrest, detain, and deport members of his community in Little Village, a threat that “hit close to home.”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s attorney, Jonathan Bedi, told the jurors in his opening remarks that the case was “riddled” with reasonable doubt because “the government cannot point to anything that shows Juan’s intent.”\n\n“When you cut through all of their words…all they have is their guesses and speculation,” Bedi said. “They are guessing.”\n\nBedi says there were no bags of money, no follow up, no recordings, no discussion of any plans. No location scouting, no escape route, no surveillance, no communication saying “Bovino’s here now would be a good time to act.”\n\n“Repeating neighborhood gossip is not a federal crime,” he said.\n\nBefore the Espinoza Martinez’s taped interview was played, jurors heard testimony from the informant, Jimenez, who walked slowly into court with a pronounced limp from a back issue he’s been suffering.\n\nDressed in a blue suit, with a salt-and-pepper beard, Jimenez said he’s been in construction for decades and recently started his own construction business. He also was convicted in 2000 of a felony and spent several years in prison.\n\nThough the jury did not hear details of that case, court records show Jimenez’s conviction was for an armed robbery and home invasion in Franklin Park that was charged in 2000. He was later sentenced to six years behind bars.\n\nJimenez told the jury he’s known Espinoza Martinez for “less than a year.” The defendant first reached out to him on Snapchat, looking for construction work, he said.\n\nJimenez testified he took photos of the Snapchat messages received from Espinoza Martinez on Oct. 2 and “almost immediately” contacted agents with HSI about them.\n\nJimenez testifies he had conversations about immigration with Espinoza Martinez “more than a few times.”\n\nBut when Shin attempted to ask what they talked about specifically, the defense repeatedly objected and the judge sustained it.\n\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Dena Singer asked Jimenez a series of questions: You have a family, right? You work? You want to continue working and you want to continue staying in the U.S.? And you take care of your kids?\n\nJimenez answered “Yes” to all of them.\n\n“And you’re not somebody who commits murder-for-hire, right?” Singer asked,\n\nSinger also got Jimenez to acknowledge that Espinoza Martinez never asked him to take any action against Bovino or share the message with any wider audience.\n\nDid he ever say “Here’s where Bovino is going to be next?” Singer asked.\n\n“Did he ever say “Here’s a picture of cash,” or “I have someone who can pay you all this cash?'”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s trial is the first criminal case to stem from Operation Midway Blitz to go to trial.\n\nThough limited in scope, the case is expected to offer an important litmus test as immigration-enforcement operations continue to roil Chicago and other Democrat-led cities long targeted by President Donald Trump, including Minneapolis, where the killing of a U.S. citizen by an immigration agent earlier this month has sparked nationwide protests.\n\nThe case was held up by top Department of Homeland Security officials as an example of the violence and threats immigration agents were facing from gang members and even international drug cartels.\n\nIn the months since, however, evidence of Espinoza Martinez’s supposed gang affiliations has not materialized. Prosecutors vastly toned down that aspect of the case, first dropping mention of gang affiliation in the indictment handed up by a grand jury, then saying in a pretrial hearing they only intended to prove Espinoza Martinez had an “affinity” for the Latin Kings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the defense objected to prosecutors introducing a text string where Espinoza Martinez told an unidentified contact: “It’s going down bro my guys are ready in the vill (Little Village). Saints sd and 2Six being bitches. Kings on they ass n they scared.”\n\nProsecutors argued the conversation showed Espinoza Martinez was disappointed other gangs weren’t fighting back.\n\nBut Lefkow sided partially with the defense, saying the comments on Little Village can be shown to the jury, but not the references to the Latin Saints or Two-Six gangs.\n\nShe also excluded later text by Espinoza Martinez about “Chapo” having the Latin Kings’ back — a reference to former Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.",

    "fullText": "The hairstylist for the film \"The Cleaning Lady\" has clarified her comments about executive producer Timothy Busfield.\n\nShe said she was unaware her conversation with a detective was recorded and stressed she aimed to speak truthfully about her observations.\n\nTimothy Busfield, 68, who faces charges of sexual abuse involving a child actor and his twin, has denied all the allegations.\n\nDanielle Vigil, the hairstylist for \"The Cleaning Lady,\" is clarifying statements she made regarding Timothy Busfield following his arrest on child sexual abuse charges.\n\nVigil stated her previous comments, in which she said she saw Busfield kiss two kids on their foreheads in a trailer on set, were \"misconstrued\" and emphasized that she never intended to accuse anyone or speculate about the case.\n\nIn a statement to Us Weekly, Vigil explained that she had been contacted by a detective about a child-related investigation, which caused her \"significant emotional distress\" due to her personal history, as her daughter was tragically murdered several years ago.\n\nVigil said she initially felt \"caught off guard and fearful\" that the investigation might involve her own children or grandchildren.\n\n\"During the call, I expressed discomfort with continuing the conversation,\" she wrote. \"However, due to my lived experience with my daughter's unsolved murder, and my belief that silence and lack of cooperation can sometimes prevent justice, I ultimately chose to answer questions about what I had personally observed.\"\n\nShe emphasized that her aim was \"never to speculate, accuse, or harm anyone, but to speak truthfully about my own perceptions as requested.\"\n\nVigil noted that she was unaware the call was being recorded, saying, \"Had I been aware that my words were being recorded or that the detective would use the conversation to fit his narrative, I would have chosen my language more carefully and ensured that my statements were fully contextualized.\"\n\nShe added that she did not anticipate her comments would be used as part of official testimony against Busfield.\n\nExpressing frustration over how her statements were reported, Vigil said portions of her conversation were \"selectively presented in a manner that does not reflect the full context\" and misrepresented her intentions.\n\nVigil described submitting her clarification in the \"interest of accuracy, fairness, and transparency,\" insisting her goal has always been to tell the truth responsibly.\n\n\"This statement is not intended to interfere with any investigation,\" she added about her remarks being used in the Busfield case. \"It is solely meant to clarify my position, my intentions, and the circumstances under which my statements were made.\"\n\nThe hairstylist then noted, \"I have always believed in telling the truth and acting in good faith, especially when the safety of children is involved. I also believe that truth must be handled responsibly and in full context.\"\n\nBusfield, 68, faces charges including two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and child abuse.\n\nAccording to reports, the allegations involve inappropriate behavior toward a child actor and his twin on the set of Fox's \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which Busfield directed several episodes of.\n\nBusfield has denied the allegations, maintaining he had no physical contact with the children. After turning himself in, he spoke to TMZ, asserting, \"I'm going to confront these lies. They're horrible. They're all lies, and I did not do anything to those little boys. I'm going to fight it. I'm going to fight it with a great team, and I'm going to be exonerated. I know I am because this is all so wrong and all lies.\"\n\nDuring a hearing on January 21, Busfield was released ahead of trial. The judge ordered him to maintain communication with his attorney, refrain from possessing firearms, and avoid contact with the alleged victims. His next court date has not been scheduled yet.\n\nProsecutors had requested that Busfield remain in custody until his trial, describing him as \"an ongoing and serious danger to children and the community.\"\n\nIn a pretrial filing, the Bernalillo County District Attorney's office referenced what they characterized as a pattern of \"sexual misconduct, abuse of authority, and grooming behavior\" to justify his continued detention.\n\nIn response, Busfield's legal team argued in a 237-page court document that the boys' mother, whose children were replaced during filming, was seeking revenge against the director.\n\nThey also noted that Busfield had successfully completed an independently administered polygraph test and that a professional psychosexual evaluation determined he \"does not appear to have a sexual attraction to prepubescent or adolescent males or females.\"\n\nThe defense also submitted numerous character reference letters to the court from friends and family members, including his wife, actress Melissa Gilbert, who had not previously commented publicly on the allegations against Busfield.",

    "fullText": "If people don't go to the office, then all of the infrastructure built to support workers stops being viable.\n\nRemote and hybrid work are reshaping downtown economies, and restaurants are among the businesses feeling the impact most acutely.\n\n\"As remote or hybrid work continues to be popular, office attendance has fallen. Less in-person work may increase office vacancy rates and reduce foot traffic to other businesses located in office-dense areas,\" according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThat shift played out firsthand near my former office, where a Starbucks in the attached hotel closed after the pandemic.\n\nFor businesses, it's death by a thousand paper cuts. It's not the loss of any one customer, but thousands of them visiting less often.\n\nRestaurants, coffee shops, and bars have felt the pinch from hybrid work situations.\n\n“Even though you may be busy on Wednesday and Thursday, your Mondays and Fridays may be very slow,” Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance told CNBC. “If someone was to walk by a restaurant around lunch or dinner time on a Thursday, they may say, ‘Wow, that restaurant’s packed, they’re so busy,’ but it’s not like that every single day.”\n\n\"In cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta, the three-day in-person work week has posed challenges for hospitality businesses. With fewer workers in offices on Mondays and Fridays — which for some businesses were their strongest sales days — many businesses have been forced to shift work schedules or launch initiatives to pull in customers at the start and end of the week,\" CNBC reported.\n\nThis change in consumer behavior has forced an iconic Boston marketplace to close its doors forever.\n\nFood halls have been a growing trend in tourist areas, driven by the Covid shutdown of buffets. In Las Vegas, where there used to be buffets in nearly every hotel on the Strip, only a handful remain, and more food halls have opened.\n\nA modern take on the mall food court, food halls offer multiple restaurants under the same roof. Some even offer ordering via QR code, making it easy to have a meal where dishes come from multiple restaurants.\n\nThis concept has also been adopted in cities as a way to serve workers, and one of the best-known food halls, Time Out Market, located near Fenway Park, has decided to close its doors.\n\n\"Following the pandemic, we have seen the Boston Market recover and grow, and we have focused on initiatives driving further growth; however, footfall until today remains inconsistent in the area due to ongoing hybrid working and in addition, operating costs have increased — all of which prevents consistent profitability,\" Time Out Market CEO Michael Marlay said in a statement.",

    "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says ‘a lot’ of six-figure jobs in plumbing and construction are about to be unlocked because someone needs to build all these new AI centers",
    "description": "The AI boom is threatening white-collar entry jobs—but it’s creating a booming six-figure opportunity for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers.",
    "fullText": "The job market has been a tough sell for many Gen Z graduates, with tariffs, economic uncertainty, and artificial intelligence reshaping hiring plans across corporate America. But according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, the next wave of six-figure opportunities won’t be found in a Wall Street cubicle or Silicon Valley Slack channel. Instead, high-paying careers will partially come by picking up a wrench—literally.\n\nAs tech giants race to build sprawling data centers—totaling $7 trillion in global capital outlays by the end of the decade—Huang believes the world is on the cusp of what he calls the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” which will create “a lot of jobs.”\n\n“It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe hands-on skills needed to construct what he described as chip, computer, and AI factories are already facing shortages—even though many roles pay over $100,000 without requiring a college degree. One McKinsey report estimated that between 2023 and 2030, there will be a need for an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—in the U.S. alone.\n\n“Everybody should be able to make a great living,” Huang said. “You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Huang has expressed his optimistic outlook on new career paths emerging alongside AI.\n\n“The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom,” he told Channel 4 News in the U.K. last year. “You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.”\n\nThat optimism stands in contrast to warnings from leaders like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has repeatedly cautioned that AI is hollowing out traditional white-collar entry points—just as the education system continues to funnel students toward four-year degrees.\n\n“There’s more than one way to the American Dream, but our whole education system is focused on four-year [college] education,” Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year. “Hiring an entry worker at a tech company has fallen 50% since 2019. Is that really where we want all of our kids to go? Artificial intelligence is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”",

    "description": "Craft Ventures, the firm Sacks cofounded, previously announced that he had moved to the Austin area.",
    "fullText": "AI czar David Sacks said California is taking a potentially \"scary direction\" if voters approve a wealth tax on billionaires.\n\n\"This is not a tax, this is an asset seizure,\" Sacks told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nSacks, a longtime venture capitalist, is just one of the many voices in the tech industry who have denounced \"The Billionaire Act.\"\n\nCraft Ventures, the firm Sacks cofounded with Bill Lee, previously announced that Sacks had relocated to the Austin area in December. According to Bloomberg, Sacks is a billionaire and thus could have been subject to the tax.\n\nWhile the proposal is limited, Sacks said it would just be the beginning.\n\n\"It's not a one-time. It's a first time,\" he said. \"And if they get away with it, there'll be a second time and a third time. And this will be the beginning of something very new and different in this country.\"\n\nIf passed, California residents with a net worth of over $1.1 billion would face a one-time tax totalling 5% of their assets. (Residents with a net worth between $1 billion and $1.1 billion would pay a smaller tax.)\n\nGoogle cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin moved entities tied to them out of California ahead of the deadline. Other billionaires, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have said they won't leave the state.\n\nThe tax has yet to be approved. Supporters are still gathering enough signatures to put the issue before California voters this November. If they meet that threshold, a majority of voters would then need to support it. It's likely legal challenges would ensue as well.\n\nSacks said Gov. Gavin Newsom deserves blame for the current situation for not opposing the tax sooner and \"vocally\" enough.\n\nTara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom's office, pointed to the governor's history of questioning earlier wealth tax proposals going back to 2020.\n\n\"Clearly, David Sacks didn't know what he was talking about,\" she said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nIn recent weeks, Newsom has continued to step up his opposition to such a tax.\n\n\"I'll do what I have to do to protect the state,\" Newsom told The New York Times in an interview earlier this month.\n\nIn a separate interview, Newsom said the news that billionaires like Brin and Page were leaving the state was exactly the response he had feared. California is home to more billionaires than any other state.\n\n\"This is my fear. It's just what I warned against,\" Newsom told Politico. \"It's happening.\"",

    "title": "Brooklyn Beckham confirmed his family feud. PR experts are wincing — and say David and Victoria should stay silent.",
    "description": "Brooklyn Beckham recently confirmed long-standing rumors of a family feud. PR experts say David and Victoria Beckham should proceed with restraint.",
    "fullText": "If you're a publicist watching Brooklyn Peltz Beckham this week, you're probably wincing.\n\nOn Monday evening, the eldest in the Beckham brood confirmed long-standing rumors of a rift between himself and his parents, A-list power couple David and Victoria Beckham — although, through Brooklyn's lens, the rift appears closer to an impassable canyon.\n\n\"I do not want to reconcile with my family,\" Brooklyn wrote in a six-part Instagram Story. \"I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.\"\n\nWhile certainly juicy, Brooklyn's scathing accusations struck PR experts as less than shrewd.\n\n\"He didn't just light a match. He brought a flamethrower to the bridges,\" Mike Fahey, the founder and CEO of the PR agency Fahey Communications, told Business Insider.\n\nBrooklyn went on to accuse his parents of \"trying endlessly to ruin\" his relationship with his wife, Nicola Peltz Beckham, and soiling their 2022 wedding with \"anxiety and embarrassment.\" He also said his parents have planted unflattering stories in the tabloids about the couple, presumably referring to the frequent reports that painted Nicola as a controlling and all-consuming influence in Brooklyn's life.\n\n\"My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first,\" Brooklyn wrote.\n\nHe concluded the series of posts with an appeal that, given the extremity of his method, could be read as counterproductive: \"My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation.\"\n\nBrooklyn, Nicola, David, and Victoria did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. So far, no party has directly addressed Brooklyn's posts publicly.\n\nBrooklyn's statement immediately ignited a firestorm on social media, and an eruption of headlines followed suit. \"Brooklyn goes nuclear\" became a popular phrase, while some British tabloids framed the statement as an \"outburst\" or \"temper tantrum.\"\n\n\"It is wild to see that something that started as Deuxmoi posts and whispers on gossip sites has now gone so mainstream, and it's everywhere,\" Fahey said. \"Him doing this six-page Instagram Story takes this from speculation to, literally, a royal-family-style fracture — front-page news everywhere.\"\n\nIndeed, rumors of a Beckham family feud — Brooklyn and Nicola on one side, David and Victoria on the other — have been just that for years. Fans began to wonder if something was amiss when Nicola wore a Valentino wedding gown instead of a design by her fashionable mother-in-law, though Nicola repeatedly denied it was a snub. Still, tabloids ran wild with reports of unspecified \"tensions,\" sweeping accusations of narcissism, and unrealistic \"demands\" from one camp or the other, reaching a fever pitch when Brooklyn and Nicola were absent from his father's 50th birthday celebrations last year.\n\nNow, Brooklyn's communication strategy has shifted firmly away from off-the-record comments and anonymous sources who are \"familiar with the situation.\" In doing so, he's removed any option for plausible deniability. No longer can he or anyone in his orbit simply shrug off questions about their familial drama.\n\n\"This is obviously a drastic change,\" Fahey said. \"This isn't even a 180. It's like a 1,080.\"\n\nBrooklyn's bombshell comments contrast sharply with the Beckham family brand of elegant, unified self-promotion, which was honed over many years of public appearances, marketing campaigns, and, most recently, his-and-hers Netflix documentaries for David and Victoria.\n\n\"If this was vetted by a publicist, it wasn't a very good one, because the level of detail and the way it is written are not PR-savvy whatsoever,\" Fahey said of Brooklyn's statement. \"It comes across as unpolished. It is airing the family laundry.\"\n\nTara Goodwin, a crisis communications expert and author of \"Manage the Message, Change the Outcome: An Executive's Guide to Crisis Management,\" echoed Fahey's analysis, describing Brooklyn's approach as \"more emotional than strategic.\"\n\n\"He has the power to push the agenda and create a spectacle, and that's what he's trying to do,\" Goodwin said. \"What I would say to him if he were my client is, 'Take a breath.' Restraint gives you more choices, because once it's in the public domain, you think you're controlling the narrative, but you actually lose control of it.\"\n\nIf Brooklyn gave a crisis PR crash course in what not to do, his parents are more likely to take the safer route: silence.\n\nThe day after his son's complaints went live, David appeared on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" yet he smartly avoided mentioning Brooklyn by name. Instead, he advised general caution with social media, especially for kids.\n\n\"They make mistakes, but children are allowed to make mistakes. That is how they learn,\" David said. \"That is what I try to teach my kids. You sometimes have to let them make those mistakes as well.\"\n\nFahey described this comment as a masterclass in celebrity image management: \"That is a brilliant way of sending a message without saying anything of substance,\" he said.\n\nNot only would a direct public response to Brooklyn clash spectacularly with the established Beckham brand, but David and Victoria are famous and beloved enough that there's very little risk in staying mum.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to hurt the Beckham brand at this juncture,\" Goodwin said. \"If this is protracted and goes on, and he has more to say, there could be some reverberations, but at the moment, I think most people are going to see this for what it is. I​​t's a difficult family moment that probably should have remained private.\"\n\nMoreover, being the parents in this situation, meeting Brooklyn's energy would likely be perceived as petty or punching down. Even though Brooklyn is 26, he's still their son, and they stand accused of disrespecting his boundaries. Now that he's loudly and explicitly asking for space, David and Victoria would be wise to heed his wishes.\n\n\"If I'm their publicist, I'm like, 'Let's let this die down. Let's try to do something behind closed doors. Let's try to mend fences privately,'\" Fahey said. \"Having this play out in the court of public opinion is not going to benefit anyone.\"\n\nIf the goal here is neither fame (according to Brooklyn) nor money (Nicola is a billionaire heiress, and the Beckhams' net worth is nothing to scoff at, either), the only benefit left is narrative control. However, with a narrative as intimate and messy as this one, both Fahey and Goodwin agreed that it's not worth braving the internet's brutal jury.\n\n\"Maybe you air that out with your therapists and not millions of people online,\" Fahey said.",

    "fullText": "Bumble's chief product officer is out as the result of a recent leadership restructuring within the dating app company, Business Insider confirmed.\n\nMichael Affronti, Bumble's chief product officer and one of two executives who remained after Whitney Wolfe Herd was reinstated as CEO, has left the company after a year in the role.\n\nIn an end-of-year message to staff obtained by Business Insider, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd shared that she and Affronti, who was hired in January 2025, had \"mutually agreed that the best path forward for the company is to centralize Product, Engineering, and Design under one leader.\"\n\nVivek Sagi, previously the company's chief technology officer, now holds the new title of chief product and technology officer. A source familiar with the matter said that much of Bumble's engineering talent is based in Austin, where Sagi is based.\n\n\"I know this news will land differently across the organization,\" Herd wrote in the December note. \"Michael has been a strong leadership presence across Bumble, and I want to thank you all in advance for supporting one another as we move through this transition.\"\n\nAffronti was one of two remaining executives who worked under Lidiane Jones, who served as Bumble's CEO from January 2024 to March 2025. After Herd, who founded Bumble, announced her return as CEO in 2025, a string of executives left, including the company's CMO, CTO, CLO, and CBO.\n\nDavid Ard, Bumble's chief people officer, is the only C-suiter left at Bumble who was hired before March 2025, when Herd officially took over.\n\nIn her message to staff, Herd described a \"year of meaningful transformation for our company.\"\n\n\"Over the past several weeks, and in close partnership with our Board, we've taken a hard, honest look at where our business stands and what our members need from us right now,\" Herd wrote. \"What's become clear is that we need to sharpen our focus so we can stabilize our core, prioritize our product investments with intention, and set ourselves up for a confident return to growth.\"\n\nBumble had a rough 2025. The company's stock has fallen 52.35% in the last year.\n\nIn response to Herd's note, Affronti sent his own note to the company's staff.\n\n\"I have a strong, enduring belief in Bumble's mission and in our ability to return to growth and become a truly massive, category-defining business,\" Affronti wrote. \"I feel incredibly positive about the direction we're heading and the clarity we now have to operate in a way that lets our teams do their best work.\"\n\nBefore joining Bumble, Affronti served as a senior vice president and general manager at Salesforce. Jones, Herd's predecessor, came to Bumble from Salesforce as the former CEO of Slack.\n\nBumble announced Affronti's hiring on January 6, 2025. 11 days later, the company announced Jones' exit and Herd's reemergence as CEO.\n\nAffronti will now be \"cheering loudly from the outside,\" he wrote in his message.\n\nRead Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd's full message to staff:\n\nI want to share that, after thoughtful discussion, Michael and I have mutually agreed that the best path forward for the company is to centralize Product, Engineering, and Design under one leader. As a result, Michael will be departing Bumble today. We are incredibly grateful for the impact he has made during his time here and the care he brought to leading his teams, and we wish him the very best in what comes next.\n\nI know this news will land differently across the organization. For many of you who have partnered closely with Michael, it may feel especially significant; for others, it may feel less immediate. Michael has been a strong leadership presence across Bumble, and I want to thank you all in advance for supporting one another as we move through this transition.\n\nVivek will step in to lead Product alongside Engineering and Design.\n\nOver the past several weeks, and in close partnership with our Board, we've taken a hard, honest look at where our business stands and what our members need from us right now. What's become clear is that we need to sharpen our focus so we can stabilize our core, prioritize our product investments with intention, and set ourselves up for a confident return to growth.\n\nBringing these functions under one leader will provide clarity, tighter alignment, and a singular focus on what matters most: moving faster and delivering against our roadmap with more value to our members.\n\nMany of our cross-functional teams already know Vivek well - he has been deeply involved in our strategic and technical direction. Vivek has successfully led combined Product and Engineering teams at scale during his career and led them to deliver impact, giving us a proven model to build from. He brings a results oriented, steady, thoughtful approach that will continue to support our times through this next phase of work.\n\nIn the coming days, Vivek will connect with leaders across Product to ensure a smooth transition and to provide additional clarity when needed.\n\nThis has been a year of meaningful transformation for our company. Through it all, what continues to differentiate us is our talent: your resilience, your ambition, and your commitment to building products that impact our members in the most meaningful way possible. You've chosen to be here for our mission, every day, and I don't take that for granted. That is why we are building an environment where you can do the most impactful work of your career, and your engagement in this next phase is critical to our success.\n\nWe remain anchored in our three hubs - London, New York, and Austin - and now is the moment for focus. The path forward will require discipline, pace, and a shared commitment to outcomes. Let's channel our energy toward delivering for our members, our business, and each other.\n\nYou will hear more from me on our 2026 strategy during our Global All Hands on Wednesday.\n\nThank you for your partnership, your confidence, and the work ahead.\n\nDo you work at Bumble?

She's taking her own lessons as a founder, marketing exec, and investor in startups over to Bullish, a consumer-focused venture capital fund. She's joining the firm as a venture partner, the company exclusively told Business Insider.\n\nBullish has invested in several consumer hits, including Warby Parker, Harry's, Peloton, and Casper, Kaplan's former employer.\n\nBullish invests in early-stage startups, typically from pre-seed to Series A, Kaplan said. The categories she's most interested in span loneliness, dating, parenting, health, and identity and belonging.\n\n\"AI can be a tool to help those problems,\" Kaplan said, but she's acutely aware that not all AI is going to be a hit with real-life people.\n\nWhat does it take to get people to care about your product?\n\nCracking how to \"break through the noise\" helps, Kaplan said.\n\n\"What a consumer cares about is what is in it for them. What do we get out of it?\" Kaplan said. \"Founders are so used to pitching VCs that it's really hard to switch gears and start thinking about: Why should a customer care?\"\n\nWhen it comes to consumer-facing AI startups, brands need to think outside the box.\n\nKaplan said that \"contrarian\" plays can be useful when marketing a startup in a crowded space.\n\nFor instance, while so many tech companies are shouting AI from rooftops, some are strategically letting AI take a back seat.\n\n\"The best brands emerging are using AI, they're not necessarily making their startup fully based in AI,\" Kaplan said.\n\nKaplan pointed to Rocco, a smart fridge brand she angel invested in, as an example.\n\n\"It's a smart fridge, but the brand doesn't lead with 'AI-powered appliance,' it leads with design and functionality,\" Kaplan said. \"The AI makes the product better without becoming its identity, which is how they've managed to generate incredible buzz and traction in one of the most commoditized categories in consumer hardware.\"\n\nMarketing AI has been a tricky battlefield for brands.\n\nLook no further than the Friend AI ads across New York City. The ads promoting the startup's AI companion pendant were defaced by locals.\n\nOther marketing and advertising agencies, such as Day Job, are being tapped by AI companies specifically to help translate their brands to everyday people — in other words, potential customers.\n\nKaplan said startups trying to reach consumers have a unique tool at their disposal: creators.\n\nKaplan said the creator economy \"rewrote who controls distribution\" on social media by shifting who stirs buzz about brands and how people learn about them.\n\n\"Early adopters have really become the creators,\" she said.\n\nWhile startups previously toiled over customer acquisition cost (CAC), Kaplan said the big question now is: \"Who will carry the story out into the world and why will anybody listen?\"\n\n\"Distribution is no longer something you can buy,\" she said. \"You have to earn it.\"",

He said meetings with Swiss businesses, including watchmaker Rolex, influenced the decision.\n\nTrump said, \"all hell really broke out\" after he proposed the tariff rate.\n\n\"I was paid visits by everybody,\" he said. \"Rolex came to see me.\"\n\nTrump said that watch brands like Rolex had contributed to a trade deficit with Switzerland.\n\n\"But I realised, and I reduced it because I don't want to hurt people,\" he said of the tariff rate.\n\nAs it stands, there's a 15% cap on the tariff rate for Swiss imports.\n\nHowever, that rate could change again, Trump said. He said he initially planned a 30% tariff on Switzerland, then raised it to 39%, before lowering it to 15%.\n\n\"We brought it down to a lower level. Doesn't mean it's not going up, but we brought it down to a lower level,\" Trump said.\n\nSome US watch sellers have said higher tariff rates could lead Swiss watchmakers to raise prices, which could affect consumers.\n\nRolex didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nSwiss business leaders met with Trump last year to discuss the tariffs, and Rolex left him with a desk clock modeled after one of its iconic watches, watch publication Hodinkee reported.\n\nTrump had kind words for Swiss watchmakers at Davos.\n\n\"They make beautiful watches, great watches, Rolex, all of them,\" he said.",

    "description": "Taylor Swift slams Justin Baldoni in text messages sent to Blake Lively, court documents reveal.",
    "fullText": "The \"It Ends With Us\" press tour in the summer of 2024 was overshadowed by rumors and speculation of a feud between lead star Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, her costar and director.\n\nBut while the movie survived the backlash and went on to become one of the summer's biggest hits at the box office, grossing $350 million worldwide, the \"It Ends with Us\" drama didn't end there.\n\nIn December 2024, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, setting off a cascade of subsequent lawsuits brought by Lively, Baldoni, and even tangential characters like Baldoni's ex-publicist Stephanie Jones.\n\nIn June 2025, a judge threw out Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit. Baldoni was allowed to file an amended complaint, but in November, the judge formally ended the suit after the deadline for Baldoni to do so had passed.\n\nLively's original lawsuit against Baldoni is still ongoing with a trial set for May 18.\n\nIn January 2026, unsealed court documents revealed texts between Lively and her friend Taylor Swift, in which Swift called Baldoni a \"bitch\" and Lively referred to him as the \"doofus director of my movie.\"\n\nHere's everything we know about their feud and legal battle.\n\nEve Crosbie and Ayomikun Adekaiyero contributed to previous versions of this post.\n\nFans suspected something was amiss when Baldoni and Lively didn't interact during the press tour despite playing partners in the film.\n\nLively did press events with costars Brandon Sklenar and Isabela Ferrer and author Colleen Hoover, who wrote the book the film is based on. Baldoni did most of his press solo.\n\nWhen they both attended the New York premiere on August 6, they were not photographed together. Lively posed with her castmates, Hoover, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and Hugh Jackman, his \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" costar. Baldoni was photographed with his wife and some of the other producers who worked on the film.\n\nWhile speaking to Entertainment Tonight on the carpet at the New York premiere, Baldoni explained why he was stepping back from the limelight.\n\n\"This isn't my night — this is a night for all the women who we made this movie for,\" he said.\" This is a night for Blake, this is a night for Colleen. I'm just so grateful that we're here, five years in the making.\"\n\nOn social media, fans theorized about the potential drama between the two.\n\nThe speculation intensified after a user on the r/ColleenHoover subreddit noted on August 6, 2024 that Lively and Hoover did not follow Baldoni on Instagram. Fans also noticed that the film's other stars, including Sklenar, Ferrer, and Jenny Slate, did not follow Baldoni. Baldoni followed all of them except Hoover.\n\nBusiness Insider could not verify whether they previously followed Baldoni.\n\nAdding to this theory was a clip of Slate seemingly sidestepping a question about Baldoni at the movie's New York premiere. Asked about having Baldoni as both a scene partner and a director, she responded by not mentioning him and instead speaking about how \"intense\" it must be to do both jobs.\n\ni just found out about the whole 'it ends with us' cast drama and omg they asked her what it was like to work with justin and she completely ignored the question 💀 pic.twitter.com/2DdlmvxS4x\n\nMany fans began blaming Lively for the supposed feud, accusing her of trying to take over the film.\n\nThis theory was supported by Baldoni and Lively's interviews in the lead-up to the premiere.\n\nOn August 9, 2024, Baldoni told Today that Lively and Reynolds, who was not a producer on the film, contributed significantly to it.\n\n\"You can't summarize Blake's contribution in a sentence, because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,\" Baldoni said.\n\nBaldoni also said he struggled to balance allowing collaboration and having his voice drowned out entirely.\n\n\"You don't have to listen to everybody, and that didn't happen all the time, but there were just moments where I would get out of the way too much,\" he said.\n\nBaldoni said Lively should take over as director to adapt the sequel to the \"It Ends With Us\" novel, \"It Starts with Us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lively told E! News on August 7, 2024 that Reynolds helped pen the opening scene of \"It Ends With Us.\"\n\nThe film's screenwriter Christy Hal told People a day later that she wasn't aware that Reynolds had written some of the dialogue used in the final version of the script.\n\n\"When I saw a cut, I was like, 'Oh, that's cute. That must have been a cute improvised thing,'\" Hall said. \"So if I'm being told that Ryan wrote that, then great, how wonderful.\"\n\nFans also criticized how Lively promoted the movie, choosing to focus on its lighthearted and romantic elements instead of its heavy domestic abuse plot.\n\nBaldoni was the only cast member who consistently spoke about the domestic abuse element.\n\nAs online sentiment toward Lively turned increasingly negative, journalist Kjersti Flaa released an archival clip of an interview with Blake Lively on August 10, 2024 titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"\n\n\"It actually took me a while to get over the experience,\" Flaa told BI in an email on August 19, 2024 of the interview, which took place years earlier.\n\n\"Every time I entered a room after this I got nervous that something similar might happen again,\" she wrote.\n\nA post shared by Brandon Sklenar (@brandonsklenar)\n\nSklenar, who plays Lively's other love interest in \"It Ends With Us,\" spoke out about the backlash in an Instagram post on August 20, 2024.\n\n\"Colleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves. Vilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strongly in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about,\" he said.\n\n\"This film is meant to inspire. It's meant to validate and recognize,\" Sklenar added. \"It is not meant to once again, make women the 'bad guy,' let's move beyond that together.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Baldoni, Lively, Reynolds, Hoover, and Sklenar did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, inflicting \"emotional distress,\" and conspiring to damage her public reputation.\n\nLively's complaint also named Wayfarer Studios, Baldoni's production company, and Jamey Heath, the company's CEO, as two of the 11 defendants.\n\nIn the complaint, Lively said an all-hands meeting about Baldoni and Heath's behavior on set was held in January 2023. She accused him of showing her nude videos and images of women, improvising kissing scenes or intimate scenes, and entering her trailer while she was naked.\n\nLively said Heath and Baldoni responded by hiring Melissa Nathan, a crisis PR representative, and Jed Wallace, a Texas-based contractor, both defendants in the complaint, to orchestrate a \"multi-tiered\" plan to \"destroy\" her public reputation and stop her or anyone else from speaking out about what happened on set.\n\nShe also said that the cast agreed to a marketing plan created by the film's distributor, Sony Pictures Entertainment, to avoid talking about the sad parts of the movie, which Baldoni broke away from.\n\n\"What the public did not know was that Mr. Baldoni and his team did so to explain why many of the Film's cast and crew had unfollowed Mr. Baldoni on social media and were not appearing with him in public,\" the complaint said.\n\nBryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, told BI in a statement after the complaint was filed: \"It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to 'fix' her negative reputation, which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions.\"\n\nFreedman said Nathan was hired because Lively made multiple demands and threatened not to show up to set or promote the film if they were not met.\n\nWhen asked to respond to Freedman, a representative for Lively referred BI to a statement shared with The New York Times on December 21, 2024: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\"\n\nOn December 24, 2024, publicist Stephanie Jones sued Baldoni, his film studio, Melissa Nathan, and Jennifer Abel, a former employee of Jones' PR company, for breach of contract and defamation.\n\nIn the suit, Jones alleged Baldoni and the PRs orchestrated a smear campaign against Lively while her company was working with Baldoni. Jones said this was done behind her back until August 2024, when Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios stopped working with the company and worked directly with Abel.\n\nA post shared by Amber Tamblyn (@amberrosetamblyn)\n\nLively's costars from 2005's \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" — America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledel — shared a joint statement supporting Lively after she made the complaint.\n\nHoover and Sklenar, who worked on \"It Ends With Us,\" seemed to both throw their support behind Lively by sharing links to her allegations on their Instagram stories.\n\n\"@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient since the day we met,\" Hoover wrote in her story post. \"Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt.\"\n\nHoover has since deleted her Instagram, TikTok and Threads account.\n\nRepresentatives for Hoover did not immediately respond to a comment request from BI.\n\nOn December 21, 2024, The New York Times reported that Ari Emanuel, chief executive of the parent company that owns Baldoni's talent agency, William Morris Endeavor, said the agency had stopped representing him.\n\nOn December 9, 2024, before the complaint was released, Vital Voices, a nonprofit organization that supports women leaders, awarded Baldoni the Voices of Solidarity Award to honor his advocacy work for women.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Vital Voices said in a statement on their website that they had rescinded the award.\n\n\"The communications among Mr. Baldoni and his publicists included in the lawsuit — and the PR effort they indicate — are, alone, contrary to the values of Vital Voices and the spirit of the Award,\" the statement read.\n\nBaldoni, Wayfarer Studios, and others mentioned in a New York Times story that detailed Lively's accusations against Baldoni filed a lawsuit against the newspaper on December 31, 2024.\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by BI, said the Times' story published on December 21, 2024 \"relied almost entirely on Lively's unverified and self-serving narrative\" and accused the publication of \"disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, contained screenshots of messages that it said contradicted the Times' reporting.\n\nIn a statement provided to BI after the lawsuit was filed, a Times spokesperson said the newspaper stood by its reporting and would \"vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\"\n\n\"Our story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article,\" the statement said.\n\nThe outlet also published its full statement responding to the allegations.\n\nIn a statement provided to BI after Baldoni's lawsuit was filed, Freedman, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said Lively had orchestrated a \"vicious smear campaign\" and that the Times \"cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful 'untouchable' Hollywood elites.\"\n\nFreedman also said that they would also sue other individuals \"who have abused their power to try and destroy the lives of my clients.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to BI about Baldoni's suit, Lively's lawyers said: \"Nothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively's California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint.\"\n\nThe same day Baldoni filed his lawsuit against the Times, Lively filed a lawsuit against him, Wayfarer, and others in New York federal court.\n\nRepresentatives for Lively said the lawsuit, which was obtained by BI, was based on the legal complaint Lively previously filed with the California Civil Rights Department. The lawsuit accuses Baldoni and his PR team of engaging in a campaign to retaliate against her for speaking out about sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Ms. Lively's decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks,\" her lawyers said in a statement provided to BI. \"As alleged in Ms. Lively's federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Baldoni and Wayfarer did not address the lawsuit filed by Lively when reached by BI.\n\nOn January 7, Freedman told SiriusXM's \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" that his team planned to take further legal action.\n\nFreedman also alleged Reynolds used his influence to help Lively take over \"It Ends With Us\" and to mock Baldoni on \"Deadpool and Wolverine,\" via a new character in the film called Nicepool.\n\nIn the film, which premiered in July 2024 and was the second-highest-grossing movie of 2024, Nicepool, a version of Deadpool from an alternate dimension whose face has not been disfigured, jokes about a woman's pregnancy weight, claims to be a feminist and wears a man bun.\n\nFreedman alleged this was based on Baldoni, who has a reputation for being a feminist and has been known to wear his hair in a bun in the past.\n\nIn the movie, Nicepool is eventually killed by Ladypool, a female version of Deadpool from an alternate dimension played by Lively.\n\n\"What I make of that is that if your wife is sexually harassed, you don't make fun of Justin Baldoni,\" Freedman said. \"You don't make fun of the situation. You take it very seriously. You file HR complaints. You raise the issue and you follow a legal process. What you don't do is mock the person and turn it into a joke.\"\n\nOn January 16, 2025, Baldoni, his associates at his company Wayfarer Studios, and his publicists Nathan and Abel sued Lively, her publicist Leslie Sloane, and her husband Ryan Reynolds, alleging they orchestrated a smear campaign against him.\n\nBaldoni's lawsuit, which seeks $400 million in damages, alleges that Lively, with the help of Reynolds and Sloane, hijacked \"It Ends with Us\" by wresting creative control away from Baldoni, then worked to destroy his reputation and livelihood.\n\nThe suit, which contains many of the same details from Baldoni's defamation suit against the Times, also claims that Reynolds pressured the talent agency WME, which also represents Lively and Reynolds, to drop Baldoni.\n\nThe agency did so in December but a WME spokesperson previously denied Reynolds and Lively put pressure on the agency.\n\nFreedman told BI that their suit was \"based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team's duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni.\"\n\n\"Justin and his team have nothing to hide,\" the statement adds, \"documents do not lie.\"\n\nLively's legal team said Baldoni's team's suit is another attempt to \"shift the narrative\" from one about harassment claims to one around battles for creative control.\n\n\"This latest lawsuit from Justin Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios, and its associates is another chapter in the abuser playbook,\" Lively's legal team said. \"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim.\"\n\nIn Lively's complaint, Lively said Baldoni acted as himself instead of Ryle while filming a slow-dance sequence for the romance film.\n\n\"At one point, he leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, 'it smells so good,'\" the complaint read. \"None of this was remotely done in character, or based on any dialogue in the script, and nothing needed to be said because, again, there was no sound.\"\n\nHer team alleged Lively later objected to this behavior and said Baldoni replied, \"I'm not even attracted to you.\"\n\nOn January 21, Baldoni's production company and lawyer hit back by sending a nearly 10-minute behind-the-scenes footage of the cast filming the scene to outlets including the Daily Mail.\n\nBaldoni's team said in a statement at the beginning of the video that the footage contains three takes filmed on May 23, 2023, and said these were the only versions filmed of the scene.\n\n\"Both actors are clearly behaving well within the scope of the scene and with mutual respect and professionalism,\" they added.\n\nThe video also showed that the initial direction in the \"It Ends With Us\" script is that Baldoni and Lively's characters just dance together.\n\nIn the takes, Baldoni repeatedly moves in to kiss Lively, and Lively pulls away and says it would be better if they talked during the scene. At one point, Baldoni rubs his face on both sides of Lively's neck seemingly without warning, but the pair joke about it in the video.\n\nThe video has elicited a range of responses on social media. Some users thought Lively looked uncomfortable, while others believed Lively was attracted to her costar.\n\nLively's attorneys sent a statement to The Hollywood Reporter after the video was published, saying that the footage corroborated Lively's story because \"every moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\"\n\n\"The video shows Ms. Lively leaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk. Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively's discomfort,\" the statement said.\n\n\"They will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent.\"\n\nLively's attorneys also said that Baldoni's choice to release the video to the media instead of presenting it to court was an \"unethical attempt to manipulate the public\" and a \"continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign.\"\n\n\"While they are focused on misleading media narratives, we are focused on the legal process,\" her attorneys said.\n\nFreedman responded in a statement sent to Business Insider via email on Wednesday: \"Prior to filing her lawsuit in court, Ms. Lively went to The New York Times in an effort to publicly destroy Justin Baldoni. When Mr. Baldoni exercises his right to publicly defend himself by putting forth actual facts and evidence, for Ms Lively and team this instantly becomes morally and ethically wrong.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"Ms. Lively wants very different standards to apply to her but fortunately, truth and authenticity apply to everyone and can never be wrong. Looking at the video and the evidence to come, I can understand why Ms. Lively would now, not want this to play out in public.\"\n\nIn February 2025, Baldoni's lawyers launched a website containing two documents related to his legal battle with Lively.\n\nThe first is an amended version of Baldoni's $400 million counter-lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds.\n\nIn the amended complaint, Baldoni's team claims that the metadata on The New York Times' website shows that the publication had access to Lively's civil rights complaint at least 11 days before publishing its report on Baldoni's alleged smear campaign, titled \"'We Can Bury Anyone': Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\"\n\nAnother update in the lawsuit took aim at Lively's husband and accused him of using the character of Nicepool in \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" to bully Baldoni, saying that the \"caricature of a 'woke' feminist\" was a \"transparent and mocking portrayal of Reynolds' warped perception of Baldoni.\"\n\nThe second document on the new site is a 168-page \"timeline of relevant events\" related to the feud and the movie's production. The timeline dates from January 2019, when Baldoni approached Hoover about adapting her novel, to January 2025.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman said: \"The decision to amend our lawsuit was a logical next step due to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light.\"\n\nVariety reported that the Times has disputed \"inaccuracies\" in Baldoni's complaint.\n\nOn June 9, US District Judge Lewis Liman dismissed Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit, in which the actor and director accused Lively of taking creative control of \"It Ends with Us\" and damaging his reputation. The suit also alleged that Lively had falsely accused Baldoni of sexual harassment as a way to take control of the production.\n\nThe countersuit had previously been combined with a separate suit Baldoni had filed against The New York Times and Lively's publicist Leslie Sloane, which accused Sloane of planting rumors to smear Baldoni in the press and the Times of facilitating their circulation.\n\nJudge Liman ruled that Lively's claims of sexual harassment were legally protected and immune from a lawsuit. Liman is still weighing whether to dismiss Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni.\n\nOn October 31, Judge Liman officially ended Baldoni's lawsuit against Lively.\n\nLiman stated in his order that he contacted all parties on October 17 that his final judgment to conclude the case was coming soon. Only Lively responded. With Baldoni's side missing the deadline to continue to claim, the judge dismissed the lawsuit.\n\nLively's original lawsuit against Baldoni is still ongoing. A court date is set for May 18.\n\nOn January 20, 2026, following Judge Liman's ruling that both parties release evidence before a hearing to dismiss the May trial, Lively's team released documents, including depositions and text messages.\n\nThey included text exchanges between Lively and her friend Taylor Swift. In one, Swift referred to Baldoni as a \"bitch,\" writing to Lively before the New York Times story ran, \"I think this bitch knows something is coming because he's gotten out his tiny violin.\"\n\nA year prior to that text, Lively referred to Baldoni as the \"doofus director of my movie\" in a text to Swift.\n\nThe deposition of Lively's \"It Ends With Us\" costar Jenny Slate was also among the unsealed documents. In it, she describes an alleged incident on set where Baldoni said to her, \"I can say this because my wife is here, but you look sexy in what you're wearing.\"\n\nSlate said the comment was \"not appropriate\" on set or in \"any workplace.\"\n\n\"The comment was about me, not my character. It wasn't useful for my work. It wasn't anything I wanted. It was unwanted and had no place, in my professional experience,\" Slate said in her deposition.\n\nTexts by Slate were also released. In one, she described Baldoni as \"a fraud.\"\n\nIn another message, she called him \"the biggest clown and the most intense narcissist.\"\n\nBaldoni's team has yet to release its evidence.\n\nBryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, told Business Insider in a statement that \"the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law\" and pointed to messages from Sony discussing Lively's behavior.\n\n\"A simple read of the newly released message exchanges makes the truth abundantly clear. We remain confident in the legal process and clearing the names of all of the Justin Baldoni parties.\"\n\nReps for Lively, Swift, and Slate did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "America's economy has never been stronger.\n\nAt least that's what President Donald Trump told the Davos audience on Wednesday. From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump framed his economic agenda as one centered on affordability.\n\nTrump repeatedly credited his policies for lowering everyday costs, and promised more savings in the future. But the reality is slightly different.\n\nAs Americans navigate a brutal job market and climbing cost of living, Business Insider dove into the data behind the president's Davos speech.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The price of gasoline is now below $2.50 a gallon in many states… Soon it will be averaging less than $2 a gallon.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The average price of gasoline in the US was $2.81 a gallon as of January 19, nearly half of what it was during a 2022 high. Gas prices haven't been below $2 since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAs of January 21, AAA reported that ten states have an average gas price at or below $2.50.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Homes are built for people, not corporations. America will not become a nation of renters. We're not going to do that. That's why I've signed an order banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump signed an executive order targeting institutional investors this month — but it's unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, largely in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The cost of prescription drugs is coming down by up to 90%.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The president is negotiating with some pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of drugs and has launched TrumpRx, a government-run, direct-to-consumer prescription platform aimed at connecting people with cheaper medications. Trump's healthcare plan, released last week, outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums while maximizing transparency for Americans.\n\nEnhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired in December because of Republican opposition in Congress, leading to a spike in premiums for millions of Americans on marketplace plans. January data shows that, with rising costs, at least 1.4 million Americans dropped their healthcare plans between 2025 and 2026.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that the enrollment decline is \"entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act also proposed changes to Medicaid, including stricter work requirements for enrollees and a federal funding reduction of $1 trillion over the next ten years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump has called on Congress to cap credit card rates that have \"ripped off\" consumers. In the third quarter of 2025, the most recently available data, American credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nThis proposal has received bipartisan support, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders pushing for a similar credit card cap. \"Trump even acknowledge the bipartisan appeal, telling CNBC's Joe Kernen Wednesday that the proposal sounds like something \"the mayor of New York maybe came up with.\"\n\nBank and business leaders are largely opposed, arguing that a 10% cap would prevent companies from adequately pricing subprime credit risk.",

I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "description": "Expect to see clips from \"Stranger Things\" and Pete Davidson's podcast sometime this year.",
    "fullText": "The funny thing about smartphone addiction is that it makes low-effort tasks feel totally productive. When I finally quit doomscrolling through Instagram and TikTok and watch an actual movie or TV show, I feel like I've just spent the afternoon studying physics. Platforms like Netflix, which could once be seen as time-wasting entertainment, now seem like antidotes to endless, useless scrolling.\n\nBut Netflix doesn't seem to appreciate its new role. Instead, the company apparently sees short-form video apps—and smartphones themselves—as a direct threat to its business, and is jumping on the bandwagon. It's not only that Netflix is reportedly now making content with phone scrollers in mind, encouraging creators to craft dialogue that makes their shows and movies easy to understand even if you're not actually paying attention.\n\nNo Netflix also wants to position its mobile app as an actual competitor to TikTok and Instagram, by introducing a short-form video feed directly within the app.\n\nThe company officially introduced its plans for short-form video during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters announced the company will roll out a new app later this year that will include its take on the vertical video feed. This isn't totally new, as the company has been experimenting with vertical video feeds since May. But it's the first time we've seen a larger announcement about how Netflix plans to integrate the short-form experience directly into its app.\n\nUnlike TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, you won't hop on the Netflix app to find short-form videos from independent creators. Instead, Netflix will serve users clips from Netflix-distributed shows and movies in a scrollable TikTok-style feed. You might swipe through this feed and see clips from Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, or His & Hers. Many of us already waste our time watching clips from shows and movies on other platforms—often cropped, slowed down or sped up, in low-quality, and besieged by artifacts meant to throw off copyright claims. Netflix obviously won't need to do this, so I expect the experience will be filled with high-quality videos (depending on how you define \"quality\" of course).\n\nIt won't just be TV shows and movies on the feed. Netflix also has big plans for its video podcasts, as evidenced by recent programs like The Pete Davidson Show and recent deals with Spotify and iHeartMedia to bring existing podcasts to its platform. Expect Netflix to sprinkle clips from these video podcasts into the short-form feed to create an experience that sounds not too far off from scrolling through other apps. How many clips you do see from video podcasts, TV shows, and movies on TikTok?\n\nAs Netflix inches closer to acquiring Warner Bros., you might soon be seeing a lot of official short-form content in the Netflix app. If and when the acquisition closes, I wouldn't be surprised to see clips from HBO shows like A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, The White Lotus, and Euphoria.\n\nI get the move from a business perspective: Netflix is likely losing subscribers' attention due to the addictive nature of vertical video apps. But do any of us really need another app to scroll through, especially when we're already paying for access to the full content to begin with? Maybe could be a helpful avenue to find new shows and movies to watch, but in all likelihood, it will just be be another addictive time-waster. I have too many of those in my life as it is.",

    "fullText": "A malicious ad-blocking extension on Chrome and Edge is using the ClickFix attack to infect devices with a remote access payload capable of spying on and taking over a system.\n\nNexShield pitched itself as a privacy-focused ad blocker from the developer of well-established and highly trusted uBlock Origin. However, as security firm Huntress found, the extension initiates a variation of the ClickFix attack that has been dubbed \"CrashFix\"—a reference to the browser crash that precedes the fake security warning and malicious command prompt.\n\nAs BleepingComputer describes, the NexShield extension creates a denial-of-service (DoS) loop that exhausts your device's memory, ultimately freezing Chrome or Edge and causing it to crash. When the browser restarts, the extension displays a pop-up with a \"Run Scan\" button to identify \"potential security threats that may compromise your browsing data,\" leading users to believe that the crash resulted from a security issue.\n\nIf you follow through, you'll see another fake window with instructions for executing commands in the Windows command prompt. This is the ClickFix attack: a form of social engineering that relies on fake error messages, CAPTCHAs, and command prompts to trick users into deploying malware onto their own devices.\n\nIn this case, the extension copies a command to the clipboard, and if users enter the keystrokes in the fake pop-up, downloads and executes a malicious script. After a 60-minute delay to avoid detection, NexShield delivers the payload that can run commands, fingerprint systems, and elevate privileges.\n\nNote that as of this writing, NexShield has been removed from the Chrome Web Store.\n\nIf you've installed NexShield, you should uninstall it and perform a full system cleanup to clear its payloads from your device. (We've got step-by-step guides to removing malware from your Mac and your PC.)\n\nAs general protection against similar attacks, only install browser extensions from trusted sources. This isn't a guarantee that you'll never encounter a malicious add-on in the Chrome Web Store or in other browsers, as hackers occasionally manage to sneak through the approval process and even get their extensions labeled as trusted or verified. Some extensions are only later injected with malicious code, essentially \"waking up\" their ability to attack.\n\nBefore installing a new extension, carefully check the creation date, reviews and ratings, and even the name, as malicious add-ons will often impersonate trusted ones (or, as in the case of NexShield, piggyback on legitimate brands like uBlock Origin). Watch for suspicious permissions—if the extension requests access to data or actions that seem excessive or are unrelated to its core function, it might be malware.\n\nFinally, never run codes or commands on your machine copied from websites or communication that you don't understand, and always verify instructions with an independent, trusted source. For this specific campaign, Huntress has other indicators of compromise you can look for on your system.",

    "title": "How to Follow Any Workout Video, Even If You're an Absolute Beginner",
    "description": "Including how to substitute easier exercises, and what to do when you just can't keep up.",
    "fullText": "A workout habit has a way of building momentum: Once you’re doing something, anything, it’s easy to build on that. Video workouts are a simple way to get started, but if you're having trouble following along, I'm here to help. Below are some ways to make common exercises more accessible, and what to do if you can't get through a whole video yet.\n\nLots of “easy” bodyweight programs ask you to perform a squatting motion without any added weight. But if that’s already more than you can do, try one of these instead:\n\nSit in a chair, and stand back up.\n\nLean your back against a wall and slide down until you’re in a sitting position (this is called a wall squat).\n\nHold onto a countertop or the back of a chair while you do a squat.\n\nFor any of these, it’s okay to squat as low as you can, even if that’s not all the way to parallel. You can work on going lower over time.\n\nPushups are another move you’ll find in simple beginner workouts, but not everyone can do a pushup on their first day. Pushups get easier the higher your hands are, and harder the higher your feet are. So for the easiest beginner version, put your hands on a wall around shoulder height. Lean into the wall, then push yourself back to a standing position.\n\nOnce those become easy, choose a lower surface, like a table or countertop. Then move to a chair, and so on. This progression is arguably better than doing pushups on your knees, because no matter which level you’re on, you are practicing holding your entire body straight in a plank position.\n\nDumbbells come in all sizes—and fortunately for beginners, the smallest ones are also the cheapest. If your gym doesn’t have dumbbells small enough, any store with a sporting goods section will likely have some one- and two-pound dumbbells you can pick up and add to your gym bag.\n\nBut if you’re not even ready for dumbbells, that’s okay. A half-liter water bottle weighs about a pound. Same with a can of soup. Larger water bottles, wine bottles, and milk jugs can take you up a bit further in weight; we did the math for you here. You can also hold books, roller skates, or tote bags full of literally anything. (Two water bottles in a grocery bag? That’s a two-pound weight.)\n\nNeed to start even lighter? It’s okay to do weight workouts using literally nothing. Make your hands into fists and go through the motions. If you’re following a video that does a million reps of bicep curls or tricep extensions, your arms will get tired even if they’re empty. Just move up to the water bottles as soon as you’re ready.\n\nWith these substitutions, you may feel ready to start following along with beginner level workout videos. But what if you can’t handle exactly what’s on the screen? Remember, your goal should be to do a workout at your current level of fitness, not to complete a certain number of reps that you theoretically could do if you were in better shape. So if the video asks for 30 seconds of pushups but you can only manage a few reps, do as many as you can and rest for the remainder of the time.\n\nIt’s fine to bounce from video to video until you find something at your level. Keep an eye out for one that seems like fun but is just out of your reach. Do it anyway, modifying it or resting as needed, and then bookmark it and come back to it next week. Chances are good you’ll be able to keep up a little bit better—and if you keep coming back to that same workout week after week, you’ll eventually master it. Consistency breeds momentum.\n\nLet’s say you want to do a workout from a Peloton-like cycling instructor. You’ve got your bike, you can pedal, but pretty quickly you’re out of breath and feel like you can’t keep going.\n\nThese workouts are easy to adjust: All you have to do is pay attention to the instructor’s voice and facial expressions and ignore any specific numbers. It doesn’t matter if she’s asking you for a “20” or a “50.” If the instructor looks and talks like she’s on an easy bike ride, adjust your resistance so you are on an easy bike ride. If she looks like she’s working hard but not dying, adjust your resistance so you are working hard but not dying.\n\nStart literally anywhere. There isn’t a wrong answer. Maybe you start doing cardio dance videos, but it turns out you hate dancing. Well, you’re already moving your body a couple times a week, so you can swap out the dancing for something else.\n\nOr maybe you start doing pushups every day, but after a while your wrists are aching. You can choose to address that problem and continue your pushups, or you can look back on how far you’ve come, congratulate yourself, and pick a different thing to try for the next chapter of your fitness journey. After all, you’ve already started, so why not keep going?",

    "description": "The statement comes about a week after OpenAI announced ads are coming to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "A week after OpenAI admitted it will soon start testing ads in ChatGPT, Google has promised that it's not planning to inject ads into Gemini anytime soon.\n\nThe statement was given to journalist Alex Heath during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the company doesn't have \"any plans\" for ads in Gemini. While the statement was fairly brief, it also jibes with a similar quote Hassabis gave to Axios, where he said he was \"a little bit surprised\" that OpenAI was already introducing ads to ChatGPT.\n\nThat surprise is understandable, especially because OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2024 that he considered ads a \"last resort for us as a business model.\" But looking at the numbers, it makes sense that ChatGPT is getting ads long before Gemini is even thinking of them.\n\nWhile Google makes most of its money through showing people ads, it's also able to rely on Search and YouTube to push ads to most of those eyeballs. Meanwhile, OpenAI is pretty much just ChatGPT. As the latter moves to a for-profit model, it now has to put moneymaking first, something it's had trouble doing without relying on traditional internet moneymakers like ads. Google, meanwhile, is already profitable elsewhere, and is able to take its time and use its sheer size to keep Gemini ad-free, at least while it continues to chase market share.\n\nDoes this mean Google's AI will never get ads? Well, never say never. But it does mean that they're probably not on the horizon—even if Google plans to more aggressively monetize Gemini over the long term, it isn't facing the same kind of time crunch as Altman's company.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the presence of ads will push users away from ChatGPT, but the move comes in the wake of significant wins for Gemini and one major loss for ChatGPT. First, Google's Nano Banana image editing model went viral on social media, winning over the general public. Then, Google struck a deal with Apple to put its AI into the iPhone, and it looks like Gemini will be powering Siri for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT reportedly saw a 6% dip in users early last month, following a model update from Gemini—and that was before the introdution of ads. While ChatGPT still seems to be in the lead on total user count, there's evidence that Google is catching up.\n\nThe divide in strategy seems clear: As OpenAI seeks ways to get more money out of its existing user base, Google can focus on growing its own with new integrations into the products we already use every day. I can't say what the limits of this growth are, but I can say that I rarely go out of my way use AI, yet I've still found myself accidentally relying on Google's AI overviews every now and then. If Google can get more people like me to casually integrate AI into our regular workflows, it's possible we could soon have a new AI leader on our hands.",

    "title": "I Tried Strava's New 'Instant Workouts' Feature, and It Isn't Great",
    "description": "The rollout leaves a lot to be desired.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month Strava unveiled its new Instant Workouts feature, a subscriber-exclusive tool that seems like a natural way to leverage its acquisition of Runna. In a Reddit post, Strava said this feature builds upon Runna's already successful Instant Workouts feature.\n\nInstant Workouts uses your activity history to generate personalized workouts across four intents (\"Maintain,\" \"Build,\" \"Explore,\" or \"Recover\"). The idea is that the more you upload, the more personalized your recommendations become. Another major selling point is the automatic route generation feature, which draws on Strava's massive database of billions of historical activities to suggest optimal paths for each workout.\n\nThe timing of this rollout seems deliberate as the company positions itself for its anticipated IPO. And on paper, it sounds like exactly the kind of innovation that would indeed justify a Strava subscription. In practice, however, the execution leaves a good bit to be desired.\n\nUnfortunately, the feature's current implementation falls far short of its potential. The most glaring issue: You cannot actually view your workout details once you've started the activity in the app. Strava generates solid, complex, multi-interval workouts—but provides no way to reference them on your watch during your run or ride. You'd have to screenshot the workout beforehand or print it out.\n\nFor the majority of us athletes who rely on our devices to guide interval training, pace targets, and recovery periods, this renders the feature practically useless. Strava has acknowledged this limitation in a Reddit post, promising that device integration for Garmin and Apple watches is \"coming soon.\" But the timeline for that \"soon\" is questionable at best.\n\nThe relationship between Strava and Garmin has reportedly grown frosty following a lawsuit last fall, and there's little incentive for Garmin to prioritize features that primarily benefit Strava's subscription revenue and investor appeal. Without Garmin's cooperation and swift implementation, a significant portion of Strava's serious athlete user base remains locked out of the feature's full utility.\n\nOn the bright side, in my opinion, the workouts themselves show promise—though others disagree. The training plans generated appear to take into account individual fitness levels reasonably well. From my testing, the prescribed intervals, pacing, and progression made sense given my current training status and recent activity history.\n\nThat said, user experiences vary considerably. Some athletes report receiving workouts that seem disconnected from their actual fitness or goals, while others note that the workout descriptions use non-standard terminology that doesn't align with how most training plans communicate intervals and pacing.\n\nThen there's the route generation. In a well-traveled area with dense activity heat maps like New York City, my suggested routes tend to be solid and sensible enough. As always, my personal preferences are to avoid extra crowded streets or sketchy areas, which Strava never seems to take into account. Ultimately, the algorithm benefits from years of crowdsourced data showing which streets, paths, and loops are actually popular with runners and cyclists.\n\nHowever, users in less densely populated areas or regions with sparser Strava usage report wildly inconsistent results. Some routes make no logical sense, sending athletes on inefficient paths or suggesting roads that aren't suitable for the prescribed workout type. The feature's quality appears directly tied to the richness of local Strava data, creating a drastic two-tier experience.\n\nAnd once again: Until I can push the workout and corresponding map to my watch, this feature doesn't mean much to me.\n\nIf you ask me, Strava's Instant Workouts feature feels rushed to market, likely timed to generate positive press ahead of the IPO rather than to actually serve athletes. Basic functionality that should have been present at launch—like being able to see your workout in the app or send it to your watch—is mysteriously absent. The wonky workout descriptions and inconsistent route quality only compound the sense that this needed more time in development.",

    "title": "Apple Might Turn Siri Into an AI Chatbot to Rival ChatGPT",
    "description": "It could be ChatGPT's next big competitor.",
    "fullText": "Last week, Apple finally admitted it will need to team up with Google to finally make good on that contextual Siri promise it made two years ago, which would have allowed the virtual assistant to integrate with content like your texts or emails to answer personal questions and take actions for you. Now, according to a new report, the iPhone company might actually go one step further and turn Siri into a full-fledged AI chatbot—one on par with the likes of ChatGPT, and perhaps even more sophisticated.\n\nCurrently, Siri has AI implementation, but only technically, and it's certainly underwhelming: You can use it to get tech support on Apple products or shunt questions off to ChatGPT, but otherwise, Siri basically works as it always has. But according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has reliably reported on insider information at Apple before, the company is finally not only looking to make Siri smarter, but also change the way you interact with it. Currently planned for iOS and macOS 27 under the name \"Campos,\" Siri's new chatbot interface will still be powered by Gemini, but will allow you to both type and talk to Siri, with full continuity between your conversations. This upgrade will be in addition to the overdue features that were already announced.\n\nIn other words, it'll look something like the chatbot interface from the ChatGPT app or the standalone Gemini app. Yes, you can technically type to Siri right now, but it mostly works like a separate input method, rather than as a full conversation. You can't scroll through your previous questions to Siri or peruse the assistant's previous answers, and if you ask Siri to reference a message you sent it two weeks ago, it'll have no idea what you mean. That's far behind what other AI chatbots offer right now.\n\nThe update will also apparently further expand Siri's capabilities even beyond the contextual or personalization upgrades that were already revealed. Gurman says that, while the contextual upgrades will be able to pull information from other apps like Messages, the chatbot-style Siri will be \"integrated into all of the company's core apps, including ones for mail, music, podcasts, TV, Xcode programming software and photos.\" Essentially, Siri will have more access to your iPhone than other AI chatbots, and those integrations will go beyond what was previously promised. That could make it more or less appealing to you, depending on your tastes in AI integration.\n\nWith the chatbot interface planned for iOS 27, it's likely to come after the contextual upgrades, rather than at the same time. That's because, as Gurman said previously, those upgrades are set for the spring. He predicts we'll learn more about it during this year's WWDC, which, if it follows the standard set by previous years, will take place in June.\n\nThe move to turn Siri into a chatbot could come across as a a much-overdue modernization, as Google has already done the same with Gemini over on Android, but it's also a bit of a surprise, as Apple had previously said it did not intend to turn Siri into a \"bolt-on chatbot on the side\" for Apple Intelligence.\n\nBut Apple was likely talking about quality of the experience rather than expressing any significant anti-chatbot bias among the development team, meaning the fact that Siri is turning into a chatbot could mean the company is finally happy with the direction it's headed. But it's also possible that the professed skepticism about turning Siri into a chatbot was meant to appeal to AI skeptics in general. Unfortunately, if you're still skeptical about AI, it currently seems like iOS 27 will be a boring update for you, as Gurman indicated the new Siri chatbot will be the \"primary new addition\" to the operating system.\n\nHowever you feel about it personally, Siri as a full-fledged AI chatbot could seriously upset ChatGPT's market dominance—ironic, given its early integration with Apple Intelligence. Currently, OpenAI has reportedly admitted it's in a Code Red situation, as it is losing market share to Google and introducing ads to bolster its bottom line. The new Siri, being powered by Gemini, is unlikely to hurt Google (although it will have more access to your phone than the standalone Gemini app), but its ease-of-access might make it the new go-to for iPhone users, and that could hurt pretty much every AI company Apple isn't in business with directly.",

    "title": "This Hydration App Tracks Your 'Output' Instead of Your Intake",
    "description": "This approach may be more accurate, anyway.",
    "fullText": "I’ve never managed to get on board with any hydration trackers. I’ll log the foods I eat, the exercise I do, but drinks just happen. Did I have one glass of water or two with lunch? Hell if I know. Not to mention that your hydration depends on all the H2O you take in, not just the glasses of plain water. You can hydrate with soup, with Diet Coke, or with slices of watermelon. Most hydration apps forget this, but even if they don’t, that just makes logging even more complicated.\n\nThat’s why I was intrigued by the P Water app for iPhone and Apple Watch. It tracks exactly what you’d expect from the name. I’ve been using it for about a week, and so far, I'm a fan. I tap a button on my Apple Watch when I’m heading to the bathroom, and between pit stops, I can drink whatever I want without measuring or logging any of it. If it’s been a few hours since my last bathroom trip, the app will prompt me to drink water.\n\nThis approach means that I get full credit for the water in my soup and Diet Coke, because it’s still hydrating me, and my internal hydration level is still triggering my bathroom trips. I spend a total of about 30 seconds each day thinking about the app, and I measure nothing. This is ideal for me.\n\nThe developers of P Water were not the first to think of tracking water output rather than input. You may have noted this approach is sometimes used in medical settings, and as a new parent I remember being asked how many wet diapers my newborn was producing each day.\n\nP Water cites research showing that counting up the number of times you urinate per day can give a reasonably good estimate of how hydrated you are. For example, this study on healthy young men concludes that “[Void frequency] is a reliable index of 24-[hour] hydration status” so long as bathroom visits come at a consistent “urgency”—in other words, if you sometimes go when you don’t really have to, but sometimes hold it a long time, your pee count will be less reliable as a hydration indicator. That much is pretty obvious.\n\nTracking output rather than input accounts for not just different sources of water in your diet, but also different hydration needs. For example, the “eight glasses of water a day” rule was never a particularly good one, especially when you consider that people come in different sizes and may have different activity levels.\n\nThat said, if you have a need to monitor your exact hydration, an app like P Water won’t necessarily do everything you need it to do. Medical providers often ask for specific amounts when they have people do what they call a “voiding diary.” But for a general sense of whether you’re hydrating enough that you’re peeing a normal amount, P Water seems to be a convenient tool.\n\nWhile it’s convenient to use P Water on an Apple Watch, it also works as a regular iPhone app. The full app has some convenient actions, like having a “log a pee” option when you long-press the home screen icon or when you swipe down to see Siri suggestions.\n\nI only used the app’s most basic features—logging bathroom visits, basically—but there’s",

    "description": "Home emergencies can happen at any time. Here are the tools and supplies you need to have ready to deal with emergency home repairs.",
    "fullText": "So many things can go wrong with your home at any given moment—and those problems won't exactly wait for you to be prepared to deal with them before they hit. Plus, they often happen when it’s difficult or impossible to get a professional to come help you—like during storms, or in the middle of the night.\n\nIf you wake up to a burst pipe or a leaking roof and you can’t get a pro to come for a while, you don’t want to be powerless in your efforts to stave off further disaster. Having a basic set of tools is a great start, but you need to keep a few more items on hand if you truly want to be able to respond with a quick fix. Here’s the short list of everything you should have in your home in case you need to do some emergency repairs.\n\nWater is incredibly destructive, and leaks that seem minor can do major damage to your house. Making sure you have basic tools like wrenches and knowing where the water shutoffs are in your house is essential, but here are a few more items that can hep you respond to emergencies:\n\nSnake auger. A plunger will take care of a clogged drain or toilet (and if you lack a plunger, don’t forget you can use a garbage bag on the toilet in a pinch), but if plunging doesn’t stop the water’s inexorable rise, you need to have a snake auger on hand. It’s a simple tool that anyone can operate, and it will break up most clogs pretty quickly, potentially averting disaster.\n\nBattery powered pumps. You may already have a sump pump installed to keep things dry in your basement and crawl space. If the power goes out, however, your sump won’t do you much good. And battery backup power typically doesn’t last long, so having a cordless transfer pump could be a lifesaver. Even something like a DrillPump (for $17) can stave off a flood long enough to get a professional in there.\n\nPipe clamps. Water pipes always seem to burst at the worst possible time—and shutting off the water to the whole house isn’t ideal if you have to wait a few days for a plumber. Having a few pipe repair clamps on hand will get you through those days. These clamps are pretty simple: You just slip them onto the pipe and tighten the clamp until the leak is sealed by the rubber backing. This fix won’t last forever, but it will probably let you keep the water on for a few days while you sort out a more permanent repair.\n\nRoof leaks often stay hidden until a bad storm suddenly reveals them—and roof repairs have to wait until the weather clears. Here’s what you need if your roof starts leaking at the worst possible moment:\n\nRoof cement. Roof cement (like the Henry 208R) can be a lifesaver. If you notice that your roof has obvious damage, or it has leaked recently, applying a layer of roof cement to the affected area is a fast, easy repair that will keep the water out until you can do something more permanent.\n\nTarp. A durable tarp is useful in a lot of emergencies, but essential for a surprise roof leak. Along with some plastic-cap nails, you’ll be able to quickly cover any damaged section of your roof and keep things as dry as possible until a roofer can make an assessment. Tarping a roof isn’t hard, though you should always use extreme caution when on your roof—especially if it’s raining.\n\nThere are a bunch more things you might not need every day, but should have on hand in case of emergency:\n\nSpray sealant. Clear waterproof sealant spray can be used to seal off cracked windows, minor roof damage, and anything else that suddenly starts leaking.\n\nZip ties. These plastic ties are incredibly useful because they’re easy to deploy quickly, can be linked together, and are strong enough for most temporary repairs when you need to hold things together. They can even be fashioned into a DIY drain cleanout tool in a pinch if you don’t have that snake auger.\n\nDuct tape and electrical tape. No, duct tape can’t fix everything, but this strong, sticky tape can temporarily fix tools, hold stuff together, stop minor leaks—and, yes, seal up broken ductwork. Electrical tape is essential if you’re going to attempt any DIY electrical repair, whether it’s braiding wires together, covering exposed wire when the insulation has worn off, or securing a loose connection.\n\nPlastic sheeting. Plastic sheeting is useful when a tarp is too heavy and cumbersome. It can be used in just about any application where you want to keep water or the weather out of a space, like covering a broken window in a storm or on the floors under a roof leak.\n\nSuper glue. Super glue is useful stuff—it can bond just about anything, and it can even be used to seal small leaks in pipes in a pinch.\n\nTwine. Having some strong twine rope will definitely come in handy. It can be used to lash things down, to reinforce repairs and connections, to tie down a tarp, or in a million other ways.\n\nBucket. The classic 5-gallon bucket has so many uses you probably already have one—but if you don’t, it’s time to pick one up. Catching leaks, hauling debris, water, or even tools, mixing—they can even be used as ersatz step stools in a pinch.\n\nMultitool. You have a whole set of hand and power tools, but when an emergency strikes, you don’t always have the time to gather everything you need. Having a high-quality multitool gives you a range of tools in your pocket, letting you get to fixing things immediately without delay.",

    "fullText": "Speaking to Tottenham fans on their way to Tuesday's Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund, almost none retained any belief in Thomas Frank.\n\nIt felt as though a bad defeat against the German side - which would have been a fourth loss in a row in all competitions - would not only have led to more boos and more toxicity inside the stadium, but the end of his reign as manager.\n\nInstead, a 2-0 win thanks to first-half goals from Christian Romero and Dominic Solanke is likely to buy Frank some time. An encouraging performance from his depleted team could even give him more than that.\n\nJust a few days earlier, loud boos greeted the final whistle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as West Ham snatched a last-minute winner.\n\nBefore kick-off on Tuesday there were some jeers once again when Frank's name was read out, but they turned into cheers at full-time as Spurs secured a win that now puts them in a strong position to qualify automatically for the Champions League knockouts.\n\nThe question now is: was this a temporary reprieve for Frank or a platform to build on? And is it enough to win back the fans who had turned against him?",

    "description": "Arne Slot praises the return of Mohamed Salah, with Liverpool's Champions League win in Marseille proving important for both.",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot has good memories in Marseille. It was here in 2022 when his Feyenoord side held on to secure a place in the Europa Conference League final.\n\nOn the eve of this week's game in the bowels of the Stade Velodrome, he was asked about those memories. He was also bizarrely and rudely asked about Xabi Alonso's links to the Liverpool job.\n\nAny noise surrounding the future of the Liverpool boss was quietened by a trademark European away performance from his side, who added Marseille to Eintracht Frankfurt and Inter Milan as the teams they have beaten on their travels this season.\n\nTheir unbeaten run of 13 matches (W7 D6) in all competitions may have been uninspiring for the large part but it is the longest ongoing streak of any team from Europe's big five leagues. In itself, credit must be due for that. Liverpool last lost a game in November.\n\nCrucially for Slot, it was a first win in a game that Mohamed Salah started for Liverpool since November 4, when they beat Real Madrid in the Champions League. It now looks like a line has been firmly drawn after Salah's interview at Leeds and both player and manager can move on for the betterment of the football club.\n\nThe reality is that both need each other. Pre-match, Slot told TNT Sports: \"The moments when I didn't play him, I was trying something different. We have missed goals from all the ball possession. If there's one player in the history of Liverpool that can score goals, it's Mo Salah.\"\n\nIt was a night where Salah did not add to his club record of 46 Champions League goals for Liverpool, even though he really should have when he fired wide in the second half, but the assurance with which Liverpool played in a 4-2-2-2 setup will leave Slot delighted and may well give him food for thought for the coming weeks.\n\n\"It says a lot about how big a professional he [Salah] is that he can be away for more than a month with a different team and be so fit to play 90 minutes for us after one day of training,\" said Slot. \"He was so close to a goal. It would usually be a goal from him, but it didn't harm us because we scored three.\"",
