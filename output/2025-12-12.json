    "fullText": "(This story first published on Dec. 12, 2017.)\n\nMonths of buildup. Dozens of interviews. Thousands of miles traveled and multiple countries visited on a press tour that seemed to go on forever. Then 13 seconds in the cage.\n\nThat was how the saga of Conor McGregor and Jose Aldo finally ended on Dec. 12, 2015. You couldn’t have missed the months of pre-fight hype if you tried. But the fight itself came and went in less time than it would take you to run to the kitchen and get a fresh beer out of the fridge.\n\nJust like that, one era ended and another began. The jester had become king, and the king had become the past. After that, the featherweight division – and arguably the UFC itself – would never be quite the same.\n\nSomehow, this all started with Dennis Siver. In January 2015, McGregor traveled to Boston to meet the stoically inoffensive German featherweight in the main event of UFC Fight Night 59.\n\nDid this seem like it was even intended to be a serious challenge to the streaking McGregor, who’d stormed into the UFC two years prior and reeled off four straight wins while his fame snowballed into an unstoppable force? Not really.\n\nWhat it seemed like was a setup. Especially after the Irishman had proven his drawing power in a win over Diego Brandao at a UFC Fight Pass-only event from Dublin, the UFC clearly wanted to be all the way in the McGregor business. So it booked him opposite Siver, a good-but-not-great featherweight who seemed to be slowing down in his mid-30s.\n\n“This fight in Boston,” UFC President Dana White said a couple weeks prior, “if (McGregor) wins, he’s going to fight for the title.”\n\nOf course he won. That was the whole point. But a second-round TKO of Siver didn’t make quite enough noise to please McGregor, so after the fight he leapt over the octagon fence and made a beeline for UFC featherweight champion Aldo, who was sitting at cageside.\n\nThe confrontation was brief, but tense. With beefy security types quickly intervening between the two men, McGregor leaned toward Aldo’s face with the wide-eyed stare of a madman. Aldo couldn’t stop grinning. The whole thing was just so funny, he explained later.\n\n“He is a fool, and just kept opening his mouth,” Aldo said. “It just made me laugh.”\n\nThis would become Aldo’s standard response to McGregor’s many provocations.\n\nAt the event, he showed off a poster depicting McGregor as a court jester. “Go Joker, Go…” it read. “Make me laugh.”\n\nAfter four years as the only featherweight champion the UFC had ever known, it hardly even needed to be said that, at least for the purposes of this metaphor, Aldo was the king.\n\nThe fight was set for UFC 189 in July. To promote what it expected to be a blockbuster affair, the UFC took both fighters on a two-week media tour that traveled from Brazil to the U.S. to Ireland, all so fans could work themselves into a frenzy as the two men jawed at one another from opposite sides of a dais.\n\nAldo may have started out trying to dismiss McGregor’s antics as harmlessly idiotic, but by the end, he was nearly boiling over. In Dublin, McGregor reached over the podium and seized Aldo’s UFC title belt, holding it over his head as the Irish fans cheered and Dana White tried to restrain the enraged Aldo.\n\nWith that image alone, the media tour seemed to have served its purpose.\n\nWhite later claimed the UFC had spent more money promoting that fight than any other in UFC history. That made it sting all the more when, a few weeks before UFC 189, Aldo withdrew with a rib injury.\n\nThe UFC president didn’t take the news well. He accused Aldo and his camp of overplaying the injury, making a bruised rib sound like a broken one. He appeared on ESPN’s “SportsCenter” alongside McGregor to criticize Aldo’s record of pulling out of title fights. Instead, White said, former title challenger Chad Mendes would step in on short notice to fight McGregor for the interim featherweight title.\n\n“If a man is scared for his life, we cannot force him to step in and face me,” McGregor said on ESPN. “I feel he is afraid. The doctors have cleared him to fight. It’s a (rib) bruise, but he has still pulled out.”\n\nEven with the late change of opponents, UFC 189 was an unqualified success. The UFC pulled out all the stops with its production, both on pay-per-view and in the arena, with Sinead O’Connor singing McGregor’s entrance music live inside MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\nAnd, after a shaky first round in which he was easily taken down by Mendes and bloodied on the mat, McGregor rebounded to knock out an exhausted Mendes in the final seconds of Round 2.\n\nNow the Irishman was the interim champ, and to the tune of more than 800,000 pay-per-view buys, according to reports. The live-gate figures also broke a U.S. record for MMA, according to UFC officials, with just north of $7 million flowing in through ticket sales.\n\nBut the fight with Mendes left some doubts. Yes, McGregor had finally defeated a strong wrestler, but one who took the fight on short notice. Plus, his takedown defense was clearly lacking. After being given such a well-manicured path to the title, was McGregor really ready for a focused and prepared champion like Aldo?\n\nWe finally got the chance to find out that December. Atop a star-studded fight card that featured Chris Weidman defending his middleweight title against Luke Rockhold (while Yoel Romero and Ronaldo Souza battled beneath them to see who had next), Aldo-McGregor was the unquestioned headliner.\n\nBefore the event, White predicted another record-breaker, saying that UFC 194 was on track to be “the biggest thing we’ve ever done.” Sure enough, live gate figures topped $10 million, according to UFC officials, breaking the U.S. record set by McGregor’s previous fight.\n\nAsked for prediction before the fight, McGregor explained that he saw himself slipping Aldo’s right hand and coming back with his own powerful left.\n\n“I see him KO’d inside one (round),” McGregor said.\n\nMore than 16,000 fans packed MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas that night. More than a million more watched on pay-per-view.\n\nMcGregor entered first, grinning his madman’s grin as he draped himself the Irish flag. A tense and serious Aldo followed a few moments later. The longtime champion looked especially nervous as he waited in his corner, head down, swaying from side to side.\n\nOnly referee John McCarthy, standing quietly with his arms crossed, seemed capable of underplaying the magnitude of the moment. When McCarthy gave the pre-fight instructions and offered the fighters the chance to tough gloves, neither man moved.\n\n“Conor looks extremely loose,” UFC commentator Joe Rogan said, as McGregor crouched in his corner, mouthing words that were immediately lost in the din of the crowd. “And Aldo looks like he’s feeling the pressure of this moment.”\n\nAt the signal to fight, McGregor bounded out to the center of the cage, his lead right hand extended as Aldo stalked forward. McGregor fired a straight left, and Aldo replied with a counter left hook that came up short. McGregor stabbed a kick at Aldo’s thigh, forcing him back, but only for a moment.\n\nThen it was if Aldo had had enough. He came forward pumping his left, missing with his right and landing his left – just as he walked directly into McGregor’s stiff left hand.\n\nThe instant the punch landed, it was as if Aldo’s feet stopped working, while his forward momentum carried his upper body on ahead. He crashed to the mat, rolling onto his side as McGregor stood over him and pounded at his unguarded head with two straight left-hand hammerfists.\n\n“Unbelievable,” Rogan said. “The first punch he threw. Slept him.”\n\nAs Aldo was being helped to his feet, McGregor celebrated atop the cage before jumping down and jogging around the perimeter, once again draped in his flag.\n\n“The first man to beat Aldo in over a decade,” UFC commentator Mike Goldberg said. “The fastest title fight finish ever, bettering Ronda Rousey’s 14-second armbar.”\n\nAldo could only stalk the cage, covering his face with a towel as he shook his head. When he came to the center of the cage for the official announcement, he traded a few words with McGregor before standing with his hands on his hips, staring at the mat while blood leaked from a cut on the bridge of his nose.\n\n“He’s powerful, and he’s fast,” McGregor said of Aldo in the post-fight interview. “But precision beats power, and timing beats speed. And that’s what you saw there.”\n\n“I'll tell you one thing that won't be happening,” McGregor said. “If I got up to that lightweight division, there is no way in hell that I am vacating my belt. That is not happening. There will be a belt on one shoulder and a belt on the other shoulder.”\n\nAnd there was, at least for a time. By then, no one was laughing at the joker anymore.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: When Conor McGregor knocked out Jose Aldo to become king in 13 seconds",

    "fullText": "Former Michigan football head coach Sherrone Moore has been charged with three crimes after his arrest on Wednesday. Moore was charged with third-degree home invasion, stalking, and breaking and entering or entering without breaking, prosecutors said. The former Wolverine was arraigned at the Washtenaw District Court.\n\nThe third-degree home invasion charge is a felony, while the other charges are misdemeanors. Moore, who spent the last two seasons as Michigan’s head coach, was fired on Wednesday after a school investigation found evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.\n\nMichigan has not revealed the details of the “inappropriate relationship,” but that was enough for athletic director Warde Manuel to fire him, citing a “clear violation of university policy.” Moore’s arrest came hours later, after the Wolverines’ announcement.\n\nFollowing Moore’s firing, Michigan promoted Biff Poggi to interim head coach with the university set to play the Texas Longhorns in the Citrus Bowl on December 31.

    "description": "This Playoff is full of talented players.",
    "fullText": "This is only the second season of the 12-team College Football Playoff, but this bracket is among the weirder in the playoff era. Two Group of Five teams? One Group of Five team seemed unfathomable just a few years ago. Now, two are in the playoffs.\n\nThe top four teams are seemingly on another tier in this year’s postseason, but there are some intriguing teams seeded 5-12. Let’s take a look at each team in the playoffs and one player to watch on each team.\n\nWide Receiver, Elijah Sarratt: Stats: 51 receptions, 687 yards, 12 touchdowns\n\nSarratt is a scary good, athletic receiver. He caught what proved to be the game-winning touchdown in the Big Ten Championship in the third quarter. Opposing secondaries are going to have to have a good game plan to prevent him from taking over the game.\n\nDefensive End, Caden Curry: Stats: 11 sacks, 16.5 tackles for loss, 6 quarterback hurries, 1 blocked kick\n\nCurry played with his hair on fire in the Big Ten Championship. That’s nothing new, though. He’s been playing that way all season. With his pass-rushing prowess, Curry can wreck any opposing offensive game plan.\n\nQuarterback, Gunner Stockton: Stats: 70.7 completion percentage, 2,691 yards, 23 touchdowns, 5 interceptions\n\nStockton has settled in nicely after a subpar performance in relief of Carson Beck in the SEC Championship and Playoff Quarterfinals matchup. Opposing defenses can’t take him lightly.\n\nLinebacker, Jacob Rodriguez: Stats: 117 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, 4 interceptions, 7 forced fumbles, 2 fumbles recovered\n\nThere may be no defensive player in college football more impactful than Jacob Rodriguez. The stats speak for themselves. Should Ohio State play the Red Raiders in the National Championship, it will be fascinating to see how the Buckeyes’ offense game plans for Rodriguez.\n\nQuarterback, Dante Moore: Stats: 72.5 completion percentage, 2,733 yards, 24 touchdowns, 6 interceptions\n\nMoore is having a really good season. It will be interesting to see how he will perform on the Playoff stage.\n\nQuarterback, Trinidad Chambliss: Stats: 65.5 completion percentage, 3,016 yards, 18 touchdowns, 3 interceptions; 118 rushes, 470 rushing yards, 6 rushing touchdowns\n\nChambliss started the season as Ole Miss’s backup, but he has taken off as the starter this season and has flourished. It will be interesting to see if he will be distracted by the drama surrounding Lane Kiffin’s departure going into the Playoff.\n\nQuarterback, Marcell Reed: Stats: 61.8 completion percentage, 2,932 yards, 25 touchdowns, 10 interceptions; 89 rushes, 466 rushing yards, 6 rushing touchdowns\n\nIf the Aggies play the Buckeyes in the Quarterfinals at the Cotton Bowl Classic, it will be fascinating to see how the Buckeyes’ defense does against Reed’s dual-threat abilities.\n\nDefensive Lineman, Taylor Wein: Stats: 6 sacks, 14 tackles for loss, 6 quarterback hurries\n\nThe Sooners’ defense is what drives this team. Wein is the engine of it up front. How far the Sooners go will be contingent on his play.\n\nQuarterback, Ty Simpson: Stats: 64.3 completion percentage, 3,268 yards, 26 touchdowns, 5 interceptions\n\nSimpson is a really good quarterback, but he’s coming into the playoffs on a bit of a cold streak. He struggled in the Iron Bowl and the SEC Championship, but Simpson is still a dangerous quarterback who must be taken seriously.\n\nWide Receiver, Malachi Toney: Stats: 84 receptions, 970 yards, 7 touchdowns\n\nToney is a physical beast at wide receiver. He has 25 receptions for 272 yards and two touchdowns in the Hurricanes’ last two games. Should the Buckeyes play the Hurricanes in the Quarterfinals, their secondary could be tested by Toney’s athletic and prolific pass-catching.\n\nOutside Linebacker, Harvey Dyson: Stats: 7 sacks, 10.5 tackles for loss\n\nIf the Green Wave is going to beat Ole Miss, it’s going to start at the line of scrimmage. Dyson is the leader of the Green Wave’s defense.\n\nRunning Back, Wayne Knight: Stats: 190 rushes, 1,263 yards, 9 touchdowns; 37 receptions, 379 receiving yards\n\nKnight is having a really good season in what’s been a dream season for the Dukes. Running games travel, and James Madison will need Knight to have a big day to have a chance at pulling a major upset in Eugene against the Ducks.",

    "description": "The first time Fernando Mendoza put his hands on a Heisman Trophy, he did it as a whim on a recruiting trip to Yale. On Saturday, he’ll be on stage for the real deal.",
    "fullText": "The first time Fernando Mendoza put his hands on a Heisman Trophy, he did it as a whim on a recruiting trip to Yale.\n\nOn Saturday, he’ll be on stage for the real deal.\n\nMendoza enters having won the Associated Press Player of the Year Award and as the the favorite to win college football’s most prestigious individual award. He would be the first winner from Indiana University and the third with Hispanic roots — titles not lost on the once lightly recruited Miami native who started contemplating this storybook ending a few months ago.\n\n“At the beginning of the year, I saw the list of the top-10 Heisman contenders and evidently (my name) wasn’t there,” he said. “I was like, ‘Wow, I want to make a goal for myself.’ I prayed about, like, if I could make it to the ceremony, how cool that would be. Now that it’s come to fruition, I’m able to share that moment with people who appreciate it. It’s such a cool moment.”\n\nFor Mendoza, his first and likely only season in Bloomington has been filled with memories.\n\nAs fans watched him throw winning touchdown passes late in games against Iowa, Oregon and Penn State what he did behind the scenes — forcing bonds with new teammates, embracing family time and savoring all those special celebrations — helped deliver program-changing victories like a 13-10 victory over No. 1 Ohio State that gave Indiana its first Big Ten title since 1967, a 13-0 mark and the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff.\n\nAlong the way, Mendoza cherished his time studying film with his younger brother, Alberto, meeting with coaches and hearing students serenade him with chants of “HeisMendoza.”\n\nThe funny thing is Fernando Mendoza never sought the spotlight. He just wanted to win.\n\n“He’s just the ultimate professional and a wonderful teammate,” starting center Pat Coogan said. “He prepares like no one I’ve ever seen. He works his butt off like no one I’ve ever seen. He’s just an awesome locker room guy on top of that.”\n\nWhen Mendoza entered the transfer portal last winter, he could have gone essentially anywhere. He chose Indiana because he knew coach Curt Cignetti would push him hard to improve.\n\nMendoza knew of Cignetti’s reputation for developing quarterbacks.\n\nAt North Carolina State, Cignetti worked with Pro Football Hall of Fame semifinalist Philip Rivers and helped recruit Super Bowl champ Russell Wilson. Then as Cignetti guided the most successful transition from the Football Championship Subdivision to the Football Bowl Subdivision he helped three quarterbacks win conference player of the year awards in five seasons.\n\nLast year, his first at Indiana, Cignetti brought in 2023 Mid-American Conference Player of the Year Kurtis Rourke, who led the Hoosiers to a school record 11 victories and their first playoff bid while earning second-team all-Big Ten honors. Rourke finished ninth in the Heisman voting.\n\nWhen Cignetti did his homework on Mendoza, he saw something different from the late-bloomer.\n\n“Being the film junkie I am, and making all the different cutups, occasionally I’d see plays from Fernando at Cal,” Cignetti said. “When he went in the portal, obviously we watched a lot of game tape on him and just really liked his stuff — the quick release, the arm, the mobility. He’s a great person. He really prepares. He’s really smart, and he’s developed quite a bit since he’s been here.”\n\nMendoza’s mobility might not have been as evident in 2024 when he was sacked 41 times.\n\nBut Cignetti embraced taking a two-year starter from a Power Four school with a rich tradition of producing quarterbacks. He was impressed by Mendoza’s crafty work ethic, selfless leadership style and his inspirational journey from grandson of Cuban immigrants to one of America’s best college quarterbacks all while watching his mother battle multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe adversity has helped Mendoza maintain a positive approach with the kind of real-life perspective rarely found in a 22-year-old with the spotlight shining so brightly on him.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to have such a great team that I’ve always been in a good position to win games,” Mendoza said. “That’s what’s helped elevate me to the position I’ll be in Saturday night.”\n\nIt didn’t take Mendoza long to win the hearts of Hoosiers fans, who have waited decades to cheer a legitimate Heisman contender.\n\nThe last time was 2001 when quarterback Antwaan Randle El finished sixth in the voting. The best finish by an Indiana player was 1989 when running back Anthony Thompson finished second.\n\nBut Mendoza didn’t impress immediately. His breakout game came in Week 4, a rout over then-No. 8 Illinois when he threw five TD passes for the second straight week. Suddenly, to his surprise, friends began touting him as a Heisman contender.\n\nOne week later, at Iowa, he beat a blitz to find Elijah Sarratt for a 49-yard touchdown with 88 seconds to go. But the play that showed his teammates what Mendoza was all about came when he took a big hit on a run out of bounds that ignited a sideline shoving match.\n\n“I told him we had his back. I said ‘Go out there and just sling it, we have all the confidence in the world in you,’” linebacker Aiden Fisher said. “That dude’s got some confidence, too. He’s got some swagger. He looked at me and said, ‘I got us. don’t even worry about it.’”\n\nHe showed his resilience again at No. 3 Oregon with a tiebreaking 8-yard TD pass to Sarratt after throwing the Pick-6 that tied the score at 20. He did it again in the final minute at Penn State and again in the third quarter against the Buckeyes, putting him here on the cusp of hoisting his own Heisman Trophy.\n\n“The (other finalists) are fantastic players. I think everybody, when you’re a finalist, you’ve got to prepare a speech because anything could happen,” Mendoza said before discussing the Heisman being a goal. “I thought of it, but it was a little bit more of a dream and a long-range goal or a goal you reach a little farther than you think you could reach.”\n\nIt could be right in his hands Saturday night.",

    "description": "FC Bayern hasn’t invested in youth talents like this in a long time, or ever",
    "fullText": "Everyone knows who Lennart Karl is. Bayern Munich’s 17-year-old starlet has made an astronomical rise after breaking into Bayern’s senior team. As it turns out, he’s got a younger brother named Vincent, currently part of the Eintracht Frankfurt academy:\n\nAs you can see from the videos above, Vincent plays like Lennart: great dribbling and an eye for goal (with a knack for hitting them from distance). The main difference between the two is their dominant foot; the former is apparently right-footed, while the latter is left-footed.\n\nAccording to a report by Bild (as captured by Abendzeitung), the 14-year-old Vincent could follow in his older brother’s footsteps as his parents are planning to move from their native Frammersbach to Munich next year because Lennart will move out of his dorm at the Campus and live with his family again. That may hint at Vincent joining the youth ranks of the Bavarians and, potentially, joining his brother in the senior team if he is guided accordingly.\n\nThe last time Bayern signed someone at that age, it was Wisdom Mike in 2022. While the German has yet to make his breakthrough, he is still regarded as a top prospect.",

    "description": "Stephen A. Smith forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.",
    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith seemingly forgot the 2020 MLB season was shortened due to Covid-19 when he claimed New York Mets star Pete Alonso was injured and barely played.\n\nOn Wednesday, ESPN’s Jeff Passan announced that Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal to join the Baltimore Orioles. Alonso, 31, played his first seven seasons in the MLB with the Mets and was considered one of the faces of the franchise.\n\nBREAKING: First baseman Pete Alonso and the Baltimore Orioles are finalizing a five-year, $155 million contract, sources tell ESPN. Alonso leaves the Mets to make a loaded AL East even better.\n\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 10, 2025\n\nHours later, Smith reacted to the news on The Stephen A. Smith Show. First, he lambasted the Mets for allowing star closer Edwin Diaz to sign with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers. He applied that same criticism to Alonso’s departure.\n\nWhile talking about Alonso’s stats, however, Smith appeared to overlook a vitally important piece of context:\n\nHe’s been in the league about seven years. Let’s look at him, alright? He got injured in year two. So, he hits 53 home runs and 120 RBIs his first year in 2019. Next year, he gets hurt, only played in 57 games. Still smacks 16 home runs, 35 RBIs. Next year, 37 home runs, 94 RBIs. The year after that, 2022, 40 home runs, 131 RBIs.\n\nTo Smith’s credit, he quickly realized his mistake with the 2020 season. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the MLB regular season was only 60 games. With 57 games played, Alonso appeared in nearly every game of that shortened season.\n\n“Actually, 2020 was Covid,” Smith clarified. “I apologize. You gotta remember that, because there was a truncated season because all the stuff that was going on in Covid.”\n\nUnfortunately for Smith, the damage was already done and social media users rushed to roast him for the error.\n\nStephen A Smith said Pete Alonso \"got hurt and only played in 57 games his 2nd season\", when really it was the 60 game shortened COVID season\n\n— Fuzzy (@fuzzyfromyt) December 11, 2025\n\nSAS and @ColinCowherd have made a fortune talking about sports despite knowing nothing about sports. It's legit impressive. https://t.co/sdFldE7oIR\n\n— Funhouse (@BackAftaThis) December 12, 2025\n\nHas anyone ever brought up the fact that these guys are simply on TV so often that it’s actually not shocking at all that they don’t follow sports? https://t.co/ZpAeKvuRDl\n\n— Tim Kalinowski (@TimmyKal12) December 12, 2025\n\nHighest paid sports \"commentator\" in the business btw https://t.co/fN2CvjZbgj\n\n— Dean Kremer Enjoyer (@DK_Enj) December 11, 2025\n\nThis clown is the highest paid employee at ESPN https://t.co/JgIjYkf17t\n\n— cg (@colingreten) December 12, 2025\n\nAnd to think Stephen A.

    "description": "One trait of Maye’s specifically stood out to Brady.",
    "fullText": "Nobody knows more about playing quarterback under Josh McDaniels than Tom Brady.\n\nAs Brady now continues to watch film for his role broadcasting games with FOX, he has now watched Patriots quarterback Drake Maye adjust to life in that same system. The seven-time Super Bowl champion has been left impressed.\n\n“With Drake, he has the physical ability, he has the size. In terms of physical skillset, his downfield passing ability is awesome,” Brady said during and interview on “The Herd” with Colin Cowherd. “Josh McDaniels has done an incredible job this year for the Patriots. Drake is running the same system that I was in. I know how good that system is for quarterbacks. How Josh does teach these young quarterbacks all the different reasons why he’s doing what he’s doing. Why we’re trying to beat this coverage or how we’re going to protect to give you the best chance to be successful. So he’s in a great system to be successful.”\n\nDespite not sharing a sidelines with McDaniels anymore, Brady has stayed close with his old coordinator that he’s known for over 25 years. That has led to discussions about Maye, where McDaniels has relayed one trait about the 23-year old that stands out to Brady the most.\n\n“[McDaniels] just talks about his work ethic, his willingness to get better and improve week in and week out,” Brady said. “He’s a sponge for information and that’s more important to me than what I see on the film. Because when I hear that, I know that he’s doing the things it takes during the week that are going to show up consistently on the field.”\n\nPairing McDaniels with Maye has been a slam dunk addition for the Patriots this season. Entering Week 15, Maye ranks first in the NFL completion percentage (71.5), second in passing yards (3,412), second in passer rating (111.9), and fourth in passing touchdowns (23). He has also dropped his turnover worthy play rate by a near full percent.\n\nThe success has put the Patriots in position to clinch their first AFC East title since 2019 with a win over the Bills on Sunday. It also has catapulted Maye into MVP consideration, as he currently holds the second best odds behind Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford.\n\nMaye could not thank his offensive coordinator enough for his role in helping him take the next step.\n\n“It’s been awesome,” Maye said. “He coaches at a really high level. He understands the game at a really high level. His offense helps the quarterback, helps me do my job. I try to do my best to keep first downs and scoring drives going so I can help him do his job, but he understands the game. He understands defenses, what they try to do. He understands what we have on offense and our players, our personnel, and he uses us to our best ability.\n\n“It’s been awesome this year, and I can’t thank him enough for what he’s done for me. We’ve still got a long way to go, but he’s a joy to be around every day.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves could really, really use a point guard.\n\nThe trade market, which should heat up across the NBA sooner rather than later, could provide one, if the Wolves can get over a potential hold-up.\n\nYou see, they want Coby White of the Chicago Bulls, according to The Athletic's Sam Amick.\n\nWhite, a gifted scorer, shooter and distributor, would be a great addition to Minnesota's roster, a perfect backcourt mate with Anthony Edwards.\n\nExcept that White's contract expires after this season. And that has made putting together a proper trade package difficult.\n\n\"A Wolves source confirmed that there is legitimate interest in White, but the 25-year-old’s looming free agency appears to be a significant hindrance to a possible trade,\" Amick writes. \"He’s making $12.8 million in the final year of his deal and is widely expected to seek a major raise this summer. But the fear of that unknown, it seems, means this is the kind of 'rental' situation that drops the price point precipitously and creates a negotiating gap between the two sides.\"\n\nMORE: This Warriors news leak about a Draymond-Giannis trade is hilarious\n\nWhite has only played in seven games so far this season due to injury, but he's been really good when on the floor, averaging 22.1 points and 5.4 assists per game.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 25-year old would take some of the pressure off of Edwards on a roster that's constructed with a lot of interior presence but a bit lacking on the perimeter.\n\nAt some point, the Wolves will have to assess if they think they can be good enough this season to make a rental trade worth it. For now, White's future hangs in limbo.\n\nRich Paul makes the LeBron James trade plans clear\n\nWhy it's time for the Pelicans to move on from Zion\n\nThe Bucks have a looming $275 million Giannis problem",

    "description": "The return of Robert Saleh has taken extra work off Kyle Shanahan’s plate.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers are sitting at 9-4 with four weeks left in what has been quite the season this year. They’ve dealt with injuries, another wide receiver saga, and still have managed to be in the playoff picture despite playing a number of first and second-year players this season.\n\nThe team’s coaching staff has done a great job. Head coach Kyle Shanahan should be in the running for Coach of the Year (although it’s unlikely he’ll win it over Mike Vrabel this year). Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh has found a way to pull the strings for a 49ers defense that has lost its two best players. And special teams coordinator Brant Boyer is starting to come along, with San Francisco improving in a couple of areas.\n\nThat’s a difference from the past few seasons, as the 49ers have seen some coaching turnover due to issues on the defensive side of the ball and on special teams. San Francisco had been through a pair of defensive coordinators in the past two years, firing both Steve Wilks and Nick Sorensen after one season.\n\nIn both years, it felt like Kyle Shanahan’s expectations weren’t met, adding more to his plate as he was more involved with the defense.\n\nThis season, however, Shanahan is back with a familiar face at defensive coordinator with Saleh, who has done a stellar job keeping the unit as a top-10 scoring defense, despite not really being elite in any category. That has alleviated some of the pressure off Shanahan’s back.\n\n“It’s huge [to have a guy that you trust so implicitly at defensive coordinator],” Shanahan said about Saleh. “I mean, just going through this offseason with him, having to make a bunch of decisions on where we were going, where we were at and trying to make the best of a number of things going into the draft like that.”\n\n“Knowing how this year was going to be different and knowing we were going to have to tinker with things throughout the year, just having a guy that I know has done it before and also someone I’ve done it together to where I know that he’s extremely capable of doing it and he’s done it at such a high level, done it a number of places and that’s exactly what he has done here.”\n\nShanahan is still involved with the defense, joining meetings and being an observer, but Saleh’s presence has allowed him not to be too hands-on with that side of the ball.\n\n“You’ve always got to meet with them,” Shanahan said about the defense. “You can’t ever get too far away, whatever side of the ball you’re on or major in as a head coach. But also too, when I watch people try to fix things too much, when you’re giving it, whether it’s 50 percent of your attention or 80 percent of your attention, you’ve got to be very careful if you’re not giving something 100 percent of your attention that you’re not going to make it worse. So, I try not to overdo anything regardless of the situation, but I always try to stay involved.”\n\nThe 49ers may have another defensive coordinator decision this offseason, as Saleh is likely to receive some head-coaching consideration again. But, this coaching arrangement for the 49ers certainly elevates the team’s floor and ceiling, as we’ve seen so far this season.",

    "fullText": "Even with a very nice upset win on Thursday night, the Atlanta Falcons are heading toward an eighth straight losing season, and could have one of their lowest win totals this century. Usually, year two is when the positive changes come for a new head coach. However, Raheem Morris is likely to have fewer wins this year than he had during his 8-9 debut in 2024.\n\nThat is why it isn’t too surprising that NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported on Thursday night that Atlanta owner Arthur Blank will “evaluate the entire football operation” after the season. Including general manager Terry Fontenot and head coach Raheem Morris.\n\nIf they did move on from Morris after just two seasons, we look at five replacement options,.\n\nMarcus Freeman has developed into one of the best coaches in all of college football. While Notre Dame doesn’t have the same resources as the elites of the sport, he had turned the program into one of the best in the game. That is why there have been rumblings about interest from NFL teams. Don’t be surprised if ATL wants to chat with Freeman if they fire Morris.\n\nThe farthest Mike McCarthy got the Dallas Cowboys during his five seasons was the Divisional Round of the playoffs. That wasn’t good enough for owner Jerry Jones. However, after eight straight losing seasons, Blank would welcome a coach who posted three straight 12-win seasons in the Cowboys’ pressure cooker. Furthermore, McCarthy has a Super Bowl win on his resume. He should be a top candidate if the Falcons’ job becomes available.\n\nIs Josh Allen an amazing quarterback? Yes. But it is no coincidence that he won his first MVP award last year and remains an elite star in 2025 under the guidance of offensive coordinator Joe Brady. Furthermore, Brady has developed James Cook into a top-flight running back. Something Buffalo badly lacked a few years back. Of the various coordinators around the game, Brady will be on a lot of teams’ radar as a potential head coach.\n\nAfter being dismissed two years ago by the New England Patriots, only one team interviewed Bill Belichick about their head coach job: The Falcons. The greatest coach in NFL history is friends with Blank, but he didn’t get the job due to wanting more control over football operations. With Fontenot’s job up in the air, serious control in Atlanta could be enough for Belichick to leave his job at North Carolina.\n\nBaltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken is one of the most respected offensive minds in the game after stops in Tampa Bay and Georgia. Yet, he has never been given a head coaching opportunity in the league. This could be the year when the 59-year-old finally gets a chance. Especially with the organization wanting an offensive-minded HC to work with young QB Michael Penix Jr. in 2026.\n\nEx-Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore charged with 3 crimes\n\nNBA Rumor Suggests MIL Bucks Trying to Add Specific Star, Instead of Trading Giannis\n\nMajor Name Ruled Out As WWE’s Masked Man",

    "fullText": "EAST LANSING —Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo is getting a salary increase.\n\nThe MSU Board of Trustees approved the raise for Izzo during their meeting on Friday, Dec. 12.\n\nThe terms of the updated contract have not yet been released, though a report from ESPN had Izzo receiving a $1 million raise. That would bring him to about $7.2 million per year, which would make him the highest paid basketball coach in the Big Ten.\n\nON THE GRIDIRON: Michigan State board formally approves hiring Pat Fitzgerald as football coach\n\nIzzo has been the Spartan's men's basketball coach since 1995. He is the winningest coach in Big Ten history, currently holding a 745-303 record across his 31 seasons leading the program.\n\nThe motion for a raise was included within the personnel actions and information reports. The board also approved the hiring of Pat Fitzgerald as the new head football coach in the motion.\n\n“Coach Izzo is one of the greatest coaches in the history of college athletics,” MSU athletic director J Batt said in a statement. “His list of championships and honors is amazing, but his true legacy will be the impact he’s had, first and foremost, on his student-athletes, as well as Spartans everywhere. He cares deeply about our University and our community, and is always willing to do whatever is asked of him to advance MSU.\n\n“Despite his impressive collection of accolades, he continues pushing his Spartans to accomplish more. Since the summer we’ve been discussing how we elevate the program to even greater heights in our new landscape. This new contract not only celebrates his legacy, it displays the department’s commitment to doing all we can to support him and the program’s championship dreams for years to come.”\n\nThe Spartans have an 8-1 record this year and are ranked No. 9 in both the Associated Press and USA Today coaches poll rankings, with their only loss to No. 3 Duke. MSU next plays Penn State at noon, Saturday, Dec. 12.\n\n“I’m incredibly appreciative of the continued support from the Board of Trustees, President Guskiewicz and AD Batt,” Izzo said in a statement. “With strong leadership and positive momentum throughout the University and the department, the pieces are in place for sustained success, and I’m as energized as ever to chase championships. We’re going to keep working tirelessly to make all Spartans proud.”\n\nContact Karly Graham at kgraham@lsj.com.

    "description": "The Rams need to take care of their own game but these 5 games could impact their playoff seeding and positioning.",
    "fullText": "Though the Los Angeles Rams control their own destiny when it comes to the NFC West and No. 1 seed, they wouldn’t mind a little help from their friends. Any losses by teams also in contention for a playoff spot could benefit the Rams, especially now that the regular season is winding to a close.\n\nThis week, there are a number of games with playoff implications. The Rams first want to take care of business themselves by beating the Detroit Lions but it’d be nice if a few other teams dropped in the standings, too.\n\nHere’s a look at the Rams’ Week 15 rooting guide.\n\nPhilip Rivers, of all people, could help the Rams this weekend – if he’s named the Colts’ starter less than a week after coming out of retirement to play his first game since 2020. If it’s not Rivers, the Rams will be pulling for rookie Riley Leonard to pull off an unlikely upset against the Seahawks, who are tied with the Rams at 10-3.\n\nThe division and No. 1 seed could come down to Rams-Seahawks in Week 16 but a stunning upset by the Colts would give Los Angeles some breathing room – assuming the Rams win this weekend.\n\nThe Packers are just a half-game behind the Rams for the top spot in the conference so if they win and Los Angeles loses, it’ll be Green Bay taking over control of the No. 1 seed. The Broncos are an 11-win team themselves so it’s not going to be easy for Green Bay to win, especially being on the road in Denver. As of now, the Packers are 2.5-point road favorites.\n\nCan Cam Ward and the Titans make it two straight wins? Unlikely, especially given the 12.5-point spread. But if the Titans can miraculously beat the 49ers, it’ll either keep the Rams’ cushion at one game or potentially grow to two games if they also beat the Lions. If the Rams and 49ers are tied with the same record, San Francisco will pull ahead thanks to its divisional record.\n\nThe Bears dropped from No. 1 to 7 with their loss to Green Bay last week but they’re not out of it yet. At 9-4, they’re just one game behind the Rams and would have a conference record tiebreaker over Los Angeles if the two were to finish with the same record. The Browns are predictably heavy underdogs but who knows with frigid conditions heading to Chicago.\n\nThe Eagles aren’t going to lose four in a row…are they? They’re 12-point favorites over the Raiders so it’s highly unlikely but stranger things have happened. Philadelphia is down bad right now but also not completely dead in the water, being two games behind the Rams while also holding the head-to-head tiebreaker. The Rams would likely have to lose their next two games in order for the Eagles to catch them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams rooting guide: 5 Week 15 games with playoff implications for LA",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMIAMI, Florida, Dec. 12 — The West Boca Raton [Boca Raton, FL] Bulls will take on the West Broward [Pembroke Pines, FL] Bobcats Friday afternoon at Florida International University's Pitbull Stadium for Florida's FHSAA Class 6A state championship.\n\nBoth teams enter the game with 12-2 records, and the Bulls will be defending their 2024 Class 6A title that came via a 26-7 win over the Osceola [Kissimmee, FL] Kowboys a year ago. The two appearances in the title game are the only times that West Boca Raton has advanced to the final in school history.\n\nBut West Broward's appearance will mark its debut in Florida's championship finals history. The Bobcats were 9-4 a year ago, losing in the regional finals in a 51-21 rout at the hands of the Southridge [Miami, FL] Spartans. They avenged that loss two weeks ago in a 30-27 win over the Spartans, and then cleared the final hurdle last week in a 24-17 win over the Buchholz [Gainesville, FL] Bobcats.\n\nGame time is set for 12:30 p.m. EST local\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:West Boca Raton [Boca Raton, FL] Bulls vs. West Broward [Pembroke Pines, FL] Bobcats\n\nWell, this game got away from West Broward pretty quick in the second quarter. West Boca adds a field goal just before the half, and the Bobcats have a lot of work to do just to get back into this thing.\n\nWell, after a long stretch with no scoring, West Boca is finding its groove on both sides of the ball. This time, the Bulls force a fumble, and Tray Mitchell goes 60 yards on the scoop and score. Suddenly, West Broward finds itself in a two-touchdown hole, and that's big against a team like West Boca.\n\nJavian Mallory goes the distance from 50 yards to put the favored Bulls out front on the scoreboard.\n\nIt feels like these two Florida heavyweights are still feeling each other out, exploring ways to gain the early momentum. It's a fast-moving game with few stoppages due in part to the lack of scoring, of course.\n\nIt's been a fast-moving first quarter with no offensive fireworks, yet. They're in a timeout with less than a minute to play in the opening quarter in a game that is still scoreless.\n\nFlorida's FHSAA Class 6A title game is under way in Miami, Florida! It looks like a good day for football in South Florida.\n\nStart time: 12:30 p.m. EST local\n\nThe game between West Boca Raton and West Broward is being played at Florida International University's Pitbull Stadium.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:West Boca Raton [Boca Raton, FL] Bulls vs. West Broward [Pembroke Pines, FL] Bobcats\n\nMORE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF HEADLINES\n\nFlorida 2025 playoff brackets (7A/6A/5A/4A)\n\nGeorgia 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nLouisiana 2025 playoff brackets (Division I/II)\n\nTexas 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)",

    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah will return to the Liverpool squad against Brighton on Saturday after holding peace talks with manager Arne Slot.\n\nThe reigning PFA Player of the Year had been omitted from the group who travelled to Italy for Tuesday’s Champions League win over Inter Milan following an explosive interview last week when he said he had been thrown under the bus and claimed he did not have a relationship with Slot any more.\n\nBut Slot said on Friday morning that he would hold conversations with Salah later in the day and, while it is not yet clear if the player has apologised or backed down, they resulted in the Egyptian being brought back into the fold.\n\nSalah will then leave to represent Egypt in the African Cup of Nations, which could give him and Liverpool at least a month to resolve the situation between them.\n\nSalah spoke after the 3-3 draw at Leeds, the third consecutive match when he was not in the starting 11, and accused Liverpool of breaking promises to him and saying that he did not know what would happen in his future.\n\nSlot was part of the decision, along with the Liverpool hierarchy, to drop Salah from the squad for the Inter game and, while no disciplinary action was taken against the 33-year-old, the Dutchman said he had “no clue” if the winger would play for the club again.\n\nBut Slot believes he has acted in the best interests of the team by recalling Salah. Liverpool are hit by injuries and fellow winger Cody Gakpo is out for several weeks.\n\nSalah, who signed a lucrative two-year contract extension in April, has attracted interest from Saudi Pro League clubs, while he lost his place after only scoring five goals so far this season.\n\nSlot had hinted on Tuesday night that it was up to the forward to make the first move to return to the side but then held talks with Salah on Friday.\n\nLiverpool are unbeaten in the four matches since Salah was dropped. He was an unused substitute in the win over West Ham and the draw at Leeds, while he came on against Sunderland at Anfield, his 420th appearance for the club.",

    "fullText": "The Georgia Bulldogs were so dominant in the SEC this year that even their former players are getting SEC recognition. Former Bulldog Damon Wilson II was selected to the second-team All-SEC as a member of the Missouri Tigers.\n\nWilson II was one of Georgia's most talented transfers from the 2025 cycle. With the Bulldogs, he had six tackles for loss and 3.5 sacks in two years. He was the No. 3 overall transfer in the nation, and on. Jan. 6, 2025, he transferred to the Missouri Tigers, where he had a familiar connection.\n\nWilson II broke out with the Tigers, notching the third most sacks in the SEC (9.0). He also had 20 tackles and an interception vs. Vanderbilt. There were games he'd completely take over his opponent, such as Alabama, where he had two sacks against Alabama offensive lineman Kadyn Proctor.\n\nOther Georgia players are being rewarded in other conferences. Former Georgia quarterback Carson Beck earned a spot on the All-ACC's third team with the Miami Hurricanes, and defensive back A.J. Harris earned an All-Big Ten honorable mention for his year with the Penn State Nittany Lions. It seems that regardless of where Georgia players go, Kirby Smart coaches them to do great things.\n\nThis article originally appeared on UGA Wire: Georgia Bulldog transfer earns placement on second-team All-SEC",

    "title": "FA set to take action as fans lash out at Fifa’s ‘scandalous’ World Cup ticket prices",
    "description": "The eye-watering prices for World Cup tickets were revealed on Thursday",
    "fullText": "Football fans have voiced outrage over \"scandalous\" World Cup ticket prices, prompting the Football Association (FA) to raise concerns with Fifa, though there is little optimism within English football's governing body for a reversal.\n\nThe pricing structure for members of national team travel clubs and loyalty schemes, unveiled on Thursday, includes eye-watering figures, with the cheapest ticket for the 19 July final exceeding £3,000.\n\nThe Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) has urged the FA to challenge World Cup organiser Fifa on these costs, which the FSA branded \"scandalous\" and a \"laughable insult\" to the average fan.\n\nIt is understood that the FA will formally convey fans’ discontent to Fifa through appropriate channels. However, sources close to the governing body are not hopeful that this will lead to any changes.\n\nThe FA is deeply sympathetic to England supporters, who also face significant travel and accommodation expenses. The association had no input in setting the prices and reportedly only learned of the detailed pricing plan on Thursday.\n\nIn contrast, FA bosses Mark Bullingham and Debbie Hewitt have already pledged that affordable tickets will be available for Euro 2028 – which England will co-host with the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales – and that dynamic pricing, seen in earlier rounds of World Cup ticket sales, will not be implemented.\n\nDespite this, the FA has no influence over World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and there is a prevailing sense of realism that while concerns can be voiced, Fifa is unlikely to alter its course.\n\nShould England reach the final in July, fans wishing to purchase tickets through the FA’s allocation would need to spend more than £5,000 on tickets alone to attend all matches, even for the lowest-priced category.\n\nA statement from the FSA, published on Friday morning, declared: \"We back Football Supporters Europe in calling for a halt in ticket sales and we are calling on the Football Association to work with fellow FAs to directly challenge these disgraceful prices.\"\n\nThe FSA described the prices proposed to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) as \"scandalous\" and \"a step too far for many supporters who passionately and loyally follow their national sides at home and abroad\".\n\nThe statement further criticised Fifa’s approach: \"Everything we feared about the direction in which FIFA wants to take the game was confirmed – Gianni Infantino only sees supporter loyalty as something to be exploited for profit.\n\n“This is a tournament that is supposed to be celebrated by the world, where fans of all nations come together for the love of football. Fifa have decided to make it all about the money and the elite who can afford it.\n\n“For Fifa, loyalty is not the hard-working fan travelling thousands of miles in support of their team at qualifiers around the continent. A game that should be for all is now only for those who can afford it.\"\n\nFootball Supporters Europe (FSE) estimates that fans will pay five times more to follow their team from the first game to the final at the 2026 World Cup compared to the last tournament in Qatar in 2022.\n\nTickets for the final in the participant member association (PMA) allocations begin at 4,185 US dollars (£3,130). Following England from first game to last buying the cheapest tickets would cost 7,020 US dollars (£5,250), before factoring in travel and accommodation.\n\nThe FSA also highlighted that ESTC members are being asked to pay for tickets through to the final, rather than just for the group games England are guaranteed to play.\n\n\"If England are knocked out before the final they’ll then return (the money), minus an admin fee of course. They are beyond shameless,\" the statement added.\n\nScotland fans, who have qualified for their first finals since 1998, face similarly high prices. The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) has called on national associations to \"hold FIFA to account\" over the ticket costs.\n\nJohn MacLean, CEO of the SFSA, noted that Scottish Football Association president Mike Mulraney – recently appointed chair of FIFA’s finance committee – is ideally positioned \"to express the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar\".\n\nBoth the FA and Fifa have been contacted for comment.",

    "description": "The Stanley Cup was in the building as part of the pregame celebration to honor the 1995-96 Colorado Avalanche squad. It could be in the building again later this season, too.",
    "fullText": "DENVER — The Stanley Cup was in the building as part of the pregame celebration to honor the 1995-96 Colorado Avalanche squad.\n\nIt could be in the building again later this season, too.\n\nAt least, longtime forward Claude Lemieux believes so. He’s been on four Stanley Cup-winning teams, including the ‘95-96 Avalanche squad. This team, he surmised after watching a 6-2 win over the two-time defending champion Florida Panthers, has all the necessary ingredients.\n\n“I love watching them play,” said Lemieux, whose squad back then won the Mile High City’s first major professional championship in their first season in town after relocating from Quebec. “They’re fun to watch.”\n\nIn a lot of ways, this version is built in the image of that squad. No real surprise there, given the architect of this team is Hall of Famer turned front office executive Joe Sakic.\n\nBack then, Sakic, the captain, and fellow Hall of Famer Peter Forsberg helped provide the scoring punch in a season that ended with a Stanley Cup Final sweep over Florida. Colorado had a blue line that include a rugged defender in Adam Foote and a scoring defenseman in Sandis Ozolinsh. They also had another Hall of Famer in goaltender Patrick Roy.\n\nThis team has that same sort of makeup. They have an elite goal scorer (Nathan MacKinnon), leadership (captain Gabriel Landeskog), even more leadership (40-year-old Brent Burns), a scoring defenseman (Cale Makar) and reliable goaltending (Mackenzie Blackwood and Scott Wedgewood).\n\nThe current crew watched as the players from the ’95-96 squad were recognized. They heard the applause. They then went out and put on a show for them.\n\n“This team knows what it takes,” Lemieux said. “They have players, quite a few of them, that were on the ‘22 Cup. I think it could be the ’26 Cup.”\n\nThe Avalanche (22-2-7) have a league-leading 51 points so far this season as they became the sixth team in the last 20 years to reach the 50-point plateau in 31 or fewer games. What’s more, they still haven’t lost a game at home in regulation (12-0-2).\n\nAvalanche coach Jared Bednar thinks it was a valuable experience having the older players back in the building. The current roster briefly got to chat with them Thursday morning, and hear some stories.\n\n“Obviously, they accomplished that two years before I was born,” Makar cracked. “But I’ve obviously heard a lot about it. It’s pretty cool they bring legends like that back.”\n\nSome of the Avalanche players who made the trip to the rink for the ceremony from the 1995-96 squad included Forsberg, Stephane Yelle, Valeri Kamensky, Lemieux, Ozolinsh, Mike Ricci and, of course, Sakic.\n\n“For them to be able to come back and get together as a group and share their stories with our guys and amongst one another, I’m sure it’s been a great couple days for them,” Bednar said. “We’ve been really happy that they were able to come and visit us.”\n\nIt gave the old-timers a chance to stroll down memory lane.\n\n“When it’s happening, when you’re in the middle of it, you don’t quite appreciate it as much as you should,” said Lemieux, who also won Stanley Cup titles with Montreal (1985-86) and two with the New Jersey Devils (1994-5, 1999-00). “So you get to relive it now.”\n\n“We think we’re better — no, we’re just kidding,” Lemieux said. “The game’s change. It’s not as physical as it was, but to counter that physicality they’ve got so much more skills. So we appreciate the game. We appreciate their skills and everything they bring.”\n\nThe get-together provided a chance to remember old teammates, too. The late Chris Simon was represented during the on-ice ceremony by his children. He died in 2024 at 52.\n\n“It’s very difficult, and especially with Chris passing at such a young age,” Lemieux said. “We have to count our blessings — be grateful for the days that we have and enjoy and appreciate those times when we get together.”\n\nLemieux certainly enjoyed being around this new cast of Avalanche.\n\n“We hope we bring them good luck,” Lemieux said, “and inspire them to win another Cup.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans are having one of the worst seasons in the NBA.\n\nThey could also be crucial to how the rest of the year plays out in the Western Conference.\n\nThat's because the Pels have two trade chips that are sought after by a lot of the league: Trey Murphy III and Herbert Jones.\n\nThe latest reporting from The Athletic's Sam Amick indicates that the Golden State Warriors are especially intrigued by Murphy, and that the Los Angeles Lakers really want Jones.\n\n\"For quite some time now, the Warriors have been open about their desire to acquire the Pelicans’ Trey Murphy III,\" Amick writes. \"But if they’re going to use Kuminga to do that, then it would be helpful to know how, if at all, the Pelicans value the Warriors’ 23-year-old forward. For the time being, the feedback is mixed on that front. ’Tis the season for smokescreens, after all.\"\n\nMORE: This Warriors news leak about a Draymond-Giannis trade is hilarious\n\nMurphy could be a part of the Pelicans' core alongside Derik Queen, if they want to go that route. It remains to be seen what they'll do with him.\n\nJones would cost a bit less in a trade, at least in concept.\n\n\"Our Lakers’ beat writer, Dan Woike, highlighted their interest in Jones this week,\" Amick writes. \"At the same time, he cited team and league sources who said the Pelicans are 'not interested' in moving Jones. Fair enough, but let’s circle back for a vibe check in late January.\"\n\nNew Orleans is already struggling. If the struggles only get worse, the Pelicans will have little choice but to consider trades to try to prop up their future, since their present doesn't appear to be going anywhere.\n\nThe Warriors and Lakers will be circling for that moment of opportunity to come.\n\nRich Paul makes the LeBron James trade plans clear\n\nWhy it's time for the Pelicans to move on from Zion\n\nThe Bucks have a looming $275 million Giannis problem\n\nTimberwolves want Coby White, but there's a catch",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid are keeping an eye on multiple defenders as they seek to reinforce their backline once again in the summer of 2026.\n\nOne of the main targets on the agenda of the Spanish capital club happens to be Bayern Munich and France centre-back Dayot Upamecano.\n\nThe towering defender is in the final year of his contract with the Bundesliga champions, and in a couple of weeks, he will enter the last six months of the deal, putting him on Real Madrid’s radar.\n\nFor a while now, there has been a lot of optimism at Bayern Munich when it comes to the renewal of Upamecano, with the German giants expressing confidence about tying down their ace defender.\n\nHowever, now, according to BILD (h/t Mundo Deportivo), even though Upamecano is an undisputed starter at Bayern Munich, his financial demands have brought contract negotiations to a standstill.\n\nAnd, given the situation, Real Madrid, along with PSG, are closely monitoring the situation with the defender.\n\nNo progress in renewal talks. (Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images)\n\nAs per the report, there is no agreement nor any progress expected between the Bavarians and Upamecano for now. At present, there are no ongoing negotiations, and talks have been halted for weeks.\n\nThe French international’s representatives have already presented their financial demands to Bayern, and they are not willing to back down.\n\nUpamecano wants to become one of the highest earners if he stays in Munich, aiming for a salary of around €20 million gross per year.\n\nOn top of that, the former RB Leipzig star is also demanding a signing fee of around £20 million, similar to the amount Alphonso Davies received when renewing his contract.\n\nWith the player’s camp unwilling to move from their position, no progress is expected before Christmas, getting him closer to the final six months of his contract.\n\nUpamecano and his agents are in no rush for an extension and are waiting calmly for Bayern’s response. If necessary, they are prepared to wait several more months, which could end up providing his suitors like Real Madrid an opening to make a move.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s recruitment plans for 2026 continue to take shape, with fresh emphasis on emerging talent and strategic squad refinement. TeamTalk’s report underlines that Nilson Angulo has surged into Premier League focus, with United, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Tottenham all monitoring the Ecuadorian. The scale of interest is expected, but the level of admiration from English scouts is notable.\n\nBolavip’s assessment that Angulo is picking up interest from several top flight sides frames why United are pushing strongly. His productivity for Anderlecht has been decisive this season, with “four goals and eight assists” backing up the glowing reviews. The description of him as a “superb” wide option adds weight to why there is real momentum behind this pursuit. Crucially, his versatility across the left flank resonates with Ruben Amorim’s tactical blueprint.\n\nAmorim’s 3,4,2,1 formation leans heavily on wing dynamism and ball progression. Angulo ranked in the 99th percentile for successful take ons per 90 minutes in the Belgian Pro League last term, posting 4.12 per match, which signals a player capable of breaking lines in a way United have lacked. His defensive metrics also stand out, which is a key factor for wide roles in Amorim’s structure.\n\nWith Anderlecht valuing the player at €30million, rising depending on World Cup performances, the question becomes whether United can move decisively. TeamTalk note that Villa are seen as frontrunners, but United remain firmly in contention.\n\nThe TeamTalk piece adds another significant thread: Kobbie Mainoo is “desperate” to leave United in January. The Daily Mail’s claim that he has his sights set on Napoli is striking, especially as interest comes from more than 10 clubs. The suggestion that the move is “99 per cent” done might be premature, but there is little doubt about the player’s desire for regular minutes.\n\nAmorim’s reluctance to guarantee weekly involvement has shaped this outcome, even though he “will be frustrated if the youngster leaves” due to midfield depth requirements. Napoli’s push will test United’s resolve when the winter window opens.\n\nA final twist arrives through Sky Sports. Joshua Zirkzee, once concerned about his role, now “no longer wants to leave United” after impressing recently. His goal in Benjamin Sesko’s absence has helped shift internal perceptions, which presents United’s hierarchy with a dilemma. TeamTalk note that the club remain open to a January sale to streamline the attack, with Roma, AC Milan, Villa, Everton and PSV monitoring developments.\n\nHis resurgence could delay decisions, but interest from across Europe ensures this situation is far from settled.\n\nUnited’s recruitment drive remains energetic and shaped by positional need. Angulo fits the club’s evolving identity, Mainoo’s potential departure creates fresh questions about pathway and development, and Zirkzee’s turnaround adds an unexpected narrative as winter approaches.\n\nAs a Manchester United fan, this report fuels both excitement and anxiety. Angulo feels like the kind of emerging talent who could thrive under Amorim. The numbers leap off the page, especially his 99th percentile take on data and his strong defensive contribution. Supporters have been craving a left sided outlet with that level of penetration, and he looks tailor made for the system. At €30million, he is exactly the profile United should target.\n\nMainoo’s situation, however, cuts deeper. Fans have seen glimpses of his intelligence and composure, so losing him before he reaches full maturity would be gutting. That he is “desperate” to leave says plenty about his frustration, but it also reflects United’s inconsistency in integrating young midfielders. If Napoli persuade him, supporters will look to Amorim for the justification, given the manager’s clear need for depth.\n\nZirkzee’s improved form is at least uplifting. Fans admire players who fight for their place, and his recent performances have shown character. Whether the club decide to cash in or persist will tell us a lot about long term plans for the forward line.\n\nOverall, the report paints United as active and ambitious, but still dealing with structural uncertainty. Supporters sense progress, yet these stories reveal there is plenty of work ahead.",

    "fullText": "It seems like it’s become a tradition that I announce I have joined a new company for the Java Advent of Code. At least this time it’s actually an old friend: I am excited to be back at Red Hat, in the llm-d team! Does that mean I forgot about Java? Of course not. If anything, this is an opportunity to learn more about GPU programming, and since Java is my comfort-zone language, what better occasion than looking into TornadoVM?\n\nRecently, the TornadoVM team released gpullama3, a proof-of-concept demonstrating LLM inference on GPUs using pure Java. Let’s explore this together!\n\nTornadoVM is a plugin for the OpenJDK that enables Java programs to automatically run on heterogeneous hardware (GPUs, FPGAs, and multi-core CPUs) using standard Java code annotated for parallel compute.\n\nTransformer-based language models are computationally expensive but highly-parallelizable. At inference time, generating each token requires matrix multiplications across billions of parameters. GPUs excel at these operations because they can perform thousands of computations in parallel. Thus, TornadoVM is the perfect tool for this kind of workload.\n\nInstalling GPULlama3.java was surprisingly straightforward. Make sure you have your favorite flavor of JDK 21 installed. I use sdkman, so I made sure I had Temurin 21 installed:\n\nThen you’ll want to make sure you have installed cmake, a C/C++ toolchain, Python and pip. Now you can clone the repo:\n\nand follow the instructions on the README; for instance, on macOS/Linux:\n\nYou can verify the installation was successful by running one example:\n\nOf course, make sure you replace tornado-examples-1.1.2-dev-e1d2d12.jar with the right jar name! Your output should look something like this:\n\nThe @Parallel annotation tells TornadoVM this loop can be parallelized. The TaskGraph API manages data movement and execution scheduling. You can compile it with the following (if you followed the installation guide correctly $TORNADO_SDK will point to the right path):\n\nNotice that -g is required for this to work correctly. Now you can run it with:\n\nIt will print the first 10 items in the resulting vector.\n\nThe gpullama3 project demonstrates running a Llama 3 model entirely in Java with GPU acceleration. Assuming you are back at the root of the repo, continue with the setup procedure.\n\nNow let’s download a compatible model using the HuggingFace CLI:\n\nTry it! Even on my poor MacBook Air with 8 GB RAM (provided I don’t have too many applications open) this returns:\n\nDisclaimer: even if you have better CPU/GPUs at your disposal, they are unlikely to affect the quality of the joke.\n\nGPULlama3.java currently supports a few FP16 (16-bit floating point) and 8-bit quantized models:\n\nDepending on the model being selected, a different execution plan will be built. The execution plan corresponds to the model architecture. In our case, we picked the unquantized Llama 3.2 1B FP16. Let’s take a look at the setupTornadoForwardPlan() method in FP16LayerPlanner, used by LLama 3.2:\n\nIn the Activation layer we mostly look up token embeddings and apply an initial normalization step, while the Logit layer is where we convert the model’s internal representation into token predictions. So let’s concentrate a bit more on the Feed-Forward Network layer (FFN), and in particular on the Attention implementation. The LlamaFP16FFNLayers#setupSingleFFNLayer method is a bit cryptic at a first glance; let’st start from its signature:\n\nThe method is building a TaskGraph, essentially describing the data flow of our GPU kernels. Let’s focus on QKV and attention, using Sebastian Raschka1‘s excellent Python Notebook as a reference. The following is the architecture diagram of the Llama 3.2 1B model:\n\nFor obvious reasons of brevity, we aren’t going to explore this in detail, but we do want to take a look at the implementation of the attention heads. In particular, let’s take a look at how we compute the Query, Key, Value matrices (Q,K,V = project(x) in the Python version):\n\nThis is followed by the RoPE rescaling to encode token positions:\n\nNow we are ready to compute attention. The generic version (there is also an NVidia-specific implementation) is:\n\nLet’s drill down into TransformerComputeKernelsLayered::processHeadsParallel to see how that is performed. The following is one of the GPU kernels. It essentially computes:\n\nYou will notice that the method:\n\nAfter the attention mechanism computes relationships between tokens, the result is added to the original input, normalized, and passed through a feed-forward network. This process repeats across multiple layers before finally producing the next-token prediction (the logit layer).\n\nBecause it’s an autoregressive model, this entire process repeats for each token, using the previously generated sequence as input.\n\nIn short, TornadoVM handled GPU compilation and execution transparently, allowing a pure Java program to perform LLM inference!\n\nWe’ve completed our whirlwind tour of Llama3GPU.java and TornadoVM. If your head is still spinning, don’t worry, you’re not alone! It’s a lot to take in, but I hope this post has sparked your interest and inspired you to dig deeper: I know I will!\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

    "fullText": "Today we are announcing four updates to Tinker:\n\nThe waitlist is over! Everybody can use Tinker now; See the Tinker homepage for available models and pricing, and check out the Tinker cookbook for code examples.\n\nUsers can now fine-tune Kimi K2 Thinking on Tinker. With a trillion parameters, Kimi K2 is the largest model in our lineup so far. It is built for long chains of reasoning and tool use.\n\nTinker has a standard function for inference:\n\nWith this release, we have added OpenAI API-compatible scaffolding for quickly sampling from a model by specifying a path, even while it’s still training. This also means Tinker can now plug-and-play with any OpenAI API-compatible platform. See more information in our Tinker documentation.\n\nWe’ve added two vision models to Tinker: Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct and Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct. With these, users can process pictures, screenshots, and diagrams for a variety of applications.\n\nTo input images, just interleave together an ImageChunk – consisting of your image, saved as bytes – with text chunks. For example:\n\nThese vision inputs can be used in a variety of applications out-of-the-box, including SFT and RL finetuning.\n\nTo demonstrate vision understanding in action, we are sharing a new cookbook recipe for fine-tuning VLMs as image classifiers. Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct obtains reasonable accuracy even given just one example per class; performance improves with more labeled data.\n\nTo showcase Tinker’s new vision capabilities, we finetuned Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct to classify images on four classic datasets:\n\nSince Qwen3-VL is a language model, we frame classification as text generation: given an image, the model outputs the class name. We compare this approach against a traditional vision baseline of finetuning a vision-only model — DINOv2-base. DINOv2 is a self-supervised vision transformer that was trained to encode images, and is commonly used as a backbone for pure computer vision tasks. For DINOv2, we add a classification head that predicts a distribution over all N classes. Both models are fine-tuned with LoRA.\n\nLabeled image data is scarce for many real-world use cases, so data efficiency is the primary measure we look at. We show the classification accuracy when sweeping across the number of labeled examples per class, starting with just a single one.\n\nIn the limited-data regime, Qwen3-VL-235-A22B outperforms DINOv2. Not only is it a bigger model, but as a VLM, it also comes with language knowledge out-of-the-box (i.e. what a “golden retriever” or “sunflower” is). This general language-and-vision capability of Qwen3-VL makes it readily available for vision tasks beyond classification.\n\nTinker exists to enable builders and researchers to train and customize state-of-the-art models. As always, we look forward to seeing what you build with Tinker. Happy holidays!",

I hope the thinking here will be useful to you, or at least validates\nsome of what you’re experiencing in your rollout. The further you read, the more specific this will get,\nending with cheap-turpentine-esque topics like getting agents to reliably translate human-readable text representations of Slack entities into mrkdwn formatting of the correct underlying entity.\n\nI am hiring:\nIf you’re interested in working together with me on internal agent and AI adoption at Imprint,\nwe are hiring our founding Senior Software Engineer, AI.\nThe ideal candidate is a product engineer who’s spent some time experimenting with agents,\nand wants to spend the next year or two digging into this space.\n\nAs technologists, I think one of the basics we owe our teams is spending time\nworking directly with new tools to develop an intuition for how they do, and don’t work.\nAI adoption is no different.\n\nTowards that end, I started with a bit of reading, especially Chip Huyen’s AI Engineering,\nand then dove in a handful of bounded projects: building my rudimentary own agent platform\nusing Claude code for implementation,\ncreating a trivial MCP for searching my blog posts,\nand an agent to comment on Notion documents.\n\nEach of these projects was two to ten hours, and extremely clarifying.\nTool use is, in particular, something that seemed like magic until I\nimplemented a simple tool-using agent, at which point it become something extremely non-magical\nthat I could reason about and understand.\n\nImprint’s general approach to refining AI adoption is strategy testing:\nidentify a few goals, pick an initial approach, and then iterate rapidly in the details until the approach genuinely works.\nIn an era of crushing optics, senior leaders immersing themselves in the details is one of our few defenses.\n\nShortly after joining, I partnered with the executive team to draft the above strategy for AI adoption.\nAfter a modest amount of debate, the pillars we landed on were:\n\nAs you see from those principles, and my earlier comment, my biggest fear for AI adoption is\nthat they can focus on creating the impression of adopting AI, rather than focusing on creating additional productivity.\nOptics are a core part of any work, but almost all interesting work occurs where optics and reality\nintersect, which these pillars aimed to support.\n\nAs an aside, in terms of the components of strategy in\nCrafting Engineering Strategy, this is really just\nthe strategy’s policy.\nIn addition, we used strategy testing to refine our approach,\ndefined a concrete set of initial actions to operationalize it (they’re a bit too specific to share externally),\nand did some brief exploration to make sure I wasn’t overfitting on\nmy prior work at Carta.\n\nMy first step towards adoption was collecting as many internal examples of tips and tricks as possible into\na single Notion database. I took a very broad view on what qualified, with the belief that showing\nmany different examples of using tools–especially across different functions–is both useful and inspiring.\n\nI’ve continued extending this, with contributions from across the company, and it’s become a useful resource\nfor both humans and bots alike to provide suggestions on approaching problems with AI tooling.\n\nOne of my core beliefs in our approach is that making prompts discoverable\nwithin the company is extremely valuable.\nDiscoverability solves four distinct problems:\n\nMy core approach is that every agent’s prompt is stored in a single Notion database\nwhich is readable by everyone in the company. Most prompts are editable by everyone,\nbut some have editing restrictions.\n\nHere’s an example of a prompt we use for routing incoming Jira issues from Customer Support\nto the correct engineering team.\n\nHere’s a second example, this time of responding to requests in our Infrastructure Engineering\nteam’s request channel.\n\nPretty much all prompts end with an instruction to include a link to the prompt\nin the generated message. This ensures it’s easy to go from a mediocre response\nto the prompt-driving the response, so that you can fix it.\n\nIn addition to collecting tips and prompts, the next obvious step for AI adoption\nis identifying a standard AI platform to be used within the company, e.g. ChatGPT,\nClaude, Gemini or what not.\n\nWe’ve gone with OpenAI for everyone.\nIn addition to standardizing on a platform, we made sure account provisioning was\nautomatic and in place on day one.\nTo the surprise of no one who’s worked in or adjacent to IT,\na lot of revolutionary general AI adoption is… really just account provisioning and access controls.\nThese are the little details that can so easily derail the broader plan if you don’t dive into them.\n\nWithin Engineering, we also provide both Cursor and Claude.\nThat said, the vast majority of our Claude usage is done via AWS Bedrock,\nwhich we use to power Claude Code… and we use Claude Code quite a bit.\n\nWhile there’s a general industry push towards adopting more AI tooling,\nI find that a significant majority of “AI tools” are just SaaS vendors that\ntalk about AI in their marketing pitches. We have continued to adopt vendors,\nbut have worked internally to help teams evaluate which “AI tools” are meaningful.\n\nWe’ve spent a fair amount of time going deep on integrating with AI tooling for chat and IVR\ntooling, but that’s a different post entirely.\n\nMeasuring AI adoption is, like all measurement topics, fraught.\nAltogether, I’ve found measuring tool adoption very useful for identifying the right\nquestions to ask. Why haven’t you used Cursor? Or Claude Code? Or whatever? These are fascinating\nquestions to dig into. I try to look at usage data at least once a month, with a particular focus\non two questions:\n\nAt the core, I believe folks who aren’t adopting tools are rational non-adopters,\nand spending some time understanding the (appearance of) resistance goes further than\ntop-down mandate. I think it’s often an education gap that is bridged easily enough.\nConceivably, at some point I’ll discover a point of diminishing returns, where the lack\nof progress is stymied on folks who are rejecting AI tooling–or because the AI tooling\nisn’t genuinely useful–but I haven’t found that point yet.\n\nThe next few sections are about building internal agents.\nThe core implementation is a single stateless lambda which handles a wide variety of HTTP requests,\nsimilar-ish to Zapier.\nThis is currently implemented in Python, and is roughly 3,000 lines of code,\nmuch of it dedicated to oddities like formatting Slack messages, etc.\n\nFor the record, I did originally attempt to do this within Zapier,\nbut I found that Zapier simply doesn’t facilitate the precision I believe is necessary to do this effectively.\nI also think that Zapier isn’t particularly approachable for a non-engineering audience.\n\nAs someone who spent a long time working in platform engineering,\nI still want to believe that you can build a platform, and users will come.\nIndeed, I think it’s true that a small number of early adopters will come,\nif the problem is sufficiently painful for them,\nas was the case for Uber’s service migration (2014).\n\nHowever, what we’ve found effective for driving adoption is basically the opposite of that.\nWhat’s really worked is the intersection of platform engineering and old-fashioned product engineering:\n\nSome examples of the projects where we’ve gotten traction internally:\n\nFor all of these projects that have worked, the formula has been\nthe opposite of “build a platform and they will come.” Instead it’s\nrequired deep partnership from folks with experience building AI agents and\nusing AI tooling to make progress. The learning curve for effective AI adoption\nin important or production-like workflows remains meaningfully high.\n\nAgents that use powerful tools represent a complex configuration problem.\nFirst, exposing too many tools–especially tools that the prompt author doesn’t effectively understand–makes\nit very difficult to create reliable workflows. For example, we have an exit_early command that allows terminating\nthe agent early: this is very effective in many cases, but is also easy to break your bot.\nSimilarly, we have a slack_chat command that allows posting across channels, which can support a variety of useful\nworkflows (e.g. warm-handoffs of a question in one channel into a more appropriate alternative),\nbut can also spam folks.\nSecond, as tools get more powerful, they can introduce complex security scenarios.\n\nTo address both of these, we currently store configuration in a code-reviewed Git repository.\nHere’s an example of a JIRA project.\n\nHere’s another for specifying a Slack responder bot.\n\nCompared to a JSON file, we can statically type the configuration, and it’s easy to extend over time.\nFor example, we might want to extend slack_chat to restrict which channels a given bot is allowed to\npublish into, which would be easy enough.\nFor most agents today, the one thing not under Git-version control is the prompts themselves, which are versioned by Notion.\nHowever, we can easily require specific agents to use prompts within the Git-managed repository for sensitive scenarios.\n\nAfter passing tests, linting and typechecking, the configurations are automatically deployed.\n\nIt’s sort of funny to mention, but one thing that has in practice really interfered with\neasily writing effective prompts is making it easy to write things like @Will Larson which\nis then translated into <@U12345> or whatever the appropriate Slack identifier is for a given\nuser, channel, or user group. The same problem exists for Jira groups, Notion pages and databases,\nand so on.\n\nThis is a good example of where centralizing prompts is useful. I got comfortable pulling the unique\nidentifiers myself, but it became evident that most others were not.\nThis eventually ended with three tools for Slack resolution: slack_lookup which takes a list\nof references to lookup, slack_lookup_prefix which finds all Slack entities that start with\na given prefix (useful to pull all channels or groups starting with @oncall-, for example, rather than having to hard-code the list in your prompt), and slack_search_name which uses string-distance to find potential matches (again, useful for dealing with typos).\n\nIf this sounds bewildering, it’s largely the result of Slack not exposing relevant APIs for this sort of lookup.\nSlack’s APIs want to use IDs to retrieve users, groups and channels, so you have to maintain your own cache of\nthese items to perform a lookup. Performing the lookups, especially for users, is itself messy. Slack users have\na minimum of three ways they might be referenced: user.profile.display_name, user.name, and user.real_name,\nonly a subset of which are set for any given user.\nThe correct logic here is, as best I can tell, to find a match against user.profile.display_name, then use that if it exists.\nThen do the same for user.name and finally user.real_name. If you take the first user that matches one of those three,\nyou’ll use the wrong user in some scenarios.\n\nIn addition to providing tools to LLMs for resolving names, I also have a final mandatory check for each response\nto ensure the returned references refer to real items. If not, I inject which ones are invalid into the context window and perform an additional agent loop with only entity-resolution tools available.\nThis feels absurd, but it was only at this point that things really started working consistently.\n\nAs an aside, I was embarassed by these screenshots, and earlier today I made the same changes for Notion pages and databases\nas I had previously for Slack.\n\nSimilarly to foreign entity resolution,\nthere’s a similar problem with Slack’s mrkdwn variant of Markdown\nand JIRA’s Atlassian Document Format:\nthey’re both strict.\n\nThe tools that call into those APIs now have strict instructions on formatting. These had been contained in individual\nprompts, but they started showing up in every prompt, so I knew I needed to bring them into the agent framework itself\nrather than forcing every prompt-author to understand the problem.\n\nMy guess is that I need to add a validation step similar to the one I added for entity-resolution,\nand that until I do so, I’ll continue to have a small number of very infrequent but annoying rendering issues,\nTo be honest, I personally don’t mind the rendering issues, but that creates a lot of uncertainty for others using agents, so I think solving them is a requirement.\n\nToday, all logs, especially tool usage, are fed into two places. First, it goes into Datadog for full logging visibility.\nSecond, and perhaps more usefully for non-engineers, they feed into a Slack channel, #ai-logs which create visibility\ninto which tools are used and with which (potentially truncated) parameters.\n\nLonger term, I imagine this will be exposed via a dedicated internal web UX, but generally speaking I’ve found that\nthe subset of folks who are actively developing agents are pretty willing to deal with a bit of cruft.\nSimilarly the folks who aren’t developing agents directly don’t really care, they want it to work perfectly every time,\nand aren’t spending time looking at logs.\n\nThe biggest internal opportunity that I see today is figuring out how to\nget non-engineers an experience equivalent to running Claude Code locally with\nall their favorite MCP servers plugged in.\nI’ve wanted ChatGPT or Claude.ai to provide this, but they don’t really quite get there,\nClaude Desktop is close, but is somewhat messy to configure as we think about finding a tool\nthat we can easily allow everyone internally to customize and use on a daily basis.\n\nI’m still looking for what the right tool is here. If anyone has any great suggestions\nthat we can be somewhat confident will still exist in two years, and don’t require sending\na bunch of internal data to a very early stage company, then I’m curious to hear!\n\nYou’re supposed to start a good conclusion with some sort of punchy anecdote that\nilluminates your overall thesis in a new way. I’m not sure if I can quite meet that bar,\nbut the four most important ideas for me are:\n\nI’m curious what other folks are finding!",

    "description": "The companies building AI are spending billions to acquire engineers, not replace them. Here’s why your job is safer than you think.",
    "fullText": "In May, OpenAI agreed to pay $3 billion for Windsurf, the AI coding assistant formerly known as Codeium. Three billion dollars. For a VSCode fork.\n\nThe deal eventually fell apart, but what matters is that they wanted to do it in the first place.\n\nLast week, Anthropic made an interesting acquisition: they bought Bun, the JavaScript runtime. Bun is open source and MIT-licensed. Anthropic could have forked it and built on top of it for free. They have Claude Code, an excellent code-writing tool.\n\nInstead, they bought the company. Because they wanted Jarred Sumner and his team.\n\nThis is what I keep coming back to when I see another “Programming is dead” post go viral. The companies building AI, the ones who supposedly know exactly what it can and can’t do, are spending billions to acquire engineering talent. Not fire them, acquire them.\n\nIf OpenAI believed GPT could replace software engineers, why wouldn’t they build their own VS Code fork for a fraction of that cost? If Anthropic thought Claude could do the work, why make an acquisition at all?\n\nHere’s my take: AI can replace most of programming, but programming isn’t the job.\n\nProgramming is a task. It’s one of many things you do as part of your work. But if you’re a software engineer, your actual job is more than typing code into an editor.\n\nThe mistake people make is conflating the task with the role. It’s like saying calculators replaced accountants. Calculators automated arithmetic, but arithmetic was never the job. The job was understanding financials, advising clients, making judgment calls, etc. The calculator just made accountants faster at the mechanical part.\n\nAI is doing something similar for us.\n\nThink about what you actually do in a given week.\n\nYou sit in a meeting where someone describes a vague problem, and you’re the one who figures out what they actually need. You look at a codebase and decide which parts to change and which to leave alone. You push back on a feature request because you know it’ll create technical debt that’ll haunt the team for years. You review a colleague’s PR and catch a subtle bug that would’ve broken production. You make a call on whether to ship now or wait for more testing.\n\nNone of that is programming, but it’s all your job.\n\nI’m not going to pretend nothing is changing.\n\nWill some companies use AI as an excuse to cut headcount? Absolutely. Some already have. There will be layoffs blamed on “AI efficiency gains” that are really just cost-cutting dressed up as something else.\n\nBut think about who stays and who goes in that scenario. It’s not random. The engineers who understand that programming isn’t the job, the ones who bring judgment, context, and the ability to figure out what to build, those are the ones who stay. The ones who only brought code output might be at risk\n\nA common worry is that juniors will get left behind. If AI handles the “doing” part, how do they build judgment? I actually think the opposite is true. AI compresses the feedback loop. What used to take days of flipping through books or waiting for Stack Overflow answers now takes seconds. The best juniors aren’t skipping steps, but getting through them faster.\n\nNow think about your own situation. Say you were hired two years ago, before the current AI wave. Your company wanted you. They saw value in what you bring. Now, with AI tools, you’re significantly more productive. You ship faster. You handle more complexity. You’re better at your job than ever before.\n\n“You got way more productive, so we’re letting you go” is not a sentence that makes a lot of sense.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you’re already thinking about this stuff. That puts you ahead. Here’s how to stay there:\n\nThe shape of the work is changing: some tasks that used to take hours now take minutes, some skills matter less, others more.\n\nBut different isn’t dead. The engineers who will thrive understand that their value was never in the typing, but in the thinking, in knowing which problems to solve, in making the right trade-offs, in shipping software that actually helps people.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic could build their own tools. They have the best AI in the world. Instead, they’re spending billions on engineers. That should tell you something.",

    "description": "His reporting on a Stanford University president put Theo Baker on the map, but his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley's startup machine.",
    "fullText": "Theo Baker is truly an outlier.\n\nWhile journalism as a major has seen shrinking enrollment for years and is even being dropped by some schools entirely, Baker, a senior at Stanford University, has doubled down on old-school investigative reporting, and it is paying off spectacularly.\n\nBaker first made headlines as a college freshman when his reporting for The Stanford Daily led to the resignation of Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne. After uncovering allegations of research misconduct spanning two decades, Baker — just one month into college — found himself “receiving anonymous letters, conducting stakeouts, and tracking down confidential sources,” according to his publisher. Meanwhile, high-powered lawyers tried to discredit his work. By year’s end, Tessier-Lavigne had resigned, and Baker became the youngest-ever recipient of the George Polk Award, one of journalism’s most prestigious honors.\n\nShortly after, Warner Bros. and famed producer Amy Pascal won a competitive auction for the film rights to his story.\n\nBut if that scandal put Baker on the map, his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley’s startup machine.\n\n“How to Rule the World,” out May 19 — three weeks before he graduates — promises an explosive look at how venture capitalists treat Stanford students as “a commodity,” wooing favored undergrads with slush funds, shell companies, yacht parties, and funding offers before they even have business ideas in their hunt for the next trillion-dollar founder.\n\n“I watched in real time as my peers were taught to cut corners and plied with enormous wealth by people who wanted to exploit their talent,” Baker, who turns 21 next month, tells Axios. Drawing on more than 250 interviews with students, CEOs, VCs, Nobel laureates, and three Stanford presidents, the book aims to expose what Baker describes to Axios as a “weird, money-soaked subculture that has so much influence over the rest of the world.”\n\nIt’s perhaps an unsurprising move from someone who grew up around top journalists. His father is New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker, and his mother is The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser. While his peers chase venture capital funding and six-figure startup salaries, Baker spent his sophomore year reporting and took his junior year off to write, including two months at the Yaddo writers’ retreat.\n\nThat choice becomes even more striking against the backdrop of journalism’s current struggles. While traditional journalism programs fail to fill classes and media outfits face seemingly relentless layoffs, Baker represents something both exciting and increasingly uncommon: a star student betting his career on accountability journalism. Whether he’s a harbinger of renewed interest in investigative reporting remains to be seen, but we’d guess his book will capture the attention of plenty of college students — and it will almost certainly make waves in Silicon Valley while doing it.",

A group gift for the owner. But it wasn’t a scam. It was real. And, apparently, not optional.\n\nThe Reddit post, shared under r/smallbusiness, came from an employee who had only been at the 80-person company for less than a year. The business brings in around $50 million in revenue and has no debt. Despite being happy in the role overall, the manager was taken aback by the unexpected demand.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\n“Each person's contribution is $100. Please Venmo me when you have a chance,” the email read. It was sent to 17 managers, totaling a $1,700 contribution to cover a luxury fish subscription for the company owner. The message came from the president, who also happens to be the owner’s nephew and is reportedly being groomed to take over the business.\n\n“My first instinct was to report the email as phishing because I thought there’s no way this guy is asking us all to Venmo him $100,” the original poster wrote. But upon closer inspection, it was legit: “Head of HR and IT were both on the To line.”\n\nThe tone of the email didn’t make the contribution sound optional, and the employee questioned the whole premise. “Can’t we just get the guy a tie? Isn’t our gift to him the labor we put in to make him his several million dollar salary?”\n\nTrending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nCommenters flooded in, and the consensus was apparent. Most business owners said they’d be horrified if their staff gave them an expensive gift. “This is batsh*t unhinged behavior,” one owner wrote. “Gifts flow down, not up,” another said. Several owners said they prefer to give holiday bonuses and thoughtful gifts to their employees, not the other way around.\n\nOne commenter summed it up: “I would be beyond pissed at whoever arranged this and I would pay everyone back.”\n\nThere was also concern about power dynamics. “The fact that it’s a family member in a superior position to all of those he is collecting $100 from seems strange,” another wrote. Some even speculated the nephew was setting a precedent for his own leadership style, or worse, trying to pocket the money.",

    "description": "An archaeological find revealed in eastern France offers a never-seen-before mix of enclosures. They could rewrite history.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAn archaeological find revealed in eastern France offers a never-seen-before mix of enclosures.\n\nThe site was in use across at least three distinct time periods.\n\nLinked in part to burials, researchers hope further study reveals more about the site’s dating and purpose.\n\nAs if one ancient circular enclosure wasn’t enough to evoke intrigue at an archaeological find in Eastern France, three interconnected enclosures raised the bar.\n\nIn what the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (Inrap) is calling an “unprecedented” discovery in Marliens, France, near Dijon, excavations revealed a series of occupations on one site spanning from the Neolithic period to the First Iron Age.\n\nThe oldest occupation features a monument with three interlocking enclosures. The center section offers a circular enclosure 36 feet in diameter, the largest in the bunch. To the north a smaller 26-foot-long horseshoe-shaped enclosure connects directly to the main center piece. To the south, a circular design remains open on one side, but still ties to the main circle. The team believes all three structures are linked together in both positioning and dating and that a gravel layer found on the two side enclosures suggests a fence was also present.\n\n“This type of monument seems unprecedented and currently no comparison has been possible,” the research team says in a statement. A bundle of artifacts—including seven flint arrowheads, two archer’s bracers, a flint lighter, and a copper alloy dagger—discovered in the site’s ditches correspond to cut flints, suggesting attribution to the Neolithic period, potentially as far back as 10,000 BC to 2,200 BC. Radiocarbon analytics is planned to help determine exact dating.\n\nThe team located an armband with traces of iron oxide tied to pyrite, indicating it could have been used to light fires. These objects often accompany a burial, but the team couldn’t make that conclusion just yet in this case.\n\n“Analyses of the composition of the copper alloy of the dagger should make it possible to establish its origin and provide us with information on commercial exchanges at that time,” the team writes.\n\nIn another location on the site, the team dates five circular enclosures—four open and one closed across a 64,000 square foot plain—between 1500 BC and 1300 BC. The remains of burials and a funeral pyre were found in the ditches of the largest enclosure, although the acidity of the soil didn’t allow the preservation of unburned bones, so the team was not able to find a complete burial. Dating based on five copper alloy pins, a necklace with 40 amber beads, and rare ceramic shards confirms the timing.\n\nA First Iron Age occupation is also nearby, about 1,300 feet from the plain, this with urns and burial ornaments. Early Bronze Age wells sit nearby. An analysis of the clay layers at the bottom of the wells may provide information on the natural environment and landscape of the valley during the Bronze Age.\n\nThe team believes that with the analytics underway on the objects found at the site, combined with paleo-environmental studies, they will be able to “propose a scenario of the evolution of this territory over the ages.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

Meanwhile, with AI still appearing to be in its early innings, the group could help lead the market higher in 2026 once again.\n\nLet's look at two AI stocks that could help you make a fortune in 2026.\n\nOne AI stock that looks like it could outperform in 2026 is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), as it has some of the best growth prospects of any AI infrastructure company.\n\nThe company is already seeing strong growth coming from its data center networking portfolio, which helps transfer data and distribute AI workloads across servers to help optimize performance. Products like its Tomahawk Ethernet switch and Jericho4 Ethernet fabric router are popular and helping power its networking growth.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) business is what should get investors excited the most. ASICs are custom chips that are pre-programmed to handle specific tasks, and because they are purpose-built, they tend to deliver improved performance with greater energy efficiency than general-purpose chips, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Broadcom made a name for itself in this business when it helped Alphabet design its well-regarded tensor processing units (TPUs) that are helping Alphabet power much of its internal AI workloads, as well as those for external cloud computing customers.\n\nThat success has led to other hyperscalers (owners of large data centers) partnering with Broadcom to design their own custom chips. The company has called out its three custom AI chip customers furthest along as being an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal 2027, and then announced that a fourth customer has placed a $10 billion order for next year. It also recently struck a deal with OpenAI to supply it with 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips, in a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWith these deals in place, Broadcom could see explosive growth in the coming years, which could propel its stock much higher in 2026 and beyond.\n\nAnother company whose stock could help you make a fortune next year is UiPath (NYSE: PATH). The company is in the midst of a transformation that could see it become one of the most important players in agentic AI.\n\nUiPath is a stalwart in the field of robotic process automation (RPA), which uses software bots to perform simple, rules-based tasks. However, it's using this background in managing software bots to become an orchestration platform that can manage both software bots and AI agents.",

    "fullText": "Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of breaking the “first rule of politics” following her announcement that she’s running for Senate.\n\nOn the Politics War Room podcast on Thursday, Carville and co-host Al Hunt expressed some hope for Democrats in the red state of Texas, but Carville laid out his problems with Crockett.\n\n“First of all, it seems like she’s well-educated. It seems like she’s got a lot of energy. But she, to me, she violates the first rule of politics, and that is, in politics, you always make it about the voters and never about yourself,” Carville said.\n\nListening to Crockett, he argued, it’s clear that it’s “a lot more about herself than it is the voters.”\n\nCarville added that Crockett can still be successful in her Senate run and recommended she collect the support of Democrats who have favored voting Republican.\n\n“You can get all the hits. You can get all the clicks. You can get on all of the TV shows. You can get in as long as you’re polemic, but you’re not helping very much,” he said.\n\nCarville still cautioned that “talking incessantly” about yourself is not what wins elections, and he hasn’t been impressed with Crockett’s “framing” and “understanding where people are coming from” on issues.\n\n“We know what wins elections. We just do,” he said. “And what wins elections is not sitting there talking incessantly about yourself. Winning elections is not how many clicks you get or how much overnight fundraising you do. Winning elections is being part of framing issues and understanding where people are coming from, and I don’t think [Congresswoman] Crockett is very good at that. I’ll be very frank.”\n\nCrockett, running with the slogan of “Texas Tough,” said she’s running for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) because Democrats need a “bigger voice.” She vowed to focus on issues like affordability.\n\n“There are a lot of people that said, ‘You gotta stay in the House. We need our voice. We need you there,” she told supporters this week. “And I understand. But what we need is a bigger voice.”\n\nThe post James Carville Blasts Fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett for Violating ‘First Rule of Politics’: ‘I’ll Be Very Frank’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "EVANSVILLE — Kentucky authorities arrested a former DoorDash delivery driver Friday who made national news for allegedly contaminating a Vanderburgh County couple’s meal with pepper spray..\n\nThe McCracken County Sheriff's Office arrested the woman, identified in court records as 29-year-old Kourtney N. Stevenson, Friday morning on an Indiana arrest warrant. She faces two counts of battery resulting in moderate injury and two counts of consumer product tampering for the Dec. 7 incident, which was captured in a now-viral doorbell camera video.\n\nStevenson, who has since been dropped by the food delivery service DoorDash, is being held in Kentucky without bond pending extradition proceedings, according to Vanderburgh County Sheriff Noah Robinson.\n\nThe investigation that would lead to Stevenon’s arrest got its start after one of the alleged victims, Mark Cardin, contacted the sheriff's office Dec. 7 to report that he and his wife had fallen ill after eating food delivered to their northern Vanderburgh County home shortly after midnight.\n\nBoth reportedly experienced burning sensations in their mouths, noses, throats and stomachs before vomiting. But the suspected source of their malaise left the couple stunned and furious.\n\n“They reviewed their doorbell camera footage and observed the DoorDash Dasher place the food off camera on the porch and take a picture,” a sheriff’s office news release states. “She then sprayed a substance in the direction of the food from a small aerosol can attached to her keychain and left.”\n\nInvestigators obtained records from DoorDash through a subpoena and identified Stevenson as the driver. Additional investigative work confirmed her identity, and authorities learned she was staying near Paducah, Kentucky.\n\nWhen detectives reached Stevenson by phone, she initially agreed to an interview, telling investigators she had been visiting her father in Evansville and was working DoorDash shifts during her stay. She acknowledged using pepper spray during the delivery but insisted she had sprayed chemical irritant at a spider, not the food, an action she attributed to her intense fear of arachnids.\n\nBut detectives found the explanation dubious. The overnight temperature in Evansville dropped to 35 degrees the night of the incident — conditions under which outdoor spiders in Indiana become inactive and cannot crawl on exposed surfaces, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nStevenson later called back to cancel the scheduled interview.\n\nThe sheriff’s office proceeded with an arrest warrant. Upon Stevenson’s extradition to Indiana, she will be held at the Vanderburgh County jail on a $3,500 bond, court records state. It was not immediately clear how quickly Stevenson would appear before a judge or whether she had retained an attorney.\n\nBattery resulting in moderate injury is a level 6 felony under Indiana law, while consumer product tampering carries more severe penalties as a level 5 felony. Under state guidelines, Level 5 felonies carry a prison sentence of between one and six years, with an advisory sentence 3 years.\n\nDoorDash didn’t wait for Stevenson’s arrest or a conviction to permanently bar her from its platform.\n\n\"DoorDash has absolutely zero tolerance for this type of appalling behavior,\" the company said in a statement to Evansville news media.\n\nRobinson said Vanderburgh County residents “should be able to trust that the food they order for their families is safe.”\n\n\"When someone violates that trust and endangers others, we will respond with urgency and we will pursue charges,” he said. “I want to commend our detectives and also thank the McCracken County Sheriff’s Office and Vanderburgh County Prosecutor’s Office for their assistance in making this arrest.”\n\nHouston Harwood can be contacted at houston.harwood@courierpress.com\n\nThis article originally appeared on Evansville Courier & Press: Arrest made in alleged Indiana DoorDash pepper spray incident",

    "title": "If Google wins AI race, Nvidia is 'in trouble,' says author of Jensen Huang biography",
    "description": "Jensen Huang biography author Stephen Witt explains why Google's self-developed AI model, Gemini, could pose a threat to Nvidia's AI dominance",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) AI turf could take a blow if Google (GOOGL, GOOG) keeps firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"The biggest risk right now obviously is Google,\" said Stephen Witt, author of \"The Thinking Machine,\" a Jensen Huang biography.\n\nThat risk, he told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid, is largely tied to Google's Gemini model. Witt described it as the \"best AI right now in the benchmarks outside the Nvidia stack.\"\n\nWitt explained that Gemini was trained entirely on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). If Google proves it can sustain world-leading AI development using only its homegrown chip stack, it sets a potent precedent for other tech giants to follow suit.\n\n\"That's a huge risk,\" Witt said. \"If Google ends up winning this AI race ... Nvidia will be in trouble.\"\n\nThis risk, coupled with competition from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is why \"it's very easy to imagine a world\" where Nvidia's high-flying stock declines. The AI chipmaker's shares are up over 1,270% in the past five years.\n\nTo mitigate the core risk of rivals like Google winning the chip war, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is already looking past generative AI. Witt said a significant amount of the CEO's personal effort is being poured into the next great computing wave: robotics.\n\nIf Huang can dominate the robotics wave, he said, \"that will mean several trillion dollars in market capitalization for this company.\"\n\nHowever, Nvidia has another issue: the lack of any clear succession plan.\n\n\"It's just Jensen at the top,\" Witt said. \"There's no second in command. There's no obvious successor.\" He noted that the board has been silent, and Huang has offered no advice on a succession strategy.\n\nThat suggests Nvidia's $4 trillion valuation — which accounts for over 8% of the entire S&P 500 (^GSPC) — is, in many ways, resting solely on Huang's vision.\n\nWitt described Huang as a \"world-class engineer\" who could \"design these microchips himself,\" a skill that whoever takes the helm must also possess. He noted that neither of Huang's two children, who work at the company, has a technical background, making them noncontenders for the top spot.\n\nWitt also provided a look behind the polished stage persona of Huang, known for his trademark leather jacket. Beneath the showmanship is a highly intense, \"almost totally neurotic\" leader who is driven not by optimism, but by fear.\n\n\"He's driven by negative emotions, things like fear of failure, guilt, even shame are what make Jensen get up in the morning and work so hard to make Nvidia succeed,\" Witt explained.",

    "fullText": "The US Navy has submitted its recommendations on potential punishments for Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly over his participation in a video that reminded US troops they have a duty to refuse illegal orders, a Pentagon official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThose recommendations have been submitted to the Pentagon’s Office of General Counsel “where they are providing a legal review and input,” the official said.\n\nCNN has reached out to Kelly’s office for comment. It was not immediately clear what recommendations were included in the report.\n\nLate last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requested advice from the Navy Secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in for more than two decades, on how to proceed to potentially punish Kelly for participating in the video, which Hegseth has claimed amounted to serious violations of the military’s code of justice.\n\n“I am referring this, and any other related matters, for your review, consideration and disposition as you see fit,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to the Navy secretary, dated November 25.\n\nIn the video that triggered the Trump administration’s calls for consequences, six Democratic lawmakers said that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”\n\nAlthough the video didn’t reference what orders service members might be receiving that would potentially be illegal, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns repeatedly about the legality of US military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the US military’s deployment to cities over the protest of governors.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that by emphasizing service members’ legal duty to disobey unlawful orders, Kelly and the other Democratic lawmakers were inciting troops to disobey lawful orders. President Donald Trump has called the video “seditious behavior at the highest level.”\n\nKelly’s involvement in the video is under “review” by the Pentagon, rather than subject to a formal investigation, meaning military police are not involved, a source familiar with Hegseth’s thinking previously told CNN.\n\nBehind closed doors, Hegseth has been weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ones that range from reducing the retired US Navy captain’s rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, CNN has reported.\n\nIn his various public messages, Hegseth has suggested Kelly’s comments violated several statutes of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which lays out legal requirements for those in the military.\n\nIn Kelly, Hegseth sees a critic worth making an example of, and he could technically use the military justice system to do so, the source familiar with Hegseth’s thinking said. Unlike the other five Democrats who appeared in the video, Kelly is a military retiree — meaning he served long enough to receive a pension, and thus, is still beholden to the UCMJ, including its restrictions on free speech, legal experts told CNN.\n\nKelly could be recalled to active service and court-martialed because of that status, but doing so over his role in the video would be extraordinary, legal experts said. That’s because not only has the UCMJ mainly been used in recent years to prosecute former service members who commit crimes overseas outside of US civil jurisdiction, but also because Kelly is a US senator.",

    "fullText": "More shocking images are emerging about some of the things Jeffrey Epstein kept track of on his island. The late child sex offender, it seems, didn’t just have records of the guests who visited his place in the Caribbean.\n\nAmong the physical records he kept were sex toys, according to news reports, including a novelty condom with a likeness to Donald Trump. Behind the table, there’s a sign reading Trump Condom $4.50.\n\nIn addition, there were pics of former US President Bill Clinton with Jeffrey’s girlfriend and conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nSee the newly released photos here: https://t.co/nBf2Y0q1I0\n\n— Oversight Dems (@OversightDems) December 12, 2025\n\nThe details of what transpired on Jeffrey’s island are disturbing enough to hear. All of these new photos add yet another element of shock. The Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published the findings on their X account on Friday, attaching a Dropbox folder for all to see.\n\nDonald and Bill aren’t the only celebrities seen in the photos. Among the others are Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Steve Bannon, Woody Allen, and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nIn their big reveal, none of the released photos were dated. Names of potential victims and identifying details were redacted. The latest collection supposedly contains over 95,000 images, with 19 revealed on Friday. Representative Robert Garcia says that these disturbing photos raise more questions about Jeffrey and his relationship with some powerful people. In early December, the Oversight Committee released photos of Jeffrey’s island.\n\nWhile Trump hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing in relation to Jeffrey and sex trafficking, their relationship is being scrutinized more than ever. Congress passed a bill to release the Jeffrey Epstein files last month, something which the President officially signed. The deadline to release the details of that investigation is December 19.\n\nTELL US – SHOULD THOSE CELEBRITIES IN THE PHOTOS HAVE TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS ABOUT THEIR TIME ON JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S ISLAND?\n\nThe post Donald Trump Condoms and Adult Toys: New Jeffrey Epstein Images Released appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem was questioned about a Purple Heart veteran deported by ICE during a Dec. 11 hearing\n\nRep. Seth Magaziner brought the veteran, Sae Joon Park, to the hearing over Zoom after he was deported to Korea earlier this year\n\nMagaziner accused Noem of not knowing \"the difference between the good guys and the bad guys\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was challenged during a hearing today about her department's controversial deportation practices.\n\nNoem, 54, testified before the House on Thursday, Dec. 11, about national security threats, where she was questioned by a representative about the deportation of military veterans by the Trump administration.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, how many United States military veterans have you deported?\" Rep. Seth Magaziner, a Democrat from Rhode Island, asked Noem during the hearing.\n\nWhen she replied, \"Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans,\" Magaziner began to express his respect for military members as a man who had been sitting behind him stood and brought over a tablet featuring a veteran calling into the hearing over video.\n\n\"As Americans, we owe everything to those who have served our country in uniform, particularly those who have served in combat. Do you agree with that?\" Magaziner asked.\n\nNoem began to say, \"Sir, I believe that people that are in the United States that are citizens have legal status here—\" before Magaziner interrupted to introduce the video guest.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park,\" Magaziner said. \"He is a United States Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989.\"\n\nMagaziner said Park — a Purple Heart recipient — had struggled with PTSD and substance abuse issues after his time in combat, and had been arrested in the '90s for \"minor drug offenses.\" NPR previously reported that Park was charged with possession of a controlled substance and bail jumping while battling an addiction to crack cocaine.\n\nPark has been sober for the last 14 years, the congressman told Noem, before saying, \"Earlier this year, you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn't lived in since he was 7 years old.\"\n\nMagaziner then asked Noem to join him in \"thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country.\"\n\nShe responded by saying she is \"grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws, and knows that our laws are important and every one of them needs to be enforced.\"\n\nWhen he pressed her about looking into Park's case, Noem said she \"absolutely\" would, but added, \"Our programs need to have integrity, as well.\"\n\nMagaziner continued with his questioning when he introduced a Navy veteran named Jim Brown who is married to a woman who came to the U.S. from Ireland and has lived in the country for 48 years, but has been in prison for the last four months.\n\n\"She did not come here illegally, and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks totaling $80 ten years ago,\" Magaziner said.\n\nNoem claimed it was not \"my prerogative, my latitude or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country get enforced,\" but Magaziner hit back by claiming she has \"broad discretion\" as DHS secretary. When asked, she said she would review the case of Brown's wife.\n\nThe congressman also introduced a veteran whose father, Narciso Barranco, had been targeted by immigration agents over the summer and punched in the the head. He asked Noem to consider offering parole to Barranco.\n\nMagaziner went on to criticize Noem, telling her, “There are many problems with your leadership, but the biggest problem is this: You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys, go after the terrorists, do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”\n\nNoem allegedly left the hearing early, according to The Hill and The Washington Post, claiming she had to attend another meeting that had been canceled. Noem’s office told The Hill the secretary found out the meeting had been called off after leaving the witness table.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nNoem has come under fire during her tenure at DHS for her attention-grabbing deportation tactics. Earlier this month, she said on X that she had been discussing ramping up travel bans with President Donald Trump.\n\nNoem recommended a \"full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"\n\nHer Dec. 1 post came not long after Trump, 79, said his administration planned to \"permanently pause\" migration from \"Third World Countries.\" He did not identify countries by name or clarify how he would implement the immigration pause.",

    "description": "As McDonald's prices have soared in recent years, the chain's corporate leadership plans a change that could affect how much a meal at the restaurant costs.",
    "fullText": "About 95% of McDonald's locations across the globe are operated by franchisees, who normally set their restaurants' pricing. But soon, McDonald's corporate office will start judging how well those franchisees' prices attract and retain customers. \"Effective January 1, 2026, we are enhancing our global franchising standards across all Segments to reinforce accountability for value leadership,\" Andrew Gregory, McDonald's senior vice president of global franchising, development, and delivery, stated in a memo, per CNBC. Those new standards will give McDonald's franchisees \"greater clarity ... to ensure every restaurant delivers consistent, reliable value across the full customer experience,\" Gregory explained.\n\nAs part of this effort, the corporation will offer company-backed \"pricing consultants, tools, and other levels that support informed choices and elevate the overall guest experience across all order points,\" Mason Smoot, McDonald's USA chief restaurant officer said in another memo to franchisees, according to CNBC. Restaurant operators will be graded on how well they use these tools and adhere to guidelines. McDonald's will penalize franchisees who don't live up to the new standards with penalties that range from being forbidden to expand to the termination of the current agreement.\n\nMcDonald's is making its latest standard enhancement move at a time when the restaurant industry continues to struggle with rising food and labor costs. As a result, restaurant prices have gone up 34% since 2019 across the nation, CNN reported in April 2025, a pace that's much faster than the overall growth of inflation. And that trend has caused people already dealing with price jumps for essential household items to eat at casual and fast-food dining spots less often.\n\nMcDonald's franchisees have increased prices by about 40% since 2019, according to Restaurant Business. To keep affordable options on its menu, the corporate office has launched extra value meal (EVM) plans in September 2025. And while sales grew globally by about 3.6% in third quarter of 2025, they were still below Wall Street expectations, CNBC reported. A big reason for that is traffic from lower-income customers fell by \"nearly double digits in the third quarter, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years,\" Christopher Kempczinski, McDonald's chairman and CEO said in a November 2025 earnings call, per Seeking Alpha. And the only way to solve that is to fix customers' \"value perceptions\" on the meals the restaurants offer. \"We heard our customers loud and clear on the need to deliver everyday value and affordability across their favorite items on our menu board,\" Kempczinski said.",

    "description": "\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known in part for saying controversial or \"careless\" things, but as the Guardian reported, he recently made a sincerely shocking admission.\n\nOn Dec. 9, Musk appeared on a podcast hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller. During that appearance, the Tesla CEO made a highly unusual set of statements, describing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was previously run by him, as only \"a little bit successful.\" Miller asked Musk if he would do it all again, and he said he wouldn't.\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said, referencing Tesla vandalism.\n\nIn 2025, Musk's involvement in American politics moved beyond funding and into an active government role.\n\nMusk first floated the idea of a \"government efficiency\" division in August 2024, and on Jan. 20, the concept formally became the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nWhat followed was, by all accounts, an immediate frenzy of government cuts. Staffed by individuals as young as 19, none older than 25, DOGE was likened to a \"wrecking ball.\"\n\nWithin a week, more than two million federal civil servants received an email pressuring them to resign from their positions and transition \"to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.\"\n\nMusk repeatedly pledged to cut $1 trillion worth of what he insisted was \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" in Washington, despite scant evidence of the purported problem. One of DOGE's first high-profile actions was to decommission USAID, a humanitarian aid agency.\n\nDOGE \"spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. Could gone to some great parties.

    "description": "A movie based on Activision's Call of Duty series is in the works now at Paramount, which is now led by billionaire and Call of Duty superfan David Ellison. Prolific writer and director Taylor Sheridan is writing the script for the film, with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg attached to direct.\nActivision had been trying to make Call of Duty movies for years, so why is it finally happening now? Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said.",

Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty touched on this year's installment of the military shooter series, and although he didn't address sales numbers directly, he did acknowledge the hardships of the franchise's annual model.\nSpeaking to Variety, Booty said that \"shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way.\"\nA new Call of Duty game has been released every year since the franchise's beginning in 2003, and it doesn't appear that Xbox-owned publisher Activision will stop this pattern any time soon. The only change to the release model is that the series will no longer release back-to-back installments of the same subseries, as Modern Warfare and Black Ops have both done.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration is arguing that requiring real-time American Sign Language interpretation of events like White House press briefings “would severely intrude on the President’s prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,\" part of a lawsuit seeking to require the White House to provide the services.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys haven't elaborated on how doing so might hamper the portrayal President Donald Trump seeks to present to the public. But overturning policies encompassing diversity, equity and inclusion have become a hallmark of his second administration, starting with his very first week back in the White House.\n\nThe National Association for the Deaf sued the Trump administration in May, arguing that the cessation of American Sign Language interpretation — which the Biden administration had used regularly — represented “denying hundreds of thousands of deaf Americans meaningful access to the White House’s real-time communications on various issues of national and international import.” The group also sued during Trump's first administration, seeking ASL interpretation for briefings related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a June court filing opposing the association's request for a preliminary injunction, reported Thursday by Politico, attorneys for the Justice Department argued that being required to provide sign language interpretation for news conferences “would severely intrude on the President’s prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,” also writing that the president has “the prerogative to shape his Administration’s image and messaging as he sees fit.”\n\nGovernment attorneys also argued that it provides the hard of hearing or Deaf community with other ways to access the president's statements, like online transcripts of events, or closed captioning. The administration has also argued that it would be difficult to wrangle such services in the event that Trump spontaneously took questions from the press, rather than at a formal briefing.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately comment Friday on the ongoing lawsuit or answer questions about the administration's argument regarding the damage of interpretation services to Trump's “image.”\n\nIn their June filing, government attorneys questioned if other branches of government were being held to a similar standard if they didn’t provide the same interpretative services as sought by the association.\n\nAs home to Gallaudet University, the world’s premier college for the deaf and hard of hearing, Washington likely has an ample pool of trained ASL interpreters into which the White House could tap. Mayor Muriel Bowser has made ASL interpretation a mainstay of her appearances, including a pair of interpreters who swap in and out.\n\nLast month, a federal judge rejected that and other objections from the government, issuing an order requiring the White House to provide American Sign Language interpreting for Trump and Leavitt's remarks in real time. The White House has appealed the ruling, and while the administration has begun providing American Sign Language interpreting at some events, there's disagreement over what services it has to supply.\n\nOn his first week back in office, Trump signed a sweeping executive order putting a stop to diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government. In putting his own imprint on the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in January issued an order stating that DEI policies were “incompatible\" with the department's mission,\n\nThis week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomatic correspondence to return to the more traditional Times New Roman font, arguing that the Biden administration's 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font had emerged from misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP",

    "fullText": "The latest installment of the legendary series could have been a Breath of the Wild-level revitalization, but it’s instead a shadow of its progenitors.\n\n on December 12, 2025 at 10:00AM PST\n\nNew Metroid games are few and far between, so the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should have been a monumental event for the fanbase. Instead, eight years after its announcement, and 18 years after the previous game, Nintendo’s big December 2025 release landed with a loud thud. Already, this once highly anticipated title is poised to be one of the series' most divisive games, earning a spot alongside Other M and Federation Force.\n\nThis isn't for lack of polish, as Prime 4 is indeed visually stunning and perhaps the greatest first-party showcase of graphics on the Nintendo Switch and its successor. But while it has its share of enthusiasts, it’s difficult not to feel underwhelmed by the final product in comparison to prior Prime games and even other, similar entries in the Metroidvania space that has grown in Nintendo’s frequent absence.\n\nThe list of Metroidvania games from independent and third-party developers in the past decade alone is astonishing, with Ori and the Blind Forest, Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Animal Well, and others throwing new concepts and innovations into the genre’s well of ideas. Hollow Knight and its follow-up, Silksong, have captivated players with their dense worldbuilding, roaming NPCs, and optional side objectives, all of which have come to define the critically acclaimed series. Nine Sols stood out with its intricate combat system, while more out-there games like pinball Metroidvania Yoku’s Island Express have proven anything can be a Metroidvania with the right amount of determination and creativity. Even Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown changed the game with something as simple as an in-game screenshot system to help with backtracking. The Metroidvania genre is rapidly iterating with a volume of unique takes.\n\nUnfortunately, Metroid Prime 4 lacks the same ambition as its contemporaries and serves as proof that the series is now lagging behind the very games that it inspired. All Nintendo has had to show in the midst of this huge explosion of search-action games is Metroid Dread, which, as good a game as it is, is far from the most innovative or unique game of the bunch.\n\nIt’s disappointing to see Nintendo become an also-ran in a space it helped create. Not every game the company publishes has to be an earth-shattering release that completely shakes up the tenets of game development. But this is a company that has reinvented its other legacy properties multiple times. For Zelda, Ocarina of Time was a revolutionary transition to 3D, while Breath of the Wild once again reimagined the series with a new open-world format. The first Metroid Prime in 2002 was a similar accomplishment, unmatched by anything in the series since then.\n\nPrime 4 could have taken a similar approach: using familiar gameplay concepts and structures while building something new, unexpected, or refreshing. Nintendo and Retro Studios could have challenged our notion of what a Metroid game could be. Instead, Prime 4 feels archaic--the same as usual, except further distilled and with the added prefix of \"Psychic\" before everything.\n\nUnder the hood, Prime 4 reuses game design ideas from the 1990s and 2000s, which wouldn’t be egregious if it had iterated on or refined any of them. The closest feature to an innovation that the game includes is the nonsensical paywalling of background music. The end result is a strange mix of concepts from the first three Prime games, as if Prime 4 was based on a vague memory of the original trilogy.\n\nIt retains the visual identity established in the original Metroid Prime, but it turns the complex rooms and environments into long, narrow corridors with the occasional split path. Prime 4’s world structure is somewhat like Prime 2’s, centering on an overworld that connects the different biomes. However, unlike in Prime 2, Prime 4's map lacks any connection between the biomes themselves, and the Ocarina of Time-like overworld of Sol Valley is more of a chore to travel through than its own compelling area to explore. And controversially, Prime 4 has the voice acting and cutscene-filled cinematics of Prime 3, except that Prime 4 forgot to include either a story that makes sense or reasonable character motivations. All in all, Prime 4 is like a botched cover version of the preceding three games.\n\nPrime 4’s loop is essentially this: Enter a dungeon, go through lengthy hallways, ride some elevators, turn on the power or complete some other objective, and then backtrack through the entire area while facing a new challenge. It’s extremely straightforward, and I was able to accept that loop as a tutorial section--but Prime 4 never felt like it got past the tutorial.\n\nThe borderline on-rails nature of Prime 4 is problematic for a series--and genre--based around exploration. Linearity and hand-holding aren’t new to the series--Fusion and Zero Mission were early examples of the game explicitly giving players a destination waypoint on the map. Prime 3 is also considered by fans to be a more linear affair, and Metroid Dread, with all of its Metroidvania-ness, imploys clever techniques to provide an invisible guiding hand to help players advance through its world. But while Dread was a modernization and streamlining of 2D Metroid, Prime 4 feels like a regression, with its version of streamlining actively dissolving much-needed tension and discouraging player agency.\n\nThis is further exemplified by the game’s characters, who continue to radio you even after they stop following you around. To hear a character \"suggesting\" where to go in an almost passive-aggressive tone feels patronizing to me as a player, and I found myself ignoring these suggestions, defiantly turning my Vi-O-La motorcycle in the opposite direction through the mostly empty desert. I felt the need to push back on Prime 4’s guiding hand to feel any sort of empowerment, but even then, there’s little to do outside of the game’s critical path.\n\nPrime 4 stripping away that Metroidvania structure and feel is particularly disappointing given that the 3D Metroidvania space is largely untapped. There are hints of Metroid Prime in games like Batman: Arkham Asylum and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. But with how groundbreaking Prime 1 was, it’s sad that it didn’t inspire imitators to the same degree as Breath of the Wild did after its release. Prime 4 could have been a watershed moment for 3D exploration-based games--instead, it wastes the opportunity, relapsing to antiquated ideas and questionable design decisions to form an overall underwhelming experience.\n\nNintendo should be leading the charge in the Metroidvania space, as it does with platformers, action-adventure games, and other genres. Unfortunately, Prime 4 feels more like an obligation for stakeholders and investors--something Nintendo couldn’t back away from after prematurely announcing it, rather than a passion project that showcases the company’s ingenuity. Naturally, this leads to questions about just how troubled Prime 4’s development was.\n\nUltimately, the Metroidvania genre doesn’t need Nintendo in order to thrive--other game creators have long proven this case. While developers may not find inspiration in modern Metroid, they can still look to the likes of Hollow Knight as a North Star. The democratization of the Metroidvania is objectively a good thing, as no one company should have a monopoly on a genre. But despite my misgivings with Prime 4 and my contentment with competing Metroidvanias, I still want Nintendo to make more Metroid games. It’s my favorite Nintendo series, and it deserves the same treatment as the company’s other key brands.\n\nA comforting thought is that the reaction to Prime 4 might send Nintendo back to the drawing board for the Metroid series. Although it might have fumbled its Breath of the Wild moment, hopefully there will be something of a Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword effect, in which Prime 4's shortcomings lead to Nintendo reevaluating the franchise and putting out a more ambitious title the next time around.\n\nBut if and when we get a Prime 5, my expectations will be even larger. Nintendo wants to be all about innovation, and I want the next Metroid to be a landmark achievement that other developers will follow. The Metroid franchise deserves nothing less. I just hope it won’t take another 18 years for Metroid Prime to get that chance.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

While last night's announcement trailer at The Game Awards 2025 was surely exciting for Knights of the Old Republic fans, the truth is that the game, led by original KOTOR and Mass Effect director Casey Hudson, is in a very early stage of development.\nAccording to the official Star Wars website, Hudson's new studio, Arcanaut Studios, was formed just this year, after his previous studio closed in November 2024. The studio's careers page contains listings for several senior-level positions, so the announcement trailer also doubles as a recruitment advertisement, a tactic that developers often employ.\nWith the lengthy development cycles that high-profile games undergo these days, we're probably years away from seeing anything concrete from Fate of the Old Republic, and even further from a release.",

    "title": "Keeping the Police Out of Pregnancy Care",
    "description": "Lourdes A. Rivera, Dr. Jamila...",
    "fullText": "We must be vigilant in keeping law enforcement out of exam rooms.\n\nImagine you’re pregnant and excited for your new baby—tracking kicks, setting up the crib, picking out names. Then comes sudden, unexpected pain. You lose your pregnancy at home, terrified and bleeding, and you do what you’ve always taught your kids to do in an emergency: you call for help.\n\nThe paramedics arrive—and with them, police. The questions come before the care: How far along were you? How long did you wait before calling 911? Did you get regular prenatal care? Were you excited to be pregnant? Have you taken any drugs? Instead of prioritizing your physical and emotional well-being, you’re suddenly facing criminal charges, worried about losing your kids, and trying to find a lawyer you can afford.\n\nCases like these are not unique. They have been happening across the country in the first two years since Roe v. Wade fell. Pregnancy Justice and our research partners have documented more than 400 prosecutions across 16 states for pregnancy, miscarriage, and abortion—as police and prosecutors, often alerted by hospitals and healthcare workers when someone seeks care, treat medical emergencies as crimes. This is pregnancy criminalization: when someone is charged with a crime because of their behavior during pregnancy, or because of a pregnancy loss, such as miscarriage or stillbirth. These charges are typically not for abortion-specific crimes; in fact, at least for now, most states cannot charge the pregnant person with an abortion-related crime. Instead, prosecutors misuse and misapply various statutes to charge pregnant people with anything from “child” abuse, neglect, or endangerment, to murder, manslaughter, or abuse of a corpse.\n\nPregnancy criminalization in the United States started long before the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe, but the guardrails that once existed to protect women from being criminalized for pregnancy loss or abortion are now off. Today, it is a dangerous framework driving these prosecutions, one that aims to treat fertilized eggs, embryos, and fetuses as “persons” with rights, and recasts behavior during pregnancy as a potential crime. In practice, this kind of criminalization falls hardest on low-income, Black, brown, Indigenous, and rural communities—those most at risk of over-policing and a lack of affordable health care or legal counsel.\n\nIn many cases, the “evidence” used to prosecute a pregnant person is a positive urine toxicology test or drug screen—often ordered and shared with child welfare authorities and the police without a patient’s knowledge or informed consent. Some positive drug tests are later shown to be false; others are a result of prescribed medications; still others reflect substance use or substance use disorder (SUD). And yet this positive test is often enough to charge a pregnant patient with a felony for allegedly putting their pregnancy at “risk” of potential harm, often resulting in the removal of their other children from their care. It’s why leading medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend against the use of drug testing to punish or criminalize people who use drugs during pregnancy.\n\nThe application of child abuse or neglect statutes to embryos and fetuses is a slippery and dangerous slope. The practice quickly expands: Any pregnancy loss is treated with suspicion. As this punitive net widens, the actual systems that support the health and well-being of patients and their infants—prenatal care, mental health care, and treatment for SUD—are being stripped away. We are witnessing the gutting of Medicaid, which is worsening maternity care deserts, and the defunding of proven treatment for SUD, which was already insufficient to meet capacity, even as overdose deaths rise among pregnant and postpartum people. If policymakers and legislators were truly interested in improving outcomes for pregnant people and their babies, they would invest in care, not punishment.\n\nBut by participating in nonconsensual drug testing and reporting of those results to government agencies and legal entities, hospitals and clinicians are inviting law enforcement into exam rooms, initiating and facilitating the criminalization and incarceration of pregnant people. Each decision amounts to centering the institution’s needs at the expense of the patients, who are then blamed for not getting pregnancy “right.”\n\nIt can be overwhelming to navigate the complicated health care system as a pregnant person, whether giving birth or seeking care for pregnancy loss; the system was designed that way. One powerful way to interrupt this cycle of punishment is by staying alert and informed. We can all help our community members, neighbors, loved ones, and family members by going with them to visits and listening, taking notes, and asking questions with their safety in mind. In the midst of so much political chaos, our most important tool is information about our rights and how to protect those rights. For example, a person can exercise their Fifth Amendment right by refusing to talk to the police without legal representation present. It’s essential not to let unconstitutional threats and actions distract us from demanding that our freedoms be protected.\n\nHere’s the good news: People seeking care and those who want to support them don’t have to do it alone. Clinicians and hospitals have agency too, and organizers around the country are working hard to ensure they know this. Health systems can refuse to allow law enforcement into the exam room, by prohibiting non-required and nonconsensual reporting and by ordering tests to support care rather than to build criminal cases. These strategies work. In New York City, a policy shift like this cut toxicology-only reports to child welfare by 80 percent with no negative impact on infant health outcomes. We can collectively advocate for more cities and states to follow their lead and protect families.\n\nProsecutors also should state plainly that no one should be criminalized for pregnancy loss, abortion, or substance use and they will refuse to prosecute those who are. Medical education should teach medical trainees about providing patients with health care that is responsive to their needs and supportive of their goals, not making assumptions about what’s “best” for a patient and increasing their risk of criminalization. If people are facing threats of criminalization for their pregnancy outcomes, they can reach out to organizations like Pregnancy Justice to get the legal support they need.\n\nOur goal should be simple: safeguard the health of the pregnant and postpartum person. That commitment improves outcomes for newborns, for patients after pregnancy loss, and for families. But it is going to take all of us. Our personal advocacy for our loved ones, our laws, policies, and medical guidelines must support one premise: No one should be criminalized for being pregnant, however that pregnancy ends.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. U.S., The Nation’s justice correspondent recaps a major death penalty case that came before the high court as well as the shenanigans of a man who’s angling to be the next SCOTUS justice. Plus: Michael Jordan for AG?\n\nFascist Trump goon and recently elevated Third Circuit Judge Emil Bove attended a Trump rally in the Poconos this week. Bove has emerged as a front-runner for the next Supreme Court opening, so it might not surprise most people that he opted for a front row seat to listen to his benefactor talk about “shi thole countries.”\n\nThe thing is: It’s a serious ethics violation for a sitting federal judge to attend a political rally. Cannons 2 and 5 of the US Courts Judicial Code of Conduct prohibit most federal judges (the inexplicable exception is Supreme Court justices) from attending political events and ask them to avoid even the appearance of impropriety when it comes to supporting political candidates. Bove has clearly breached this code of conduct, and watchdog groups have already filed ethics complaints against him.\n\nNot that it will do any good. Although federal judges must follow a code of ethics, they are not subject to independent, third-party oversight. Instead, ethics complaints against them are handled by the court they serve on. In Bove’s case, this means the complaints will be heard by his colleagues on the Third Circuit. And even if his fellow judges are as aghast at his behavior as they should be, the stiffest penalties for ethics violations usually amount to no more than censure. Federal courts do not have the authority to remove their own judges.\n\nThe only body that does have the power to kick Bove off the court for his corruption is Congress, through the constitutional process of impeachment. So now I am forced to quote a Democrat who cannot retire soon enough, the minority leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin. Here’s what he told Courthouse News Service: “Mr. Bove is a loyalist to President Trump, but I hoped that after he received this appointment to the federal bench at the second-highest court in the land, he would show better judgment.” When CNS asked Durbin whether Senate Democrats would “act against Bove,” he replied that he was still thinking about it.\n\nA literal chimpanzee that was trained only to throw feces when displeased would be a more effective leader on Senate Judiciary than Durbin at this point.\n\nIn fairness, even if Durbin had sufficient spine to act, it wouldn’t matter. You need 67 votes to convict on an impeachment charge in the Senate (which itself assumes you could get charges through Mike Johnson’s House), and Republicans are already twisting themselves into pretzels to defend Bove. Check out this torturous logic from Senator Josh Hawley: “If a campaign hosts a dinner, a judge can’t go do that,” he told Courthouse News Service. “That’s a gift from a campaign. I think an event by a public official is fine. It’s within his discretion.”\n\nAccording to Hawley, Bove can’t go to a dinner hosted by his friend Donald Trump, but can go to a political rally for his friend Donald Trump. What makes Hawley’s argument all the more risible is that it’s devoid of any reference to the actual statutory code covering judicial ethics. It’s a standard that Hawley is making up on the fly.\n\nNone of this remotely matters to Bove’s long-term project to be a Supreme Court justice. If Justice Sam Alito retires and Trump nominates Bove, Republicans will confirm him while Durbin and the Democrats continue to think about what to do next.\n\nStudentNation\n\n /\n\n Thai Loyd\n\nI like to periodically remind everybody that the Trump administration and the Supreme Court are serial killers, finding speedy and efficient ways to murder people on death row. The Supreme Court held oral arguments this week in Hamm v. Smith, a capital punishment case in which lawyers for a person the state wants to kill argues that their client is intellectually disabled and should therefore be shielded from the death penalty.\n\nAs a public intellectual and a person who makes their living on at least the appearance of being “smart,” I’m always shocked when people bring up IQ scores. In my expensively educated mind, IQ has largely been debunked as a reliable way of measuring intellectual capacity. When people quote IQ scores to me, all I hear is “Big number good, fire bad.”\n\nIt turns out that we still heavily rely on IQ scores to determine who is fit to die. If you score under 70, you are deemed to be mentally incapable of understanding the severity of your crime, and thus it is cruel for the state to murder you. If you score over 70, well, apparently, you deserve to die.\n\nJoseph Smith has taken four IQ tests over the past 40 years that he’s been on death row in Alabama. He’s scored between 72 and 78. Alabama wants to execute him based on these scores, but a panel of experts, taking what they described as a holistic approach that goes beyond his IQ scores, has determined that Smith is intellectually disabled. Alabama is asking the Supreme Court to let them kill the guy all the same.\n\nIn case I’m not being clear, I think the death penalty is wrong, morally barbaric, and a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. But any argument that devolves into whether a few points on a standardized test marks you for death is darkly absurdist. Alabama is literally arguing that it can ignore experts who say Smith is intellectually disabled because he scored too high, by a couple of points, on a test.\n\nIt doesn’t appear that the Supreme Court will agree. While listening to oral arguments, I could not get past Justice Neil Gorsuch, the most homicidal justice when it comes to capital punishment. Explaining Gorsuch’s cruel and bloodthirsty commitment to the death penalty was one of the first articles I wrote for The Nation.\n\nBut Ian Millhisier argues that if I hadn’t been blinded by Gorsuch’s usual arguments to kill as many people as quickly as possible, I might have noticed that the occasional tag team of Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seemed skeptical of Alabama’s arguments.\n\nAll I heard was Republican justifications for our continued use of medieval punishments, but I hope Millhiser is right.\n\nThe most politically important case the Supreme Court heard this week was Trump v. Slaughter, a case that will determine whether Trump can fire administrators from independent federal agencies at will. The Republicans on the court sounded eager to give Trump this authoritarian power, thereby completing a long-held Republican goal of destroying the administrative state. I wrote about what will happen when they do this.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nLast Friday, the World Cup, which will be played this summer in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, held its draw to sort all 48 teams in next year’s tournament. FIFA, the organization governing global soccer, turned it into a three-hour Trump rally.\n\nFIFA is generally disgusting. Dave Zirin explains in The Nation that FIFA president Gianni Infantino is currently accused of aiding and abetting Israel’s war crimes in Palestine.\n\nInfantino is also the guy who came up with the idea to create a FIFA “peace prize” and award it to Trump during the World Cup draw. He was so solicitous of Trump during the proceedings that I thought Trump was going to have to pay him hush money when the thing was over.\n\nThere are two likely explanations for Infantino and FIFA’s total prostration to Trump. One is that Infantino has long been rumored to be interested in launching his own authoritarian political career, somewhere in Europe, and he’s using FIFA as a springboard for those aspirations. The other reason is practical: Trump is a fickle madman easily capable of ruining the tournament set to be played in the country he now rules. But flattery will get you everywhere with Trump, and kissing his ass during World Cup warm-up events is one way to keep him from messing with actual World Cup events.\n\nHere’s a fantastic YouTube video from the best American explicator of soccer, Zealand Shannon, which details everything that happened during the draw, and why. The Global South revolutionary in me wishes countries would just boycott this World Cup, but I know, practically speaking, that’s not going to happen. I mean, everybody went to freaking Qatar last time, so political righteousness is quite beyond the scope of international soccer. And in my more calm moments, I don’t actually think the athletes who’ve spent their entire lives dreaming of this opportunity should be punished just because one of the three host countries happens to be run by a racist nincompoop.\n\nStill, I can’t say I’m looking forward to this year’s tournament. If the draw is any indication, it’s going to be drenched in disgusting Trumpism. My most realistic hope now is that when Trump shambles out to hand the winner their trophy, someone accidently kicks him in the balls.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v.

    "description": "Taylor Swift is known for her glamorous red-carpet looks and sparkling stage outfits. In her everyday life, she's equally fashionable and flashy.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift knows a thing or two about fashion.\n\nOf course, she has a certified triple platinum single titled \"Style.\" But there's also the matter of her concert outfits, red-carpet looks, and standout street style.\n\nThe latter, in particular, has evolved greatly over the years. She once stepped out in outfits comprised of miniskirts and tank tops — but now sports designer looks from Vivienne Westwood and shoes from Christian Louboutin.\n\nHere are the best ensembles she's worn while out and about over the years.\n\nFor a New York City outing in November 2011, for example, Swift tucked a navy, cable-knit sweater by Ralph Lauren into a pleated yellow skirt from ModCloth.\n\nHer academia-esque look was completed with magenta Marc Jacobs kitten heels, red lipstick, and a blue Fendi purse that matched the sparkling 13 drawn on her hand.\n\nLess than a month after her fifth studio album was released, Swift was photographed spending time with Karlie Kloss in New York City.\n\nShe wore a little black dress underneath a tan, tattersall coat, sheer polka-dot tights, and lace-up heeled Oxfords.\n\nSwift also carried a burgundy purse and sported a thin gold headband adorned with a small bow.\n\nIn August 2016, Swift walked around New York City while wearing a pink Brandy Melville tank top underneath a denim overall-style dress from Tularosa.\n\nShe also sported a black Marni bag and flower-printed sneakers from Gucci.\n\nOne evening in September 2016, Swift was photographed wearing a black V-neck Aritzia bodysuit worn underneath a white miniskirt from Related Apparel.\n\nBut her accessories really made the outfit. Swift wore strappy sandals from Louise et Cie, a tan clutch by Aspinal of London, and a white choker necklace from Adornmonde.\n\nHer striped, long-sleeved bodysuit was from PH5, while her pleated, burgundy miniskirt was from Urban Outfitters.\n\nShe wore both pieces with Michael Kors sunglasses, a Burberry bag, and platform, velvet sandals from Aquazurra.\n\nShe was photographed in July of that year wearing a pinstriped Unravel Project shirt hanging off one shoulder and distressed denim shorts from Gucci.\n\nWhile the casual outfit matched the dark aesthetic of her sixth studio album — as did her black leather Tod's boots and Tommy Hilfiger bag — her vibrant lipstick, wavy hair, and Miu Miu earrings hinted at the era to come.\n\nDays before her song \"ME!\" was released to the world, Swift stepped out in New York City wearing one of her quirkiest outfits to date.\n\nIt consisted of a floral Zimmermann dress, a red Mango blazer, and Rupert Sanderson sandals.\n\nThe highlights of Swift's outfit, however, were her pink-tinted hair and her cat-printed purse from Anya Hindmarch.\n\nAfter performing three sold-out shows at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, in late May, Swift was photographed outside Electric Lady Studios in New York City.\n\nShe wore a black cotton dress with a black belt around the waist, $450 Waylon slide sandals from Anine Bing, $200 Indio sunglasses from the same brand, and a brown version of the $895 M Frame Box Bag from Mansur Gavriel.\n\nBut most impressive was Swift's gold, diamond-encrusted Cartier necklace from the 1980s.\n\nThe sparkling jewelry — called the Agrafe Herringbone Twisted Necklace — is no longer produced, but one was sold on 1stDibs, an online luxury marketplace, for $27,250.\n\nShe wore a pinstripe shirt from The Row over a pleated Free People skort and paired both pieces with a baseball cap, lace-up shoes, and a Patou purse.\n\nSwift's navy pants were designed by Vince, while her sheer cashmere tank top was by Gabriela Hearst.\n\nShe wore them with ankle boots from The Row, a Ralph Lauren baseball cap, and a purse from Yuzefi.\n\nHer chic black-and-gold ensemble featured an $825 houndstooth coat from Gant over a Versace corset top and high-waisted black trousers.\n\nShe also carried the $340 Nirvana bag from Aupen and wore a $70 gold necklace from Mazin Jewels. Her updo hairstyle and red lipstick completed the look.\n\nShe was photographed in New York City wearing an $850 rugby shirt from Stella McCartney as a dress.\n\nShe wore the shirt, which was emblazoned with a golden horse design, with knee-high Prada boots in an auburn shade and a corduroy hat from Ralph Lauren.\n\nDesigned by Clio Peppiatt, the black garment was sleeveless, covered in black sparkles, and decorated with silver moons and stars.\n\nSwift wore the minidress with a fuzzy Anine Bing jacket draped over her arms, platform heels, and a silver Aquazzura bag in hand.\n\nAs she left the party, she was also seen wearing a massive teardrop-shaped ring made from opal and blue topaz stones. Though many assumed it was gifted to her by Kelce, it was later revealed to have been a birthday present from Keleigh Teller, Swift's friend and Miles Teller's wife.\n\nSwift stepped out during a September 2024 visit to Electric Lady Studios in New York City in a three-piece outfit from Monse. Inspired by art from the 1950s, each tapestry piece was decorated with images of a landscape and a landing UFO.\n\nThe musician likely chose to wear the $1,490 jacket, $740 corset, and $890 miniskirt as a nod to her song \"Down Bad,\" which uses alien analogies to express her feelings about a breakup.\n\nShe paired the outfit with $1,270 statement boots from Vivienne Westwood, adding a high-fashion touch to the quirky outfit.\n\nWhile out with Kelce in October, Swift was photographed wearing a $1,700 lace-embellished Gucci corset, a $195 faux-leather miniskirt from RTA, and $1,720 Louis Vuitton boots, which are now sold out.\n\nThe three pieces created a feminine and edgy ensemble that also embodied quiet luxury, especially thanks to her accessories.\n\nShe sported a $2,498 Ralph Lauren coat, carried a $4,400 Dior Saddle bag, and accessorized with two expensive rings: a $3,150 gold and diamond band from Louis Vuitton and a $3,490 pear-shaped piece from Shala Karimi.\n\nMost of Swift's street-style looks are classic and subdued. The dress she wore in New York City in November 2024, though, was anything but.\n\nDesigned by Vivienne Westwood, the $2,390 piece had a structured, off-the-shoulder bodice that looked like it had been painted with strokes of yellow, blue, and red. Its puffed skirt, on the other hand, was decorated with uneven blue stripes.\n\nSwift completed the outfit with $795 velvet sandals from Aquazzura, which have since sold out, a vintage necklace from For Future Reference that previously retailed for $12,750, and a $355 Vivienne Westwood purse.\n\nShe was photographed holding hands with Kelce in New York City, where the couple sported coordinated black and red outfits.\n\nSwift's included a $1,095 crystal-covered coat from Simkhai, a $498 minidress from Fleur Du Mal, and Louboutin sandal heels.\n\nShe also wore her signature red lipstick and an assortment of fine jewelry from De Beers.\n\nShe visited New York City with Kelce again, this time wearing a Louis Vuitton sweater tucked into a wrap skirt from the same fashion house.\n\nThe most eye-catching piece of her look, though, was her floral-printed fishnet tights. She wore them beneath $1,940 Louis Vuitton boots.\n\nShe was photographed in New York City wearing a plaid miniskirt from Miu Miu, a dark bodysuit, and a $3,730 Max Mara coat.\n\nHer accessories included suede Louboutin boots, sheer tights, a $1,300 YSL bag, and diamond earrings from Etiq.",

    "title": "My husband and I always fought about when to leave for the airport. So, we created a travel rule that solved everything.",
    "description": "After many arguments with my husband about when to leave for flights, we started arriving at the airport separately. This trick helped our marriage.",
    "fullText": "For the nine years we've been a couple, my husband and I have taken countless flights together.\n\nWe've visited family in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Montana, and Maryland. We've wandered around the Duomo in Florence, enjoyed tacos and tequila in Mexico City, and explored the breathtaking Normandy coastline.\n\nNow that we live in London, travel has ramped up. We're in our late 20s and early 30s, and wedding season has us flying back to the US on a near-monthly basis for our friends' nuptials … in addition to other scheduled trips.\n\nUnfortunately, we would get in a fight — almost every time — about what time to leave for the airport.\n\nAs a chronically early person, I hate rushing and get intense anxiety about cutting things too close.\n\nI'd rather sit in an airport for an extra hour than make a sweaty sprint through the terminal to catch a flight.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, doesn't like to waste time — and with his demanding, meeting-filled job, he rarely has a moment to spare.\n\nHis perfect travel day involves passing through security as the plane begins boarding. Though that's anxiety-inducing to me, for what it's worth, he's only ever missed one flight.\n\nBecause of this, in the hours before a flight, I'd be huffing around our apartment with bags packed and shoes on. He'd get frustrated that I was rushing him, and I'd get annoyed that he was making us \"late.\"\n\nCue lots of tense moments and grumpy silence in transit.\n\nA few months ago, ahead of yet another long-haul flight to the US, I suggested what I thought was a reasonable time to leave — not too early, not too late. My husband wanted to leave even later.\n\nI decided to just leave when I wanted to avoid the stress and inevitable argument. We were taking public transportation, so the cost was the same either way.\n\nI told him I'd meet him at the gate, gave him a quick kiss, and made my way — happily, unhurriedly — to the airport. He arrived much later, but still on time.\n\nWe proceeded to have the smoothest trip we'd ever had in nine years.\n\nSince we started arriving at the airport separately, we noticed tons of other benefits, too.\n\nMy husband and I have very different work schedules, and this setup helps us both effectively manage our responsibilities. Sometimes, I'll get to the airport extra early to take a call or put finishing touches on an assignment.\n\nWe've also found that there's no financial downside to this system.\n\nObviously, this travel hack works best for city dwellers with easy access to public transport. It's definitely trickier if you live out in the suburbs and either share a car or don't want to park two at the airport.\n\nBecause we've only ever lived together in cities, though, this option is easy for us. Even if we planned to take an Uber together, the added cost of one of us leaving earlier on public transit is generally pretty marginal — in our case, usually no more than about $15.\n\nBest of all, by arriving at the airport when we like, we start our trips on a positive note. The last thing we need on an already stressful travel day is to be fighting or feeling frustrated with or another.\n\nThough this works well for us, we don't always travel separately.\n\nThere are times when our schedules make it more convenient to head to the airport together, or we have enough luggage that it makes more sense to schedule an Uber.\n\nIn those instances, we talk through our schedules the day before to make sure we can clearly communicate expectations so that there are no surprises.\n\nThese days, though, this heading to the airport separately has become our norm. I'll tell my husband which train I'm planning to take, and he tells me which one he's on.\n\nWe know that we'll see each other at the gate, one way or another.",

    "description": "A New Zealand McDonald's is located inside a decommissioned plane, and multiple restaurants have been built inside historic homes.",
    "fullText": "Some McDonald's locations go far beyond the typical drive-thru experience, offering unique and unforgettable dining settings that redefine the concept of fast food.\n\nFrom a New Zealand McDonald's located inside a decommissioned plane to multiple restaurants built inside historic homes, McDonald's has transformed iconic and unconventional spaces into mind-blowing dining locations.\n\nMany restaurants have also been modified to comply with local laws. In Sedona, Arizona, there's a McDonald's with turquoise arches instead of the iconic golden ones, designed to complement the area's natural red rock scenery. A glass-walled McDonald's restaurant in Georgia has also received an award for its impressive architecture.\n\nHere are some of the most unusual and extraordinary McDonald's restaurants around the world.\n\nIt is the oldest surviving McDonald's location in the world. It doesn't even have a drive-thru — instead, customers walk up to the restaurant's windows to place their orders.\n\nSpeedee, a chef with a hamburger for a head, appeared on the original McDonald's signs alongside the brand's logo of two interlocking golden arches.\n\nSome signs also advertised the low price of McDonald's hamburgers — just 15 cents at the time.\n\nBefore being converted into a McDonald's and McCafé restaurant, the building was known as a cultural relic that had been the residence of politician Chiang Ching-kuo for one month during the 1940s, according to CNN.\n\nCNN reported that many locals objected to the restaurant opening inside the historic building, calling it a prime example of Western commercialism invading Chinese culture.\n\nHowever, since opening in 2015, the restaurant has become somewhat of a tourist attraction, welcoming visitors from all over the world.\n\nThe restaurant opened on October 8, 1990, in Shenzhen's Special Economic Zone.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported that on its opening day, the unique McDonald's location received over 40,000 customers, despite having a maximum seating capacity of only 460. It was the first McDonald's to open in mainland China, making it a popular destination for both locals and tourists at the time.\n\nThe restaurant's roof is still adorned with the iconic golden arches to make it recognizable to passersby.\n\nAuthor and photojournalist Gary He, who has dined at over 100 McDonald's restaurants around the world, told Business Insider in 2024 that it was one of the most \"epic\" locations he has ever visited.\n\nNamed one of the \"world's coolest McDonald's\" on a sign outside the restaurant, customers can enjoy everything from a classic Big Mac to Chicken McNuggets and McCafe beverages inside the plane.\n\nVisitors to this unique McDonald's restaurant can also view the D3 plane's cockpit.\n\nThe building was originally the United Kingdom Hotel and was designed by architect James Hastie Wardrop.\n\nConstructed between 1937 and 1938, this restaurant has been called one of the most beautiful McDonald's buildings in the world.\n\nThe restaurant, which spanned two floors and was a replica of Ray Kroc's first McDonald's, was filled with music and pop-culture memorabilia.\n\nAfter the restaurant was partially demolished and modernized, the memorabilia once housed in the restaurant were added to the franchise owner's personal collection, The Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nKnown for its giant marquee featuring thousands of light bulbs, the restaurant — perhaps surprisingly — closed in 2020 not as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but rather as part of McDonald's regular review of its restaurant portfolio, a spokesperson told NBC.\n\nHowever, a new McDonald's restaurant has opened in Times Square, meaning you can still get your fix.\n\nThe restaurant, built in 1993, is situated in one of Arizona's most beautiful cities, renowned for its awe-inspiring red-rock mountains, canyon walls, and pine forests.\n\nWhile the bright yellow color of most McDonald's signs might work in other parts of the country, the turquoise color chosen by the Sedona, Arizona, location blends much better with the surrounding landscape.\n\nSedona also has strict restrictions on the height of buildings and signage, which is why the famous arches are placed lower than at most other McDonald's restaurants.\n\nOn top of the large McDonald's restaurant, which also had a play place, was a statue of a NASA astronaut holding a container of fries.\n\nRonald McDonald and the rest of the \"McDonaldland\" characters lined the walls wearing space suits and posing against a starry background.\n\nMoored slightly south of the Gateway Arch on the Mississippi River, this McDonald's was the very first McDonald's to be opened on a riverboat.\n\nIt was open for 20 years before closing in 2000.\n\nSome McDonald's locations attempt to blend in with the local buildings and are designed more sympathetically.\n\nThis McDonald's location, however, was actually built inside a preexisting colonial mansion that's more than 150 years old. Located in Freeport, a small seaside town in Maine, the building was converted into the town's only McDonald's in 1984.\n\nThe restaurant is on Rue Saint-Lazare in Paris, France. Though the building is now a McDonald's, it is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nInspired by Roswell's extraterrestrial history, the interior of the spaceship contains a space-themed play area.\n\nThough you might think patrons can stroll up the steps to enter one of the most unusual McDonald's buildings in the world, customers actually enter from a side entrance.\n\nThe giant bronze eagle, designed by Portuguese sculptor Henrique Moreira, is usually the first thing customers notice when they approach the restaurant.\n\nThe colorful window is original to the coffee shop that previously occupied the space, and it features beautiful coffee-related scenes.\n\nThe restaurant has been called the world's most beautiful McDonald's.\n\nIt was designed in accordance with building requirements from the city.\n\n\"The building is unique to any I have ever seen and it is a joy to take a break and walk to the second floor and enjoy the view while I enjoy breakfast or lunch,\" wrote one TripAdvisor user.\n\nThe \"train station\" opened in 1975, and is also occupied by a Starbucks and a Popeyes.\n\nDespite having a unique theme, the restaurant still serves up McDonald's favorites.\n\nThe building was originally an 18th-century farmhouse that was converted into a Georgian-style mansion in the 1860s.\n\nHowever, Atlas Obscura reported that the fast-food giant faced pressure from preservationists to restore the home to its former grandeur.\n\nThe town then allowed the chain to build onto the existing building to create space for a drive-thru.\n\nThe station was built in 1877 by the Eiffel Company, which also built the Eiffel Tower.\n\nLocated in downtown Batumi, this McDonald's stands out for its reflective glass exterior. Patrons eating inside the restaurant can also gaze out onto the pool of water and manicured grass surrounding the building.\n\nThis location was built in 2013 and won the award for The Best Commercial Building of 2014 by the architecture website ArchDaily.\n\nThis makes for a great photo-op or simply a beautiful sight while patrons eat their meals.\n\nResembling a ski lodge, the restaurant fits in perfectly in the mountain town and the nearby Biltmore Estate, a grand home built by George Vanderbilt in the 1890s.\n\nHowever, the inside is grander than perhaps any outside viewer could expect.\n\nThe interior is also decorated with wallpaper, pieces of art, and hanging chandeliers.\n\nLocated in Lindvallen, one of Sweden's premier ski resorts, this one-of-a-kind \"ski-thru\" McDonald's allows guests to enter the building and order their food without ever even removing their skis.\n\nGary He told Business Insider that it was the most unusual location he had ever visited.\n\n\"The air is so clean and crisp — it's like being on top of the world,\" He said. \"When I visited, it wasn't even busy.

    "description": "I returned to the US after living in Europe for years, and noticed a lot of lifestyle changes, including the way I grocery shopped, worked, and ate.",
    "fullText": "Travel has always been important to me.\n\nIn college, I spent two separate semesters abroad. After graduation, I won a once-in-a-lifetime competition that let me spend the summer visiting five continents.\n\nUnsurprisingly, when I got the opportunity to move to Budapest to teach English, I jumped at the chance — and ended up sticking around. I spent seven years building a life in Europe before heading back to the States.\n\nNow that I'm back in the US, I've noticed that I picked up more than a few European habits.\n\nSome are small: I no longer wear shoes inside the house, and I use cutlery even when eating \"finger food\" like pizza. I also get dressed up for quick errands, instead of just throwing on athleisure like I used to.\n\nI've noticed some bigger shifts in how I live, too. Here are four ways my habits and lifestyle have changed since my time in Europe — and one distinctly American trait I plan to keep.\n\nI remember thinking that desk lunches, grab-and-go snacks, and rushed meals were the norm. Sitting down to eat was one of the first things I'd sacrifice for the sake of time.\n\nOnce I moved abroad, however, dining became an occasion, not something to be rushed through. The abundance of outdoor terraces for an afternoon coffee or restaurants offering a business lunch — which usually means two or three courses for a set value price — helped support this.\n\nThis isn't to say that I think every meal has to be a formal event, but I liked how intentional eating and drinking felt in Europe.\n\nNow, I savor my meals more, whether that means intentionally carving out time for a long lunch or just sitting down to enjoy a coffee instead of sipping it while I head to my next destination.\n\nWhen I first moved to Hungary, one of the biggest shocks was the lack of \"hustle culture.\" In the US, I always felt pressured to work more so that I could earn more so that I could buy more.\n\nSuddenly, though, I found myself living among people who generally didn't work on days off and took their six weeks of annual vacation seriously.\n\nNow that I'm back in the US and looking for a full-time job, I am prioritizing roles at companies that understand and appreciate work-life balance, too.\n\nBefore I moved to Europe, I considered buying fresh produce or groceries from farmers markets to be a luxury. There weren't many of these markets in my area, and it made sense to go to larger stores.\n\nBudapest, on the other hand, has many such markets, so fresh food was much more accessible. Since everything was closer, I picked up essentials daily, instead of doing one massive weekly shop.\n\nWhen I first visited a grocery store after moving back to a small town in the US, I was a bit bewildered by how pricey it felt to buy high-protein foods or produce marketed as organic.\n\nAfter getting used to whole foods in Budapest, though, I've made it a priority to seek out healthier ingredients and fewer processed foods here — even if they don't feel as readily accessible where I live.\n\nLiving in an international community where English wasn't everyone's first language changed the way I speak.\n\nOver the past several years, I've found myself talking more slowly and with more intention. As a result, I believe I've become a better listener.\n\nI've also noticed that the kinds of conversations I participate in have changed, too — and I've developed more cultural sensitivity.\n\nWhen I first moved abroad, I heard some criticisms from new Hungarian acquaintances about how often Americans make small talk.\n\nI was surrounded by people who were much more private, so what I thought were well-intentioned questions sometimes came off as invasive.\n\nFor instance, some Hungarians have told me that even \"How are you?\" is generally considered a personal question.\n\nI didn't want to make locals feel uncomfortable, so I learned to tone down any tendencies to overshare. That said, I was also raised to be enthusiastic and friendly, and didn't want to lose those traits.\n\nNow that I'm home, I remember how affirming it feels to strike up a chat with a stranger — maybe in line at the grocery store or out walking my dog — and have it reciprocated.\n\nI believe kind, surface-level interactions are still beautiful moments of connection, and I want to remain open to those instead of guarded, no matter where my travels take me next.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation Madison Knight. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2020, I had just moved to a new city in Alabama and was trying to meet new people when my work colleague suggested I meet her niece. She was sure we'd get on, and she was right — we became inseparable.\n\nOver the next five years, we went on to get engaged and get married, moving through a lot of life's major events with each other. We decided that when it came to having kids, we would do everything in our power to get pregnant at similar times.\n\nWe weren't expecting what life was about to throw our way.\n\nI'd gotten off of birth control in June 2024, not because we were trying to have a baby, but just because I had been on it for so long and needed a break. A month later, I found out I was pregnant. I called Jamesen immediately, and told her it was turn now — I wouldn't be doing this alone.\n\nLeading up to my eight-week scan, I had a gut feeling I would be having twins. Sure enough, the ultrasound technician looked up at me during the ultrasound and asked how I felt about having two.\n\nFrom the hospital, I met Jamesen for breakfast to break the news by simply handing her the ultrasound photos, letting her figure it out.\n\nIn October, Jamesen called me to say there was a faint line on her pregnancy test. I immediately got in the car to get more pregnancy tests with her to know for sure. She was pregnant too, and in the lead-up to her eight-week scan, I said several times how crazy it would be if she were to have twins too.\n\nI like to think I manifested multiples for her.\n\nShe called me after her ultrasound and asked to meet for breakfast, handing me the ultrasound photos in the parking lot before we went in to eat. I could see two sacks in the photos, but she kept saying, \"No,\" and then finally told me to keep counting. Jamesen wasn't having twins; she was having triplets.\n\nWe stood together in the parking lot, me crying happy tears and Jamesen just smiling and laughing.\n\nFor the next six months, we both had a support system in each other, which meant a lot because pregnancy is hard, but pregnancies with multiples are often even harder. Going through the same thing at the same time meant we could talk about all our pains, fears, and plans together, fully understanding one another like no one else could.\n\nI was on bed rest toward the end of my pregnancy, and Jamesen, even though heavily pregnant, came to visit me all the time, making sure I had everything I needed.\n\nLuckily, our husbands also became friends, able to offer support to each other as they considered the mammoth changes ahead.\n\nI had my two babies, one girl and one boy, in February 2025, and Jamesen had her three boys in March.\n\nOnce all the babies were born, life became chaotic, but in the most beautiful of ways. With my working from home flexibility, and Jamesen working shifts as an ER nurse, we live in each other's pockets when we aren't working.\n\nWe're either at my house or hers — we only live 10 minutes from each other — because we can't quite make it further with all the babies yet. Looking in through a window, you might assume we were a fully functioning day care — complete with bouncers, swings, diapers, wipes, teething toys, play pens, changing mats, and highchairs scattered everywhere.\n\nShe never has to think about what to bring to mine and vice versa. We're all set up with everything we both need in each other's houses.\n\nBeing together brings calm to chaos. We just drink coffee on tap while holding and entertaining babies.\n\nThere have been times when Jamesen needed help when her husband is on night shifts. And I've called her when we're all sick and not managing. We are there with each other through it all.\n\nWhat I'm most grateful for is how I haven't felt alone since having babies, thanks to Jamesen.\n\nI have lots of friends who have babies, and family around too, but Jamesen is the only other person I know who gets what it's like to parent multiples.\n\nIt's truly the best feeling to have someone so close to me, whom I trust completely, to walk through this parenting life with. I can't imagine what it would have been like to do this without her, and I look forward to continuing together as our kids grow up.",

    "fullText": "Broadcom is the latest victim of investors punishing high-flying AI companies.\n\nThe chipmaker tumbled 8% as investors took in its stellar results for the last quarter, but were left disappointed by certain aspects of the company's outlook.\n\nThe firm beat on earnings and revenue, leading shares to initially rise after-hours on Thursday, before falling into the red as CEO Hock Tan dug into the results in the call with analysts.\n\n\"It was surprising to see a call that started with such good numbers and such a great story end with frustration,\" Josh Meyers, an executive director at JPMorgan, wrote in a client note on Friday.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Friday:\n\nOther chip stocks also lost slightly, extending a decline in the sector that kicked off after Oracle reported earnings earlier in the week. Here were some of the notable moves:\n\nBroadcom investors seemed disappointed in how the company didn't issue full AI revenue guidance for the coming year, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan wrote on Friday. Broadcom said it expected AI semiconductor revenue to double to $8.2 billion in the following quarter.\n\nInvestors also seemed \"underwhelmed\" by the firm's $73 billion backlog of AI product orders over the next 18 months, Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said in a note.\n\n\"Somehow some investors seized on this as 'not enough,' which compounded an earlier narrative today that somehow we needed more visibility on F27 AI revenue (no idea why this is suddenly an issue),\" JPMorgan's Meyers wrote.\n\nSome investors also feel that the Tan was more \"buttoned-up\" about the company's results than they would have liked, Meyers said, citing his conversations with shareholders.\n\nThe stock is a crowded trade in the already popular AI theme, and some may also think the market \"just needed to take a breath\" from the AI trade, Meyers said. Shares of Broadcom are still up more than 56% this year.\n\nInvestors have put more pressure on the semiconductor sector in recent months amid concerns about the sustainability of the AI trade, which has led to some firms getting punished despite beating on earnings and revenue.\n\nOracle shares plunged 14% on Thursday as investors took in lower-than-expected quarterly revenue and worries that the software giant is overspending on AI.\n\nMeta and Microsoft shares also dropped after the companies reported earnings in October, as both tech titans promised to spend more on AI in the coming years.",

    "description": "AI is reshaping the CHRO role, requiring HR leaders to become AI strategists and bridge people, technology, and data in today's workforce.",
    "fullText": "AI is changing how companies hire, train, and lead, and in the process, the chief human resources officer's role is expanding.\n\nToday's top HR leaders are becoming AI strategists, helping their organizations navigate the next wave of workplace transformation.\n\n\"The old model of HR was employees over here, technology over there,\" says Thomas Hutzschenreuter, a university professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). \"But the new model of work is human-AI collaboration.\"\n\nAI is a coworker now, he says, and that means that \"HR has a bigger mandate. They need to understand not just people and culture, but go deeper into the strategy, the business, and the technology itself.\"\n\nTo understand how companies are navigating the shift, Business Insider spoke with people leaders at Citizens Bank, one of the largest banks in the Northeast; Boston Consulting Group, a global consultancy; and UiPath, an automation software testing company.\n\nAll interviews have been edited for brevity.\n\nCHROs are becoming the architects of the future of work, bridging people, technology, and data.\n\nThere are many questions we are in the middle of that are germane to how we as an organization move forward, such as: What's going to happen to entry-level roles? What roles are emerging? And how do we reskill people in a way that prepares them to make shifts thoughtfully?\n\nWe need people who can quickly learn, adapt, and change. Our technologists need to develop their business acumen, and our business folks need to develop their digital and technical fluency. The lines are blurring.\n\nMy HR team is developing a baseline of skills and capabilities. We're having conversations with consulting partners and clients. There's an openness to communal learning because everyone is trying to figure out the same things: what the AI-driven workforce will look like, how to break work into tasks for AI vs. humans, and what AI agents can handle versus humans.\n\nWe're subject to a lot of regulatory oversight in our industry. It's great that people can develop their own AI agents — there's a push to decentralize these capabilities — but we need to be mindful of risk and governance and how we do this in a safe, ethical way.\n\nAI is changing how work gets done and what work gets done. Business models are evolving, and the way companies serve clients is shifting. The CHRO role now requires adapting to both at once. It's a tall order.\n\nIn consulting, our ability to add value means constantly evolving our approach to human capital. The issues are constant; the pace is what's different. Today, a quarter of our business involves AI, which wasn't true even two years ago.\n\nWe need our people to be AI fluent. About 90% of our workforce uses AI regularly, and more than half use it daily. To get there, we've built a multi-layered support system: a 1,400-person enablement network acting as evangelists and coaches.\n\nWe've upskilled more than 100 team coaches to provide hands-on support. We deploy experts directly into teams to help them reimagine workflows and run innovation competitions to keep momentum going.\n\nOur HR team has taken the lead. We started with recruiting — consolidating six IT systems into one and integrating AI throughout the platform and across performance management and development.\n\nWe're also experimenting with voice tools, chat interfaces, and AI avatars for real-time coaching. These tools give employees confidence, learning opportunities, and instant feedback. They don't replace managers — they free them up for higher-level thinking and relationship-building.\n\nOur business is automation, so that muscle is very strong for my team. But the next frontier of agentic AI is an adjustment.\n\nWe're using these AI agents — but we're also creating them. One agent, almost in production, helps with performance reviews, which is a time-consuming and sometimes dreaded task. Our agent helps employees write their self-assessment and collects feedback, bringing it together much quicker. It also helps managers by consolidating feedback from multiple resources.\n\nIt won't make rating decisions on the manager's behalf, but it makes the year-end much more seamless. Instead of spending time on admin, managers can focus on the feedback itself and my team on the right framework for career development.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns at the moment, and fear is natural. But it should fuel curiosity and development. This is the time to think about career development seriously.\n\nWe have this idea that AI is only affecting entry-level or lower-level jobs. The truth is that technology is replacing skills that very highly skilled people have been doing.\n\nIf you look at the medical field and aviation — areas where we always thought technology wouldn't touch — that's no longer the case. It's not going to happen overnight. We have time to prepare. But it's relevant for everybody in any profession.",

Mike Johnson in a phone call on Wednesday, discussing plans to dramatically lower regulatory oversight on cannabis and its derivatives, giving them the same classification as many standard prescription painkillers.\n\nIt's also not the only bullish regulatory development for pot stocks.

While both catalysts are still speculative, investors are piling in.\n\nHere are the cannabis stocks that are up big on Friday:\n\nRepublicans have historically been against easing cannabis restrictions. When Trump was first elected in 2016, and again in 2024, his win was regarded as bearish for cannabis stocks, but his latest shift is now boosting the whole sector.\n\nAs Business Insider reported, the buzz around cannabis infused drinks may have flatlined after significant hype but that doesn't mean consumers aren't cheering on policy changes that would benefit widespread marijuana use.\n\nRetail investors have piled into Tilray, a former meme stock that remains a popular choice for traders seeking cannabis market exposure.

    "description": "After testing homemade pasta sauce recipes, I found a tasty Mediterranean diet-friendly one with fiber, protein, and no ultra-processed ingredients.",
    "fullText": "Pasta with sauce is, and always will be, one of my most beloved comfort meals.\n\nIt's also one of the simplest, speediest, and most satisfying combos in my cooking repertoire, serving as a reliable staple at the end of my busiest days.\n\nBecause I've been trying to reduce the amount of ultra-processed foods in my diet, I've experimented with homemade sauces that are relatively low-effort yet made with entirely whole ingredients.\n\nAfter sampling a range of recipes over the past few months, one flavorful sauce based on a recipe shared by Caroline Hanna, a nutritionist and chef, has emerged as a clear winner.\n\nThe recipe yields four servings, with each containing about 12 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber. If you have leftover sauce, keep it in a sealed container in the fridge and use it within five days.\n\nYou can pair the sauce with any type of pasta you like. I typically go for a whole-wheat option for added fiber.\n\nBefore the bean-averse shy away from this sauce, let it be known that no one I've made it for has ever guessed they're even an ingredient in this recipe — you really can't taste them.\n\nThe blended beans just contribute to the sauce's smooth, creamy texture.\n\nI love this sauce because it's packed with vegetables, fiber, and protein, but it still tastes as good as (if not better than) any jarred option I've bought in a grocery store.\n\nIt also provides more protein and fiber per serving than most store-bought options I've found.\n\nFor more insights, I asked Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a dietitian and the author of \"How Not to Eat Ultra-Processed,\" to review my recipe. She called the sauce \"brilliantly balanced and nutrient-dense.\"\n\n\"It's rich in fiber, plant-based protein, and micronutrients,\" she said, adding that the fiber in the vegetables and butter beans can help support gut health and make the sauce more filling.\n\nThe dietitian also said this sauce \"aligns with a Mediterranean-style pattern of eating,\" which focuses on fresh produce and plant-based proteins while limiting processed foods.\n\n\"It's packed with antioxidants, especially vitamin C and carotenoids, from the red peppers and tomatoes, and it contains healthy fats from the olive oil, which also helps the body absorb fat-soluble nutrients,\" Ludlam-Raine said.\n\nIf I have a little extra time and energy, I serve my saucy pasta with chicken, green vegetables, and pine nuts.\n\nFor those who want to pack in more fiber, Ludlam-Raine said, you can stir extra vegetables, such as spinach or roasted zucchini, into the sauce.\n\nTo add more protein to the sauce itself, you can swap the ricotta for cottage cheese. Personally, I prefer the taste of ricotta, but both are excellent options.\n\nYou can also use almost any variety of beans in the sauce, though I find butter beans work best. When I used red kidney beans (which you can see in the featured photos), the sauce came out beautifully.\n\n\"Overall, this is exactly the kind of nourishing recipe I encourage people to make,\" Ludlam-Raine said.",

    "description": "Dell is increasing its prices on December 17 amid a global memory chip supply crisis. Business Insider obtained a list of price changes.",
    "fullText": "Your company's Dell laptops are about to cost more.\n\nStarting December 17, the computer maker is set to hike prices across its commercial product lines, according to an internal list of upcoming price changes sent to staff on December 9 and seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe list outlines price hikes for Dell's commercial business — meaning its sales to corporate clients rather than individual consumers. The commercial business accounts for about 85% of Dell's annual revenue in the Client Solutions Group (CSG), the division that sells laptops and PCs, according to its latest annual results.\n\nThe company is one of the leading providers of computer hardware to US companies, and prices aren't just rising at Dell. An industry-wide shortage of memory and storage chips is driving up costs across the PC industry, affecting competitors like Lenovo and HP as well.\n\nThe soaring demand for AI infrastructure has tech companies snapping up enormous quantities of memory and storage chips, increasing competition for consumer devices.\n\nA Dell spokesperson told Business Insider that \"like others in the industry, Dell takes targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity and its commitment to customer value.\"\n\n\"Our supply chain is resilient and globally diverse. It's designed to offer the needed flexibility when navigating macroeconomic, regulatory and trade dynamics,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHow much more expensive a laptop at Dell will be next week depends on how much memory and storage you require.\n\nThe global shortages are hitting two key types of chips that are essential components in most user devices: DRAM and NAND.\n\nWhen you buy a laptop, DRAM — dynamic random-access memory — is the memory, usually 8GB to 32GB for an average customer. NAND — non-volatile flash memory — is used for SSD storage, typically around 512GB or 1TB.\n\nFrom next week, Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks and desktops with 32GB of memory will cost between $130 and $230 more, according to the list of price changes seen by Business Insider. If opting for the top-of-the-range 128GB memory, the price is set to rise by between $520 and $765 per device.\n\nSelecting a laptop with 1 TB of storage will add to the overall cost by between $55 and $135.\n\nAn employee at Dell who works in sales said the percentage increase would be \"between 10% and 30%\" depending on the contract. They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.\n\nThe price list also includes price hikes for AI laptops containing Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and individual monitors. For example, a Dell Pro 55 Plus 4K Monitor, currently listed on Dell's website at $1,349.99, will be $150 more expensive, according to the price list.\n\nAI laptops containing an Nvidia RTX PRO 500 Blackwell GPU with 6GB will become $66 more expensive, and a 24GB GPU will cost $530 more, the pricing chart shows.\n\n\"It's impacting everyone, and there's no way around it currently, so customers will just have to pay more if they want the products,\" the sales employee said.\n\nHigher prices make for a tougher sell, already a challenge for sales teams amid today's tariff-weary consumers and enterprises.\n\nDell sent an email to its \"go-to-market\" (GTM) sales staff on November 25, which Business Insider has seen, outlining the \"critical next steps\" sellers should take to prepare ahead of the increase.\n\n\"Global memory and storage supply are tightening fast,\" Dell warned GTM team members.\n\nThe price of contracts for DRAM and NAND chips has \"already risen significantly this quarter, and suppliers are signaling further increases and allocation constraints driven by AI demand,\" Dell said in the email.\n\nThe company told its sellers to \"move decisively\" ahead of the price increases to \"protect value for our customers and for Dell.\"\n\nThe email advised teams to engage with top accounts in the coming week, close deals, and plan significant opportunities and multi-quarter deals to protect the sales pipeline.\n\n\"Ordering today for future delivery DOES NOT lock in current pricing,\" Dell warned, but said that acting now would help customers stay ahead of \"significant anticipated memory increase.\"\n\nThe Dell sales employee said that there had been an initial rush to help customers buy remaining inventory, but now the situation is largely viewed as \"out of our control.\"\n\nThe employee said Dell was also absorbing some of the costs internally, through hits to margins and limiting discounts that sales staff can offer.\n\nIn the company's third-quarter earnings call on November 25, Jeff Clarke, Dell's COO and vice chairman, said the market's price increases were \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen,\" Clarke said. \"Demand is way ahead of supply. And as we wade our way through that, we're going to lean on the things that we've always done.\"\n\nTech companies are buying massive amounts of DRAM and NAND to power AI models and cloud services, leaving fewer chips for consumer devices.\n\nCombined with global supply-chain tensions, the explosion in demand has prompted the three companies that dominate the DRAM market — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — to raise their prices.\n\nDRAM prices are expected to rise 30% in the final quarter of 2025, having already increased by 50% so far this year, according to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm.\n\n\"The entire supply chain simply can't meet the demand that is now required and that inevitably leads to these kinds of challenges,\" Bob O'Donnell, the president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research, told Business Insider.\n\nThese price increases will \"likely have a noticeable impact for all types of PCs from every PC vendor,\" said O'Donnell, adding that the supply shortage is expected to continue throughout 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Warren Buffett's deputy goes to JPMorgan: What close watchers say about Jamie Dimon hiring Todd Combs",
    "description": "Jamie Dimon, a longtime admirer of Warren Buffett, has hired his deputy stockpicker as a key lieutenant and special advisor.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett will soon be out of a job, but at age 95, he's probably not looking for a new one. Longtime admirer Jamie Dimon may have sprung for the next best thing by hiring his understudy.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO has hired Todd Combs, one of Buffett's two investment managers at Berkshire Hathaway, to head up a new $10 billion group at the bank and be his special advisor.\n\nBringing Combs into the JPMorgan fold might be as near as Dimon can get to having Buffett himself on his team.\n\n\"Dimon may very well have viewed Combs as a close proxy for Buffett himself,\" David Kass, a finance professor and longtime Berkshire blogger, told Business Insider. \"Although Dimon could not hire Buffett, he could hire one of his protégés.\"\n\nThe \"main impetus\" for Dimon hiring Combs was likely his observations of the investor as a JPMorgan board member over the past nine years, John Longo, a finance professor, fund manager, and the author of \"Buffett's Tips,\" told Business Insider.\n\nBut \"the fact that he ran a large financial business (Geico), is a successful fund manager, and is a protégé of Warren Buffett certainly enhance his credentials,\" Longo said.\n\nHe added that Combs has undoubtedly \"learned a great deal\" from Buffett, and JPMorgan now stands to benefit from that knowledge.\n\n\"Jamie deeply respects Warren Buffett and Todd Combs,\" JPMorgan said in a statement to Business Insider. Geico declined to comment.\n\nCombs ran a hedge fund before Buffett hired him in 2010. He helped set up Haven, a healthcare joint venture between Berkshire, JPMorgan, and Amazon, that launched in 2018 but closed three years later.\n\nHe was appointed CEO of Berkshire-owned Geico in 2020, and has reshaped the auto insurer to help increase profits in recent years. Buffett applauded Combs for Geico's \"spectacular\" improvement in his February letter to shareholders.\n\nCombs' departure was unexpected, as Buffett had originally planned for him to take over Berkshire's vast portfolio once he and Charlie Munger were out of the picture.\n\nBut the legendary investor said during Berkshire's past two shareholder meetings that his successor as CEO, Greg Abel, would have final say over how Berkshire's capital is deployed. Berkshire announced a raft of leadership changes this week, ahead of Abel replacing Buffett on New Year's Day.\n\nIn a press release announcing the move, Dimon drew a clear line between the master and the student: \"Todd Combs is one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known, having successfully managed investments alongside the most respected and successful long-term investor of our time, Warren Buffett.\"\n\nDimon has frequently praised Buffett over the years.\n\nAfter the Berkshire CEO announced in May that he would step down as CEO this year, Dimon said in a statement that Buffett \"represents everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself.\"\n\nHe also lauded his \"integrity, optimism, and common sense,\" and said he'd learned a great deal from him and was \"honored to call him a friend.\"\n\nDimon told the Financial Times this week that he was quickly impressed by Combs when Buffett introduced them in 2014. The pair caught up last month and Combs said he was intrigued by the new role at JPMorgan, he told the outlet. Dimon responded that if Combs was \"remotely interested in this, we're all in.\"\n\nBuffett's seal of approval may have factored into Dimon's decision to hire Combs, but the billionaire banker also said in Monday's press release that he prized \"Todd's experience, character and judgment\" and felt \"honored\" to have him on board.\n\nIn his new role at JPMorgan, Combs will lead the Strategic Investment Group, part of the bank's Security and Resiliency Initiative, and focus on investing in sectors deemed important to national security, such as critical minerals and frontier technologies.\n\nDo you work for Berkshire Hathaway and have a story to share?

    "title": "Trump's plan to limit student loans for nurses in his repayment overhaul is facing bipartisan backlash",
    "description": "Over 140 bipartisan lawmakers wrote to oppose the Education Department's plan to place new student-loan limits on nursing programs.",
    "fullText": "Opposition toward new student-loan limits in President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul is mounting.\n\nOn Friday, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent urging him to revise the Department of Education's proposal to place new student-loan limits on professional degree programs.\n\nThe department recently concluded its negotiations on the student-loan payment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The changes included borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: a $100,000 lifetime limit for graduate students, and a $200,000 lifetime limit for professional students.\n\nThe crux of the debate centered on which programs qualify as \"professional,\" and the department identified 10 programs, including medicine, dentistry, and law, that would meet its new definition. Post-graduate nursing programs are not included within the professional definition, and the lawmakers wrote that the omission could exacerbate the ongoing nursing shortage.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nThe lawmakers used the example of the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000. They said that the proposed $100,000 cap is \"restricting the pipeline of CRNAs and further limiting an anesthesia workforce that is suffering from shortages across all provider types.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, said in a statement that \"misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion\" about the proposed student-loan limits. Keast cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that, based on data from the College Scorecard, most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. However, advocates still expressed concern about their implications. Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told Business Insider that removing the professional designation for nurses could make it difficult to recruit and retain staff in the industry.\n\n\"It's going to be a really bad revolving issue where we don't have enough faculty to produce enough nurses to replace the nurses who are retiring,\" she said.\n\nThe Department of Education is planning to implement these changes beginning in July of 2026, and its proposal is still subject to change based on the comments it receives from the public early next year.",

    "description": "Bathroom trends in 2026 will include statement tiles, high-tech features, medicine cabinets, and layered decor, according to interior designers.",
    "fullText": "Each year brings a new wave of design trends that continue to evolve home spaces, including bathrooms.\n\nSo, Business Insider asked four interior designers to share their thoughts on what will be popular in bathrooms this coming year, and which fads are starting to disappear.\n\nHere's what they predict will be in and out for bathrooms in 2026.\n\nKara Thomas, interior designer and founder of Studio KT, believes there will be a \"heavy trend\" of incorporating tech into bathrooms next year.\n\n\"Regardless of the square footage, people need a space to decompress, and people are going to be wanting to spend more intentional time with themselves in their bathroom,\" she told BI.\n\nFor that reason, she believes an array of useful, high-tech features that aid self-care — like voice-activated shower controls, deodorizing smart toilets, and heated floors — will be taking over home bathrooms in 2026.\n\nThough medicine cabinets haven't exactly been a consistently popular home feature, they're not going anywhere this year, according to Molly Torres Portnof of DATE Interiors.\n\n\"Even for clients with bigger homes and multiple bathrooms, medicine cabinets are still incredibly useful,\" she said.\n\nWhether they're custom or ready-made, recessed or mirrored, \"space is very important, and having any type of hidden storage space is gold,\" the interior designer added.\n\nDanielle Chiprut, interior designer and founder of Danielle Rose Design Co., believes that bathrooms with personal, expressive touches — such as statement tiles — are trending upward.\n\n\"Patterns like plaid, soft geometrics, or dimensional fluting bring a tactile richness that instantly gives the room character,\" she said. \"People are craving spaces that feel crafted rather than 'standard issue,' and tile is a beautiful way to layer in artistry without overwhelming the room.\"\n\nOn a similar note, hand-painted tiles will also be making their way into bathrooms next year, said Torres Portnof.\n\nMost designers agree that there's a growing trend toward more layered designs, with cohesively blended colors, patterns, textures, and lighting taking priority over lifeless, cookie-cutter motifs.\n\nChiprut has noticed a decline in enthusiasm for \"ultra-coordinated\" packages with matching fixtures and cabinetry.\n\n\"Homeowners are moving away from that catalog feel and toward spaces with layered materials and lighting that tell a more personal story,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Thomas, the trend won't involve clutter, but rather more intentional layouts and decor — this could look like an antique piece of art above the toilet, or an accent rug next to the tub.\n\nBathrooms can sometimes feel too stark, which is why it's essential to incorporate multiple lighting sources for balanced illumination and a cozy, welcoming feel, said Torres Portnof.\n\n\"Just like in any other room in the house, it's important to have overhead lighting and accent lighting like sconces,\" she told BI.\n\nIn 2026, we'll likely see more integrated LED lighting in bathrooms, with a particular shift toward backlit mirrors and under-vanity strips, according to Molly Miller, principal designer and founder of Molly Miller Interiors.\n\n\"Bright-white, clinical bathrooms and stark-gray palettes are losing steam,\" Miller said.\n\nInstead, she expects a shift toward earthier tones, like soft clays, muted greens, and warm taupes.\n\nShe also sees earthy palettes being paired with materials like honed natural stone, warm oak or walnut, and unlacquered metals, which she says will help make the space feel more grounded and restorative.\n\nAs earthy hues and natural materials dominate home spaces, Chiprut sees synthetic materials, such as plastics like acrylic, losing favor in bathrooms next year.\n\nInstead, people might opt for dark-stained oak, wabi-sabi wood, or marble.\n\n\"Natural materials carry a quiet longevity that man-made surfaces rarely replicate,\" she said. \"I think many homeowners are moving away from plastics and overly engineered finishes simply because they want a deeper connection to what surrounds them.\"\n\nMaterials like marble and wood can add a sense of warmth, she added.\n\nUltra-glossy finishes may have been popular in 2025, but Chiprut believes that bathroom trend is on its way out.\n\n\"For a while, there was a push toward everything looking polished and reflective, but those surfaces can feel a bit cold and one-note,\" she said.\n\nInstead, she's seeing her clients gravitate toward more tactile, matte textures that feel calming and authentic.",

    "fullText": "For much of the past year, Wall Street and Silicon Valley have wrestled with the same uncomfortable question: Will companies really spend money on AI, or is the hype just outpacing budgets?\n\nA new CIO survey from RBC Capital suggests that question may finally have an answer, and it's a resounding yes.\n\nRBC recently polled 117 IT professionals at companies with annual revenue ranging from below $250 million to more than $25 billion. 90% of the respondents said their organizations plan to spend more on AI in 2026.\n\n\"Overall, we came away increasingly optimistic of macro/budget stabilization taking shape in 2026 and encouraged by the pace of early GenAI adoption,\" the RBC analysts wrote in a research note summarizing the findings.\n\nCIOs are not only moving rapidly into production with AI systems, but they are also setting aside dedicated budgets to fund that adoption.\n\nA striking 90% of technology leaders said their organizations are creating new budgets specifically for generative AI and LLM projects, up from 85% the year before. That suggests AI is becoming additive rather than substitutive in enterprise tech spending.\n\nEven more telling: 60% of respondents said they are already in production with AI initiatives, a jump from 39% the previous year. Another 32% expect to be in production within six months.\n\nThis shift comes after months of skepticism from investors who questioned whether businesses would convert pilot projects into real spending. The survey data suggests that moment is now arriving.\n\nCIOs overwhelmingly cited AI as the top category for increased software spending next year, surpassing cybersecurity and IT service management. And in open-ended responses, executives repeatedly named AI as their biggest area of investment for 2026, often paired with infrastructure upgrades and automation initiatives, according to the RBC survey.\n\nUse cases are expanding beyond experimentation. Seventy-six percent of CIOs said their AI strategies now target both cost savings and revenue generation, a shift that reinforces AI's transition from a novelty to a competitive mandate.\n\nConcerns remain — data privacy tops the list — but those worries are no longer slowing adoption. Instead, AI is becoming the primary force expanding IT budgets heading into 2026.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The \"OpenAI Supply Co.\" has 10 merch items available for purchase, and dozens of more archived designs. Most sizes have sold out.",
    "fullText": "You can now wear ChatGPT on your sleeve — or head or shin.\n\nAs part of its 10-year anniversary celebration, OpenAI dropped a link on its X feed to a merchandise store. The \"OpenAI Supply Co.\" seems suited for the company's engineers, with a space to log in with a company email. Indeed, most of the items listed are archives of old designs — but a few are available for purchase.\n\nThe \"Supply Co.\" site was marked as \"coming soon\" in July 2024, according to the Internet Archive. But this appears to be the first time ChatGPT users who aren't employees can actually buy something from it.\n\nOpenAI fans ate it up. The post garnered over 3,000 likes within 15 hours, and multiple sizes of the for-sale items were quickly sold out. If you're anything other than an extra small or a small, you're out of luck on sweatshirts and tees.\n\nThe items OpenAI listed give a glimpse inside the company — or at least its swag.\n\nThere are five Pokémon-style trading cards. Their subjects include Sora 2 (\"shape-shifter\"), GPT-5 (\"two worlds, one model\"), image generation (with a \"huge\" wow factor), Sora (\"sci-fi\"), and the OpenAI Blossom (\"back and better\").\n\nPokémon has recently been a point of contention for the company, after its Sora video generator began booting out unauthorized versions of Pikachu.\n\nMuch of the site is themed around AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a much debated breakthrough milestone that many AI companies are racing to hit. One shirt reads: \"AGI that benefits all of humanity,\" a line from OpenAI's charter. On the employee log-in, the suggested email is agi@openai.com.\n\nThe assortment of hats also offers clues. There are Sora beanies and baseball caps with the word \"research.\" One cap has the chatbot's phone number, 1-800-CHATGPT. (Yes, the number still works.)\n\nAnother cap has OpenAI in red letters on camo print, resembling the popular Harris/Walz hat, which nods to Chappell Roan.\n\nThe baseball caps kept coming. There's one with silver flames, a piece of early 2000s nostalgia. There's another with the letters \"SF\" on it, firmly planting OpenAI in the city of San Francisco.\n\nAll the way at the bottom of the page is a baseball cap with the words \"Thinking deeply.\" The site says that it was released in September 2024 in honor of OpenAI's reasoning model. It also looks remarkably similar to Anthropic's \"thinking\" caps, which launched a year later at the company's Air Mail pop-up.\n\nAnthropic's \"thinking\" caps quickly became a status symbol, signifying the wearer's closeness to the AI boom. Cursor's tab keys had a similar effect, as did OpenAI's DevDay token plaques.\n\nIt's possible that this merchandise drop will have the same effect. Your ChatGPT crew neck could give you caché.\n\nThe fans have clearly been hungry. Fan-created merchandise concepts have long floated around X. Some even turned their designs into unauthorized businesses.\n\nThirty minutes before its post about the tenth anniversary, OpenAI responded to a fan post. Developer Tibor Blaho posted some of the merch, saying that the company should make its store \"public instead of keeping it employee-only.\" OpenAI responded with the link and an eye emoji.\n\nBlaho's post was 10 months ago.",

    "fullText": "When a third opportunity to relocate was presented, the choice wasn't so easy anymore. Our family had grown; we now had a baby to consider. This move would take us from Houston to California, a place we'd barely visited. The whole idea felt exciting, but what would it be like to move halfway across the country with a baby in tow?\n\nWe asked ourselves what advice we'd give our child if she were an adult making this decision. We realized we'd encourage her to take the chance, so we decided we would, too.\n\nMy husband's employer provided us with a moving company to pack, load, and transport our belongings. Unfortunately, the truck had a blowout on I-10 and was delayed, so when we arrived in California, we were without many of the comforts that make life with a baby easier for longer than we'd planned.\n\nThe beginning was rough, but it worked out. We embraced having mountains and beaches close by, but what we couldn't embrace was the cost of living. To afford to live where we were, I'd need to go back to work. However, we'd created a little obstacle; I was pregnant. We didn't know if we could afford to live in California with our expanding family, but we knew of a place we could afford.\n\nTwo and a half years after we arrived in California, we were on the move again. This relocation took us back to Houston. Thankfully, my husband's company provided moving assistance once more.\n\nMoving while pregnant and with a 3-year-old was exhausting, but we settled into our new house and our new life. Once we hit the milestone of two and a half years in our home, we celebrated.\n\nA few months later, my husband was asked to consider applying for another opportunity. The position was outside the United States, and if he applied, it would mean we were OK with moving abroad. But were we?\n\nFor our move to California, we'd asked ourselves what advice we'd give our children. Now the question was: what life did we want to give our children?\n\nDespite the benefits and experiences that come with living as expatriates, providing our children with stable and predictable childhoods was a bigger priority for us. We chose to have our adventures during school vacations instead of having an adventure-based life.\n\nMy husband did not apply for that overseas position and chose not to apply to any other jobs that would require us to relocate. We've now been in our second Houston house for 16 years. Moving was fun for a while, but we're thankful we were able to stay in one place after the fun wore off.\n\nAnd if our children ever ask us for advice on moving, will we stick with our original, hypothetical answer? I think we would.",

    "fullText": "Platform fighting world-leading ban on grounds it contravenes implied freedom of political communication in constitution\n\nWill Australia’s social media ban survive a high court challenge?\n\nReddit has filed a challenge against Australia’s under-16s social media ban in the high court, lodging its case two days after implementing age restrictions on its website.\n\n The company said in a Reddit post on Friday that while it agreed with protecting people under 16, the law “has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences”.\n\nReddit said there was an “illogical patchwork” of platforms included in the ban.\n\n“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”\n\nReddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.\n\nReddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.\n\nIt said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.\n\nThe company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.\n\n“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”\n\nReddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’s Digital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.\n\nProf Sarah Joseph, from Griffith university’s law school, said she believes there was a strong case against the ban.\n\n“I do believe the legislation has cut off the main source of political information for people under the age of 16, in terms of their receiving and giving information. Whilst that is not the intention of the legislation, that is one of its many effects,” she said.\n\n“Whilst other sources remain open, they operate in very different ways and do not provide the same means to communicate one’s opinions, and the same variety of opinions.”\n\nBut Joseph said she believed the high court case was more likely to fail, as with most challenges to legislation on implied freedom of communications grounds.\n\n“The freedom is engaged in most cases, but the high court goes on to find the law to be proportionate. In reality, the constitutional freedom is quite weak due to the way that it has been interpreted and applied.”\n\nA law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beck wrote in the Guardian on Thursday.\n\n“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.\n\n“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”\n\nThe Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Reddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in September that it should be excluded from the ban.\n\n“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.\n\n“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”\n\nReddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.\n\nReddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.\n\nThe 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.",

    "fullText": "The PM’s social media sortie has not been a total embarrassment, which may be a shame for him\n\nThe scene opens on the interior of an aeroplane.\n\nA suited man in a luxurious seat looks pensively out the window, his face partially obscured, his chin delicately resting on his hand.\n\nDreamy synths reverberate as the camera pans to show a fighter jet, hovering above the clouds just past the plane’s wing.\n\nIt turns and flies away, its dark shadow set against the warm yellow sunset.\n\n“I’d explain, but it’s classified,” the TikTok video’s caption reads, the username above revealing the identity of the mystery man: Keir Starmer.\n\nIn the comment section, one user puts a voice to the question on a thousand lips.\n\n“Why is our prime minister aura farming?”\n\nThis article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nWhen the UK prime minister launched his TikTok account earlier this week, I assumed we’d get the same slate of cringeworthy content that so many elected officials have given us before.\n\nStiff line delivery, policy talking points awkwardly shoehorned into already outdated memes, and the general feeling a PR person is holding them at gunpoint just out of shot.\n\nAlas, no. In a shocking twist, Starmer’s TikToks are borderline competent.\n\nThe majority of the videos seem to be attempts at ultra short-form cinéma vérité: a camera operator following the prime minister around, catching snippets of him saying good morning to security guards, questioning where chief mouser, Larry the cat, is and greeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThis article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nThe “peek behind the curtain” style is clearly designed to make the prime minister feel more relatable to young UK voters, and while there’s definitely potential here, all his videos share the same fatal flaw.\n\nStarmer cares about looking cool.\n\n“Aura farming” is an internet term for someone posting content trying to seem effortlessly suave, handsome or charismatic.\n\nAnd look, for my own sanity, I have to assume Starmer’s team was being tongue-in-cheek when they captioned that plane video: “I’d explain, but it’s classified” – that they were poking fun at people trying to seem cool on the internet.\n\nBut the more I look through his TikToks, with every shot so carefully curated to make Starmer seem competent and in control, the more I began to feel the accusation of “aura farming” fitted.\n\nAnd on a platform such as TikTok, which trades off vulnerability and intimacy, being caught trying to seem aloof is a crime worse than murder. (Or at least worse than the “millennial pause”, and that’s pretty bad.)\n\nThere are some rare examples of politicians feeling authentically at home on the app: in the US, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has found great success speaking frankly to her iPhone camera from her living room couch. Even a lower-profile politician such as the Australian MP Julian Hill has cultivated a dedicated following by sharing his frustrations with the opposition from his cluttered parliamentary office.\n\nThis article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nThe politicians that truly succeed on TikTok are the ones where you can suspend your disbelief just enough to believe they’re actually hitting “post” themselves. Where a little part of you is holding out hope that they might actually reply to your comment.\n\nBut Starmer never gets within a metre of the camera lens, let alone a comment section keyboard. A style, no doubt, influenced by the fact that TikTok is technically banned on government phones, due to data security concerns, and his team is, no doubt, terrified to imply he might actually have the app downloaded.\n\nThis article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nNumbers wise, the videos are going well, two of them already crack 1m views, but that lack of intimacy comes at a cost. The comments under any politician’s post are going to be filled with far more vitriol than praise – that’s just how the internet works. What’s notable about Starmer’s is just how generic the comments are.\n\nIt’s all “get this clown out”, “vote reform” and the occasional “best prime minister ever”, but barely any mention of the actual content at hand.\n\nBecause ultimately, the videos don’t have any content – besides a fleeting sense of novelty, there’s no reason I would ever send them to friends, let alone bring them up at the pub. These videos only exist to prove what a cool guy Starmer is. And he isn’t.\n\nSo no, the UK prime minister’s first foray into the world of TikTok hasn’t been an utter embarrassment. But it might have been better if it was.\n\nLike most politicians, Starmer is an innately dorky man and if he is really serious about winning the hearts (and votes) of young people, his TikTok needs to embrace and celebrate that, not unconvincingly hide it away.\n\nI have some ideas for what he could do, and I would explain, but hey, it’s classified.",

    "fullText": "I get really carsick if I try to read in a moving vehicle. And there's a reason for that: my eyes and my sense of movement are out of sync.\n\nAt least, that's according to the CDC, which states that motion sickness, \"happens when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses.\" Your inner ear is a sack of fluid that moves when you do, giving you an innate sense of movement. If you're in a car and watching the horizon, your senses are aligned. But if you're looking at your phone, your senses are confusing each other. It's similar to the reason VR games make some people feel sick.\n\nThe free Android app KineStop aims to help. The application overlays a transparent horizon, and a number of transparent dots, across your entire screen. The accelerometer on your phone is used to move these reference points as your phone moves, helping to reduce the conflict between your eyes and your inner ear. You can turn the feature on manually in the application or, if you prefer, you can set it up to turn on automatically when you're in a moving car.\n\nI tried it out, wondering if it would help with my carsickness, and it did—surprisingly well. Normally I can't read for more than a few minutes without feeling sick, but the KineStop app helped me do so for longer, without discomfort. I'm still not going to be able to read novels during a long road trip, mind you, but I can look up the next restaurant on a road trip without vomiting, and I call that a win.\n\nKineStop is totally free, though there's a $3.50 pro version that adds themed overlays, including one that makes it look like your phone is a half-empty beer. It's great to support a developer, but I also think the free version will work fine for most everyone.",

    "description": "This organizational method is all about action and results.",
    "fullText": "Figuring out how to structure your days so they're as productive as possible is a challenge, which is why there are so many different techniques for doing it, though they're all best suited to different kinds of people. And then sticking to a plan once you've made it? Even harder. This is where RPM can help. The Rapid Planning Method, or RPM, can help you streamline your daily planning process and get started working on your action steps sooner, making you more productive overall. Plus, since RPM is fairly straightforward, you're more likely to stick with it.\n\nThis technique comes from famed motivational speaker Tony Robbins, who outlined it in his Time of Your Life program. Robbins may have a slightly cheesy rep, but RPM has the goods: Not only does does the acronym stand for Rapid Planning Method, but it can also serve as a guide to what your day should look like: Results-oriented, purpose-driven, and featuring a massive action plan.\n\nIt starts with asking yourself three questions consistently—every morning, for instance, or every week:\n\nWhat do I need to do/What is my massive action plan?\n\nYou can write down your answers or just keep them in mind, but they're intended to drive you forward into action that will be efficient and lead to accomplishing your ultimate goal. For best results, I do recommend writing the answers down in a planner, so you can stick your guiding principles somewhere you'll continually see them. Actually, I just recommend writing them down in general. Having to hand-write something helps commit the information to memory.\n\nThere are a whole lot of productivity methods out there—and the benefit of RPM is that it can be easily combined with many of them. For example, you can implement a 1-3-5 to-do list as part of your overall action plan. The defining feature of RPM is that it keeps your goals and desires front and center, giving you something to strive for. and organize your actions around. Just by keeping that central plan in mind, you can weed out what isn't important and highlight what you want to prioritize, all without a lot of time-wasting deliberation.\n\nOverall, I recommend sticking with productivity techniques that revolve around larger, bigger-picture goals and clearly-defined purposes. When you fail to keep your dreams and loftier ambitions in mind, it can be hard to motivate yourself to complete the tedious, smaller steps that add up to them. Another solid option for this kind of broader thinking is the MIT method.\n\nLike using SMART goals, using RPM infuses your daily tasks with a sense of purpose or a mission, helping you stay focused and engaged.",

    "title": "The Case for Ditching Your Fitness Trackers",
    "description": "When did exercise become this exhausting?",
    "fullText": "I have a love-hate relationship with the smartwatch on my wrist. This relationship is no doubt shaped by the fact that I write about fitness tech for a living, but I know I'm not alone in succumbing to an obsession with numbers from my wearables. Did I hit 10,000 steps? What's my resting heart rate today? Is my sleep score better than yesterday's? When did progressive overload turn into screen time overload, too?\n\nThe fitness tech boom is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon—and with it, we consume a constant stream of promises that this data will make us healthier, stronger, and faster. With the sheer amount of health insights potentially available to us at any time, it's easy to get overwhelmed. I've watched my least health-anxious friends become consumed by metrics they'd never heard of two years ago. They're tracking bone density trends, obsessing over cortisol levels, panicking about stress scores that fluctuate for reasons no algorithm can fully explain. I can feel my fitness trackers pull me away from genuine wellness and into a mental health disaster. The good news: When I look up from my screens and start talking to real people, I see I'm not alone in wanting to unplug and push back against the overly quantified self.\n\nWhen I put out a call on Instagram asking people about their relationship with posting workout data and fitness content, I received hundreds of responses from people exhausted by the performance of fitness. Even if your only audience is your own reflection, simply owning a wearable can create a real barrier between feeling good about your body and your fitness journey. Did I work out enough today? Will my friends see that I skipped a workout? Should I push through injury to maintain my streak?\n\nFor these reasons, celebrity trainer Lauren Kleban says she doesn't like to rely on wearables at all. \"Counting steps or calories can quickly spiral into a bit of an obsession,\" says Kleban, and that \"takes the joy out of movement and away from learning what's truly best for us.\" She says her clients want to focus on their mind and body connection, now more than ever. There's a real, growing desire to rebuild a sense of intuition that doesn't depend on feedback from a watch.\n\nSimilarly, Marshall Weber, a certified personal trainer and owner of Jack City Fitness, says that he's \"definitely been surprised by the growing push towards unplugged fitness,\" but that he \"totally gets it.\" Weber says he's had clients express feeling \"overwhelmed with their Fitbit or Apple Watch micromanaging their training.\" When every workout becomes about numbers and keeping up with an average, it's all too easy to lose touch with your body. \"The anti-tech movement is about taking back that personal connection,\" Weber says. After all, when was the last time you finished a workout and didn't immediately look at your stats, but instead just noticed how you felt?\n\nThis is the paradox at the heart of fitness technology. Tools designed to help us understand our bodies have created a new kind of illiteracy. Maybe you can tell me why you're aiming for Zone 2 workouts, but can't actually recognize what that effort feels like without a screen telling you. In a sense, you might be outsourcing your own intuition to algorithms.\n\nIf nothing else, the data risks are real. (Because if you think you own all your health data, think again.) Every heart rate spike, every missed workout, every late-night stress indicator gets recorded, stored, and potentially shared. Still, for me, the more insidious risk is psychological: the erosion of our ability to know ourselves without consulting a device first.\n\nSo what does unplugged fitness actually look like in practice? It's not about rejecting all technology or pretending GPS watches and heart rate monitors don't have value—I promise. Look, I crave data and answers as much as—and maybe more than—the average gym-goer. I'm simply not woo-woo enough to ditch my Garmin altogether.\n\nInstead, I argue for re-establishing a hierarchy in which technology serves your training, not the other way around. \"Sometimes, the best performance boost is just learning to listen to what your body is saying and feeling,\" says Weber. But what does \"listening to your body\" actually look like?\n\nIf you're like me, and need to rebuild a connection with your body from the ground-up, try these approaches:\n\nStart with tech-free workouts. Designate certain runs, yoga sessions, or strength workouts as completely unplugged. No watch, no phone, no tracking. Notice what changes when there's no device to check.\n\nRelearn your body's signals. Can you gauge your effort level without looking at a heart rate monitor? Do you actually know what \"recovery pace\" feels like for you, or are you just matching a number? Practice assessing fatigue, energy, soreness, and readiness without checking your watch.\n\nReplace metrics with sensory awareness. Instead of tracking pace, notice your breathing pattern. Instead of counting calories burned, pay attention to how your muscles feel. Instead of obsessing over sleep scores, ask yourself a simple question in the morning: how do I actually feel?\n\nSet goals that can't be gamified. Rather than chasing step counts or streak days, aim for qualitative improvements. Can you hold a plank with better form? Does that hill feel easier than last month? Are you enjoying your workouts more? These are the markers of real progress.\n\nCreate tech boundaries. Maybe you use your GPS watch for long runs but leave it home for everything else. Perhaps you track workouts but delete the social features. Find the minimum effective dose of technology that serves your goals without dominating your headspace.\n\nReconnect with in-person community. The loss of shared gym culture—people actually talking to each other instead of staying plugged into individual screens—represents more than just nostalgia. There's real value in working out alongside others, in having conversations about training instead of just comparing data, in building knowledge through shared experience rather than algorithm-driven insights.\n\nUnplugging is easier said than done, but you don't need to go cold turkey. Maybe in the new year, you can set \"body literacy\" as a worthwhile resolution. At the end of the day, exercise should add to your life, not become another source of performance anxiety. It should be energizing, not exhausting—and I don't just mean physically. The never-ending irony of modern fitness culture is that in our pursuit of optimal health, we keep inventing new forms of stress and anxiety. When all forms of wellness come with trackable metrics and social pressure, I think we've fundamentally missed the point.",

    "fullText": "If you find yourself in an emergency or crisis situation, the more information you can give first responders, the better. Android users can now share a live stream of their surroundings with 911, allowing emergency services to assess and provide guidance in real time while you wait for help to arrive onsite.\n\nYour Android already shares some information with first responders via Emergency Location Services (unless you disable this feature). This built-in tool sends an accurate location as well as contextual information, such as language settings, when you call or text an emergency number. Now, that includes live video from your device's camera.\n\nYou don't need to do anything to set up Emergency Live Video. Once available in your area, responders can send a request during an emergency call or text to securely share your camera's live video. You'll see a prompt on your screen to start sharing with one tap.\n\nAccording to Google, Emergency Live Video is encrypted by default. Users can choose whether to share their video from the prompt as well as stop the share at any time by clicking the onscreen Stop sharing button.\n\nLive video sharing is rolling out now to U.S. users, as well as those in parts of Germany and Mexico, on Android phones running Android 8 and up. Google says they are partnering with public safety organizations to expand the feature to more users.\n\nEmergency Live Video is the latest in Google's suite of safety features designed to make help more accessible—more quickly—in an emergency. Pixel users in Australia, North America, and several dozen countries across Europe now have access to Satellite SOS, which allows you to call emergency services even without a cellular or wifi connection.

    "title": "10 Hacks for Moving Day That Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "These essential hacks will remove a little of that moving-day stress and make things go more smoothly.",
    "fullText": "More than 37 million Americans moved last year—and while that’s actually a historic low, one thing that hasn’t changed is the levels of hair-tearing stress the experience can inspire. Everything about moving, from packing to hiring movers to switching utilities, comes with a little spice of stress and anxiety. Even the most competent and careful planning can leave you with an ulcer and an incipient nervous breakdown as you try to pack your entire life into a truck and transport it to another location.\n\nThere are lots of little ways to reduce that stress and make moving a little easier. These hacks can help anyone, no matter how far you’re moving or what your housing situation might be, because they each reduce the friction a tiny bit without much effort. Whether the big day is tomorrow or next month, take a moment and employ a few of these moving hacks to make the day a little less nightmarish.\n\nBuying moving boxes can be pricey—U-Haul sells kits that range from about $150 to $460, depending on the size of your household, for example. That’s not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, but after paying for everything else associated with a new home, saving a few hundred bucks is a worthy hack.\n\nLuckily, there are several ways to get your mitts on some free boxes, from companies like U-Haul that connect its customers to platforms like Freecycle where people often post used boxes for free pickup. And there’s always the old standby of contacting local grocery stores and the like to see if you can dumpster dive for some old boxes. If you start collecting boxes early enough, you can save yourself stress and money.\n\nWhen collecting or buying moving boxes, most of us just grab what’s available and wind up with a Tetris-like assortment of sizes and shapes. If at all possible, make all of your moving boxes the same size. This will make packing them into a truck or van a lot easier and more efficient, and make stacking them onto a handtruck or cart a lot faster and more stable. There will be obvious exceptions to this rule of thumb—garment boxes, television boxes, etc.—but the more you can make your boxes uniform, the faster things will go.\n\nMoving stuff like desks or dressers often means playing whack-a-mole with drawers and doors that keep popping open, or having to make multiple trips because nothing fits together snugly.\n\nThe answer is stretch wrap. You’ve seen professional movers use this stuff, but you can easily buy your own. And you should—it makes combining oddly-shaped things into one unit easy, it can be used to ensure drawers and doors stay closed, and protects your stuff from incidental damage caused by your enthusiastic but careless friends who are just in it for the free pizza.\n\nSometimes moving can feel positively Kafka-esque in its suffering. For example: You put in some effort to score a bunch of boxes only to discover that each box fits approximately one fluffy sweater. Sure, that’s an easy carry, but now you have to go find 100 more boxes—or start thrusting your clothes into garbage bags.\n\nOr, get yourself some vacuum storage bags. The same physics that allows you to store an entire winter wardrobe in the space under your bed will make your move a lot more efficient, shrinking down those bulky items to a more manageable size. Once shrunk, you can then roll or fold the bags to fit efficiently into boxes. Bonus: The plastic bags will also protect your clothes during the move, ensuring they don’t arrive stained, dusty, or torn.\n\nIt’s a ritual of moving: Propping the door. You’re up and down, in and out, and the front door keeps swinging shut and latching, forcing you to constantly fish out your keys or fobs to open it up.\n\nThere’s an easy hack for this, though: Take some (relatively large) rubber bands (you might need more than one), loop them over both knobs, and lay it against the latch so it’s pushed in. Now the door won’t latch, so you can just push or pull it open as needed.\n\nSometimes, when packing up stuff for a move, you can fall into a bit of a trance and become a packing machine, just madly shoving everything into boxes and bags. And then you arrive at your new home and you can’t brush your teeth, find the bandages, or find utensils to eat your victory Doordash.\n\nA great hack is to set up a “go bag” with all the essentials you might need. Treat it like staying one night in a hotel and bring everything you need to be comfortable, like hygiene products, toilet paper, basic utensils, and cleaning products. Throw in anything you might need: dry socks, fresh underwear, pet food, baby supplies, a first aid kit. This way, when you’re exhausted from the move, you won’t have to search through a pile of boxes looking for your toothbrush.\n\nTransporting your finery safely can be challenging, especially if you’re moving yourself. Wardrobe boxes can help protect your clothes during the move, but they’re also bulky and cost money, and you have to take the time to drag your clothes out of the closet and transfer them to the box.\n\nThere’s a hackier way: Separate your clothes into groups, then slide a trash bag up from the bottom to envelope the whole group of clothes and secure the plastic ties around the tops of the hangers. In a few minutes your whole closet is wrapped up and ready to go. You can combine this with a wardrobe box if you have one, but if not, your clothes are protected and your closet is instantly organized and ready to be emptied out.\n\nMoving houses can descend into chaos so quickly we often make our future selves miserable. What starts off as a relatively organized effort becomes a mad dash to cram stuff into boxes and finish the project, which means future you is stuck with a load of boxes filled with random stuff, and there will always be at least one treasured item that just seems to have dropped through a portal into another dimension.\n\nYou can prevent this with a simple hack: Mark each box with a number and take a photo of the contents of every box before you tape it shut and stuff it into the van. Sure, you could be more meticulous and have a spreadsheet, color-coded system of stickers, or other more robust way of tracking each box’s contents, but the photo method blends well with the barely-held-together chaos of many house moves. Later, when you’re searching for something, a quick scan of your photos will tell you precisely which box you put it inside.\n\nIt’s amazing how wires proliferate as if they’re an alien species infiltrating our world. Everything seems neat and tidy in your house, and then comes moving day and you realize that each television, desktop computer, and device has at least one—and sometimes several—cords associated with it. Keeping them all straight when moving to a new place can be a real pain. While cords like HDMI cables are usually interchangeable between devices, that won’t be the case if your laptop uses a USB-C-to-HDMI cable, and sometimes your cables are ideally sized—a short HDMI cable between a Roku and your TV, for example, won’t hang down and be an eyesore.\n\nTo ensure you put everything back the way it should be without tearing your hair out, take photos of the back of your devices before you disassemble them for transport. Being able to see exactly where every cord goes and how it was set up will save you a lot of time and trouble on the back end of your move.\n\nCleaning is a huge part of moving. If you’re renting, it’s a vital aspect of your plan to get your security deposit back. If you’ve sold a place, it’s just the right thing to do (and might even be stipulated in your sale contract).\n\nA simple but powerful hack: Don’t wait until you’ve moved everything out to clean. While it might seem like a completely empty house would be ideal for cleaning, it’s also kind of overwhelming. An empty room is just as easy to clean, and tackling each space as you clear it out instead of leaving it all to the end will make cleaning seem like less of a chore. Plus, alternating between packing and cleaning will actually make both go a little more smoothly, because at least there will be some variation.",

    "description": "Sleep Score should feel a bit more accurate.",
    "fullText": "watchOS 26 wasn't a huge update, but it did introduce some new features. You now have a Workout Buddy to help you exercise—though it'll only work if you have the right iPhone—and there's now a helpful gesture to dismiss your notifications. Apple is back at it today with updates across its Apple products, including the Apple Watch: watchOS 26.2 is a minor update, even compared to watchOS 26 proper, but there are still some key things to highlight here. In fact, there are three:\n\nwatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.\n\nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you.\n\nGoing forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nYou'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.\n\nIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n\nFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice.\n\nApple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone.",

    "fullText": "They say no one actually uses their phones for phone calls anymore. That's not really true, though maybe the \"Phone\" app does get underused. Instead, many of us have turned to chat apps for our calls. FaceTime, WhatsApp, Messenger—these apps are now our go-to choices for getting in immediate touch with friends and family. (Not that I'm complaining: The call quality is usually better, anyway.)\n\nBut one thing the Phone app—and traditional phone calls—have on these chat apps is voicemail. For decades, when you called someone and they didn't answer, you could \"leave a message after the tone.\" That way, when the person saw they had a missed call, they didn't need to guess what you wanted to say. If it was important, they'd hear about it, and call you back. If it wasn't, they could choose to call back when it was convenient.\n\nVoicemail isn't dead: You can still leave these messages if you call someone the old fashioned way. But since many of us choose to use our chat apps of choice, we've largely lost this practice. It's been wholly replaced with text messages and voice notes: If they don't answer the call, you can simply text them what you wanted to talk about, or record a voice note to achieve a similar end.\n\nSome chat apps are trying to bring voicemails back, however. The first major player on my radar was FaceTime: Back in 2023, Apple made it possible to leave video and audio messages for people whenever they didn't pick up a FaceTime call. It's a small but logical feature: Sure, there are other ways to leave a message. But it just makes sense given the history of phone calls to present the option as soon as someone misses your call.\n\nNow, WhatsApp is getting in on the feature. The company first started testing missed call messages in August, before rolling out the option in full on Thursday. Now, when you try calling someone in WhatsApp and they miss it, you have the option to leave either a video or an audio message—depending on what type of call you started.\n\nAgain, these are functions you could initiate already in the app itself: You could simply record a video saying what you want to say, and send it to the recipient, or record an audio note letting them know to call you back. But this built-in option isn't only convenient, it establishes voice messages as a standard for missed WhatsApp calls.\n\nInterestingly, WhatsApp says this new feature \"will make voicemails a thing of the past.\" As it see it, it's actually keeping them alive.",

    "title": "All the New Features in iOS 26.2",
    "description": "Apple's latest update for your iPhone is now available.",
    "fullText": "Apple dropped iOS 26.1 on Nov. 3, introducing some small but meaningful changes to iPhones. But after changing how alarms work, and adding options to adjust the look of Liquid Glass, the company is back at it with another update: iOS 26.2.\n\nAs you might expect, iOS 26.2 isn't a major update. Apple clearly added most of the features and changes it had in mind with iOS 26, and a handful of new features and adjustments with iOS 26.1. Still, iOS 26.2 does bring some changes. Here's what's new:\n\nWith iOS 26.1, Apple added an option to adjust the look of Liquid Glass. With it, you can choose from two options: \"Clear,\" the iconic Liquid Glass look, or \"Tinted,\" which increases opacity of the elements, and turns Liquid Glass into more of a Frosted Glass.\n\nWhile this is a helpful addition for users who didn't like the look of Liquid Glass, some wanted Apple to go a step further, and add a slider to more finely adjust the look of the glassy design. It seems Apple has done just that with iOS 26.2, but not for the system-wide Liquid Glass UI. Instead, with this new version, you get a slider to adjust the look of your Lock Screen clock:\n\nIn addition, it looks like Apple adjusted the Liquid Glass animations throughout iOS. As you can see from the post below, the animation is responsive and bouncy, a bit closer to the demos we saw back in June:\n\nApple is also continuing to update its apps with Liquid Glass. With 26.2, the Measure app is next. The new update adds Liquid Glass bubbles to the app's Level function, which replaces the existing solid white circles.\n\nReminders are an indispensable part of my iPhone. I rely on them on a daily basis to make sure I keep up with important tasks. However, reminder alerts are as present as any other notification on your iPhone. If you frequently watch your notifications, that's just fine, but if you don't check your iPhone so much, or you use Focuses or Do Not Disturb, it can be easy to miss a reminder—and easy to forget to do the thing you were reminding yourself to do.\n\niOS 26.2 has a solution: alarms for reminders. When you set a reminder as \"Urgent\" while running iOS 26.2, you'll see a pop-up asking for permission to to schedule alarms and timers. The idea is, rather than rely on a simple alert, the Reminders app can play an alarm when your reminder is due. I imagine that will help avoid forgotten reminders: You might miss a short ping, but you probably will hear if your iPhone is continuously blaring.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch running watchOS 26, you can take advantage of Apple's new Sleep Score feature. Sleep Score looks at your sleep duration, bedtime, and sleep interruptions to assign you a score to summarize how well you slept. Duration can go up to 50 points, bedtime up to 30, and interruptions up to 20, culminating in a highest possible score of 100.\n\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple is adjusting the Sleep Score metrics, which should hopefully make it a bit more accurate for users at a glance. Here's how it changed, as noted by MacRumors:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nIn addition, \"Excellent\" is now \"Very High,\" to keep the naming scheme more consistent.\n\niOS 26.2 introduces a new \"Manage Known AirDrop Contacts\" section, that reads: \"You will automatically appear for 30 days to people you have shared a one-time code with.\" As this setting suggests, you may be able to share a one-time code with another user, after which time you will be able to easily find each other over AirDrop for 30 days.\n\nThis new iOS 26.2 feature can update you about \"imminent threats,\" like floods, emergencies, and natural disasters. You'll see maps of affected locations, and links to relevant safety information. This feature is also available on watchOS 26.2.\n\nApple added a new feature to Accessibility Settings that lets you choose to have the device screen flash whenever you receive a notification.\n\nFreeform, Apple's digital whiteboard app, doesn't get the attention it deserves. With iOS 26.2, tables in Freeform can now store text, images, documents, and drawings. Cells also \"intelligently\" resize to fit.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.1, Apple brought back Slide Over. This useful multitasking feature lets you assign one app window that you can easily bring forward or dismiss from the side of the screen. It's great for quick glances at apps like Messages, Music, or social media platforms—things you don't always need on-screen.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.2, Apple is continuing to bring back Slide Over functionality. The company brought back drop and drop, which lets you pick up an app and drop it on top of your active Slide Over window to instantly turn that chosen app to a Slide Over view.\n\nApple is introducing three new changes for the Podcasts app in iOS 26.2. You'll see all three in a pop-up menu the first time you open the app post-update.\n\nFirst, all Podcasts in English will come with chapters by default. Podcasters can include these chapters themselves, or, if none are available, the app will generate them automatically with AI. If podcasters don't want their episodes to have chapters, they can disable the feature on their end. The app will also collect any podcasts mentioned during the show you're listening to in one location, so you can easily find those other podcasts if interested. Similarly, podcasters can roundup any links they want to share in one place, including with timestamped entries in the transcript of the episode. The app may automatically create these links too, based on the contents of the episode.\n\nWhen you update your iPhone to 26.2, you might notice three changes in the Games app. First there are new sorting options, including filters that sort by game size, show what games your friends are playing, and which games support challenges. In addition, the app now has expanded controller compatibility for navigating the app, so you should be able to continue using the controller rather than touch controls when in Games. Finally, your challenge scores will update in real-time as you play games.\n\nFor the last five years, Apple has let you pin your favorite contacts and group chats to the top of the Messages app. With iOS 26, Apple updated CarPlay to support this feature, but didn't give you any say in the matter. If you had pinned chats on your iPhone, CarPlay would mirror that, even if you would prefer to drive without the pinned chats on your car's display.\n\nWith 26.2, however, Apple is giving you the option to disable pinned messages for CarPlay. The option appears as a simple \"Pinned Conversations\" toggle in CarPlay settings.\n\nLive Translation is a promising new feature for AirPods owners running iOS 26. When you're wearing your AirPods, and you start talking to someone who speaks a different language than you do, your iPhone will translate their words on the fly, and you'll hear what they're saying in your target language through your AirPods. Apple isn't the first company to offer this feature and it isn't perfect, but it's great to have it nonetheless.\n\nHowever, EU users running iOS 26 or iOS 26.1 can't use Live Translation. Apple cited the region's Digital Markets Act as the reason it couldn't bring Live Translation to the EU, but the company seems to have sorted out whatever logistical and bureaucratic issues it had been dealing with: Now that iOS 26.2 is here, AirPods users in the EU will be able to use Live Translation, too.\n\nWhile not technically an iOS 26.2 feature, Apple has one major update to macOS with version 26.2: The company has added an \"Edge Light\" feature, which adds a ring of light around your video call window. Apple says the feature uses your Mac's Neural Engine to identify your face and analyze your movements, which allows the light to adjust as needed. If you move your cursor to access something else on your screen, for example, the light will dim so you can see what you're doing. You can also change the light's hue, if you prefer something warmer or cooler for your calls.\n\nWhether this feature will be good enough to replace a dedicated light, like the popular Ring Light, remains to be seen. But this is an interesting and unexpected feature from Apple, and I'm curious to try it for myself when it launches.",

With these two at the top of the card, we're going to stack the rest of the evening and put on an event for the ages.\"",

    "fullText": "Briton Dalton Smith's world-title challenge against WBC light-welterweight champion Subriel Matias remains on, despite the champion returning adverse drug-test findings.\n\nThe Puerto Rican tested positive for the banned substance Ostarine in a Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) out-of-competition test taken on 9 November.\n\nA 'B' sample also returned an adverse finding, but the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) says the concentration detected was below the threshold used by major boxing jurisdictions, meaning the fight in New York on 10 January can proceed.\n\n\"The New York State Athletic Commission is aware that Mr Matias, who is currently licensed, has received an adverse analytic finding from VADA concerning an out of competition test,\" the commission told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The reported concentration was below the applicable threshold used by multiple jurisdictions, including Nevada, California, and New York.\"\n\nThe commission added that Matias has been cooperative but that the situation remains under review and he will be subject to additional testing.\n\nIt added: \"At this time the fight is scheduled to proceed on 10 January 2026.\"\n\nOstarine, a non-steroidal drug used to support muscle growth, has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substance list since 2008.\n\nFollowing the initial A-sample finding, the WBC said it had identified mitigating factors in Matias' case.\n\nThe sanctioning body indicated the adverse result was linked to the fighter's use of supplements known to carry a risk of Ostarine contamination, adding that the levels detected were low and consistent with accidental ingestion.\n\nHowever, the organisation has placed him on a 12-month probation period.\n\nThe WBC also warned that any further positive test during the probationary period would result in an indefinite suspension, pending further investigation.\n\nSheffield's Smith, 28, has won all 18 of his professional bouts, and his team have said he will not pull out of the contest.\n\nMatias, 33, has 23 wins and two defeats on his record.",

    "description": "Fifa is coming under increasing pressure from supporters' groups to revisit its \"scandalous\" pricing structure for the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "The Football Association has been asked to lobby Fifa to lower the price of World Cup tickets by a leading supporters' group.\n\nThe Football Supporters' Association (FSA) says the pricing structure for next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico is \"scandalous\".\n\nIt has joined Football Supporters Europe (FSE) in demanding that the sales process is stopped so fans' groups can hold talks with world governing body Fifa over its pricing policy.\n\n\"We back Football Supporters Europe in calling for a halt in ticket sales and we are calling on the Football Association to work with fellow FAs to directly challenge these disgraceful prices,\" the FSA said in a statement.\n\n\"We call on all national associations to stand up for your supporters, without whom there would be no professional game.\"\n\nFifa, the FA and the Scottish FA are all yet to comment.\n\nBBC Sport has been told that the FA is aware that England fans are angry, and is planning to relay those concerns to Fifa.\n\nThere is a Fifa Council meeting in Doha next week, and FA Chair Debbie Hewitt will be present. Last month she said that she was opposed to dynamic ticket pricing, and has vowed that it will not be used at Euro 2028, which the UK and Ireland is hosting.\n\nDespite mounting pressure, Fifa has also not yet made any public comment on its ticket price policies.\n\nThat may change if a number of national football associations jointly raise concerns, but with the Home Nations FAs hoping to host the 2035 Women's World Cup, they (and the UK government) may also be wary of upsetting Fifa.\n\nBBC Sport has been told that Fifa is waiting to see how many people have entered the ballot, but that it is expecting strong demand.\n\nPrivately, Fifa insiders say that while tickets will seem expensive to many, the governing body has a duty to set prices with the US market in mind, grow the game around the world, and to use its revenues to develop men's, women's and youth football.\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino has also promised to achieve record revenues, and the most lucrative sports event in history will do no harm to his re-election hopes in 2027.\n\nThe huge increase in the price of tickets was revealed on Thursday when Fifa released allocation details for the official supporters' groups of each country.\n\nAt the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, group stage fixtures all had set prices of £68.50, £164.50 or £219.\n\nBut for England v Croatia and Scotland v Brazil next year, tickets cost around £198, £373 or £523.\n\nThe cost ramps up considerably in the latter stages.\n\nQuarter-finals for all teams are £507, £757 and £1,073, with the semi-finals £686, £1,819 and £2,363.\n\nThe cheapest tickets for the final are £3,119, seven times more expensive than in Qatar.\n\nThere are no concessions across any of its tickets for children or other groups.",

    "fullText": "Premier Sports Cup final: St Mirren v Celtic\n\nVenue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Sunday, 14 November Kick-off: 15:00 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds & digital\n\nCeltic manager Wilfried Nancy says victory in Sunday's Premier Sports Cup final against St Mirren would \"validate\" what he is trying to implement at his new club.\n\nBut he insists he will have \"many other\" chances to prove himself to their supporters.\n\nNancy became the first Celtic boss to lose his first two matches in charge as they were swatted aside by Roma in the Europa League on Thursday following last weekend's Scottish Premiership defeat by Heart of Midlothian.\n\nMany supporters had left by the time the full-time whistle blew and those that remained expressed their frustration at both the result and performance.\n\nGiven the importance of Nancy's first three matches in charge, some fans were confused by the timing of his appointment.\n\nThe Frenchman understands what is at stake at Hampden but insists he is not thinking about the prospect of a third straight defeat.\n\n\"For me? No,\" he said when asked about the importance of winning a trophy.\n\n\"For my players, yes. And for the fans, yes.\n\n\"Yes, I would like to win the trophy. I'm pretty sure that, if we don't win it, it's going to be difficult, because when we lose, this is painful.\n\n\"But, again, I am optimistic as a person. So hopefully we're going to do it. And also if it's going to validate what we are doing. But, if not, I don't want to think about this because, for the moment, I want to stay positive and this is the way I think.\n\n\"I'm going to have many, many other times to show, to do my stuff and to convince the fans that I am the right guy.\"\n\n'Nancy exposed to brutal life as Celtic manager as cup final looms'\n\nDoes Nancy 'know what he's walked in to' amid horror Celtic start?\n\nNancy inherited a side that had won seven from eight matches under interim manager Martin O'Neill, but he stamped his own identity on the team from the start, switching to a back three against both Hearts and Roma.\n\nWith some players shoehorned into unfamiliar positions, Celtic have struggled to click in attack and were dismantled at the back by Roma on Thursday in a dominant first-half display.\n\nStill, the former Columbus Crew head coach has seen enough to believe his system will come good.\n\n\"I watched the game and obviously we had a difficult moment, but we had also good moments,\" he said\n\n\"This game for me was important because it gives me the possibility to set the standard regarding what we want to achieve and it was good to compare certain things [with Roma].\n\n\"After that, the standard, we have it already. The desire to compete, the desire to train well, the desire to improve, this is the standard.\n\n\"The desire also to do what it takes to have good performance, we have it. We have to be better in terms of execution, but we are on the right track.\n\n\"For one week, I can see good stuff. We need also to improve on certain things, but it will come.\"\n\nGiven the two defeats leading into the cup final, Nancy admitted there will be a degree of doubt but dismissed the idea there was an added pressure on the game.\n\n\"It doesn't change,\" he added. \"A final is a final, it's not the same.\n\n\"Obviously the fact that we didn't win the last two games, mentally we can have a bit of uncertainty.\n\n\"But we're having a good discussion with the players and we know what we did well, we know what we need to improve and everything is clear.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans could be looking at their next head coach on Sunday originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans, coming off their second win of the season, a 31-29 victory over the Cleveland Browns on the road, head west to take on the 49ers. San Francisco is currently in the middle of the playoff hunt with a 9-4 record. Offensively, running back Christian McCaffery has been incredible. He is closing in on another season of having 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving, which would be the second of his career and make him the only player ever to have two of these seasons in their career. Defensively, the 49ers have been injury-riddled, but they remain one of the best scoring defenses in the NFL, allowing only 20.8 points per game, good for eighth in the NFL. The offense can be credited to Kyle Shanahan and his creativity. The defense, however, is led by their defensive coordinator, Robert Saleh.\n\nSaleh is back with the 49ers after leaving his defensive coordinator post in San Francisco in 2021 to take the head coaching position with the Jets. His head coaching journey there was fascinating, especially after they signed veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers.  It ended abruptly, though, as he was fired after Week 5 in the NFL. However, Saleh has designs on being a head coach again in the NFL. Apparently, NFL teams are interested in speaking with Saleh. His name has been thrown out there in the rumor mill for potential head-coaching openings, and one of those places his name has been rumored is the team he will be facing Sunday, the Tennessee Titans. So, with that being said, what would Saleh bring to the Titans if he were the head coach?\n\nOne thing that cannot be overlooked is the energy Saleh brings. Throughout his time as the 49ers' defensive coordinator and as a head coach with the New York Jets, cameras captured him expressing his emotions on the sideline. The excitement of seeing a player he coaches make a play is something he can hardly contain, and you see him busting out of the seams with excitement. That type of energy permeates throughout your team when you know a coach is invested in your performance and genuinely happy for you. That type of energy would be great for the Titans to have in a head coach. A head coach who could bring that type of energy to a team that, at times, can appear lifeless.  And for a player like Jeffery Simmons, Saleh would be a perfect fit for him as a head coach.\n\nDefensively, Saleh would bring an attacking style defense. He generally does not like to bring extra people when he is getting after quarterbacks. But what he has always done is adjust to the talent and pieces that he has. And with this 49ers defense that has suffered significant injuries, he has shown himself to be flexible with what he can do and has been able to get the best out of players and put them in the best positions to succeed. The Titans have also had injuries at key positions. So with Saleh, he would come in and bring an attacking style defense that would help hide some of the deficiencies the Titans have had over the years.\n\nWhile that defensive strategy sounds good, Saleh could also switch the Titans' defensive scheme. The Titans have run a 3-4 defense for a while now, but Saleh does like to run a 4-3 or 4-2-5 defense. With that, you have two guys you could plug inside and make it really tough to run in T’Vondre Sweat and Simmons, who is among the top interior defensive linemen. But you would have to figure out whether the players who are 3-4 outside linebackers can adjust to being defensive ends, or if other players are needed to fit his scheme. That could potentially stunt Saleh's ability to figure out how to get this defense the way he wants it.\n\nAnd the even bigger question, should they go with Saleh, is who does he bring in offensively? With Cam Ward, the 2025 first overall pick, set at quarterback, it will be paramount for Saleh to bring in someone who can continue developing Ward into the quarterback he has the potential to be. While the defense will be necessary, if he is unable to bring in someone to continue Ward's progression, then Saleh would ultimately fail here in Tennessee.\n\nNothing is set in stone for Saleh to land in Tennessee as the head coach, but he is among many who could get an interview with Tennessee and is a name to watch this offseason.",

The Trojans are led by head coach Mike Coe, who led the program to a Class AAAAA state championship in 2023.\n\nGrady recently stepped down as Brunswick’s head coach in the aftermath of the brawl with Gainesville a couple weeks ago. He had previously served four seasons as the Pirates’ head football coach and five as the program’s offensive coordinator.\n\nLet's go! Welcome to Trojan Nation Coach Grady! pic.twitter.com/IC7fId8HOL\n\n— Coffee Trojans FB (@coffee_trojans) December 12, 2025\n\nBack on Nov. 25, the Georgia High School Association (GHSA) had previously announced the suspension of 41 Brunswick players, fining the school $5,000 and barred the Pirates from participating in the 2026 playoffs. The association met with Glynn County Schools and decided to amend the sanctions, lifting the program’s playoff ban and rescinding 39 of the 41 player suspensions, but continuing to uphold the fines assessed to Brunswick.\n\nThe sanctions stemmed from an altercation that happened back in November and occurred late in the third quarter of the playoff game between Brunswick and Gainesville, with viral video showing Pirates’ players instigating Red Elephants’ players, igniting an all out melee between the two teams.\n\nGrady leaves the Pirates with an overall record of 36-10, qualifying Brunswick for the postseason each of his four years leading the program.\n\nFor Georgia high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "On Dec. 10, 2025, the Professional Softball League (PSL) announced its formation and a TV partnership with the All Women’s Sports Network (AWSN). giving fastpitch another major place to land on the streaming map.\n\nAccording to AWSN, PSL’s inaugural season will begin in June 2026 and run through late July, with games airing live worldwide on the network.\n\nSeven previously independent teams are coming together under one league structure. One report mentioned that the goal is a consistent schedule, standings, and a postseason pathway rather than a one-off touring setup.\n\nChattanooga Chill (Chattanooga, TN)\n\nFlorida is coming strong with three teams included.\n\nThis isn’t a single touring squad or a loose collection of exhibitions. According to AWSN, PSL is moving to a single league structure with standardized standings and a postseason route, built around seven member teams from across the U.S.\n\nEach club can carry up to 20 players. AWSN noted PSL teams will sign players to pro contracts, host open tryouts, and offer multiple paths for prospects to earn roster spots, with more competitive-format details coming later.\n\nFor updates, PSL’s official hub is already live at professionalsoftballleague.com.\n\nPro softball has a real history in the U.S., even if the leagues haven’t always stuck around. National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) is the big reference point for many fans, and Wikipedia notes it ran from 2004 to 2021, after earlier years under the Women’s Pro Softball League name.\n\nWhen NPF shut down, it wasn’t subtle. In an official statement carried by the NFCA, the league said it was suspending operations effective immediately in August 2021, pointing to lost revenue after the canceled 2020 and 2021 seasons tied to COVID disruptions and Olympic timing.\n\nThe sport didn’t pause for long. NFCA reported that Women’s Professional Fastpitch (WPF) was set to kick off in June 2022, with USA Softball designated as a co-founder. And on the newer-model side, ESPN reported Athletes Unlimited launched its pro softball championship format in 2020, then announced a more traditional team league structure starting in 2025.\n\nWhen it comes to watching the PSL in June 2026, AWSN’s “Where to Watch” page covers all bases. It also highlights that you’ll be able to find games on:\n\nAs Sports Illustrated reported, having these games on major platforms like Amazon Prime, Pluto TV, and DIRECTV, will make the action easy to consume.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of women’s sports is its growth. Sports Business Journal reported that WNBA games across ESPN networks, including ABC, averaged about 1.3 million viewers in 2025.\n\nThe key is that distribution is shifting as growth continues. For instance, Variety covered DIRECTV’s MyFree DIRECTV push in 2024, a free, ad-supported streaming service that shows AWSN. This distribution across major networks puts women’s sports in front of more people than ever.\n\nAWSN fits this new distribution mix and includes partnerships and programming tied to UEFA, Athletes Unlimited, FIBA, and the WNBL. It’s not a one-league or sport channel.\n\nLooking ahead, this growth may continue to climb. Data from Nielsen shows global interest in women’s sports hit 50% of the general population in 2024, up from 45% in 2022. And Reuters, using Nielsen projections, highlighted that women’s soccer could become a top-five global sport by 2030, with 800 million-plus fans in sight. That is amazing.\n\nThat’s why the PSL-AWSN pairing feels timely. The audience is already training itself to look for women’s sports in more places, more often.\n\nIdentifying Tampa Bay Buccaneers Coaching Candidates to Replace Todd Bowles\n\nDo the Devils Need External Help?

Toure added that Rodri will not be back for this weekend, but is \"looking sharper every day' as he continues his recovery.\n\nThe game against Palace will be the final match before Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri report for international duty at the Africa Cup Of Nations.\n\nToure gave his assessment of the Blues' current run of 11 wins in their past 14 games: \"The team is playing the same football that they used to play. One thing we have had is fighting for the second ball. We know that the Premier League is a physical league. When you have the ball it is top, but when you don't have the ball you have to fight. That is the difference from last season.\"\n\nHe explained Pep Guardiola was a manager he always wanted to work with when he finished playing.\n\nHowever, he has not ruled out a return to a full-time managerial role in the future, and said his experience managing Wigan was \"the best thing that has happened to him\".\n\nOn Saturday's opponents: \"They are a top team. They are second best at the moment at conceding goals but we focus on what we can do. We know if we play our football consistently and work hard as a team, we can beat any team in this league.\"\n\nFollow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news\n\nListen to full commentary of Crystal Palace v Manchester City from 14:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra on Sunday",

It's a very exciting time.\"\n\nVonn's 83 World Cup wins are third all-time, men or women.\n\nAfter retiring in 2019 due to knee problems, Vonn returned to competition in Dec. 2024 with a eye on qualifying for the 2026 Olympics in Italy.\n\n\"Obviously my goal is Cortina but if this is the way we start I think I'm in a good spot,\" said Vonn.\n\nVonn has dominated in her career at Cortina d'Ampezzo, the location of the Olympic skiing competition in February, with 12 World Cup wins. It's a special place that played a factor in her deciding to come out of retirement.\n\n“I don't think I would have tried this comeback if the Olympics weren't in Cortina,” Vonn said in November. “If it had been anywhere else, I would probably say it's not worth it. But for me, there's something special about Cortina that always pulls me back, and it's pulled me back one last time.”\n\nVonn won gold in the downhill and bronze in the super-G at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics and picked up another bronze medal in 2018 in Pyeongchang.\n\nVonn's competition isn't done in St. Moritz.

It's nice to have some very important players looking fit. Some still a bit short but they're getting there. It's nice seeing some of these faces who are very good players coming back to full fitness and on the bench or starting of course.\"\n\nIbrahim Sangare has \"earned his place back in the side\" but his absence for the Africa Cup of Nations from next week will provide another \"challenge\".\n\nMeanwhile, Dyche explained why Ola Aina will not be joining up with the Nigeria squad despite requests from the country's FA: \"It's just that he's not fit - he hasn't been fit and he's still not fit. He hasn't played any football yet. So, that's all we can offer to that situation.

They've got some very good individual players and Thomas [Frank] is a wily fox in the Premier League now after years at Brentford. A new challenge for him and a new challenge for me. Different circumstances I think.\"\n\nHe is not underestimating the difficulties Spurs will pose but backed Forest to cope: \"I've read about some of the players they've brought in - they've spent a heck of a lot of money so it's a big challenge. I think we're in good shape and we're at the City Ground and that's a big factor. We take this game on gladly and I want us to perform.

That is because Newcastle's focus has been on their Champions League campaign while also trying to improve their Premier League position, which they have managed to do since the November international break.\n\nHowe would have liked a full week to prepare but the Magpies are now so used to playing every three or four days that a lack of training time should not be a problem.\n\nTheir record under Howe in the biggest matches is very good and he has top-level players who will love an occasion like this.\n\nI sense uncertainty among the fanbase about how Sunday will go. Many consider Sunderland favourites after their impressive return to the Premier League. Newcastle's bad habit of throwing away a lead and conceding late goals - sometimes doing both in the same game - adds to the unease.\n\nBut, I think the extra quality of the away side will make the difference and ensure three points go back to Tyneside.\n\nExplore Newcastle content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Sherrone Moore scandal, explained: What to know about Michigan coach's arrest after firing for relationship with staff member originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe coaching carousel received a jolt Wednesday when Michigan announced it was firing head coach Sherrone Moore for cause. Moore, who had just wrapped up his second season with the Wolverines, posted an 18-8 record as head coach.\n\nMichigan athletic director Warde Manuel announced the decision Wednesday afternoon, saying Moore had engaged in an \"inappropriate relationship\" with a staffer. Moore was also arrested on Wednesday evening as part of an investigation into a alleged assault. The link between the two incidents remains largely unclear\n\nMoore finished the 2025 regular season 9-3. Michigan is set to face Texas in the Citrus Bowl.\n\nHere’s what to know about the allegations facing Moore, his status with Michigan and more.\n\nBENDER: Sherrone Moore firing creates 4 major questions for Michigan\n\nAccording to Michigan, Moore was fired for \"credible evidence\" that Moore had engaged in an \"inappropriate relationship\" with a UM staffer.\n\nMichigan announces that Sherrone Moore has been fired for cause & school found “credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.”\n\n— Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) December 10, 2025\n\nThe Wolverines' athletic director, Warde Manuel, released a statement on Wednesday afternoon:\n\nStatement from University of Michigan Athletic Director Warde Manuel:\n\n“U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate…\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 10, 2025\n\nOn Thursday, Michigan President Dominico Grasso also released a statement in a letter to the Wolverine community, saying there is no tolerance for Moore's behavior.\n\nLetter sent from Michigan president to the university tonight. https://t.co/ELwP0hu1mgpic.twitter.com/AHPQ6LYba0\n\n— Pete Nakos (@PeteNakos) December 11, 2025\n\nMoore just finished his second season with Michigan, taking over for Jim Harbaugh after he left for the NFL two seasons ago. He finished 18-8 as a head coach in Ann Arbor.\n\nIt has been reported that Moore, who is married with three children, is accused of engaging in a relationship with a Michigan staff member. Such a situation likely resulted in a breach of Moore’s contract with the university. Beyond that, however, few details of the situation have been made public.\n\nMoore had been suspended twice previously under the sign-stealing investigation involving former UM assistant Conner Stalions, missing two games this season. He was also set to serve a one-game suspension to open the 2026 season. In 2023, he served a self-imposed one-game suspension for violating COVID recruiting rules.\n\nWe have seen other coaches fired for cause in recent years. Michigan State fired Mel Tucker in 2023 after an investigation found Tucker sexually harassed Title IX advocate Brenda Tracy, who had previously worked with the program. Tracy was a sexual assault survivor stemming from the Baylor football Title IX scandal.\n\nWashington State fired Nick Rolovich for cause in October 2021 after he refused to comply with the state’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Florida fired Jim McElwain for cause in 2017 after the head coach claimed he and his family had received death threats amid the program’s struggles. An investigation later found that no such threats had been made.\n\nMORE: Michigan's best candidates to replace Sherrone Moore\n\nTMZ has released audio of a 911 tape, allegedly tied to Moore's arrest on Wednesday. On the tape, you can hear the dispatcher say that a woman on location was \"being attacked,\" and that the man at the location has \"been stalking her for months.\"\n\n#EXCLUSIVE 😳 TMZ Sports has obtained dispatch audio stemming from the alleged Sherrone Moore assault. https://t.co/F75acyiGiepic.twitter.com/d12cGW9DcQ\n\n— TMZ Sports (@TMZ_Sports) December 11, 2025\n\nPer Adam Rittenberg of ESPN, Moore is expected to appear in court for his arraignment on Friday, Dec. 12:\n\nUpdate from Pittsfield Township police on the Sherrone Moore situation: \"This investigation is ongoing and under review by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor.

Police confirmed to Paul that they made an arrest stemming from “an assault investigation” but did not specifically use Moore’s name in the statement.\n\nStatement from Pittsfield Township police: https://t.co/zmdD5LYwULpic.twitter.com/Q9sfEx3tx4\n\n— Tony Paul | Detroit News (@TonyPaul1984) December 11, 2025\n\nOn Thursday, NBC's Nicole Auerbach reported that the university knew that the former head coach was dealing with mental health issues, yet Manuel fired Moore with no human relations representative or security guards present.\n\nMichigan had been alerted prior to Wednesday that Sherrone Moore was dealing with mental health issues yet Warde Manuel fired him alone with no HR rep and no security present, source told @NBCSports.\n\n— Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) December 11, 2025\n\nMoore was arrested hours after his termination. He is expected to be arraigned on Friday afternoon.\n\nSheriff at the 14-A district court has told us arraignments will not begin this afternoon until 1:00 p.m. That, of course, includes Sherrone Moore.\n\nIt is not yet clear if it will be a video arraignment or in person, the expectation is it will be on video.\n\n— Tony Garcia | Detroit Free Press (@RealTonyGarcia) December 12, 2025\n\nWhile rumors are circulating that Manuel will be fired, Michigan will be starting its coaching search with him remaining as athletic director.\n\nMichigan board members and university officials held a call earlier today related to the situation with Sherrone Moore, sources tell @YahooSports. Despite reports to the contrary, Warde Manuel remains the athletic director as the school begins a search for its next coach.\n\n— Ross Dellenger (@RossDellenger) December 11, 2025\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Michigan board members and university officials held a call related to the situation and made the decision.\n\nPittsfield police released a statement saying it brought a suspect into custody \"for the purposes of investigating an alleged assault,\" according to ESPN. The statement went on to say \"this incident does not appear to be random in nature, and there appears to be no ongoing threat to the community.\"\n\nThe police did not name Sherrone Moore as the suspect, but the details of the arrest align with the reports that police detained Moore. The situation and investigation remain ongoing.\n\nYes, Moore is married. He has been married since 2015, to his wife, Kelli Moore. The couple has three daughters together.\n\nMoore's wife is Kelli Moore. The two married in 2015, when Moore was the tight ends coach at Central Michigan.\n\nMoore signed a five-year contract with Michigan in Jan. 2024. His salary was $6.1 million annually, with a $500,000 retention bonus every year. His deal ran through the 2029 season.\n\nHis buyout by USA Today is listed as $13,897,916. According to CBS Sports, his buyout is 75% of his base salary, including the additional compensation remaining on his contract. If Moore is fired for cause, the school could potentially avoid paying out the remainder of his contract.\n\nRevisiting Michigan's sign-stealing scandal\n\nJim Harbaugh's timeline of trouble at Michigan\n\nExplaining NCAA's Jim Harbaugh show-cause penalty",

    "description": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles placed blame following the Week 15 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday night and he put all of it on his players.",
    "fullText": "Todd Bowles points finger after Bucs' loss to Falcons and it wasn't at the coaches originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers had about as ugly a loss as a playoff contender can have in the Week 15 game against the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nWith Tampa Bay desperately needing a win, the Buccaneers coughed up one against Atlanta, blowing a two-score fourth-quarter lead that resulted in them falling into second place in the NFC South and out of a playoff spot.\n\nThe normally reserved Bowles went nuclear in his post-game presser, dropping a total of seven F-bombs while answering a question about what he would say to players in the locker room following the brutal loss.\n\n\"It's inexcusable. You don't make excuses,\" Bowles said. \"You gotta f****** care enough where this s*** hurts. You gotta f****** care enough where this s*** hurts. Gotta f****** mean something to you. It's more than a job, it's your f****** livelihood.\"\n\n\"How well do you know your job, how well can you do your job. You can't sugarcoat that s***,\" he added. \"It was in-f******-excusable. There's no f****** answer for it. No excuse for it. That's what you tell them in the locker room. Look in the f****** mirror.\"\n\nBowles didn't stop there, though.\n\nHe even went on to put all of the blame on his players instead of putting any on himself and the coaching staff.\n\n\"At this point, you've seen everything in the season,\" he said. \"The coaches have done everything they can do. This is a player-drive team in the last four or five weeks. You gotta execute and they gotta hold each other accountable.\n\n\"As a coach, you can sit there until you're blue in the face, until they start holding each other accountable and doing the little things right — and that's not everybody, now, we're only about a small select few, but the small select few is what's getting us beat — and until that happens, it's not going to get right, so we gotta get up and go to work tomorrow, no matter how bad today looks. You gotta put it behind you and we gotta win the last three games, we know that.\"\n\nBowles' players might be so disgusted at themselves that they have no issue with what he said, but this is exactly the type of comment that can lose a locker room.\n\nWe might be more inclined to put extra blame on the players if what the Bucs are going through hasn't happened under Bowles before, but it has.\n\nAs a result, it's fair to wonder if players deserve all of the blame rather than some of it going to the coaching staff and, more specifically, Bowles himself.\n\nAt the end of the day, it really doesn't matter. The fact is, the Bucs are crashing and burning right before our very eyes and no longer control their own destiny going into the weekend.\n\nJake Ferguson injury update spells trouble for TE's Week 15 status\n\nCeeDee Lamb injury update all but confirms WR's Week 15 status\n\nPhilip Rivers' Week 15 playing status gets significant update\n\nJosh Jacobs injury update sets off alarm bells for Week 15\n\nDe'Von Achane injury update is only mildly concerning\n\nEx-Cowboys, Packers coach considered front-runner for Titans job",

    "fullText": "Goldenberry, a small, tart-sweet fruit described as a cross between a pineapple and a mango, is increasingly popular in U.S. markets for its flavor and superfood nutritional profile. However, the plant's naturally wild and unruly growth habit has made it impractical for large-scale commercial farming. This challenge has kept the highly nutritious crop, native to the Andes region of South America, trapped between its wild origins and its commercial potential, even as global demand continues to rise.\n\nResearchers at the Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI), led by Professor Joyce Van Eck, have successfully overcome this barrier using CRISPR gene editing technology. By targeting the ERECTA gene, which regulates stem length in related crops like tomatoes, the collaborative team engineered goldenberry plants that are 35% shorter than their wild relatives. This new, compact growth habit makes the plant viable for commercial agriculture, as it allows for higher planting density, eliminates the need for trellising, and simplifies maintenance and harvesting. The team successfully edited two copies of the gene, a necessary step because the goldenberry is tetraploid, meaning it contains four sets of chromosomes.\n\nThe BTI team has already secured clearance from the USDA, confirming the engineered plants are free from plant pest regulations, and is now seeking FDA approval to allow growers to begin commercial production immediately. This work serves as a powerful demonstration of how gene editing can accelerate the development of improved varieties for minor crops that have been neglected by traditional breeding programs. The successful method—which could also be applied to other underutilized crops like groundcherry and passion fruit—aims to expand dietary diversity and create new opportunities for farmers by bringing highly nutritious, farmable varieties to the global food system.\n\nBiotech Updates is a weekly newsletter of ISAAA, a not-for-profit organization.

Perhaps you, Lightning McQueen and Iron Man are all dancing together in the Mos Eisley Cantina.\n\nSora is an app made by OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, which allows users to generate videos of up to 20 seconds through short text prompts. The startup previously attempted to steer Sora’s output away from unlicensed copyrighted material, though with little success, which prompted threats of lawsuits by rights holders.\n\nDisney announced that it would invest $1bn in OpenAI and, under a three-year deal perhaps worth even more than that large sum, that it would license about 200 of its iconic characters – from R2-D2 to Stitch – for users to play with in OpenAI’s video generation app.\n\nAt a time of intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of AI on the livelihoods of writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives, Disney stressed its agreement with OpenAI would not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nThe announcement was framed as an extraordinary opportunity to empower fans.\n\nThink of the “fan-inspired Sora short form videos”, as Disney called them in a press release – akin to taking an AI-generated version of a photo with Princess Jasmine at Disney World. OpenAI included screenshots of these kinds of videos in its press release, indicating how the two companies expect people to use the app’s new cast. Sora already allows users to generate videos that include their own likenesses.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, said the licensing deal would place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”.\n\nThey may even offer a chance at wide viewership, with some fan-made videos being displayed on the Disney+ streaming service, a move seemingly designed to compete with TikTok’s and YouTube Shorts’ infinite feeds, which themselves often include clips of popular TV shows and movies.",

    "fullText": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won nine awards, including game of the year, while newly announced games at the show include the next project from Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios\n\nThe Game Awards 2025: the full list of winners\n\nAt the Los Angeles’ Peacock theater last night, The Game Awards broadcast its annual mix of prize presentations and expensive video game advertisements. New titles were announced, celebrities appeared, and at one point, screaming people were suspended from the ceiling in an extravagant promotion for a new role-playing game.\n\nAcclaimed French adventure Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 began the night with 12 nominations – the most in the event’s history – and ended it with nine awards. The Gallic favourite took game of the year, as well as awards for best game direction, best art direction, best narrative and best performance (for actor Jennifer English).\n\nElsewhere, Hades II took best action game, Hollow Knight: Silksong won in best action/adventure and Arc Raiders won best multiplayer. There was a decent showing for the new(ish) Nintendo Switch 2, with Donkey Kong Bananza taking best family game and Mario Kart World scorching across the line with best sports/racing game.\n\nIt was also a night of big budget video game announcements. Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a spiritual successor to the classic Xbox series Knights of the Old Republic, was revealed with the original game director Casey Hudson at the helm. Developed by Arcanaut Studios, it’s a single-player narrative adventure set on the brink of major change for the galaxy.\n\nAnother returning classic was Tomb Raider, which is getting two fresh instalments – a remake of the 1996 original named Legacy of Atlantis, and a new adventure, Tomb Raider: Catalyst.\n\nA newcomer to the Divinity series of role-playing adventures was unveiled with a frankly gross trailer. Created by Larian Studios, maker of Baldur’s Gate 3, the game was teased by Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley who posted photos on social media showing a mysterious statue along with its coordinates in the Mojave desert.\n\nAn unexpected highlight was the lovely looking Coven of the Chicken Foot, a fantasy puzzle platformer from Wildflower Interactive, a new indie studio set up by Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley, who worked on both Uncharted and The Last of Us. You play an elderly witch called Gertie and a lumbering creature in what looks like an arthouse riff on The Last Guardian.\n\nThere was a new trailer for Capcom’s latest survival horror opus Resident Evil Requiem which showed the return of series favourite Leon S Kennedy, now sporting a floppy fringe and leather coat like some sort of emo super cop. He’ll be playable alongside FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, the characters experiencing parallel adventures with different special abilities.\n\nAmong dozens of other reveals was 4:Loop, a new co-op shooter from the makers of Left 4 Dead and JJ Abrams’ Bad Robot Games, featuring eternally cloned and re-cloned warriors trying to reclaim the world from alien invasion. Ontos is a sci-fi mystery from Frictional, creator of Soma, set in a repurposed hotel on the moon. Remedy Entertainment unveiled the sequel to its acclaimed sci-fi adventure Control; named Control Resonant, it takes place in a Manhattan reshaped by an invading cosmic force. Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio from members of the Apex Legends and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare teams showed off Highguard, a free-to-play raid shooter. And Wizards of the Coast materialised with Warlock, a dark single-player action-adventure set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe.\n\nThe Game Awards is a controversial and imperfect beast. But this will be remembered as a night in which an ambitious debut game from a small French studio, with a budget of less than $10m, took all the major awards, beating vastly expensive sequels such as Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yōtei. In a modern games industry of billion dollar takeovers and mass redundancies, we must grasp such positives where we can.",

Over the next two years, the plan is to “deploy” the chatbot to more than 5,000 public schools in an “AI-powered education program”.\n\nxAI’s Grok is more known for referring to itself as “MechaHitler” and espousing far-right conspiracy theories than it is for public education. Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "One of the most useful traits of Modularity done properly is Autonomy: modules - folders or versioned packages in a modular monolith, separately deployed microservices - are as independent from and as unaware of each other as possible. It has at least three important implications:\n\nWhen this ideal is achieved, we can have multiple people and teams working in parallel and independently, on various parts of the system. Different people and teams might be given responsibility for various modules and develop, test, deploy, maintain and extend them on their own, autonomously - with minimum to no input from other module owners. It then has tremendous implications on both productivity - as multiple streams of work are undertaken at once, in parallel - as well as maintainability and adaptability of our systems, since smaller, independent parts are easier to develop, test, understand, debug, modify, deploy and scale. Clearly then, it is something well-worth focusing on and striving towards.\n\nImplementation details of this Modularity ideal differ depending on whether we have a single unit of deployment (monolith) or multiple ones (services). In both cases though, it still mostly is about the universal Modularity principles. We will now explore how, when done properly, this approach enables parallel work, independent deployments and organization scalability, touching on various implementation details along the way. It also is the best moment to pose an essential in this context question:\n\nAre multiple deployment units (services) required to have parallel work, independent deployments and organization scalability?\n\nA properly modularized system allows many people and teams to work on its different parts in parallel, with little to no conflict. As we recall, one of the key features of a good module is being as independent as possible: having no or only a handful of dependencies, which are shallow and loose, not deep and tight. Only when this requirement is met, each person/team is able to work on different modules of a system without getting in the way of others. Occasionally, when to implement certain features or behaviors modules must exchange data or functionality, negotiations will be involved. But since this exchange is done properly through dedicated interfaces and types, it is fairly low effort to agree on a contract and then start implementation in a module A, knowing that module B will implement the established contract at some point. It might be mocked, faked or hardcoded at the beginning, not blocking module's A development.\n\nFrom a parallel work perspective, does it matter whether a module constitutes a folder or versioned package in a modular monolith or is a separately deployed microservice? Not really - assuming a simple approach where every person/team works on a single module, it is a secondary concern, how exactly modules are implemented. Their proper design - dependencies and data flow between modules - is the bottleneck for parallel work, not an implementation strategy (isolated files or processes). If modules have many opaque and tight dependencies - work is hard or even impossible to parallelize, no matter how many deployment units (services) there is.\n\nAs we are not fond of talking in vacuum here, we are going to illustrate these points with the help of an example. Expanding on the Curious Notes to the Interesting Quotes and People system from the previous post, let's consider the following cases:\n\nAs a reminder, in this system we have four modules: users, quotes, people and notes.\n\nSupport for a new authentication method - as the users module is responsible for users, managing their accounts and authentication/authorization, this is the only module where work needs to be done. Especially that in the UsersClient we had:\n\nreturning id of the currently signed-in (authenticated) user - it does not concern us how they got there. In this particular change case then, we have to:\n\nAllowing users to upload profile images - resembles supporting a new authentication method case. Changes required for this functionality are introduced in the users module alone. One thing that we should keep in mind is that other modules must be able to load and display these images. Fortunately, they are publicly available so it is really easy. The profileImageUrl field added to our public User type is all that is needed. It points to some kind of public (at least for profile images) media server. But even if the requirement was to not have it publicly available but private, we could just have something like this:\n\nallowing only signed-in (authenticated) users to get content of such images. But for the purpose of this example, we just go with the profileImageUrl field, containing publicly available URLs.\n\nDisplaying these images in various places of the application - requires changing the users' module contract slightly:\n\nThe profileImageUrl field is added to the User type that is defined in some shared/common module. Then, without waiting for the final implementation in the users module, other modules might temporarily hardcode this field value so that it points to the same image for all users or the users module might provide fixed-value implementation first, before starting the real one. In either case, people/teams responsible for different modules can collaborate in this minimalistic way to work fully in parallel - even when their work is highly dependent.\n\nSumming it up, a properly modularized system allows many people and teams to modify and develop its different parts in parallel, with little to no conflict and minimal coordination - irrespective of whether modules are folders, versioned packages or separately deployed services. Clearly then, multiple deployment units (services) are not required for people and teams to work autonomously and in parallel. Are they needed to support independent deployments?\n\nAs a properly modularized system has modules with the minimum and loose dependencies on other modules, it should follow that it is easy to deploy each of its modules independently. Is it?\n\nIn the microservices approach, each module is a separate service. As each module is more or less autonomous, only loosely coupled with other modules (services) and running in its own process piece of software, we have independent deployments out of the box - as long as each module dependencies adhere to the proper Modularity rules. Somebody (or some team) can work on a module and then just deploy their changes independently, not waiting for others and without breaking other modules. Of course, there still are possible problems that might emerge only at runtime. For example, forgetting or failing to respect API Contracts & Compatibility or producing Poison Messages: messages/requests that repeatedly fail to be processed by a consumer, leading to continuous retries and potentially blocking the processing of other messages/requests or even taking down the consumer and possibly the producer as well, if implemented incorrectly. But by and large, modules are mostly well isolated when they represent separate processes with their own runtimes.\n\nIn the modular monolith (modulith) approach, the main difference is that we have a single deployment unit and each module is a folder or versioned package, not a standalone process with its own runtime. In terms of development, it basically is the same - each module might be developed by a different person or a team. What mainly sets these approaches apart is how modules are combined into a system and deployed to the target environment. Let's follow the usual modulith development & deployment flow with the crucial assumptions reiterated.\n\nAs we can see, the details differ - single deployment unit (modulith) that glues together folders or versioned packages vs many deployment units (microservices) - but the process is fundamentally the same: different people/teams modify various modules simultaneously and then deploy them independently. In both cases, changes are deployed to an environment after git merge; in case of a failure or other unforeseen issues, changes are reverted using git revert.\n\nWith a modular monolith, deployments by default are sequential: there is only one deployment unit and when changes are merged into a single master/main branch, the following deployments are queued and block each other. We also have a single process risk - one, shared runtime means that there is a non-zero chance that change in module A may introduce a global bug that slows down, impedes or even kills the modulith process, blocking deployments of all other modules and making the whole system unavailable. With the right discipline and practices like solid code reviews, static analysis and automated tests it can be reduced to almost zero, but it will never be zero, it will always be there. But let's not forget that multiple services exchanging data over the network are not without their own set of runtime problems - mainly around API Contracts & Compatibility and Poison Messages. With multiple services there are multiple runtimes and that makes them by default more isolated; but taking all factors into consideration, it is not entirely so.\n\nIf we have not a few but hundreds of people and dozens of teams working on the modulith, sequential deployments will become problematic - it might then take hours to deploy changes. Especially considering the fact that some deployments (of modules) will be rolled back, if they prove to be problematic or contain not caught previously bugs. Above all, we should start with optimizing the build process itself, making it as fast as possible: caching dependencies, rebuilding only modules that have changed and so on. But once these optimizations are in place and the resulting build & deploy times are still not enough, there is at least one simple improvement to be made here.\n\nWe can simply batch deployments. Instead of building and deploying our modular monolith after every merge to the master/main branch, it is postponed a bit. We might for example build the modulith at most once every one to three minutes. In this way, multiple changes are batched into one build & deployment, reducing their frequency by a wide margin. Time-wise, it most likely is enough for very frequent changes - in the multiple merges into master/main per minute ballpark; it is extremely rare to witness a system doing more than few thousand merges per day - 1 merge per minute = 60 * 60 = 1440 daily. The tradeoffs are definitely that any given change must wait slightly more (delay) for its deployment and it distorts visibility into potential post-deployment problems a bit, since multiple changes are deployed at once (with microservices we are doing the same thing, but as separate processes). But to be fair, every change author should be vigilant and available during the deployment process, ready to test and rollback their change in case of any issues. It can easily be done independently, on the per module basis, by either git revert the change of a problematic module or downgrading its version in the modulith - depending on whether we have modules as folders or versioned packages.\n\nAs we have seen, multiple deployment units (services) are not required for independent deployments as well. It is true that they are given by default with many deployment units (services); in a single deployment unit (modulith) approach, they require more discipline and work to set up. But it is likewise possible to have them running smoothly in the modulith - mainly a few conventions and the right CI/CD setup are needed - and it can scale to hundreds of people and dozens of teams, working on a single modular monolith.\n\nAs we have established, pretty much the same level of parallel work and independent deployments could be achieved in both cases - single unit of deployment (monolith) or multiple ones (services). How do both approaches scale organizationally, as systems grow in complexity and the number of modules, developers and teams working on them?\n\nWith microservices, we might have as many deployment units (processes) as we want - there virtually are no limits. The only limiting factor is how much we are willing to spend on the infrastructure setup and maintenance. We can run 5, 10, 100, 1000 and more services - each representing just a single module. There is no ceiling when it comes to scalability here - from this simple perspective alone, microservices are the most scalable approach.\n\nWith a modular monolith, all modules live in a single, shared runtime and memory - there is a fundamental limit of how many of them there could be. The exact number depends on the used programming language and its runtime efficiency, average module size and its CPU & Memory requirements - the more resource-hungry modules are, the less of them there could be, since they all run in a single process; keeping in mind that most cloud providers offer machines with more than 100 GiB of Memory and 32 CPUs. Still, the fundamental limitation remains: once we have about a few hundred modules, it probably is the time to split things up into a few deployment units - not necessarily microservices, a few modular services will suffice. Granted, that it is rather rare to work on a system that even begins to approach a hundred modules and a similar number of teams working on it!\n\nSome people would add build times as another limitation of the modular monolith approach; I skipped it intentionally. Why? Because having modules as separately versioned packages allows to optimize it a lot - each module is built and released independently and it should not take long to create a single deployment unit out of ready-to-be-used packages. It takes more time when a modular monolith is built from scratch, for the first time - compiling/preparing each module directly from sources, but it rarely needs to be done. For the local development, we mostly operate on a single or a few modules and might just download already built versions. It is not going to be an issue unless we have something truly extreme - thousands or tens of thousands of modules.\n\nSumming it up, if we have up to about a few hundred modules, it does not really matter - both approaches scale equally well and arguably, most systems will never reach this scale. Objectively speaking though, after reaching a certain number of modules, we have to split things up a bit - there is no need for full-blown microservices but switching to a few modular services will be required, once this level of complexity is achieved.\n\nIt may seem like we have mostly talked about the backend part of a system. Is it any different for the Frontend/UI?\n\nIf we take a standard web-based application today, it is most likely built as SPA - single page application. We develop it in JavaScript or TypeScript, probably using a framework of React, Vue, Svelte or Angular type. In this context, all Modularity principles apply - we should likewise work on modules that are as autonomous and as loosely coupled as possible, exchanging data and functionality only through dedicated interfaces and types. In the same vein, modules might be just folders or separately versioned packages; likewise, when done correctly, they allow for parallel work, independent deployments and organization scalability.\n\nThere is the Micro Frontends idea, extending microservices approach to the Frontend/UI world: each module being an independent application. To be honest, I think it is rarely justified - even less often than microservices - and it introduces a great deal of avoidable complexity. In most cases, comparable levels of parallel work, independent deployments and organization scalability might be achieved simply by modularizing a single application, with independently deployable modules, as effectively as possible.\n\nAs we have seen, as long as we adhere to the proper Modularity rules, we enjoy a high degree of:\n\nIrrespective of whether our chosen architecture is modular monolith, microservices or something in between.\n\nIf we do not adhere to the proper Modularity rules, we suffer from:\n\nIrrespective of whether our chosen architecture is modular monolith, microservices or something in between.\n\nLet's then choose the proper Modularity path and enjoy the benefits of parallel work, independent deployments and organization scalability!",

Psychiatry, 26 November 2025\n\nVolume 16 - 2025 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1701751\n\nIntroduction: The present study provides novel insights into the psychological mechanisms linking social emotions and eating behaviors by integrating large-scale social media analysis with individual-level assessments.\n\nMethods: Two complementary approaches were employed: Study 1 analyzed 1,902 Weibo posts containing “diet” and “social” keywords through latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling and semantic network analysis to identify thematic structures and interactional patterns; Study 2 surveyed 1,199 participants (aged 18–33) using the Intuitive Eating Scale and self-reported social situation texts, applying Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and LASSO regression to identify language features of intuitive eating.\n\nResults: Study 1 revealed six psychological themes and a semantic framework connecting social–dietary interactions, health discourse, emotional states, and body image concerns, while Study 2 demonstrated that negatively valenced words (e.g., sensitive, tiring) were associated with lower intuitive eating, whereas positively valenced words (e.g., relaxed, positive) were associated with healthier eating patterns; moreover, negative emotion scores in social texts showed significant correlations with poorer intuitive eating (p < 0.05).\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion: These findings illustrate associations between social emotional expression and eating behaviors, highlighting implications for emotion-sensitive interventions and the design of healthier online social environments.\n\nEating is not merely a biological necessity but also a deeply psychological and social phenomenon. As a fundamental behavior for survival and adaptation, eating habits exert profound influence on both physiological and psychological functioning. Physiologically, a balanced diet sustains bodily homeostasis and promotes immune resilience, while imbalanced consumption—particularly of high-fat and high-sugar foods—can disrupt metabolic regulation and increase the risk of chronic conditions such as obesity and cardiovascular disease (1, 2). Psychologically, dietary quality plays a crucial role in mental well-being. Adherence to dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet has been associated with lower risks of depression and anxiety, suggesting that food choices also serve as pathways to psychological regulation (3). Thus, eating behaviors reflect not only physical needs but also underlying psychological dynamics.\n\nNotably, as inherently social beings, humans rarely make eating decisions in isolation. Eating often occurs within interpersonal contexts, where it functions not only to fulfill nutritional needs but also as a medium for social communication and emotional signaling (4, 5). Empirical research has revealed that social influences shape how much, what, and when people eat. Social norms, peer modeling, and group dynamics can alter food intake, particularly in contexts involving impression management or affiliation needs (6–8). For example, individuals may increase portion sizes when dining with close friends to express intimacy, yet restrict intake when eating with strangers to maintain self-control or social appropriateness (9, 10). Collectively, this evidence characterizes eating as a socially embedded practice that flexibly adapts to interpersonal contexts and relational demands.\n\nBeyond these behavioral adjustments, interpersonal interactions inherently elicit social emotions — defined as emotions whose object is other human beings and social interaction, such as pride, embarrassment, guilt, and belonging (11). In other words, social emotions are feelings that arise within or are directed toward our relationships with others. They play a pivotal role in guiding social behavior, including eating decisions. Thus, eating can be conceptualized not only as a socially embedded practice but also as an emotionally mediated one, where social emotions serve as the psychological link between interpersonal dynamics and dietary choices. In this sense, eating decisions are fundamentally shaped by emotions arising within social interactions.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, Social Cognitive Theory offers a useful framework for understanding how interpersonal environments influence eating behaviors, not only through direct behavioral modeling but also through emotional mechanisms. According to SCT, behavior is shaped by reciprocal interactions among personal factors, environment, and behavior itself (12). Within social eating contexts, observational learning (e.g., modeling others’ eating), self-efficacy (confidence in regulating intake), and social feedback (approval or disapproval from others) operate jointly to shape emotional experiences and subsequent food choices. For instance, social feedback can evoke emotions such as embarrassment or pride, which in turn influence self-regulation during eating episodes. Emotional states—emerging in or shaped by interpersonal interactions—can function as internal drivers or regulators of eating. Negative emotions such as anxiety, loneliness, or frustration may trigger maladaptive eating patterns, including emotional eating and binge eating (13, 14), while positive social emotions can promote adaptive self-regulation and enjoyment (15, 16). In line with emotion regulation theory (17), these processes suggest that individuals regulate eating behaviors partly to modulate affective states induced by social interaction. Thus, the pathway “social context – motional reaction – eating behaviors” reflects an integrated socio-emotional regulation loop.\n\nDespite this growing recognition of the emotion–eating link, much of the existing literature remains constrained by laboratory paradigms that isolate emotion from real-world social interactions (18). These studies often induce emotions experimentally and capture short-term changes in food intake, leaving unanswered how emotional experiences naturally unfold and are expressed in authentic interpersonal settings. Recent advances in text mining and natural language processing have enabled psychologists to infer emotions, personality traits, and well-being from linguistic data (19). These computational approaches make it possible to analyze large-scale, naturally occurring language and to capture subtle emotional dynamics that are difficult to observe in laboratory settings. However, few studies have applied such methods to examine how social emotions expressed in language relate to behavioral regulation, particularly in the domain of eating. With the rise of digital communication, social media platforms such as Weibo provide ecologically valid opportunities to examine how individuals spontaneously express and regulate social emotions. Unlike traditional experiments, these platforms capture the linguistic traces of genuine emotional experience in social life (20). A growing body of research has examined how social media use relates to psychological well-being, showing both benefits (social connection, emotional support) and risks (social comparison, body dissatisfaction) (21; 22). However, few studies have integrated these insights to explore how social emotions expressed online relate to eating behaviors.\n\nBuilding on these perspectives, the present study investigates how emotional experiences within social contexts are reflected in language and how such emotional expression relates to individual differences in eating behaviors. Specifically, we address two core questions: (1) What psychological and interpersonal themes emerge in naturally occurring discussions that link eating behaviors to social experience? (2) How do emotions expressed in social interactions relate to self-regulatory patterns in eating? To address these questions, we adopt a two-study design that integrates large-scale social media text mining with individual-level survey data, allowing us to link online discourse with eating behaviors. Study 1 explores the thematic structure and emotional patterns of social–dietary discussions on social media, providing a macro-level understanding of how social emotions are embedded in collective language use. Building upon these insights, Study 2 further examines, at the individual level, how social emotions influence intuitive eating behaviors through validated psychometric assessment and linguistic analysis.\n\nThe dataset for Study 1 was obtained from Sina Weibo, one of China’s most influential social media platforms, which hosts large volumes of user-generated content reflecting daily life interactions and thus provides ecologically valid naturalistic language data for examining social behaviors and affective states (23). Using a customized web crawler, 3028 publicly accessible posts containing the keywords “dietary behaviors” and “social interactions” were collected. All retrieved posts were drawn solely from publicly available content that users had made openly accessible on the platform. No private messages or restricted-access materials were included. To ensure privacy protection, only anonymized textual content and non-identifiable metadata were retained, in accordance with ethical standards for secondary analysis of public online data (24). Metadata included user pseudonyms, post texts, geolocation tags (country/province/city), and device types. To maximize data coverage, no a priori temporal restrictions were imposed; instead, posts were continuously collected until June 2024, which served as the data collection endpoint. After data cleaning procedures (removal of duplicates, advertisements, and irrelevant content) and standard text preprocessing (tokenization and stopword removal), 1902 valid posts were retained for analysis.\n\nStudy 2 employed an online questionnaire to collect both textual data and psychometric assessments. First, participants’ recent social experiences were elicited through open-ended questions requiring detailed descriptions of interpersonal interactions. Second, intuitive eating behaviors were assessed using the validated Chinese version of the Intuitive Eating Scale–2. A total of 1,314 adult volunteers were recruited via social media platforms. After rigorous quality control to exclude invalid responses (e.g., patterned or contradictory answers, completion time <120 seconds), 1,199 valid responses were retained. The final sample comprised individuals aged 18–33 years (M = 21.16, SD = 2.14), including 798 females and 401 males. All participants provided informed consent, and the study was conducted in accordance with institutional ethical review guidelines.\n\nTextual data were obtained from Weibo using a customized Python-based web crawler developed by the research team. The program was designed to systematically capture user-generated content while minimizing data loss and redundancy. This approach facilitates reliable and reproducible acquisition of naturalistic social media texts, which are well-suited for examining social and affective processes in everyday contexts.\n\nParticipants’ eating behaviors were assessed using the validated Chinese version of the Intuitive Eating Scale–2 (IES–2; 25). The Chinese adaptation was psychometrically validated in previous research, showing satisfactory reliability and construct validity across both college (26) and clinical samples (27), thus supporting its applicability in Chinese populations. The 23-item measure comprises four subscales: Unconditional Permission to Eat (6 items; α = .61), Eating for Physical Rather Than Emotional Reasons (8 items; α = .75), Reliance on Hunger and Satiety Cues (6 items; α = .78), and Body–Food Choice Congruence (3 items; α = .73). Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), with higher scores indicating stronger intuitive eating tendencies (25). The subscales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency in the present sample.\n\nAlthough the internal consistency of the “Unconditional Permission to Eat” subscale (α = .61) was lower than that reported in previous Chinese validation studies (α = .888–.919; 27), several contextual factors may account for this difference. First, our sample consisted of young adults from a non-clinical population, whose eating behaviors and self-perception of food restraint may be less stable than those of clinical or patient groups. Second, the items of this subscale are particularly sensitive to social and cultural norms around eating restraint, which may lead to greater within-group variability and reduced internal consistency in community samples. Given its theoretical relevance in representing a core aspect of intuitive eating, the subscale was retained for analysis. Nevertheless, the lower internal consistency may have introduced greater measurement error and attenuated observed associations between this dimension and other variables. Therefore, interpretations involving this subscale should be made with caution, and future research is encouraged to further refine its linguistic adaptation for diverse Chinese populations.\n\nTopic modeling is an effective method for identifying and organizing latent themes within large-scale text data (28). Among these methods, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) assumes that each document is composed of multiple latent topics, and each topic is characterized by a distinct word distribution (29). A key challenge in applying LDA lies in determining the optimal number of topics (30). An excessive number of topics may cause overfitting, whereas too few topics may oversimplify the text and obscure meaningful distinctions (31)To address this issue, the present study employed a perplexity-based optimization procedure, where lower perplexity values indicate a better-fitting model (32–34). The calculation of perplexity is shown in Equation 1.\n\nHere: p(wd)  denotes the ​generative probability of document d. Nd  represents the ​total number of words in document d.\n\nTo further process the text data, we employed semantic network analysis, a technique that reveals language structure by analyzing co-occurrence relationships between words (35). This method treats words or phrases as nodes and their co-occurrence as edges, constructing a semantic network for visualizing and quantifying underlying semantic structures. In this study, Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI; 36) was used as a key metric to measure the statistical association between word pairs. PMI effectively reduces the influence of high-frequency words while highlighting low-frequency but semantically significant word pairs. A higher PMI value indicates a stronger co-occurrence relationship. The definition of PMI is given in Equation 2.\n\nHere: P(x,y) is the probability of the two words co-occurring, while P(x) and P(y) represent the individual probabilities of each word occurring.\n\nLASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a statistical method that performs ​simultaneous variable selection and model shrinkage by imposing an L1​-norm penalty on regression coefficients (37). The regularization parameter λ, a critical hyperparameter in LASSO, governs the intensity of the penalty term and directly modulates the ​sparsity structure of the model. Optimal λ selection is typically implemented via ​cross-validation, which supports a balance between bias and variance and promotes generalization performance.\n\nStudy 1 was designed to identify core discourse themes surrounding “dietary behaviors” and “social interactions” on social media platforms and explore their latent associations with users’ mental health, affective states, and social engagement patterns. To achieve these objectives, we implemented a five-stage analytical pipeline (see Figure 1), structured as follows:\n\nFigure 1. Flowchart of the data processing steps in Study 1.\n\n1. Corpus Standardization: To ensure data quality, raw textual data underwent rigorous preprocessing. Posts containing fewer than 20 characters were excluded to preserve semantic validity. Remaining texts were tokenized using Python’s Jieba library, followed by removal of stopwords, punctuation, whitespace, and duplicate entries, yielding a structured analytical corpus.\n\n2. Latent Thematic Extraction: The LDA model was constructed using the LatentDirichletAllocation module in scikit-learn (Python). Model parameters were set as follows: α = 0.1 for the document–topic distribution and β = 0.01 for the topic–word distribution. The model was trained using a batch learning approach (learning_method=‘batch’) for up to 100 iterations (max_iter=100), with a fixed random seed (random_state=42) to ensure reproducibility. The optimal number of topics was determined by jointly considering the lowest perplexity.\n\n3. Dual-Coder Thematic Labeling: Two domain-trained graduate researchers independently derived theme labels by analyzing each theme’s top 20 keywords and 20 representative documents. Iterative discussions resolved coding discrepancies (38), culminating in consensus-based thematic nomenclature.\n\n4. Classification Consistency Validation: Two independent coders annotated 120 randomly sampled posts (39, 40). Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (41) quantified inter-rater agreement between LDA outputs and manual annotations, objectively evaluating theme robustness.\n\n5. PMI Network Analysis: To complement LDA’s semantic limitations, a co-occurrence network was constructed using the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) metric. Nodes were first selected based on word frequency (top 120 terms) and PMI values above the 75th percentile to ensure statistical relevance. Edge weights corresponded to PMI scores, and connections with weights below 0.1 were excluded to enhance interpretability. Community detection was conducted using the Louvain modularity optimization algorithm implemented in Gephi, which automatically classified nodes into modularity classes representing distinct semantic communities (42). Weighted degree was computed for each node to quantify its centrality within the network. Following this, both network metrics (e.g., modularity, degree centrality) and semantic coherence were jointly considered to retain 36 representative nodes and 215 statistically significant edges for final visualization.\n\nBuilding upon the emotional and thematic patterns identified in Study 1—particularly those highlighting the interplay between social emotions, stress, and dietary behaviors—Study 2 extends this line of inquiry to an individual behavioral level. Specifically, Study 2 systematically investigates the mechanistic links between social emotional states and intuitive eating behaviors, while identifying semantically salient markers associated with eating patterns through advanced text feature extraction. The three-stage analytical protocol (see Figure 2) unfolds as follows:\n\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of the data processing flow in Study 2.\n\n1. Affective Profiling via LIWC Lexicon: To quantify emotion-laden expressions in social discourse, we deployed the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC-22) software for automated sentiment annotation. This tool calculates standardized scores for ​positive affect (e.g., “joy,” “satisfaction”) and ​negative affect (e.g., “anxiety,” “loneliness”) by matching user-generated posts against its empirically validated emotion lexicon, establishing a quantifiable foundation for linking affective dimensions to intuitive eating outcomes.\n\n2. Multivariate Regression Modeling: A multiple linear regression model was implemented in SPSS 27 to assess the predictive validity of emotional variables. Specifically, LIWC-derived positive and negative affect scores served as core predictors, with the total score from the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) as the dependent variable. This approach disentangled the differential predictive strength of distinct emotional domains on eating behaviors.\n\n3. LASSO Regression for Semantic Marker Identification: To transcend limitations of conventional regression, machine learning-enhanced text mining was conducted: Python’s scikit-learn TfidfVectorizer converted raw texts into Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) matrices, prioritizing high-frequency lexical candidates; using the glmnet package in R, LASSO regression (43) was applied with IES-2 scores as the response variable and TF-IDF features as predictors. Optimal regularization parameters were selected via 10-fold cross-validation, retaining non-zero coefficient terms to pinpoint semantically critical markers of intuitive eating behaviors.\n\nThe optimal number of topics and thematic extraction results are illustrated in Figure 3 and Table 1. Based on the LDA model, the lowest perplexity was achieved when the number of topics was set to 6, indicating superior model fit under this configuration (29). The six extracted topics are as follows: ​Life Stress and Emotional Management, Gourmet Experiences and Media Interaction, Mental Health and Stress, Alumni Gatherings and Socialization, Social Anxiety and Image Management, Psychological States and Exercise Regulation. Each theme was labeled not only based on lexical co-occurrence patterns but also with reference to its underlying psychological meaning—for example, “Life Stress and Emotional Management” aligns with Lazarus’s stress and coping framework, while “Social Anxiety and Image Management” reflects self-presentation and social comparison processes. The top 20 keywords and corresponding document counts for each topic reflect users’ focal concerns and emerging trends in discussions related to social interactions and dietary behaviors.\n\nFigure 3. Trend of perplexity with varying number of topics.\n\nTable 1. Summary of thematic topics with top keywords and document frequencies from LDA topic modeling.\n\nMultidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis, implemented via the pyLDAvis package, visually represents the inter-topic relationships (44). The visualization of topic spatial distributions is depicted in Figure 4, where bubble labels correspond to topic indices, and bubble diameter scales proportionally to the document count within each topic. Taking Topic 1 as an exemplar, the right panel of Figure 4 displays the 30 most relevant terms for this topic, along with their proportional representation among all tokens (24.1%). (Detailed visualizations for other topics are provided in Supplementary Material 1) Inter-bubble distances reflect semantic associations between topics: proximate bubbles indicate thematic overlaps, while distant ones suggest content independence.\n\nFigure 4. Topic modeling visualizations generated with pyLDAvis in Python, showing the relationship between the number of topics and perplexity, inter-topic distances, marginal topic distribution, and the top 30 relevant terms (using Topic 3 as an example).\n\nThe consistency check of topic classification revealed that the Cohen’s Kappa coefficients between the LDA model and Researcher A and Researcher B were 0.470 and 0.450, respectively (both p <.001), while the coefficient between Researcher A and Researcher B was 0.504 (p <.001). These values fall within the range of moderate agreement (45) and are comparable to those typically reported in topic modeling or mixed-method semantic analyses (39), where κ values between 0.40 and 0.60 are generally considered acceptable given the interpretive nature of theme labeling (39, 46).This level of consistency may be attributed to the semantic multiplicity of the texts—for instance, a term like “stress relief” could be categorized under both Topic 1 (“Life Stress and Emotional Management”) and Topic 3 (“Mental Health and Stress”) due to its contextual relevance. Such overlap reflects the inherent ambiguity of user-generated content, in which emotional and behavioral expressions often span multiple domains. Future refinements could involve adopting hierarchical topic models or incorporating word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT) to capture semantic nuances more precisely and reduce coder uncertainty.\n\nThe network, comprising 36 key nodes and 215 edges, exhibited an average degree of 41.87 and a mean weighted degree of 49.19, indicating a relatively dense interconnection among high-frequency terms (network density = 0.341). The modularity coefficient (Q = 0.28) suggested a moderately clustered semantic structure, reflecting that while distinct communities emerged, substantial overlaps existed across social and dietary themes—a pattern typical of psychologically intertwined discourse. It was divided into four primary categories using modular processing, with each category visually distinguished by color, as shown in Figure 5. The blue nodes represent social-dietary interactions, highlighting the connection between food choices and social contexts, such as gatherings with friends and festive celebrations. The red nodes focus on health-related discussions, reflecting the role of social media in facilitating the exchange of health information, including topics on diseases, lifestyle habits, and dietary recommendations. The yellow nodes illustrate emotion-physiology linkages, emphasizing the interplay among diet, emotional regulation, physical activity, and weight management, encompassing aspects like stress relief, mood regulation, and healthy living practices. Lastly, the purple nodes center on body image–social anxiety, examining the relationship between social media use, self-perception, and the interplay between social anxiety and eating behaviors.\n\nFigure 5. Semantic network analysis of Weibo discussions related to social and dietary themes. The nodes in the picture are as follows: 1 - Food, 2 - Media, 3 - Photo, 4 - Body figure, 5 - Self - discipline, 6 - Gym, 7 - Social phobia, 8 - Consumption, 9 - Female, 10 - Delicacy, 11 - Emotion, 12 - Gathering, 13 - Social interaction, 14 - Make friends, 15 - Dine, 16 - Dinner party, 17 - Platform, 18 - Game, 19 - Obstacle, 20 - Life, 21 - Disease, 22 - Doctor, 23 - Nutrition, 24 - Patient, 25 - Social activity, 26 - Mood, 27 - Stress, 28 - Body, 29 - Exercise, 30 - Work and rest schedule, 31 - Diet, 32 - Mentality, 33 - Emotion, 34 - Regularity, 35 - Drink alcohol, 36 - Weight.\n\nBuilding upon the thematic and semantic findings in Study 1, Study 2 further explored how social-emotional expressions in interpersonal contexts relate to individual eating behaviors. Based on social text data from 1,199 valid participants, the study first quantified emotional indicators through sentiment analysis and conducted multiple linear regression analyses using the LIWC emotion scores and the total score of the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2). As shown in Table 2, the negative emotion score in social texts was significantly negatively associated with intuitive eating behaviors (β = -0.103, p = 0.023), indicating that individuals who express stronger negative emotions in social interactions are more likely to experience impaired intuitive eating abilities.\n\nTable 2. Regression coefficients of social emotional scores predicting intuitive eating.\n\nTo further identify key semantic markers related to eating behaviors, the study employed LASSO regression analysis using the glmnet package in R. LASSO regression introduces an L1​-norm penalty, which gradually shrinks the coefficients of less important variables to zero. The LASSO regression model yielded a cross-validated mean squared error (MSE) of 62.87 with an R² of 0.08. While the explained variance is modest, this level of performance is expected given the high-dimensional nature of linguistic data. In this context, the primary objective of LASSO regression was not to maximize predictive accuracy, but to identify linguistic features most strongly associated with intuitive eating scores. This feature selection approach aligns with established practices in psychological text-mining research, where interpretability and parsimony take precedence over raw prediction performance (47, 48). As the penalty parameter λ increases, most coefficients converge toward zero (as shown in Figure 6). The optimal regularization parameter λ was determined through cross-validation, ultimately retaining nine non-zero coefficient terms (as presented in Table 3). Among them, “sensitive,” “tiring,” “frustrated,” and “lonely” were negatively associated with intuitive eating scores, suggesting that expressions of these emotions may impair individuals’ self-regulation of eating. In contrast, “bored,” “anxious,” “shy,” “positive,” and “relaxed” demonstrated positively associated with intuitive eating scores, implying that moderate anxiety and a positive mindset may enhance cognitive control and promote healthier dietary behaviors. Notably, the unexpected positive associations of traditionally negative words like “bored”, “anxious” and “shy” may reflect individuals’ adaptive strategies of using dietary management to cope with social stress.\n\nFigure 6. Visualization of the effects of log(λ) on LASSO regression. (A) LASSO regression coefficients. (B) Mean squared error (MSE) across different λ values.\n\nTable 3. Key emotional words predicting intuitive eating scores.\n\nAcross the three analytical approaches, a convergent pattern emerged linking emotional experiences in social contexts with dietary behaviors. The topic modeling results revealed that users frequently discussed stress, emotional regulation, and body image concerns in relation to food and social interaction. The semantic network analysis further confirmed these interconnections, demonstrating that emotional, social, and dietary terms were densely intertwined and clustered around shared psychological constructs such as stress management and self-presentation. Extending these findings to individual-level data, the linguistic analysis identified emotion-related expressions that covaried with intuitive eating tendencies. Taken together, these results provide multi-level evidence that social-emotional dynamics play a central role in shaping both the discourse and behavioral dimensions of eating.\n\nThe present study provides novel insights into the psychological mechanisms linking social emotions and eating behaviors by integrating large-scale social media analysis with individual-level assessments. The findings reveal associative patterns between emotional expression in social contexts and self-regulatory aspects of eating. By combining topic modeling, semantic network analysis, and behavioral validation of emotion-related language, this research advances a multi-method framework for understanding how social-emotional processes are reflected in dietary discourse and behavior.\n\nThe structured analysis of six thematic categories indicated that emotional states frequently co-occur with eating-related discussions. The clustering of psychological themes—”Mental Health and Stress,” “Life Stress and Emotion Management,” and “Psychological States and Exercise Regulation”—illustrates that stress and emotion regulation are recurrent themes in public discourse surrounding diet. These findings are consistent with prior evidence that stress correlates with reduced healthy food intake and greater consumption of high-calorie foods (49, 50). Extending this evidence base, the present results suggest that such emotional dynamics are traceable within naturally occurring online language, highlighting the value of digital data for psychological inquiry.\n\nStudy 2 further supported this mechanism by showing that negative emotions expressed in social texts were significantly associated with lower intuitive eating. Words such as “tiring,” “frustrated,” and “lonely” were associated with weaker dietary self-regulation, echoing prior work linking negative affect and maladaptive eating behaviors (51–53). This convergence of online linguistic signals and offline self-reports underscores the reliability of emotion–diet associations across methodological contexts. Conversely, positive expressions such as “relaxed” and “positive” were linked to healthier eating behaviors, suggesting that supportive emotional climates can buffer against maladaptive eating patterns. Interestingly, certain words often coded as negative (“bored,” “anxious,” “shy”) showed positive associations with intuitive eating, highlighting the complexity of emotional regulation. This pattern may reflect a higher level of emotional awareness, in which individuals recognize and articulate their transient discomfort rather than avoiding it (54). From the perspective of reflective self-regulation, acknowledging mild social unease (e.g., boredom or anxiety) can prompt individuals to monitor internal states more deliberately, thereby engaging in more conscious food-related decisions (55). In this sense, such emotions may function as regulatory cues rather than risk factors, signaling opportunities for self-reflection and adaptive adjustment to eating behaviors. These results suggest that not all negative emotions are uniformly maladaptive, some may heighten self-awareness and promote more deliberate food choices.\n\nBeyond individual emotional states, the results emphasize the role of social environments and body image concerns in shaping eating regulation. The themes “Food Experiences and Media Interaction” and “Alumni Gatherings and Socialization” illustrate that both online sharing and offline social gatherings are associated with eating choices. While the mechanisms cannot be directly inferred from the topic modeling, prior research suggests that self-presentation, peer influence, and normative expectations are likely drivers of these associations (6, 8, 56). In particular, the relative isolation of the “Social Anxiety and Image Management” theme points to a distinct pathway, which may reflect a tendency toward restrictive eating as a coping strategy to manage social evaluation risks. This interpretation aligns with Social Identity Theory (57), which posits that individuals regulate their behaviors to maintain a favorable social identity and group acceptance, and with the Social Media Internalization Model (58), which highlights how internalized appearance norms derived from digital comparison processes shape body-related attitudes and eating behaviors. Taken together, these findings suggest that dietary regulation in social contexts is not only an outcome of individual emotional control but also reflects collective identity dynamics and social conformity pressures within both online and offline environments.\n\nWhile the psychological findings resonate with existing health behavior research (59–61), While the psychological findings resonate with existing health behavior research (59–61), this study makes a distinctive contribution by situating these mechanisms within the context of digital platforms. The semantic network analysis showed that health-related nodes (“Doctor,” “Disease,” “Patient”) coexist with social nodes (“Dining,” “Gathering”) and emotional nodes (“Stress,” “Body”), reflecting how health communication on social media is deeply interwoven with social bonding and emotional states. This hybrid structure can be better understood through the lens of social cognitive theory (62) and the social sharing of emotion framework (63). From a social cognitive perspective, online environments provide both observational learning cues and social reinforcement that shape individuals’ health-related behaviors. Users not only receive information about diet or exercise but also observe emotional expressions and social feedback that reinforce certain attitudes or practices. Meanwhile, the social sharing of emotion framework suggests that emotional disclosure—such as expressing stress or body concerns—serves to regulate affect and strengthen social bonds. The co-occurrence of emotional and health-related terms in the network thus reflects a collective coping mechanism, where individuals use social media to negotiate both personal well-being and social belonging.\n\nFrom a platform perspective, the identification of emotion-laden linguistic patterns related to eating behaviors suggests possible directions rather than direct interventions for supporting users’ emotional and dietary well-being. For example, digital health applications could be informed by digital behavior change intervention (DBCI) principles to help users recognize emotional stress and adopt healthier coping strategies. At the design level, platforms might explore ways to reduce content that reinforces body anxiety and to promote balanced, positive discussions about food and well-being. These directions fit within broader digital mental health frameworks, which emphasize supportive online environments and self-awareness rather than behavioral control (64).\n\nBeyond its practical relevance for digital health design, the present findings also carry theoretical significance. First, it applies and refines Social Cognitive Theory (12) within digital contexts, demonstrating that observational learning and social reinforcement mechanisms are not limited to offline interactions but are also salient in online environments, where peer influence, self-presentation, and social comparison processes are intensified (65, 66). This extension underscores how digital platforms serve as social learning environments that both mirror and magnify everyday behavioral modeling. Second, the study provides evidence that natural language on social media can serve as an observable marker of underlying psychological and emotional states. This aligns with emerging perspectives in emotional awareness (67) and reflective self-regulation frameworks, which posit that individuals’ capacity to articulate emotions linguistically reflects deeper levels of self-monitoring and behavioral control. By linking online emotional expression to offline eating behaviors, this work advances the integration of affective and behavioral dimensions in health psychology. Third, the research offers a methodological demonstration of integrating big data analytics (LDA topic modeling and semantic network analysis) with behavioral assessment. This framework highlights how computational methods can complement psychological theory to capture complex emotion–behavior dynamics in naturalistic digital environments.\n\nDespite these contributions, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the data from Study 1 were collected solely from Weibo, a Chinese platform, which may limit the generalizability of findings to other contexts. Cultural norms around emotional expression and eating behavior may differ substantially across societies, particularly between collectivist and individualist cultures. Future research should examine cross-cultural comparisons across platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok. Second, although LDA and LASSO offer powerful tools for identifying consistent associations between emotional expression and eating behaviors, these methods do not imply causality. The observed relationships should therefore be understood as correlational patterns rather than causal effects. To determine whether changes in emotional expression directly influence eating regulation, more rigorous longitudinal designs will be necessary. Third, the reliance on text data overlooks multimodal expressions—images and videos of food, exercise, and body image are highly salient in social media contexts and likely shape eating behaviors in ways not captured by textual analysis. Future studies should incorporate multimodal approaches using computer vision and multimodal deep learning models. Finally, although this study applied dictionary-based approaches for emotion detection, more advanced natural language processing models (e.g., BERT) could capture contextual nuances in emotion expression, improving cross-cultural applicability.\n\nThis study provides evidence that emotional expression in social contexts—both online and offline—is associated with young adults’ eating behaviors. By integrating large-scale social media analyses with individual-level assessments, the research highlights potential pathways through which social emotions may relate to eating regulation. The topic modeling and semantic network results shed light on the thematic structures linking diet, emotion, and social interaction, while linguistic patterns identified through LASSO regression suggest specific emotional expressions associated with intuitive eating. Collectively, these findings enrich theoretical understanding of the psychosocial processes connecting emotion, social interaction, and eating, and offer practical implications for fostering healthier digital environments. While these findings highlight meaningful associations between social emotion and eating behaviors, future research is needed to clarify the causal mechanisms underlying these links.\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusion of this article is not publicly available a protect participant confidentiality and privacy.

    "description": ": Rights groups say digital-only record is leaking data and courting trouble",
    "fullText": "Civil society groups are urging the UK's data watchdog to investigate whether the Home Office's digital-only eVisa scheme is breaching GDPR, sounding the alarm about systemic data errors and design failures that are exposing sensitive personal information while leaving migrants unable to prove their lawful status.\n\nIn a joint letter [PDF] to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), coordinated by the Open Rights Group, the signatories argue that the Home Office has failed to meet its data protection and equality obligations, despite rolling out a system that replaces physical proof-of-immigration status with a live, online record checked in real time. When that system breaks, they say, people are locked out of work, housing, travel, education, and essential services, with no meaningful fallback.\n\nThe groups cite a \"high volume\" of data errors linked to the eVisa scheme, which they say amount to both operational failures and serious data protection breaches. In one documented case referenced in the letter, the passport details, contact information, and immigration status of a Canadian citizen were wrongly disclosed to a Russian woman.\n\nOther failures have seen migrants locked out of their eVisa accounts, with no effective support from the Home Office and no clear way to escalate urgent issues. Because the scheme is digital-only, there is no physical document to fall back on when errors occur, leaving individuals unable to demonstrate their lawful right to live and work in the UK at critical moments.\n\nAt the heart of the complaint is the Home Office's Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), which the signatories describe as incomplete and misleading. The groups argue it misses obvious risks baked into a digital-only system, especially for older people, disabled users, and those who are digitally excluded, while brushing off the impact of stripping away all physical proof-of-immigration status in favor of real-time online checks.\n\nThe letter also takes aim at how biometric data is being handled, arguing that the DPIA glosses over the risks of using facial images for identity checks, automation, or sharing with third parties that might mash them up with other data. According to the groups, this omission undermines claims that privacy risks have been adequately assessed or controlled.\n\nCampaigners also challenge the Home Office's framing of the eVisa rollout as part of a \"digital-by-default\" transformation. Under the government's own definition, digital-by-default services are meant to remain accessible to those who cannot use them, but the eVisa scheme offers no option to opt out. Migrants without smartphones or reliable internet access are forced to rely on friends or family members to access their status, introducing additional risks such as coercion and loss of privacy that the DPIA does not address.\n\nSara Alsherif, migrants digital justice programme manager at the Open Rights Group, said: \"Since the rollout of the digital-only eVisa scheme, we've seen widespread data errors, inaccessible design, and persistent technical failures that are leaving migrants unable to prove their right to work, rent, study, travel, or access essential services.\n\n\"In its DPIA, the Home Office failed to assess the risks that a digital-only scheme brings, particularly for those who are vulnerable, older, or disabled. It is also misleading in its assessment of the scheme as digital by default. If the Home Office had identified some of these risks, migrants may not have experienced the same levels of distress and hardship that we have seen over the last year. The ICO must investigate.\"\n\nThe ball now sits with the ICO, which must decide whether the Home Office's push for a paperless immigration system complies with GDPR – or whether it has created a system that is both legally and practically unfit for purpose.\n\nAn ICO spokesperson, told us: \"We regularly engage with government departments, including the Home Office, to ensure that data protection obligations are met and potential risks are mitigated. We can confirm that we have received the letter outlining these concerns, and will carefully assess the issues raised before responding.\"\n\nThe Register has asked the Home Office to comment. ®",

    "fullText": "Megyn Kelly can’t believe Charlie Kirk was not named Time magazine’s Person of the Year.\n\nOn Thursday’s episode of “The Megyn Kelly Show,” the host fumed over the fact that the 2025 Person of the Year was not even a single person at all – but rather the architects of AI. She railed against the decision not to posthumously award Kirk with the distinction following his assassination in September.\n\n“It’s f–king AI. It’s AI architects,” Kelly said. “It’s not Charlie Kirk, which is so obvious – it’s as obvious as the nose on your face. And don’t tell me, detractors, ‘Oh, he was too controversial.’ That’s not it. They’ve gone for extremely controversial people and villains in the past. It’s always and often come down to people like Vladimir Putin, the Ayatollah. We’ve had very controversial people make it or almost make it. And not only did Charlie not get chosen, he wasn’t even one of the honorable mentions. Yeah, Putin won it in 2007.”\n\nShe added: “This is a thumb in the eye, and it’s genuinely wrong. Like, AI architects are not the most influential people of the year. To ignore what happened with Charlie Kirk in September and the worldwide revival of faith that followed his assassination is to ignore reality based on your own politics.”\n\nKirk was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. Tyler Robinson was later charged with the Turning Point USA founder’s assassination. Kirk is survived by his wife Erika and their two children.\n\nAlongside AI architects, others in the running for Person of the Year were President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope.\n\nThe post Megyn Kelly Fumes Over Charlie Kirk Not Being Named Time’s Person of the Year: ‘A Thumb in the Eye’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "A fingerprint discovered on the wrecked remains of Denmark’s ancient Hjortspring boat have helped unravel the long-standing mystery behind the Scandinavian plank canoe’s origin.\n\nThe wreck site of the boat, thought to have carried 80 passengers, was first discovered on the Danish island of Als and first excavated in the early 20th century.\n\nArchaeologists believe it likely belonged to warriors who attacked the island and were defeated, but where these people came from, remains unknown.\n\nUntil now, several theories have been proposed about the boat’s origin over the past 100 years, with some suggesting its crew likely came from northern Germany or another part of modern-day Denmark.\n\nIn a new study, researchers analysed previously unstudied caulking and cord materials found with the boat as well as a partial fingerprint, which points to the 2,400-year-old boat’s likely area of origin.\n\n“Our scientific analysis of the boat's caulking material gives us the first major new clue in over a century,” researchers wrote in the study published in the journal PLOS One.\n\n“Fingerprints like this one are extremely unusual for this time period. It is great to have found a direct connection with one of the people who used this ancient boat,” they wrote.\n\nThe latest analysis revealed that the caulk was made up of mainly animal fat and pine pitch.\n\nSince Denmark did not have any significant pine forest cover during this time, scientists suspect one of the coastal areas along the Baltic Sea to the east, which had pine forests, may have been the origin site of the boat.\n\nBut if this were the case, the boat would likely have travelled a long distance over the open ocean to reach the island of Als, suggesting that the attack was organised and premeditated.\n\n“The boat was waterproofed with pitch from pine trees, which were rare in both Denmark and northern Germany during the first millennium BC,” scientists wrote.\n\n“We argue that this means the boat and its crew most likely came from further east along the shores of the Baltic Sea where pine forests were more abundant,” they explained.\n\nThe new materials found on the boat were dated to the 4th or 3rd century BC, in line with previous datings of wood from the Hjortspring site.\n\nScientists also found a partial human fingerprint in a part of the caulking material, which they suspect could have been left by one of the crew members.\n\nThis likely provides “a direct link to the seafarers of the ancient vessel”, researchers say.\n\n\"New analysis of Scandinavia's oldest plank boat brings us a step closer to solving the 100-year-old mystery of the ancient boat's origins,” they wrote.\n\n“Using cutting-edge scientific methods, researchers have zeroed in on the Baltic Sea Region as the most likely source for the circa 2,400-year-old boat, while also discovering a fingerprint left by an ancient seafarer in the tar used to waterproof the vessel,” scientists added.\n\nThe latest findings bolster the belief that the boat was used by a small army of invaders who attacked the island of Als in southern Denmark over 2,000 years ago.\n\n“The invaders were defeated and the local defenders sunk the boat into a bog as an offering to give thanks for their victory,” researchers wrote.\n\n“Ever since the boat was excavated from the bog in the early 1920s, the question of where the invaders came from has been an open mystery,” they said.",

She had faithfully repaid both her personal loans and the $50,000 her parents had taken out under Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students to help fund her education.\n\nAt 29 years old, Sarah told her parents she planned to make her final few payments and close the chapter on student debt. But instead of celebrating, her parents dropped a bombshell: they had consolidated the Parent PLUS loans taken out for her and her siblings into one big loan. Her monthly payments, it turned out, had been covering not just her share, but everyone else's, too.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\n“They kind of just like dropped the bombshell, like, ‘Oh, well, this happened… to make our payments lower,'” Sarah told personal finance experts Dave Ramsey and Rachel Cruze on “The Ramsey Show.”\n\nRamsey quickly jumped in. “No, no, no,” he said. “You did not make an obligation to pay your siblings' part. You made a promise to pay your part.”\n\nSarah explained that she had been paying her parents $1,000 a month for nearly eight years–money she believed was going toward her $60,000 portion of the Parent PLUS loans. But with her parents combining everything into one pot, she was suddenly on the hook for loans that were never hers.\n\nRamsey encouraged her to take a clear-eyed look at the numbers. “We’re talking about 96 months that you paid $96,000, including 7% interest,” he said. “That means I don't owe anymore.

    "title": "McDonald's pulls controversial Christmas commercial within days of being uploaded: 'Offensive from every angle'",
    "description": "\"The entire tone of the ad was stupid and insensitive.\"",
    "fullText": "Many people remember Coca-Cola's ill-conceived and poorly received AI-generated Christmas ad in 2024, largely due to the vocal backlash that followed.\n\nBut as Futurism reported, McDonald's either missed the memo or forgot about it, leading to a wave of negative feedback.\n\nAccording to Futurism, McDonald's \"decided to get in on the corporate slopfest\" for a Christmas ad; \"AI slop\" is a pejorative neologism used to describe low-quality AI content.\n\nMcDonald's has released an AI-generated Christmas ad\n\nThe studio behind it says they 'hardly slept' for several weeks while writing AI prompts and refining the shots — 'AI didn't make this film. We did'\n\nComments have been turned off on YouTube pic.twitter.com/Es5ROvI7n2\n\n— Culture Crave (@CultureCrave) December 8, 2025\n\nThe A.V. Club observed that the spot, titled \"The Most Terrible Time of the Year,\" depicted a string of holiday mishaps and was \"immediately and widely despised\" upon its release.\n\nMedia coverage of the initial McDonald's AI advertisement emphasized its poor quality, citing \"key tells\" such as a lack of continuity, and likening it to a \"visual seizure.\"\n\nRemarkably, the ad managed to generate vocal backlash despite failing to accrue many views after it was uploaded. McDonald's initially turned off commenting on the YouTube advertisement before delisting it completely — though some users saved and shared copies beforehand.\n\nAlthough the use of generative AI and the resulting poor quality of the spot were social media's biggest objections, the advertisement's negative framing didn't resonate either.\n\n\"It's not even so much that the AI was bad as the entire tone of the ad was stupid and insensitive so the slop on top just made it offensive from every angle,\" one person tweeted.\n\nMcDonald's ultimately made the advertisement private, effectively withdrawing it. The creative team behind the clip issued a statement defending the ad, claiming \"up to 10\" of their \"in-house AI and post specialists\" worked so hard generating AI results and editing them together that they \"hardly slept.\"\n\nDo you worry about robots taking away our jobs?\n\nYes — but it will create new ones too\n\nPossibly — but not significantly\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThat statement has been taken down as well after many users on X derided it and felt it only stood as further indictment on how much more the claim of sleepless nights working on the AI ad indicates they should have shot or animated a normal commercial instead.\n\nOne of the biggest objections to the advance of generative AI is its impact on workers in creative fields, like art, publishing, and music.\n\nMcDonald's is a massive, powerful corporation with global reach, and consumers saw their use of AI in a holiday ad as lazy and miserly, perhaps an attempt to avoid paying human creators.\n\nWhile valid worries about AI's potential to take jobs are part of the issue, they're far from its sum, and there are numerous beneficial uses of AI, such as identifying potential health problems and other scientific patterns across massive volumes of data.\n\nGenerative AI is a nascent technology, and details like its environmental toll are still being assessed. However, it's undeniable that AI data centers are detrimental to the environment. Their excessive use of public energy costs has rapidly driven electricity bills skyward, for one thing.\n\nPower isn't the only thing data centers consume — all of that computing generates heat, and these facilities strain and potentially contaminate water resources in their vicinity, destroying locals' quality of life.\n\nMajor players in the AI field, like OpenAI and Amazon, have been less than transparent about these public costs.\n\nAt the same time, experts have warned that an \"AI bubble\" could wreak havoc on the economy, a concern even Google's CEO acknowledged was warranted.\n\nMcDonald's acted quickly to withdraw the ad under intense scrutiny, ostensibly acknowledging the ad was a mistake.\n\nThe chain of events, however, was an excellent example of the power of public pressure to rapidly effect corporate change.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee executed Harold Wayne Nichols by lethal injection Thursday in Nashville for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nNichols, 64, had confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\n“To the people I've harmed, I'm sorry,” Nichols said in his final statement. Before Nichols died, a spiritual adviser prayed over him in the execution chamber and the two recited together the 23rd Psalm and the Lord's Prayer. At several points, they teared up and their voices became strained. After the final “Amen,” the adviser, J.R. Davis, continued talking quietly, with Nichols nodding along.\n\n“Go in peace, my friend. I love you,” Davis told Nichols.\n\nNichols was strapped to a gurney with a sheet pulled up to just above his waist and a long tube running from an adjoining room to an IV inserted on the inside of his elbow. There was a spot of blood near the injection site. At one point he took a very heavy breath and his whole torso rose up. He then took a series of short, huffing breaths that witnesses said sounded like snorting or snoring. Nichols’ face turned red and he groaned. His breathing then appeared to slow, then stop, and his face became purple before he was pronounced dead.\n\nNichols' sister, Deborah Perry, watched the execution from a witness chamber and cried quietly but did not speak.\n\nNichols’ attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to issue a stay of the execution on Thursday.\n\nPulley's sister, Lisette Monroe, had wanted to be present for the execution but became too overwhelmed, her husband and Pulley's brother-in-law, Jeff Monroe, told media afterwards. He read a statement that said the family “was destroyed by evil” the night Pulley was killed.\n\n“Taking a life is serious, and we take no pleasure in it,” he said. “However, the victims, and there were many, were carefully stalked and attacked. The crimes, and there were many, were deliberate, violent, and horrific.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols' execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she'll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nPulley, who was 20 when she was killed, had just finished Bible college and was attending school in Chattanooga to become a paralegal, Jeff Monroe said.\n\n“Karen was bubbly, happy, selfless, and looking forward to the life before her,” he said.\n\nNichols' attorney, Debbie Drew, also spoke after the execution, saying her client had turned his life over to God after speaking to Pulley's mother decades ago, shortly after he was sentenced. His execution “sent the message that no one can rise beyond the crimes they committed decades earlier and that redemption deserves no mercy,” she said.\n\nDavis said after the execution that he had known Nichols for a decade as part of a prison men's group and believes that Nichols' remorse and spiritual transformation were genuine. Davis said Nichols committed “horrible crimes. But killing to teach people not to kill just doesn't make sense.”\n\nNichols had seen two previous execution dates come and go. The state earlier planned to execute him in August 2020, but Nichols was given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany states have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs as anti-death penalty activists have put pressure on drug companies and other suppliers. Between the shortages and legal challenges over botched executions, some states have moved to alternative methods of execution including a firing squad in South Carolina and nitrogen gas in Alabama.\n\nIncluding Nichols, a total of 46 men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the U.S.\n\nCorrects that Pulley was a student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nReporter Adrian Sainz contributed from Memphis, Tennessee.",

    "description": "An AI agent hacked Stanford's network for 16 hours and outperformed human pros, all while costing far less than their six-figure pay.",
    "fullText": "For 16 hours, an AI agent crawled Stanford's public and private computer science networks, digging up security flaws across thousands of devices.\n\nA study published Wednesday by Stanford researchers found that their AI agent, ARTERMIS, placed second in an experiment with 10 selected cybersecurity professionals. The researchers said the agent could uncover weaknesses that humans missed and investigate several vulnerabilities at once.\n\nRunning ARTEMIS costs about $18 an hour, far below the average salary of about $125,000 a year for a \"professional penetration tester,\" the study said. A more advanced version of the agent costs $59 an hour and still comes in cheaper than hiring a top human expert.\n\nThe study was led by three Stanford researchers — Justin Lin, Eliot Jones, and Donovan Jasper — whose work focuses on AI agents, cybersecurity, and machine-learning safety. The team created ARTEMIS after finding that existing AI tools struggled with long, complex security tasks.\n\nThe researchers gave ARTEMIS access to the university's network, consisting of about 8,000 devices, including servers, computers, and smart devices. Human testers were asked to put in at least 10 hours of work while ARTEMIS ran 16 hours across two workdays. The comparison with human testers was limited to the AI's first 10 hours.\n\nThe study also tested existing agents, which lagged behind most human participants, while ARTEMIS performed \"comparable to the strongest participants,\" the researchers said.\n\nWithin the 10-hour window, the agent discovered \"nine valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate,\" outperforming nine of 10 human participants, the study said.\n\nSome of the flaws had gone unnoticed by humans, including a weakness on an older server that testers could not access because their browsers refused to load it. ARTEMIS bypassed the issue and broke in using a command-line request.\n\nThe AI worked in a way humans could not, the researchers said. Whenever ARTEMIS spotted something \"noteworthy\" in a scan, it spun up additional \"sub-agents\" to investigate in the background, allowing it to examine multiple targets simultaneously. Human testers had to do this work one step at a time.\n\nBut the AI isn't flawless. ARTEMIS struggled with tasks that required clicking through graphical screens, causing it to overlook a critical vulnerability. It is also more prone to false alarms, mistaking harmless network messages for signs of a successful break-in.\n\n\"Because ARTEMIS parses code-like input and output well, it performs better when graphical user interfaces are unavailable,\" the researchers said.\n\nAdvances in AI have lowered the barrier to hacking and disinformation operations, allowing malicious actors to enhance their attacks.\n\nIn September, a North Korean hacking group used ChatGPT to generate fake military IDs for phishing emails. A report from Anthropic in August found that North Korean operatives used its Claude model to obtain fraudulent remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies — a tactic that gave them insider access to corporate systems.\n\nThe same report also said a Chinese threat actor used Claude to run cyberattacks on Vietnamese telecom, agricultural, and government systems.\n\n\"We are seeing many, many attacks,\" Yuval Fernbach, the chief technology officer of machine learning operations at software supply chain company JFrog, told Business Insider in a report published in April. He added that hackers have been using AI models to extract data, shut systems down, or manipulate a website or tools.",

    "fullText": "British Airways passengers spent more than nine hours on a transatlantic flight that ended up back where it started.\n\nWednesday's Flight 243 took off from London Heathrow Airport at 1:22 p.m. and was supposed to land in Mexico City around 11 hours later.\n\nHowever, five hours into the journey, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner turned around over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIt had already passed Greenland and was only about 150 miles off the coast of Canada's Nunavut territory, according to data from Flightradar24.\n\nThe plane then headed back across the ocean, arriving in London just after 10 p.m.\n\nThe airline said in a statement that the diversion was due to an unspecified technical issue.\n\n\"The flight landed safely and customers disembarked normally following reports of a technical issue with the aircraft. We've apologised to our customers for the delay, and our teams are working to get their journeys back on track,\" the statement said.\n\nIt can be frustrating for passengers when they're diverted to their origin — a so-called flight to nowhere — but often it's the best course of action.\n\nReturning to Heathrow, BA's main hub, makes it easier for the airline to rebook passengers on alternative flights and fix any problems with the aircraft.\n\nDiverting elsewhere might have also left the plane and crew out of place, disrupting the airline's schedule. Plus, a stopover in Canada or the US may have caused the crew to reach their maximum working hours.\n\nWhen BA Flight 243 turned around, its closest airport was Iqaluit in northern Canada, less than 300 miles away.\n\nSome flights have diverted to this remote town in the past, but it can ultimately be more disruptive.\n\nLast year, an Air France flight diverted to Iqaluit after a burning smell was detected in the cabin.\n\nThe pilots declared an emergency, and a different plane was rerouted to rescue the passengers. It was originally scheduled for another flight, so that had to be canceled. Passengers were then taken to New York, where they were rebooked onto other flights to reach their intended destination of Seattle.\n\nUltimately, it depends on how urgent the diversion is, since safety is the top concern.\n\nHowever, if possible, returning to the flight's origin can be the simplest option for both passengers and the airline.",

    "description": "Barak Turovsky said that if a company wants to integrate AI on a software level, it needs someone with a different kind of expertise.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Barak Turovsky, the former Chief AI Officer at General Motors, based in Silicon Valley. He also held executive roles at Google and Cisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have worked on AI and LLMs since 2014 — way before they became the hottest thing on Earth.\n\nI'm an ex-Google AI exec who led the first scaled deployment of LLMs and Deep Neural Networks with Google Translate. I also worked as the Chief Product and Technology Officer at a computer vision AI startup, and as the VP of AI at Cisco.\n\nGeneral Motors approached me for the Chief AI Officer role while I was at Cisco, and it felt like a great crash course on using AI to develop physical products. The role no longer exists because I left after GM restructured its software and AI organization; however, until November, I reported to the head of software engineering, who reported to the CEO.\n\nSome people ask, \"Do you really need a dedicated AI officer?\"\n\nLet's ignore the title because you can call it different names, but I do believe successful AI implementation requires someone in leadership to drive that change, as well as commitment from the top.\n\nFunctional business leaders, such as the CTO or CIO, may have little or no understanding of AI. If you want to integrate AI on a software level, you need someone with a different kind of expertise.\n\nTraditional large companies have powerful executives who want to own the benefits of scaling AI, but not necessarily the responsibility. Therefore, someone with deep AI knowledge is needed to direct the traffic.\n\nI like to use a restaurant analogy to break it down.\n\nThe analogy is based on three primary resources that create products, or dishes. The first resource includes the kitchen equipment, or the AI infrastructure and models necessary to build AI solutions.\n\nThe next can be thought of as the ingredients. It's the data or internal assets used to train and run AI solutions. The last one is talent, or the restaurant staff. You need expertise at different levels — busboys, short-order cooks, sous chefs, and master chefs for the really gourmet restaurants.\n\nThe complexity of creating the final product depends on the company's needs, specifically whether the restaurant needs to prepare the food internally. For very advanced, cutting-edge models, which can be thought of as the main course at a gourmet restaurant, companies often need to develop their own AI solutions because standard versions may not perform the required functions.\n\nThink of the CAIO as the master chef. They need to make sure all the different pieces run smoothly. If you are in an industry that requires cutting-edge solutions, you also need to spend a lot of time making sure that the hardest output — a.k.a. the main dish — comes out just right.\n\nThe hardest and most important part of the job is securing top talent. Vendors will tell you that their toaster ovens can pop out a French soufflé in 15 minutes. Yet your ingredients will consistently arrive late, of dubious quality, and in incorrect amounts. Your customers will come in, declare they are hungry and want to eat the whole menu, and then leave mid-meal without paying.\n\nThe specifics of each role vary. At GM, I worked on a cutting-edge area because AI for physical products, like cars, is largely untouched and getting a lot of traction.\n\nThere are three buckets of what a chief AI officer should do. First is AI talent management. I focused a lot on hiring a top-tier team, which is very important because the moment you enter a novel space, you have a small sliver of talent. They need to be motivated and flexible because you're still mapping out those areas.\n\nThen, you need to create a culture of innovation for the company in general. You need to work with internal stakeholders who might be used to doing things in a certain way, but need to change because of AI.\n\nYou also need to create organizational change, which starts with mapping the needs and players of your organization. You have people who are AI enthusiasts and skeptics. In a large organization, it's not always easy to identify them. You need to create a top-down and bottom-up framework, which includes clear goals from the top.\n\nIn every function, you need to identify champions, and you need to nurture and empower them. The CAIO can't do all the magic while everyone else just sits there.",

    "description": "An internal memo, obtained by Business Insider, assessed Microsoft's deployment of cutting-edge GPUs.",
    "fullText": "As Nvidia works to install some of its newest chips in Microsoft data centers, an employee at the GPU giant observed in early fall that Microsoft's cooling approach at one facility seemed \"wasteful.\"\n\nNvidia has been deploying its GB200 Blackwell architecture at Microsoft and other tech giants as demand for compute to train and run AI models surges.\n\nBlackwell, announced in March 2024, is roughly twice as powerful as its predecessor, Hopper, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at launch. GB200 is part of an earlier wave of Blackwell deployments, with the GB300 generation now available.\n\nIn early fall, an internal email sent by a staffer on the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team described one Blackwell installation of server racks for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner and largest investor.\n\nThe email described the setup of two GB200 NVL72 racks, each of which houses 72 Nvidia GPUs. The setup uses liquid cooling technology, given the heat generated by multiple GPUs operating closely in tandem.\n\nThe staffer wrote that Microsoft's \"cooling system and data center cooling approach for their GB200 deployment seems wasteful due to the size and lack of facility water use, but does provide a lot of flexibility and fault tolerance,\" according to the memo.\n\nWhile liquid cooling is used for the servers, data centers also use a second, building-level system to expel heat from the facility, according to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California.\n\nThe Nvidia employee may have been referring to a building-level system that uses air-cooling instead of water, explained Ren, who studies how data centers use water and other resources.\n\n\"This type of cooling system tends to be using more energy,\" he said, \"but it doesn't use water.\"\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson described a cooling setup consistent with Ren's two-phase explanation.\n\n\"Microsoft's liquid cooling heat exchanger unit is a closed-loop system that we deploy in existing air-cooled data centers to enhance cooling capacity on first and third-party platforms,\" the Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.\n\n\"These systems ensure we maximize our existing global data center footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimizing power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, energy and water use in data-center cooling have become flashpoints globally, prompting pushback in some regions where new facilities are being built.\n\nRen noted that because data centers can use air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid system at the building level, \"there's a trade-off\" between resources.\n\nAir cooling requires more energy, but can \"address some of the public concerns with water consumption — because water is something people can really see,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies are profit-driven,\" he added, \"they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost.\"\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, said it intends to be \"carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste\" by 2030.\n\n\"We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centers and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe internal email from the Nvidia staffer described some logistical hiccups that occurred during the Blackwell installation in early fall, which can be typical in the early deployment of new data center hardware.\n\n\"Onsite support for this activity was a necessity,\" the staffer wrote. \"Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation is usually performed.\"\n\nAdditionally, the handover processes between Nvidia and Microsoft \"required a lot more solidification than what was performed before arrival.\"\n\nStill, the memo suggested Blackwell's production hardware quality had improved compared to early samples.\n\nThe email said GB200 NVL72 production hardware \"has good quality\" compared to the qualified samples sent to customers for early testing. Both racks had a 100% pass rate on certain compute performance tests.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that its Blackwell systems \"deliver exceptional performance, reliability, and energy efficiency for a wide variety of computing applications.\"\n\n\"Our customers, including Microsoft, have successfully deployed hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GB200 and GB300 NVL72 systems to meet the world's growing need for artificial intelligence,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "title": "Ex-Meta staffer nicknamed 'coding machine' says the best engineers aren't on LinkedIn — but they're special cases",
    "description": "Michael Novati , a former Meta principal software engineer, said the names of the best of the best engineers are \"nowhere\" online.",
    "fullText": "LinkedIn is full of corporate braggarts. But don't expect the best engineers to flaunt their success on the platform — or even have an account, according one former Meta employee.\n\nMichael Novati spent almost eight years at Meta, back when it was still called Facebook and hadn't yet doubled down on AI. He reached the rank of principal software engineer and earned the nickname \"coding machine.\"\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, host Steve Huynh asked Novati about his claim that the top five engineers aren't on LinkedIn. Novati stood by it.\n\n\"When I was at Facebook, the top engineers were like, 'If you had a LinkedIn account, people would be wondering if you're job hunting,'\" he said.\n\nNovati said these engineers don't need to publicly job hunt because of tech's extensive recruiting arm, which he called the \"secrets of the industry.\"\n\n\"There are very senior, very highly paid recruiters that work at the top companies who have very strong long-term social relationships with a lot of top engineers,\" he said.\n\nHow do these engineers and recruiters meet? Novati gave the example of an engineer who spends a week doing campus recruiting at Stanford, bonding with the company's recruiter in the process.\n\nHe referred to these as the \"secret backroom dealings of Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"These engineers' names are nowhere, but they are the ones that are the most desirable by these recruiters,\" he said. \"The $100 million engineer is not on LinkedIn with a tagline that's like, #100millionengineer.\"\n\nTech recruiting has long been a large, lucrative industry. Big Tech companies both employ in-house recruiters and outside agencies to stay close to key talent.\n\nMeanwhile, talent is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly in the field of AI. Meta shelled out large contracts for its Superintelligence Labs, poaching engineers from its competitors.\n\nSometimes CEOs even get involved. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly made a list of the top AI talent to poach. OpenAI's chief research officer said that Zuckerberg hand-delivered soup to an employee he was trying to recruit.\n\nOne AI worker told Business Insider they got a personal call from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, pitching them to join the company. They accepted.\n\nBeing offline may not be the golden key to tech recruiting, though. These top-tier engineers are a \"specific case,\" Novati said on the podcast.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that your strategy should be: delete LinkedIn and all the offers will come,\" he said.\n\nIt's a rarified class, Novati said, but one that stays away from all semblances of personal branding.\n\n\"I don't know any of those top engineers, who get special equity grants and special dinners with Bezos or whatever stuff like that, who have big personal brands,\" he said.",

    "description": "Americans are deeply skeptical of President Donald Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, though he is shoring up support",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Americans are deeply skeptical of President Donald Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, though he is shoring up ​support among his core Republican followers who have long focused on the case, a ‌new Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nThe poll, completed on Monday, found that most Americans believe Trump's administration is covering up information about ‌the late sex offender, including his 2019 death and his ties to rich and powerful people, and do not believe Trump's claim that he was unaware of Epstein's alleged trafficking of teenage girls when the two were friends decades ago.\n\nOnly 23% of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling the ⁠ongoing scandal, the poll found, while ‌52% disapprove.\n\nHowever, the poll found he appears to be easing the concerns of his supporters: 53% of Republicans said they approved of the way he was ‍handling the issue, up from 44% last month. That is still well below the 85% approval rating Trump enjoys overall among Republicans.\n\nThat could prove crucial. Trump stoked conspiracy theories about Epstein before he returned to the ​White House this year, and prominent supporters have accused his administration of a cover-up.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats ‌in Congress defied Trump last month and passed a law requiring the Justice Department to release documents by December 19 from its long-running investigation into Epstein.\n\nThe online poll of 4,434 U.S. adults, conducted December 3 through December 8, found lingering suspicion about the U.S. government's role.\n\nSome 62% of those surveyed, including 56% of Republicans, said they believed the government is hiding information about Epstein's death, ⁠which was ruled a suicide, in a Manhattan jail in ​2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges.\n\nAn even ​higher proportion - 70% - said they thought the government is hiding information about people who may have participated in the late financier's alleged sex trafficking of teenage girls, ‍including 62% of Republicans.\n\nAnd only ⁠18% said they thought it was likely that Trump did not know about Epstein's alleged crimes before they were made public. Among Republicans, that figure was 34%.\n\nTrump has said ⁠he was not aware of Epstein's activities, and says he broke off their friendship before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 ‌to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution.",

    "description": "From making real estate investing more attainable to developing 500-square-foot homes to fit in your backyard, here's why these rising stars of real estate are the ones to watch in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Brick-and-mortar business has long been the foundation of real estate — figuratively and literally. But as the industry adapts to new technologies and rapidly changing market conditions, new leaders are stepping in to meet unique new challenges.\n\nEach year, Business Insider highlights up-and-coming agents, architects, founders, and other figures making an outsize impact in real estate. The process starts with nominations from CEOs, company presidents, and managing partners. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, under 40, and stand out from their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections.\n\nThis year's class of rising stars comes from a wide array of backgrounds, with prior expertise in everything from construction and marketing to private equity. From making real estate investing more attainable to developing 500-square-foot homes to fit in your backyard, they're addressing some of the industry's biggest challenges head-on.\n\nMeet Business Insider's 18 Rising Stars of Real Estate for 2025.\n\nTarek Afifi said his secret to success is his deep belief in the American dream.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who serves as the corporate finance and investor relations manager at Better Home & Finance, said he gets satisfaction from shaping investors' perception of the online mortgage lender — and helping the company's hard work get reflected in its stock price.\n\nHe attributes his success to how deeply he believes in Better's mission, and said the idea of helping Americans buy a home brings him satisfaction.\n\n\"Everyone wants to own equity in a home that they can live in, but also, build wealth off of,\" he said. \"What really attracted me to it, I think, is the fact that it really is applicable to all walks of life,\" he said of buying a home.\n\nBetter shares have soared more than 400% since April of last year, around the time Afifi joined the company. That's due to investor optimism on the company's future earnings growth, as well as a surge of interest in the stock after the hedge funder Eric Jackson made a high-profile bet on the company.\n\nBetter reported a net loss of $27 million in the second quarter, down from a $40 million net loss in the first quarter. Its funded loan volume for the quarter also rose to $1.2 billion, up 38% for the quarter.\n\nAfifi is optimistic about the direction of the residential real estate market over the next year. He expects refinance and mortgage activity to bloom in 2026 as the Fed continues to cut interest rates.\n\n\"Everyone's kind of positioning themselves for the refi rally,\" he said. \"So it's a symbiotic relationship and I think that it's something we're all looking forward to seeing.\"\n\nThe rate of Hispanic homeownership rose to a record 49.5% in 2023. Maria Barrios wants to make that statistic even higher.\n\nAs the executive director of operations and chief financial officer of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP), Barrios is central to the nonprofit's mission to promote homeownership and expand access to credit in the Hispanic community through education and advocacy. As of 2025, the organization has 85 chapters nationwide, with an additional 30 in development and nearly 58,000 active members.\n\n\"While our mission is to promote sustainable Hispanic homeownership, we're about much more than that,\" Barrios told Business Insider. \"We understand that homeownership isn't the end goal for Hispanics; it's just the beginning of their financial journey.\"\n\nBarrios has played a key role in expanding the organization's reach, assisting with the launch of the AVANCE Global Conference, a business and media platform, and expanding internationally with AVANCE España in January 2026. She also supported the launch of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance (NHCA) and AVANCE Sports.\n\nOverall, Barrios has driven consistent 30% year-over-year revenue growth for the organization and helped launch an average of 10 new NAHREP chapters annually.\n\n\"The real estate industry faced a challenging market this year, but our biggest accomplishment was growing despite these difficulties,\" Barrios said.\n\nDerek Fitzgerald is the poster child for company loyalty. He's been at McCarthy, a national commercial construction company, since he left college 12 years ago, climbing the ranks to become the senior vice president of operations for the builder's San Francisco office.\n\nIt's a career he came to after finding a passion for the \"built environment\" while studying civil and environmental engineering at UC Berkeley.\n\nSince then, Fitzgerald has been part of a wide range of projects, from the renovation of a 350,000-square-foot naval hangar to the construction of a lab that produced the antiviral drug Remdesivir. The work is varied, and marries his varied set of skills.\n\n\"I didn't necessarily want to focus on the design part of it,\" Fitzgerald said. \"But I found this commercial real estate and construction environment that allowed me to merge my technical background with this passion that I have for people and bringing people together.\"\n\nFor most founders, selling their company marks the end of a journey. For Nick Friedman, it was the beginning of another chapter.\n\nFriedman's first chapter began at 19, when he dropped out of Williams College and set out to start a company that would \"change the world.\" After joining the famed Y Combinator program with Adam Pollack, the two launched lending startup Accept.inc in 2019. In 2022, they sold the company to the real estate technology company HomeLight.\n\nA lot of founders would've ridden into the sunset. Friedman stayed on board.\n\n\"I think that I told the CEO of HomeLight, 'I'm probably going to be your worst employee of all time,'\" Friedman told Business Insider. \"I am not going to listen to you. I'm going to want to do my own thing. I'm going to want to figure out how to grow this thing on my own. That's just who I am. And I don't think I'm going to last very long.\"\n\nThree years later, he's HomeLight's president of home equity, overseeing sales, operations, products, and compliance with everything associated with HomeLight's core lending product, Buy Before You Sell, which allows users to purchase their next home before selling their existing one.\n\nFriedman describes himself as an old soul, and said his willingness to get out and talk to people — instead of relying on social media or sending emails — has helped him connect with the right people and grow his career.\n\n\"We're not shy,\" he said. \"I think the reason a lot of younger founders today don't make it is because they are very shy.\"\n\nReal estate investment is often considered the easiest way to gain wealth in the US. But high barriers to entry prevent unseasoned investors or people with less capital from getting started.\n\nFractional real-estate investing, which allows people to invest in a portion of property instead of buying it outright, makes it easier for non-accredited investors to get started — a fact Mogul Club cofounder Joey Gumataotao recognized early on.\n\n\"My partner and I actually purchased our home right out of college with what very, very little savings we had from jobs that we worked in college and ended up renting out two of our bedrooms to two of my colleagues at Goldman,\" Gumataotao told BI. \"This is a real way to build wealth that wasn't there before.\"\n\nGumataotao started Mogul Club in 2022 alongside his cofounder Alex Blackwood, who he met while they were both working at Goldman Sachs. Blackwood was on the investment banking side, and Gumataotao was in real-estate investing on the private equity side.\n\nThey both wanted to make real-estate investing more accessible to everyone.\n\n\"Even as someone who was working for a large institution, I actually didn't have a ton of opportunity to invest in these lucrative multifamily, large multimillion-dollar investments myself,\" Gumataotao said.\n\nMogul Club allows investors from all financial backgrounds to invest as little as $250 toward a property in markets like Mesa, Arizona, or Ramsey, New Jersey.\n\nAs COO, Gumataotao still handles people management and fundraising responsibilities — Mogul Club is still in its seed-extension round — but he also gets his hands dirty working on the acquisition and supply side of the business.\n\n\"No matter how much we grow, I'll always prefer to be hands-on,\" he said. \"Real estate's my passion.\"\n\nZoe Heyman's role at Basis defies a simple job description. As vice president of investor relations at Basis, a commercial real estate investment firm, the 31-year-old oversees all marketing and investor communications, leads the publication of the company's annual Corporate Responsibility Report, and recently spearheaded the implementation of new technology to better track deals and streamline operations across the company.\n\nHer efforts aren't solely focused on the company's bottom line. As a leader on the People, Planet, Policy Committee, Heyman also organizes environmental-justice fundraisers and community cleanup activities for the firm's employees. Through her involvement in Basis' Capital Connect Initiative, Heyman also works to promote minority-led institutions and direct capital to underserved communities.\n\n\"Zoe Heyman brings a fresh perspective, a modern approach, and an unparalleled level of resourcefulness and initiative to her leadership role,\" said Leigh Roumila, head of investor relations at Basis.\n\nOnly two-and-a-half years into working in residential real estate, Jed Miciak knows it's his calling.\n\nMiciak is the senior vice president of marketing and revenue at Landing, a company that provides a collection of furnished apartments for shorter-term rentals. It's a job with some similarities to the decade he spent working at Hilton, where he helped grow the data analytics team and worked in global pricing.\n\nThis year, Miciak has helped grow Landing's portfolio of properties to about 500 nationally, up from 100 last year. He's also built AI models that use machine learning to identify potential problems, launched Landing's rebrand, and grown the company's online travel agency business while working with companies like Airbnb and Marriott.\n\nOver the next year, Miciak hopes to continue to grow supply and drive marketing efficiency higher — in addition to working toward an IPO down the line. He's motivated by all he's learned from being in the room with longtime real estate pros.\n\n\"I was able to be in these rooms with executives who have been in the space for a long time,\" Miciak said. \"I sat there and provided data at the time; it didn't really seem that valuable for my career. Now, looking back, seeing how these executives face the tough problems solves a lot of the issues running this global powerhouse. It's super helpful.\"\n\nJames Murray is tackling one of architecture's most challenging tasks: designing small spaces that are functional and stylish.\n\nMurray is the director of design at Samara, a modular startup spun out of Airbnb's research and development team. The California-based company's first product, Backyard, is an accessory dwelling unit, or ADU — a compact backyard home that can serve as an in-law suite, home office, or short-term rental.\n\nSamara is growing at a pivotal moment in real estate, as high housing costs prompt many homeowners across the country to stay put and find creative ways to expand their living space.\n\n\"ADU is an acronym that's been spreading across the US for some time, but in California specifically, it's become a very common type of home, one that's now almost ubiquitous as a solution for many people,\" Murray told Business Insider.\n\nSamara offers a suite of backyard ADUs, ranging from compact studios to XL models, measuring between 420 and 950 square feet. For each design, Murray applies a philosophy he calls \"empathetic affordances\" — the idea of creating spaces that respond to how people actually live and move through them.\n\n\"We're always aware of how we engage in a space,\" Murray said. \"Think about the size of a dining table or a bed in a bedroom. It's also about the right balance of space in that perfect kitchen triangle, where you can cook a meal while staying close to the refrigerator, stovetop, and sink.\"\n\nMurray's thoughtful designs have been integral to the company's success, helping Samara book more than $100 million in project value in California over the past year.\n\nWith the abundance of TikToks and Instagram Reels showcasing listings and giving homeownership advice, it's not hard to see the connection between real estate professionals and content creators today.\n\nBut when Griffin O'Brien launched his real-estate media company Estate Media in 2023, it took some time to convince others it was a good idea for a business.\n\n\"There was absolutely a challenge from day one,\" O'Brien told Business Insider of convincing major realtors and talent that being featured in Estate's content would be good for their brands and businesses.\n\nO'Brien, whose background in media spans consulting for Snapchat and working in content acquisition at Roku and Amazon's Prime Video, founded Estate Media with Andrew Shanfeld and \"Million Dollar Listing\" star Josh Flagg as a consulting firm, talent agency, and content-creation machine with a talent-focused approach to creating original content for the real estate industry.\n\nO'Brien said that Estate Media reaches close to 35 million people through its podcasts, newsletters, and shows on a number of social media platforms.\n\n\"We really did see an opportunity between the traditional publications — largely news-based publications — covering real estate and reality television to create content right around these leading voices,\" O'Brien said.\n\nMichael O'Connor has worked nonstop in real estate since he was 21. He has no intentions of changing that.\n\nO'Connor started in luxury real estate with Douglas Elliman, where he's been for nearly a decade. Now a sales associate for The Exclusive Group, a boutique real estate advisory group under Douglas Elliman, O'Connor specializes in South Florida luxury real estate, selling over $1 billion in properties alongside his business partner Nicholas Malinosky. The group was ranked number one in Florida and number two in the country for sales volume for medium-sized teams by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"That right there goes to show how hard we work for our clients and production,\" O'Connor said. \"That's definitely the greatest accomplishment over any one particular sale.\"\n\nOne of O'Connor's proudest transactions was for two contiguous oceanfront lots in Delray Beach that sold for a combined $44 million. He and Malinosky have done about 30 transactions a year, though they prioritize sales volume.\n\nBecause many of the buyers and sellers O'Connor works with are \"extremely sophisticated\" and \"typically the best at what they do,\" they want someone who will go above and beyond in guiding them through the process.\n\n\"T​​he phone is always going and you're always getting emails, so it starts early and it goes late,\" O'Connor said.\n\nThere was a time when Alex Redfearn thought things wouldn't work out.\n\nIn 2014, at the age of 25, he launched Redfearn Capital, a private equity firm specializing in commercial real estate, based in South Florida. At the time, he had no experience beyond a college case study he completed at his alma mater, the University of Miami.\n\nRedfearn told Business Insider that during the early years of building his business, he often considered walking away and starting over.\n\n\"I almost quit after the third year,\" he said. \"I tried to, but my wife wouldn't let me. I wanted to get a cabin and move to New York, but we stuck it out.\"\n\nTurns out, his wife was right. Since founding the company, Redfearn has built a portfolio exceeding $800 million in assets under management, spanning industrial real estate including small-bay, manufacturing, and logistics warehouses. Despite challenging economic conditions, such as tighter lending standards and higher interest rates, his firm continues to grow. In 2024, the company acquired 13 properties, generating a total revenue of $125 million.\n\nReflecting on his career, Redfearn said his company's success comes down to persistence — a quality he believes is essential for every young real estate entrepreneur.\n\n\"Do what you say you're going to do,\" Redfearn said. \"I think in my line of business, people often commit to something but don't always follow through. Success really comes down to doing what you said you were going to do.\"\n\nAlexis Rivas believed traditional homebuilding methods were outdated and sought to build homes with the same precision, speed, and cost efficiency as vehicles.\n\nSo in 2014, while still in school, Rivas and his fellow Cooper Union classmate Jemuel Joseph co-founded Cover, a prefab homebuilding company. In 2018, they designed and constructed their first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) — a compact, 500-square-foot, customizable backyard home.\n\n\"There's a huge housing shortage in the United States, and the problem is getting worse,\" Rivas told Business Insider. \"Our approach to solving this is by building homes in a factory with the same repeatability, quality, and scale as cars.\"\n\nLos Angeles-based Cover handles the permitting, design, and engineering process for its customers. Like automobile manufacturing, the company produces every component — from framing to doors and windows — on automotive-style production lines in its factory before assembling the home on-site. The production and installation process of their steel homes, which range from 150 to 1,200 square feet, typically takes 1-2 months, depending on size. ​​\n\nIn 2025, Cover expanded into full-size custom homes, and in October, it announced it was nearing completion of a rebuild of a house destroyed in the Pacific Palisades fires.\n\n\"Cover was always more than a backyard home company,\" Rivas said. \"Expanding to full homes feels like our original ambition becoming visible.\"\n\nA rural farm town in Northwest New Jersey might not be where you'd expect to find the architect responsible for some of the most exciting projects on the East Coast. But in Gensler's case, that's where they found JJ Rivers.\n\nRivers, who has already notched 10 years at global architecture firm Gensler at age 34, had an early appreciation for how things are built.\n\n\"I come from a pretty blue-collar family, so I've got a lot of aunts and uncles in different trades,\" Rivers told Business Insider. \"Growing up, I always had my hands on building things, whether it was at my childhood home or at my relative's home.\"\n\nToday, he's a principal and studio director in Gensler's DC office, and he also runs mixed-use development for the Southeast region. He manages a team of about 60 people, so his fingerprints are all over a number of projects on the East Coast, like Under Armour's new global headquarters in Baltimore.\n\nBecause of the diverse differences in architecture up and down the coast, Rivers is always encountering new challenges. Not that he minds.\n\n\"It just provides you different opportunities,\" he said.\n\nA lot has changed since Luke Robinson joined WeWork more than a decade ago, when the coworking firm was in startup mode and had only a handful of buildings.\n\nOverseeing the firm's sales, Robinson helped launch and scale WeWork's enterprise business, a major component of its growth over the years. Later, when COVID-19 and the work-from-home trend upended the commercial real estate market, he also led the charge to help its businesses bounce back in New York.\n\nRobinson told Business Insider that being as transparent as possible with clients during difficult times has been key.\n\n\"We saw all the extremes. We saw people come back immediately. We saw people fully go remote,\" he said of the pandemic. \"We were able to, number one, hopefully provide solutions, but also provide some perspective.\"\n\nRobinson, who is now WeWork's regional president of North America, said the firm's recent restructuring to slash its $4 billion debt has been challenging.\n\n\"Everything, to a degree, is challenging about that process. I really made a huge effort to be extremely transparent with our landlords and our members throughout the whole process.\"\n\nRobinson said he expects the commercial real estate market to pick up steam next year as the RTO push continues, and he's focused on continuing the company's efforts to refresh its properties and widen its offerings to customers.\n\n\"We've talked about return to office for five years at this point,\" he said. \"I feel very confident in saying that this phase over the past year has been by far the strongest.\"\n\nLaunching a small business at 27 during the pandemic would have been a risk for anyone, but Amy Rossetti was confident that the strong relationships she built wouldn't fail her. Now, after celebrating her company's fifth anniversary, she's planning for many more years of success.\n\nRossetti's company, R[AR]E Public Relations, is a boutique agency with a five-person staff that handles the public relations needs of 22 real estate clients. Since launching in Beverly Hills in 2020, the company has opened a New York office, and Rossetti plans to establish a bigger presence in South Florida and potentially international markets in 2026.\n\nThough Rossetti's clientele is mainly focused around the luxury real estate market, R[AR]E has opened its services to all who need them — from architects to investors to startups.\n\n\"I'm really adamant that I think R[AR]E can be and will be, if it's not too bold to say, the No. 1 real estate PR firm in the country within the next five years,\" she said. \"That's what I'm gunning for.\"\n\nErik Rutter cofounded the real estate development firm Oak Row Equities with every intention of dividing his efforts between Miami and his hometown of New York City. Almost eight years after the 2018 launch, though, he and his firm remain laser-focused on South Florida.\n\nThat choice has proven to be a winning strategy. With Rutter and his cofounder, David Weitz, at the helm, the company has amassed a $3.9 billion portfolio of office, retail, and multifamily space, luring big-name tenants such as Spotify and Amazon along the way.\n\nRutter, 33, started the company with the firm belief that South Florida's quality of life would eventually draw a wave of top employers, who in turn would demand top-tier office space and ample housing for their workers. The COVID-19 pandemic \"certainly accelerated our thesis,\" Rutter said, but he still sees plenty of runway.\n\n\"We're continuing to see great firms take large swaths of space in the Miami market,\" Rutter said. \"And that's not really slowing down.\"\n\nErica Sachse was on a founding spree early in her career.\n\nAfter spending five years in Australia, Sachse noticed that the US real estate market was lagging in its adoption of technology. She set out to fix that.\n\n\"Australia is very far ahead in the utilization of technology and 21st-century marketing techniques for real estate,\" she said. \"I learned how to harness the data being created in the digital space for high-quality lead generation, ultra-targeted campaigns, lead nurture, really strong automation, and data profiling for prospective buyers and renters.\"\n\nShe founded the property marketing company Snaplistings at the end of 2019, then started her own marketing and sales brokerage, Powered by DMT, in 2021.\n\nBeing ahead of the curve has its benefits.\n\n\"Our clients are just so happy to finally be able to make data-driven decisions,\" Sachse said. \"That's really what our focus is and what my passion is.\"\n\nRaised in Paraguay, Sofia Zavala developed an early passion for art and design, as well as a clear sense of their socioecological impact on daily life. This perspective now guides her architectural work.\n\nZavala specializes in large-scale urban projects, and her portfolio encompasses a range of interior corporate work in New York, as well as mixed-use, corporate, and commercial developments across San Francisco and Texas.\n\n\"Large-scale projects have a big impact on the cities they're in,\" Zavala told Business Insider. \"I'm involved in a couple of projects in San Francisco and in Texas, and they're all meant to make a meaningful difference in communities and create beautiful spaces for people to engage.\"\n\nZavala is currently a senior associate at Connecticut-based Pickard Chilton. She's the architectural firm's youngest employee at that rank and the youngest woman on its senior leadership team.\n\n\"I'm very proud of that and grateful for the confidence that the firm has placed in me,\" Zavala said. \"Being in this role motivates me to keep raising the bar and to support younger designers as they grow into leadership roles and find their own voice.\"\n\nZavala has plenty to be proud of. In 2024, she was a project designer on 530 Howard, an 840-foot luxury residential tower in San Francisco — the city's largest residential building. In 2025, she will also serve as the design team leader for the recently announced Ritz-Carlton Houston, which is projected to be the downtown area's second-tallest building at more than 600 feet.\n\n\"The most rewarding part of my job is knowing that the projects we do at Pickard Chilton aren't just buildings — they're future landmarks that help shape the skyline,\" Zavala said. \"That's the really exciting part of what I do here.\"",

    "title": "How can lawyers stop AI's hallucinations? More AI, of course.",
    "description": "Law firms can't stop lawyers from tinkering with chatbots, so they're adding hallucination detectors.",
    "fullText": "Law firm Cozen O'Connor has a rule against using publicly available chatbots to draft legal filings. But after a judge penalized two of its lawyers for citing fake cases, the firm is adding some extra protection: an AI hallucination detector.\n\nCozen O'Connor is now testing software, made by a startup called Clearbrief, that scans legal briefs for made-up facts and produces a report. Think spell-check, except instead of flagging typos, it spots the fictional cases and citations that generative tools sometimes invent.\n\n\"You have to be pragmatic,\" said Kristina Bakardjiev, the Cozen O'Connor partner tasked with harnessing technology to serve lawyers and their clients. She said lawyers will play around with chatbots whether the tools are authorized or not.\n\nStung by embarrassing AI hallucinations, the legal field has adopted bans on general-use chatbots and AI assistants. But it's hard to stop a curious associate from pasting a draft into a free, browser-based chatbot like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Now law firms and legal tech companies are scrambling to lower the risk of bogus citations and catch those that sneak through before they land in front of a judge.\n\nTwo of Cozen O'Connor's defense lawyers in September admitted they had filed a document riddled with fake cases after one of them used ChatGPT to draft it, against firm policy. A Nevada district court judge gave the firm a choice: remove the lawyers from the case and pay $2,500 in sanctions each, or have the pair write to their former law school deans and bar authorities explaining the fiasco and offering to speak in seminars on topics like \"professional conduct.\"\n\nBoth lawyers went with option No. 2. Cozen also fired the lawyer who had used ChatGPT.\n\nEarlier this year, Damien Charlotin, a legal data analyst and consultant, began tracking cases in which a court had discovered hallucinated content in a legal filing. Charlotin tallied 120 cases between April 2023 and May 2025. By December, his count had hit 660, with the rate of new cases accelerating to four or five per day.\n\nThe number of documented cases remains small relative to the total volume of legal filings, Charlotin said. Most cases in his database involved self-represented litigants or lawyers from small or solo firms. When large firms were involved, the hallucinations often slipped in through the work of junior staff, paralegals, experts, or consultants, or through processes like formatting footnotes, Charlotin said.\n\nHallucinated content is causing headaches in other professions, too. In October, consulting firm Deloitte agreed to pay a partial refund to the Australian government for a $290,000 report after officials found it was peppered with allegedly AI-generated errors.\n\nAI hallucinations are hard to eliminate because they're baked into the way chatbots work. Large language models are trained to predict the word that is most likely to come next, given the words before it.\n\nMichael Dahn, a senior vice president at Thomson Reuters who leads global product teams for legal-research service Westlaw, says the model makers can't get hallucinations to zero for answering open-ended questions about the world. However, companies can dramatically reduce their risk by forcing a large language model to cite from a specific data set, like a corpus of case law and treatises. The model can still mismatch or overlook content, but wholesale fabrications are far less likely.\n\nThomson Reuters and LexisNexis are selling that promise to customers: that an artificial assistant confined to their walled gardens of vetted material is safer than a chatbot trained on the open internet. Both companies have spent decades and heaps of money building deep repositories of case law and other legal content. More recently, they've bolted on AI-powered tools to help lawyers search and cite their data. They now have to defend their positions against services like ChatGPT and Claude that are creeping into the legal field.\n\nLexisNexis has also extended its moat to Harvey, the legal tech startup whose valuation has climbed to $8 billion. Harvey struck a partnership with LexisNexis this year that pipes one of the world's biggest legal databases into Harvey's generative tools.\n\nHarvey also works with AI model providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, to constrain which datasets they're allowed to draw from and layer in Harvey's own proprietary datasets, a spokesperson said. Lawyers can then inspect logs that show how an answer was reached and what data fed into it.\n\nClearbrief makes a drafting tool for litigators that works as a Microsoft Word plug-in. Jacqueline Schafer, a former litigator who founded Clearbrief, says its product detects citations using natural language processing, and creates links to the relevant case law or documents from the case. The tool calls out citations and facts that are fabricated or contain typos. The tool also points to places where the underlying source doesn't quite support what the writer claims.\n\nCozen O'Connor has been testing a new Clearbrief feature that lets users generate a cite-check report before passing a draft to a partner or filing it in court.\n\nSchafer says partners at large firms trust their junior staff to check citations rather than vetting every case themselves. Still, federal rules hold the partners who sign filings personally responsible for their accuracy.\n\nPart of Clearbrief's appeal for Cozen O'Connor is the paper trail. The firm is upgrading its knowledge management system, and Bakardjiev imagines that someday the firm might store cite-check reports alongside drafts and final filings, creating a chain of custody for every brief.\n\nIf a judge ever asks what a partner did to prevent hallucinated citations, Bakardjiev said, partners can point to a report that shows who ran the check and when.\n\nThe legal world is likely to live with hallucinations for a long time. The unglamorous part of the solution is training lawyers to treat the chatbot output as a starting point, not the finished work. The other answer: throwing more AI at the AI.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Ukraine's special-ops buggies are fast — but dodging drones is a dangerous gamble",
    "description": "Ukrainian special operators described to Business Insider how they came under Russian fire driving buggies near the front lines.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's elite special operators rely on light buggies to swiftly move along the front lines, banking on their speed and maneuverability to execute high-stakes missions.\n\nThese run-and-gun vehicles don't come with much in the way of external protection, leaving them exposed and vulnerable to Russian drone strikes, but that's the tradeoff for flexibility in combat.\n\nTwo soldiers in Ukraine's 4th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit modeled after its US Army counterparts, talked to Business Insider about how they found themselves under Russian drone fire near the front lines while riding in the buggies.\n\nBoth attacks, which were carried out in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region in recent months, left soldiers injured, the two special operators said. They could only be identified by their call signs for security reasons.\n\nIn September, Khyzhak and two other operators were driving back to base from a mission when a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone appeared behind their buggy and started chasing the vehicle.\n\nKhyzhak said that his driver skillfully maneuvered away from the Russian drone at the last second, which detonated a few feet away on the side of the road. The Ukrainians, having narrowly survived, jumped out of the buggy. One of the operators landed awkwardly and broke his leg.\n\nThe 4th @SOF_UKR Regiment Rangers skillfully maneuver away from an enemy FPV while returning from the frontline to the base. Video from the ranger's action camera of the 2nd Battalion, the Northern-Slobozhanskyi direction. Ukrainian SOF: Always Beyond! pic.twitter.com/i7tN5PQsSZ\n\nTwo months earlier, in July, Drago and several other operators were out in a buggy when they were attacked by a massive swarm of Russian FPV drones — so many, in fact, that he described how their tiny propellers made the whole sky sound \"noisy.\"\n\nDrago said his buggy was struck and shrapnel from the explosion injured his left hand and pelvis. Then, another Ukrainian buggy that went to help came under drone fire. Multiple operators from the 4th Ranger Regiment found themselves caught in the large attack.\n\nKhyzhak speculated that the Russian drone pilots may be intentionally targeting the Ukrainian buggies because these vehicles are known to carry elite troops, forces that tend to stir up trouble behind enemy lines.\n\nIn his case, the Russian drone didn't react to any other vehicles in the vicinity, he said. However, Drago said that when he was struck, the concentration of Russian drones was so high that pilots attacked anything they could, including ATVs and armored personnel carriers.\n\nAlthough several buggies were caught in the attack, Drago said that it's hard to say whether they were priority targets.\n\nIt's unclear to what extent the targeting of buggies may reflect a broader trend. The Russian defense ministry and its embassy in the US did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe buggy is a four-wheel car with virtually no external protection. It is one of the lightweight vehicles used in the conflict for infantry assaults, rapid movement, and other specialized missions, alongside quad bikes, motorcycles, and even electric scooters.\n\nThese buggies can also run logistics missions — hauling ammunition to the front or evacuating wounded troops. Ukraine's defense industry has signaled it intends to mass-produce them.\n\nThe US Army is notably interested in something very similar, the Infantry Squad Vehicle, a lightweight buggy-style combat asset that comes as the service and soldiers look to prioritize speed and flexibility over cumbersome heavy armor.\n\nUnlike armored vehicles, which have hardened exteriors, the buggies used in Ukraine look more like militarized golf carts. However, their main advantages are speed, maneuverability, and off-road capabilities that allow access to areas other vehicles can't reach and a shot at dodging drones, though these can be tough to evade.\n\nThese characteristics are particularly useful for special operators, who try to keep a low profile during their missions.\n\nKhyzhak, who joined Ukraine's special operators forces nearly two years ago and commands a small unit, said that he faced the threat of Russian drones earlier in the war while riding in US-made High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (Humvees) or Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.\n\nThe September near-miss, though, was the first time he experienced a Russian drone attack while riding in a buggy.\n\nUkrainian officials have said that attack drones are destroying most battlefield targets now, making large mechanized assaults with armored vehicles far harder for both sides.\n\nThe increasing threat of drones has pushed Ukraine and Russia to acquire and field smaller, lighter, and faster vehicles as alternatives to more traditional — often slower, less flexible, and more easily spotted — systems, such as tanks and heavy armor.\n\nAt least 14,000 tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed in this conflict, according to the open-source intelligence platform Oryx, which tracks equipment losses on both sides. Many systems have been taken out by drones.\n\nThe expanded use of light vehicles for combat and logistics missions underscores how Ukraine and Russia are adapting to the threat of drones, which dominate the battlefield all along the front line.",

    "fullText": "Larry Ellison just took a $25 billion hit to his net worth.\n\nThe Oracle cofounder saw billions wiped off his fortune on Thursday, according to estimates on Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, after the software giant's shares fell by more than 11% on weaker-than-expected earnings results.\n\nThe hit brought Ellison's net worth down to $258 billion, per the Index, marking one of the biggest single-day wealth drops of 2025.\n\nOther billionaires suffered steeper or similar losses in April: Elon Musk lost $35 billion in just three days, and Mark Zuckerberg shed about $24 billion as Trump's tariff plans sparked fears of retaliation and recession.\n\nEarlier this year, Ellison briefly took the crown of world's richest person, overtaking Musk in September when Oracle shares surged as much as 43% due to a strong forecast for its cloud business.\n\nOracle missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in its most recent earnings results, which were reported on Wednesday. Shares fell more than 11% in after-hours trading, extending a slide that began in October as investors questioned the company's breakneck spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nDespite missing estimates, revenue was up 14% year-over-year during the quarter. But that wasn't enough to calm concerns over the scale and cost of its expansion.\n\nThose worries dominated Wednesday's call with analysts.\n\nClay Magouyrk, Oracle's co-CEO, pushed back on fears that the company might need more than $100 billion to build out its data centers — a figure some analysts had floated.\n\n\"We expect we will need less, if not substantially less, money raised than that,\" he said, adding that Oracle's debt remains \"investment-grade.\"\n\nEven after Thursday's plunge, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows that Ellison's net worth still remains ahead of most tech titans, including Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.",

    "description": "Disney's OpenAI deal comes at a time when the stock is essentially flat over the past 10 years, while the S&P 500 has soared 236%.",
    "fullText": "Things Disney has accomplished in the past 10 years:\n\nThings it hasn't accomplished over the same period:\n\nThis may seem like a wild stat. After all, the S&P 500 is up a whopping 236% over the past decade. But it's true: Disney shares are basically dead flat during the stretch.\n\nFrom a market perspective, the last 10 years have been a total wash.\n\nThe chart above — which looks at Disney's stock versus the benchmark S&P 500 — shows that the key divergence happened in early 2021, which marked Disney's last record high.\n\nThe company has faced a few main headwinds since that top:\n\nAfter Disney+ got off to a fast start, user growth eventually stalled out and prolonged the service's winding path to profitability. The company has also grappled with ESPN's increasingly online audience in the era of cord-cutting, which has contributed to contentious negotiations with TV carriers. (To be fair, all legacy media companies are dealing with the same issues.)\n\nMissing the mark on original content\n\nPixar movies used to be an absolute slam dunk at the box office. No longer. Viewers are also getting fatigued by the constant stream of reboots and sequels. And yes, Disney still has Marvel and Star Wars, although those have lost steam as well. (Note that a similar slowdown has been seen for movie studios overall.)\n\nDisney has caught flak in recent years over the prices at its parks. CEO Bob Iger even admitted in 2023 that the company had been \"too aggressive\" with price hikes. While parks remain a source of relative strength for the company, their cost has left them vulnerable to downturns in consumer sentiment.\n\nWhich brings us to Disney's latest big swing: a $1 billion investment in OpenAI that will integrate iconic characters into the AI video platform Sora. It's notable that Disney is the first major non-tech company to partner with OpenAI.\n\nUpon first glance, the deal feels like a desperate move from a company that's underperformed for a long stretch. But analysts at Citi see it differently.\n\nJason Bazinet, who has a \"buy\" rating on Disney's stock, lauded it as a defensive move, intended to protect the value of the company's IP from cannibalization. He sees it helping to sustain long-term brand value, while also giving it long-term upside in AI. Iger made similar points in defense of the deal.\n\nWe'll see over time if this AI team-up is a catalyst for a grand stock comeback — and if it's a model other companies follow.",

    "title": "I visited an underrated city in Sweden before heading to Copenhagen, and it ended up being a highlight of my Europe trip",
    "description": "Malmö, Sweden, is just 20 minutes from Copenhagen, Denmark, via train. Affordable and fun, it's totally worth adding to your trip to Scandinavia.",
    "fullText": "For me, the most stressful part of planning a trip is narrowing down what I want to see, especially when I'm traveling to new countries.\n\nI never want to miss out on anything, and when you only get a few days in a place, there's no way to see everything. If I'm going somewhere I'm not sure I'll get to visit again, I feel even more pressure to make the perfect itinerary.\n\nI faced that exact conundrum when trying to decide which part of Sweden to visit as part of a trip to nearby Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nIn August, my husband and I set off for a trip to Scandinavia to go to a wedding in the small city of Helsingborg, Sweden. We planned to spend the majority of our trip in Copenhagen, as we were flying in and out of the Danish city since Helsingborg and Copenhagen are only about an hour and 20 minutes away from each other via train.\n\nStill, we wanted to see a bit of Sweden during our journey, and we knew we wouldn't have a ton of time to sightsee in Helsingborg because of the wedding. We also didn't want to have to take a separate flight or spend a full day traveling, which ruled out Stockholm on the other side of the country.\n\nAfter doing some research, we decided to spend one day and one night in Malmö, Sweden. Malmö is the third-largest city in Sweden and one of the country's fastest-growing cities. I liked the idea of going somewhere that could offer a true glimpse at Swedish culture, and it was extremely convenient to get there.\n\nAdding a day in Malmö to our itinerary seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nMy husband and I took the train from Helsingborg to Malmö on a Monday morning, which took about 40 minutes. We also took the train from Malmö to Copenhagen the following morning, which was only a 20-minute ride.\n\nThe train couldn't have been easier. It ran in frequent increments, so we just bought tickets upon arrival at the station. It was lovely not to have to plan that part of our journey in advance.\n\nThe train was fairly crowded with commuters, but we still managed to find space for ourselves and our luggage.\n\nI considered a few different hotels in Malmö when planning our trip, but I settled on MJ's fairly quickly. I appreciated that the boutique hotel was just 10 minutes from the train station and within walking distance to restaurants and bars.\n\nThe interior also has a floral, pink aesthetic, which appealed to me, and it was in my budget. A one-night stay in a small room cost 1,630 Swedish krona, which was about $170 when I booked our stay.\n\nWalking to MJ's from the train was easy, even with the luggage my husband and I were toting, and I loved the look of the hotel from the outside.\n\nI selected a small room at MJ's for our stay, figuring we could handle limited space for just one night.\n\nHowever, to my surprise, the room was large. It had a seating area by the front door, a large bed, and room for a desk and a wardrobe. Likewise, the bathroom featured a large vanity and tub.\n\nI couldn't believe how much space we got for the price I paid.\n\nFor our day in Malmö, I didn't create a strict itinerary. I mostly planned to wander the city with my husband, hoping to get a feel for what life in Sweden was like.\n\nI was so glad I kept our schedule loose as we started exploring Malmö, as every street we turned down was beautiful and made me want to see more.\n\nFrom the brick roads and cobblestone sidewalks to the colorful homes lining the streets, I couldn't get over how stunning the city was. Greenery grew on many of the homes we passed, and restaurants and shops were often situated in courtyards, creating a sense of community from the architecture alone.\n\nIt was also easy for us to travel on foot everywhere we went, as biking and walking are popular forms of transportation there.\n\nAfter visiting Malmö Castle, a popular tourist destination in the city, we stopped for lunch at Malmö Saluhall, a food hall offering a diverse array of dining options.\n\nThere was a flower market set up outside it when we arrived, and when we walked in, there were stands with almost any food you could think of. I saw other tourists like me milling around, but there were also Malmö residents who had come to eat on their lunch break.\n\nWe feasted on Italian-inspired crostinis before stopping by another booth for pastries and coffee. Everything was, unsurprisingly, delicious, and I loved that the meal came with a side of people-watching.\n\nAfter lunch, we made our way to Folkets Park, a family-friendly green space renowned for its vibrant and eclectic installations. There are also performances held there.\n\nThere were colorful playgrounds, oversize chairs, and shops inside. It was quiet since we were there during a school day, but I could imagine the area would be packed on weekends.\n\nThe colorful design felt so novel compared to the neutral colors I see at most American parks. I could have stayed there for hours.\n\nWe spent the rest of the afternoon walking around the city, popping into shops and sitting on benches to take in the sights. I was charmed by the bookstores, flower shops, and thrift stores we entered, and it was fun to see locals and other tourists exploring the area.\n\nI could tell the city was designed to be friendly to tourists, finding English writing nearly everywhere, but it still felt quintessentially European thanks to its architectural style.\n\nI also spotted people sitting at cafés enjoying fika, a traditional Swedish snack break, in the afternoon. I loved catching a glimpse at a customary aspect of Swedish culture.\n\nBefore we grabbed dinner, my husband and I decided to sit at one of the many outdoor patios in Malmö, as we wanted to enjoy the city's ambiance.\n\nWe stopped at Mello Yello, a bar located in Lilla Torg, a square in the heart of the city, just a one-minute walk from MJ's.\n\nAs I sipped on a beer, I watched coworkers gather for happy hours, families walk to early dinners, and friends meet up after long work days. The atmosphere was unhurried and communal throughout the square. It felt like we could sit for hours, and the staff would be happy to have us.\n\nAfter drinks, we spent the evening eating dinner, wandering through more squares, and grabbing dessert at Verde Gelato on our way back to our hotel.\n\nMy husband and I both love affogatos, so we would have loved them even if they came in plastic cups. Still, the adorable wooden tray and glass serveware made it even sweeter. The aesthetically pleasing touch was in perfect alignment with every other experience we had in Malmö that day, adding to its charm.\n\nWe ate them at bistro tables outside the shop, grinning at each other over bites of espresso-gelato goodness.\n\nWe were lucky enough to be in Sweden in late August, when the sun doesn't set until around 9 p.m.\n\nWe took advantage of the brightness by taking a walk along the edge of the Öresund Strait, which separates Denmark and Sweden, as the sun went down. We had crossed over it on our train ride into Sweden, but it felt even more romantic and quaint up close.\n\nWhen we returned to MJ's after dark, the bar in the lobby had a party-like atmosphere going. I appreciated the fun energy, as well as the fact that our room was quiet a few floors up, allowing us to get a peaceful night of rest even as people mingled downstairs.\n\nThe elaborate breakfast spreads at all the hotels I stayed at in Europe amazed me, but MJ's was among my favorites, and not just because I got to eat it in the pink patio.\n\nThere was fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, all sorts of pastries, and a parfait bar. I served myself a bit of everything, and I sipped coffee out of an adorable mug I wished I could take home with me.\n\nIt was the perfect end to our stay at MJ's.\n\nMy 24 hours in Malmö were among the most relaxing of my weeklong trip to Europe.\n\nI was enchanted by the city's architecture, green spaces, divine food, and charming restaurants. I loved my time in Copenhagen, too, but I thought Malmö offered a slightly slower pace that was more indicative of Scandinavian culture outside the bustling metropolis. I found myself wishing we had stayed there for longer than just a day.\n\nIf you're hoping to visit Sweden on a trip to Copenhagen, I think Malmö is the perfect way to do it.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is proposing to overhaul a regulatory panel that monitors the nation's financial stability, by advocating for looser regulations.\n\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council, a U.S. body created in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, monitors risks to the financial system and coordinates regulators' approaches to overseeing the U.S. financial system. In a letter released by Bessent Thursday, he said “too often in the past, efforts to safeguard the financial system have resulted in burdensome and often duplicative regulations.\"\n\n“Our administration is changing that approach,\" said Bessent, who chairs the committee, which is meeting on Thursday.\n\nBessent said the council will begin to \"consider where aspects of the U.S. financial regulatory framework impose undue burdens and where they harm economic growth, thereby undermining financial stability.”\n\nIt was established in 2010 by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a sweeping U.S. financial reform law created to prevent future economic meltdowns.\n\nA critic of the Trump administration, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., panned the idea of loosening financial regulations, saying “taking this hands-off approach to financial stability would leave our financial system and economy at greater risk in any economic environment.”\n\n“Going down this path just as cracks are emerging in the financial system and yellow lights are flashing across our economy is especially reckless,\" she said in a statement, citing the recent bankruptcies of subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, auto parts company First Brands, and home remodeling platform Renovo Home Partners.",

    "description": "HD Hyundai built two new guided-missile frigates for the Philippine Navy, giving it a firepower upgrade for South China Sea.",
    "fullText": "One of South Korea's top shipbuilders is turning out new warships for the Philippines as Manila accelerates its naval modernization.\n\nThe new frigates mark a major upgrade for the Philippine fleet, offering the country a more credible defense as China turns up the pressure in the South China Sea.\n\nThe historically obsolete Philippine naval force is now modernizing to meet current and future threats. \"The Philippine Navy is professional and getting stronger,\" Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider. He said that \"adding two guided-missile frigates to their very small fleet means that China's no longer running alone in the arms competition in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSouth Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai Heavy Industries has built two HDF-3200 Hybrid frigates for the Philippines. The second vessel, BRP Diego Silang, was commissioned earlier this month, over six months after the first-in-class BRP Miguel Malvar entered service.\n\nBoth vessels bring added firepower to the Philippine Navy. They're the first Philippine warships to have vertical launch systems for missiles, a modern capability that allows the Philippines to carry and fire VL MICA surface-to-air missiles made by MBDA, a European missile company. The frigates also carry eight SSM-700K C-Star anti-ship missiles made by South Korea.\n\nWarship vertical launch systems can be refreshed with new weapons over time. They shoot missiles straight upward before they arc toward their targets, a design that works well in all conditions. Each frigate has 16 cells, allowing the Philippines to tailor its missile loadouts for different missions.\n\nThe $550 million contract for the two frigates dates to 2021 and is the latest in a string of deals between HD Hyundai and Manila. The premier South Korean shipbuilder is also constructing six offshore patrol vessels and has discussed additional projects. In all, it has built 10 ships for the Philippine Navy.\n\n\"As we strengthen our defense industry network with the Philippines and other key Southeast Asian countries, we plan to identify additional potential demand and continuously expand our business competitiveness in the region,\" the company told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nAs Manila races to modernize its military, new warships give its navy much-needed heft in a region where China now fields the world's largest fleet and increasingly throws its weight around.\n\nThe South China Sea has been a hotbed of Chinese aggression, accidents, and close-calls in recent years, with Beijing's navy, coast guard, and maritime militia vessels frequently harassing Philippine fishing boats, spraying them with water cannons, chasing them down, and even ramming into them.\n\nWithin the contested region, the Philippines' new frigates and firepower now pose a potential challenge for China.\n\n\"They would be taking a very big chance of being sunk or knocked out of the sky if they start to push around these frigates,\" Cronin said of China's ships and planes. Strategies on both sides of this long-running dispute will, however, need to be managed carefully to avoid escalation and a shift from gray-zone aggression to conflict.\n\nChina fields a huge coast guard, backed by some of the world’s largest cutters, and typically relies on it for confrontations in the South China Sea while its navy hangs back. In a recent encounter, a Chinese navy destroyer joined in the chase of a Philippine patrol ship. Its unsafe maneuvering at sea led to it slamming into one of China’s own coast guard vessels.\n\n\"It is part of China's standard operating procedure to intentionally engage in unsafe behavior and create risks of collision at sea and in the air,\" Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider at the time.\n\nThe Philippines has been investing in other military might to counter China as well.\n\nManila's Archipelagic Defense Concept, for instance, has included the acquisition of more missile systems and better intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance capabilities to monitor its waters. Additionally, more military exercises and deeper cooperation between the Philippines, US, Australia, and other Pacific parnters is also helping better prepare Manila.\n\nThe Philippines is also planning for a fleet of submarines, with another South Korean shipbuilder, Hanwha Ocean, pitching an offer to build diesel-electric submarines earlier this year, as well as construct a submarine base, with support for local maintenance, repair, overhaul, and training.\n\nNewer submarines would provide the Philippine Navy with additional ways to patrol and monitor activity within its waters and deter foes.",

    "fullText": "Mickey Mouse … brought to you by OpenAI.\n\nDisney lending out its iconic characters to be leveraged by AI seemed a far-fetched idea a few months ago. But thanks to a $1 billion deal between the House of Mouse and OpenAI, that's exactly what's happening.\n\nIt's representative of a larger question companies, especially those in media and entertainment, are grappling with: Are AI companies friend or foe?\n\nFor Bob Iger, the answer is very much friend.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" the Disney CEO told CNBC on Thursday.\n\nThe deal will allow Disney+ to post users' AI-generated content, a goal that Iger mentioned last month. Doing so could help boost engagement on the streamer's platform, which has been stagnant in recent years, writes BI's Lucia Moses.\n\n(I should probably mention Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, also falls in the \"friend\" camp. It cut a deal with OpenAI almost two years ago.)\n\nOthers aren't as willing to rub shoulders with OpenAI. The startup has a history of using someone's intellectual property without permission and then apologizing for it. That has resulted in several lawsuits, including those from The New York Times and \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.R. Martin.\n\nSo who's right? It's too early to say, but it could easily go both ways.\n\nThe longer one waits to cut a deal with an AI company, the worse the terms could be. (The benefits of first-mover advantage.) On the other hand, opening yourself up to AI could be a kind of Pandora's box you can't close.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nThe deal isn't just beneficial to Disney.\n\nDisney characters coming to Sora 2 could be a big boost for a video platform that hit a bit of a lull after a hot start a few months ago.\n\nBringing characters from \"Frozen\" and \"Moana\" to life on your app is also a great way to generate interest and build loyalty with a younger audience. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently touted the personal benefits he finds from using ChatGPT as a new parent.\n\nBut pursuing a younger demographic also comes as some countries are putting up more guardrails around kids' use of tech. Australia recently installed a ban on social media for anyone under the age of 16.\n\nThe Disney-OpenAI deal also comes as competition keeps mounting against the startup from the likes of Google and others. And while so much of AI is about pushing cutting-edge tech, sometimes you just need a little bit of old-school magic.",

    "fullText": "Break out the shovels, your weekend's about to get snowy.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wilmington has issued a winter storm watch for several central Ohio counties, including Franklin, Licking, Preble, Montgomery, Greene, Fayette, Pickaway, Fairfield and Hocking.\n\nThe advisory issued the afternoon of Dec. 11, which includes Columbus, goes into effect Saturday, Dec. 13 and runs until the morning of Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nThe watch says that accumulation of 3 to 5 inches is possible and could make travel difficult in parts of east central Indiana and central and west central Ohio.\n\nThere is also a chance of snow overnight and into the early morning of Friday, Dec. 12, with the forecast calling for some snow after 4 a.m.\n\nTwo separate weather systems will bring accumulating snow. First, 2-4 inches of snowfall is expected tonight into Friday morning, with impacts to the morning commute. Next, 2-4 inches of additional accumulation is possible Saturday afternoon into Saturday night. pic.twitter.com/hMLxv7qMy0\n\n— NWS Wilmington OH (@NWSILN) December 11, 2025\n\nNWS alerted these weather conditions in an X post on Dec. 11, explaining \"two separate weather systems will bring accumulating snow.\"\n\nThe NWS says the overnight snow could affect the Dec. 12 morning commute. So, it might be a good idea to leave early for work or school to give yourself time to get to where you're going safely.\n\nThe previous considerable snowstorm snarled traffic, resulted in multiple crashes and led to several school closings and delays across central Ohio.\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center (CPC) confirmed on Dec. 11 that the La Niña weather pattern would continue to impact weather across the country until February 2026.\n\nIn Ohio, La Niña winters mean colder conditions, especially if you live in the northern and eastern parts of the state.\n\nThe strong westerly to northwesterly winds crossing Lake Erie can fuel lake-effect snow along the snowbelt, impacting cities such as Cleveland, Toledo, and Sandusky. If the lake remains ice-free later into the season, as is expected in milder falls, snow events can be more frequent and intense.\n\nSouthern Ohio may not see significant lake-effect snow, but the region can still experience colder-than-average temperatures and occasional heavy snowfall when Arctic air aligns with storm systems.For example, during past La Niña winters, northern Ohio has seen multiple lake-effect snowstorms dropping several feet of snow in just a few days, while southern Ohio experienced sharp cold snaps and scattered snow events — a pattern that reflects the classic La Niña influence on the state.\n\nLa Niña isn't the only weather system influencing winter weather. The polar vortex is expected to impact Ohio. Dipping Arctic air and frigid temperatures will hit the entire state, according to AccuWeather. Indiana and Kentucky will also be affected.\n\n\"There is a massive area of air in northwestern Canada where temperatures are 20 to 30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is on its way southeastward into the U.S.,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said. \"This is the mother lode of cold air and is a term I don't use lightly.\"Over the next few days, extreme cold air will barrel into the central and eastern U.S. \"like a wrecking ball,\" said Weather Trader meteorologist Ryan Maue in a post on X on Dec. 9, as reported by USA TODAY. Maue dubbed it a \"textbook 'Polar Vortex' mega-dump of western Canadian cold.\"\n\nThe cold blast could be relatively short-lived, however. Forecasts expect a return to more typical wintry temperatures as the polar vortex retreats back to the north.\n\nCurrently, no schools in the Columbus area have announced closures for Dec. 12. That could change before the morning, so continue monitoring the storms at dispatch.com.\n\nToday: A slight chance of snow showers before 11 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 32 degrees.

    "fullText": "There are many programs that keep a wide variety of exotic animals in captivity for the purposes of conservation, education, breeding, and continuing the species. However, there are also less savory reasons to keep rare animals around — and when not properly managed, these endeavors can lead to dangerous situations for both the animals and people nearby. That was recently the case in South Africa when a lion being transported to a game ranch escaped from the truck carrying it, as seen in a video recently shared on Reddit.\n\nThe video shows the lion standing on top of the truck after escaping through its top hatch. As the truck pulls off the road, the lion jumps down to the ground, then strolls away across the street.\n\nLion breaks out of truck while it was being transported\n byu/notleonn ininterestingasfuck\n\n()\n\nAccording to UPI, the incident occurred on the road near Bakerville, between Lichtenburg and Zeerust. The lion was being taken to a game farm in Nietverdiend and was under the influence of a tranquilizer. It was later found resting under a tree and was recaptured, after which it was successfully transported to its destination.\n\nThis was an alarming moment for drivers who witnessed the lion's escape, as viewers can tell by the expression of the driver caught in the rearview mirror in the video.\n\nWildlife encounters like this one are dangerous for both the people, who could be injured by an uncontrolled animal, and the animal itself, which could be injured by a car, could get hurt during the escape attempt, or might need to be euthanized later to protect people from it.\n\nIn this case, the lion sustained only minor injuries, and no one was hurt. However, that was only a matter of luck. An investigation is being conducted into the incident, including whether the correct permits were obtained for the transport. Meanwhile, unfortunately, the lion ultimately ended up at a game ranch — meaning that its ultimate fate is still likely to be a tragic one.\n\nAside from the ongoing investigation into the circumstances of the lion's transport and escape, many opponents of big game hunting are hard at work trying to end this practice.\n\nMeanwhile, conservationists work to stabilize the wild lion population in South Africa.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Here's how to know if it's impacting you—and whether you should avoid it altogether.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to lowering blood pressure through diet, there's a hyperfocus on sodium. It's worth taking this advice with more than a grain of salt: The American Heart Association notes that cutting just 1,000 milligrams of sodium from your daily diet can significantly improve blood pressure.\n\nHowever, salty foods aren't the only culprits when it comes to high blood pressure, according to cardiologists and registered dietitians.\n\n\"Salt is only one part of the story,\" notes Michele D. Rager, DCN, RDN, LDN, FAND, the head of clinical nutrition at Berry Street. \"Some drinks...can also raise your blood pressure. Ingredients like caffeine or certain herbal extracts can tighten your blood vessels and make your heart beat faster within minutes.\"\n\nRecognizing which foods and drinks increase blood pressure lets you manage your health proactively. Rager, another RD and two cardiologists agree: one common drink can raise blood pressure even faster than salt.\n\n🩺\n\"Energy drinks can cause rapid increases in blood pressure because of how their ingredients stimulate the cardiovascular system,\" says Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian and certified diabetes educator for EntirelyNourished.com.\n\nNot to further jolt you, but there's considerabledata to back up the idea that energy drinks can raise blood pressure, including in people without hypertension.\n\nUnfortunately, caffeine—AKA the main reason people usually reach for an energy drink—is also the reason why this beverage can increase your blood pressure.\n\n\"Caffeine triggers the release of epinephrine—adrenaline—which can cause a spike in blood pressure, usually peaking within an hour,\" explains Dr. Randy Gould, DO, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in NYC and a contributor to labfinder.com.\n\nHowever, peek at the ingredients label. Energy drinks contain other ingredients that can increase the risk for elevated blood pressure, starting with guarana, a plant extract.\n\n\"Guarana is essentially an added source of caffeine,\" Rager explains. \"When it’s included, the total stimulant load is higher than what the label may suggest, which can lead to an even bigger bump in blood pressure.\"\n\nShe also flags the bitter orange content in energy drinks as a driver of higher blood pressure. \"Bitter orange—or synephrine—is another stimulant that can mimic adrenaline,\" she says. \"Studies show it can cause small but meaningful increases in blood pressure and heart rate.\"\n\nUnderstanding the signs that an energy drink increases your blood pressure can help you protect your short-term and even long-term health.\n\nDr. Gould says you might experience the following if an energy drink contributed to a surge in your blood pressure:\n\nHeart palpitations (feeling flutters or like your heart is racing)\n\n\"If you develop these symptoms, stop consuming the energy drink immediately, increase water intake to stay hydrated and try to relax,\" Dr. Gould suggests.\n\nHowever, if the symptoms are severe or persist, seek out medical attention, advises Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at Saddleback Medical Center.\n\nImportantly, you may not even know if energy drinks spiked your blood pressure.\n\n\"Many people experience a 'silent spike,'\" Routhenstein warns. \"This is especially true for habitual caffeine consumers or individuals who have caffeine tolerance. However, it is important to note that blood pressure can still increase, putting extra strain on the heart and arteries over time, even if you feel fine.\"\n\nIt's important to know how much caffeine is in your energy drink, as it can elevate your blood pressure. Unfortunately, \"Caffeine content in energy drinks can vary a lot by brand and can size,\" Rager says. Generally speaking, though, she reports that:\n\nA typical 8.4-ounce energy drink has about 80 milligrams (mg) of caffeine.\n\nA typical 16-ounce can has around 160 mg of caffeine.\n\nThat said, Rager notes that, \"Some brands go much higher–up to 300-plus mg [of caffeine] in a 16-ounce can.\"\n\nTo put things in perspective, she points to FDA guidance stating that up to 400 mg of caffeine daily is usually considered safe for most healthy adults. That's what you'll get from about two to three 12-ounce cups of coffee. \"That means a single large energy drink can easily deliver half to almost all of your suggested daily caffeine in one shot.\"\n\nIt depends on your overall health and how energy drinks affect your blood pressure.\n\n\"While occasional energy drink intake is not likely to result in long-term consequences, having energy drinks daily or many times a day could potentially result in clinical hypertension and increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms,\" Dr. Chen says.\n\nHowever, he does suggest eliminating energy drinks if you are living with hypertension, explaining, \"In these people, the caffeine—if consumed in excess—can potentially lead to serious cardiovascular complications, such as stroke or [irregular heartbeats].\"\n\nRager adds that it's likely time to cut energy drinks (and even talk to a provider) if you regularly experience symptoms of high blood pressure after having one. If you're not sure, it may be worth investing in an at-home blood pressure monitor.\n\nEnergy drinks can raise blood pressure faster than sodium, but that doesn't mean healthcare experts want you to shake your salt shaker like a Polaroid picture. \"Sodium directly raises blood pressure by promoting fluid retention and increasing blood volume,\" Routhenstein says. \"Unlike energy drinks, which cause rapid, short-term spikes, sodium’s effects accumulate over time.\"\n\nShe adds that chronic over-consumption of salt can contribute to and damage the inner lining of the blood vessels, making it harder for your body to regulate blood flow. The American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams per day (ideally 1,500 milligrams).\n\nThe rest of your diet also matters. \"Sweetened drinks, like sodas, juices and teas, can contribute to weight gain and may lead to elevated blood pressure and/or glucose levels,\" Dr. Gould explains. \"Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats can also lead to increased blood pressure.\"\n\nA cardiologist or registered dietitian can give you personalized advice on how to align your diet with your blood pressure goals.\n\nShaking the Salt Habit to Lower High Blood Pressure.

    "title": "Instead of 'Eating the Frog,' Use the 10-Minute Rule to Be More Productive",
    "description": "Sometimes, how you structure your days needs to change on the fly. (No pun intended.)",
    "fullText": "A popular productivity method encourages you to start your day by “eating the frog”—that is, tackling your biggest, most important task of the day first, then moving through the lesser ones in turn. For many, structuring their to-do list around their greatest responsibility is a good way to stay motivated and ensure top priorities are handled expediently.\n\nBut not every person works best that way. I know I don't. Even for people who generally do enjoy tackling the hard stuff first, not every day is the same. If you find the prospect of jumping into a massive project first thing in the morning daunting—every day, or just today—there are other ways you can arrange your schedule. The following two rules can help you.\n\nThe 10-minute rule was coined by time management expert Clare Evans, who included it in a roundup of “anti-sad hacks.” Here's the gist: Think about the activities that don’t energize or excite you, but which also don’t take up a lot of time. Answering emails. Making a grocery list. Organizing your desk. Filling out paperwork. You can probably knock each of these out in 10 minutes or less, but they’re tedious.\n\nSo do all of your \"10-minute tasks\" right away. The theory behind why this is helpful is similar to the one undergirding the concept of \"eating the frog\": Once these tasks are done, you’ll feel a sense of accomplishment, and will be well positioned to a tackle additional responsibilities.\n\nSure, when you do choose to eat the frog, you'll feel motivated and proud, and it will be easier to breeze through the lighter lifts on your list—but that’s not always the case. Sometimes, you’re too bogged down to tackle something huge. Other times, doing that big thing will deplete your energy and focus enough that those small tasks will feel a lot bigger than they should.\n\nOn these occasions, the 10-minute rule might be a better option. Quickly working through the simple things first won’t zap your energy or use up all your resources, and will still give you a sense of accomplishment that can keep you going.\n\nI am a major proponent of doing this, especially for the tasks I don't enjoy at all, like cleaning. In my version, I keep an ever-updating note on my phone that contains small tasks I need to do, which I input the minute I think of or notice them. They're usually things like \"clean the fan\" or \"wipe the baseboards.\" Just jotting them down helps keep them closer to the top of my mind, so even if I'm lacking motivation or time in the moment, I always have a list to consult. Then, when I think of one or check my list, I just pounce on it. After that, I work in the \"one more\" trick, which involves asking yourself if you can do \"one more\" thing every time you complete something small. The answer is usually yes and, as you work through the list of additional tasks, you grow more and more motivated.\n\nThere's an even a simpler method, conceptualized by Gretchen Rubin in her book The Happiness Project. It's similar to the 10-minute rule, but not quite as structured. In short, if something will take you a minute or less to accomplish, you should do it as soon as you realize it needs to be done. I mentioned I keep my 10-minute tasks in a note, but since becoming familiar with Rubin's technique, I've started trying to knock out my one-minute projects the second I think of them or notice them. It does help. Emails don't go unanswered. The table is never in desperate need of a wipe-down. Little actions add up to big improvements, which compounds the motivation.\n\nThis rule is especially useful for me when it comes to signing important documents—a simple thing that I can do quickly, but which I often end up putting off, and then forgetting to do altogether. I’ve recently been trying something new: As soon as I see the request (which might pop up on my computer, iPhone, and/or Apple Watch), I stop whatever I’m doing it, open it, complete the Docusign, return it, and get on with my day. Nothing to remember to come back to later, and minimal interruption to my workflow now.\n\nThis is the crux of Rubin's rule: If you can effectively cross an item off your list in under 60 seconds, just do it. Yes, this flies in the face of other productivity methods, which emphasize limiting distractions and rigidly blocking out your schedule. But in life, not everything will always slot neatly into a perfect, prearranged structure—just as it won't make sense to begin every day with that mouthful of metaphorical frog.\n\nThere's another version of this—the two-minute rule—which operates the same way. I'll caution this, though: Don't get too hung up one whether something will take one, two, or 10 minutes. Don't overthink these strategies until you're in a state of decision paralysis. Trust yourself to recognize the tasks that can easily be taken care of instantly, the ones that might take 10 minutes but should be tackled ASAP, and the ones that will be a heavier lift. If you're struggling, try a task prioritization technique like MIT, which helps you order your responsibilities based on the impact they'll have on your life, or the Eisenhower matrix, which organizes them by urgency.",

    "fullText": "Scottish Championship: Ayr United v St Johnstone\n\nVenue: Somerset Park, Ayr Date: Friday, 12 December Kick-off: 19:45 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live on BBC Scotland, BBC iPlayer and online\n\nThis weekend marks the halfway point of the Scottish Championship season, with the top four sides all going head-to-head, but the big question is - will St Johnstone retain their place at the top of the pile?\n\nThe Perth side, relegated from the Premiership last season, have been the big hitters at the top since the starting gun sounded, but what once looked like being a procession is now anything but.\n\nSt Johnstone currently sit level on points with Partick Thistle – albeit with a superior goal difference.\n\nBut they lost to the Glasgow side three weeks ago and have failed to win any of their last three games.\n\nThis included being dumped out of the Scottish Cup by League 1 side Cove Rangers, with manager Simo Valakari admitting they are going to have to adapt their style.\n\nWatch: Best of weekend action from around the leagues\n\n\"We had our way of playing when we started the season and maybe our opponents were not that familiar [with it],\" he said.\n\n\"Now they start to see how we want to play, how they stop that. Again, we need to evolve our things that can counter what the opponent is doing.\n\n\"The basics and the foundations of how we do things are at a good level. Now, we need little tweaks - when we attack, how we can be more balanced in defence, attacking the box, how we can find this final pass.\n\n\"The basics are there, the foundations are there, the principles are there.\"\n\nTonight, St Johnstone take on fourth-placed Ayr United at Somerset Park. Currently 11 points behind the leaders, Scott Brown's side surely need a victory if they are to keep any title ambitions alive.\n\nWhile St Johnstone's midweek KDM Evolution match with Hearts B was postponed due to high winds in Edinburgh, Ayr's match with Peterhead went ahead, with the Honest Men winning 2-1.\n\nThe good news for Ayr was a first goal of the season for striker Anton Dowds, who missed a year of football after suffering an ACL injury. The 29-year-old only returned to match action in September.\n\nBefore his injury last season, Dowds was one of the hottest strikers in the Championship and Brown will clearly be hoping he can return to that kind of form from now until the end of the season.\n\nThistle will be watching proceedings this evening with interest. Any slip up from Saints gives them the chance to grab top spot on Saturday.\n\nHowever, that will be far from simple for the Jags as they travel north to take on third-top Arbroath.",

The club needs every one of its coaching staff and players to be united with one aim, which is to win football matches.\n\nI have never known a manager pick a team that he believes will lose games and, at the moment, Salah is not playing because Slot does not consider him as being a starter in his best XI.\n\nSlot, as a manager, understands that there can be only one singer, and one song being played, and that he conducts it.\n\nAs a player, Salah must look up to the stands and see two other great Liverpool goalscorers in Ian Rush and Kenny Dalglish, and recognise that even the greatest players come to a stage in their career where the club moves on.\n\nAt Liverpool, Salah has had a wonderful platform to show off his fantastic abilities. Over many years he has rightly become an Anfield legend and, if he leaves in the next transfer window, let's hope for all concerned that this spat can be washed away and fans can remember the fantastic memories he gave them.",

    "fullText": "UFC BJJ 4 had three title bouts, two new champions, and three notable submissions.\n\nThe Tackett Brothers topped the event, but they had drastically different outcomes in their respective title bouts. Andrew Tackett successfully defended his UFC BJJ welterweight belt and continues to be the face of the promotion, but his older brother William Tacket wasn’t as lucky.\n\nWe’ll discuss the key bouts from the event, but do check here for complete results from UFC BJJ 4.\n\nHeadlining the event was another spectacular performance from Andrew Tackett. He reportedly came in with a rib injury, but he still put on a show and landed a slick submission finish to boot. After a few exchanges early, Elijah Dorsey dropped down for a heel hook, only for Tackett to hunt for a counter leg lock of his own.\n\nOne small adjustment, then his heel hook locked in deeper and Tackett was able to finish the submission and add a title defense to his growing resume.\n\nEXTENDING HIS DOMINANCE 🏆\n\nAndrew Tackett retains his welterweight belt tonight!\n\n[ #UFCBJJ4 | LIVE & FREE on YouTube ] pic.twitter.com/2XP66WJ0aH\n\n— UFC BJJ (@ufcbjj) December 12, 2025\n\nTackett said that even outside of the injury hampering his training, he didn’t drill leg locks at all as he expected more of a wrestling match and a battle for top control with Dorsey.\n\nAfter the match, Tackett called for an unlikely BJJ match with UFC fighter Michael Chandler.\n\nWhile Andrew was able to go home with the impressive victory, his brother suffered a different fate as the second title bout on UFC BJJ 4 produced a pretty sizable upset. William Tackett came in as a favorite and was looking to join his brother Andrew as a UFC BJJ champion, but Ronaldo Junior had other plans.\n\nThe Atos product pushed the pace from top position, and absolutely dominated Tackett in the last two rounds. Junior had several choke attempts from front headlock, wore him down and pretty much beat Tackett in his own game.\n\nTackett survived to the final bell, but it was Junior that went home with the dominant decision win and the inaugural UFC BJJ middleweight belt.\n\nIn the other title bout on the card, Aurelie Le Vern came into Las Vegas against a local star and UFC BJJ favorite in Raquel Canuto, and pulled off a particularly nasty submission win in hostile territory. The French grappler kept transitioning between reverse triangle and kimura attempts, before eventually finishing with a pretty brutal hammerlock that won her the inaugural UFC BJJ women’s featherweight title.\n\nCanuto tried to hold on and tough it out, but the painful submission was just locked in too deep and Le Vern forced a verbal tap to claim the inaugural belt.\n\nOutside of the three title bouts at UFC BJJ 4, it was a teenager called “The Big Slime” that arguably stole the spotlight. 19-year-old top prospect Landon Elmore was fresh of winning the EBI title and effortlessly submitting UFC fighter Bryce Mitchell, and he made his UFC BJJ debut look easy as well.\n\nMoments after the match started, Elmore quickly submitted Nate Hernandez by Aoki lock, adding yet another high-profile win in under a minute to his resume.\n\nTHE BIG SLIME 🤯\n\nLandon Elmore takes home the submission in under a minute! \n\n[ #UFCBJJ4 ] pic.twitter.com/8kJkVPycX9\n\n— UFC BJJ (@ufcbjj) December 12, 2025\n\nElmore, who trains under John Danaher and Gordon Ryan, again proved why he’s one of the top prospects to watch in jiu-jitsu.\n\nComplete UFC BJJ 4 results are below.\n\nFor the latest Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and grappling-related news click here.",

    "description": "The Buccaneers blew a key game on Thursday night.",
    "fullText": "The Buccaneers blew a key game on Thursday night. After the loss to the Falcons, quarterback Baker Mayfield accepted the blame for it.\n\n\"It falls on my shoulders,\" Mayfield told reporters following the 29-28 defeat. \"Can't turn the ball over, can't have that interception. And then, just gotta hit [Emeka Egbuka] in stride on that third down. Listen, you can say what you want about being up two scores and the defense right there, but we have to be better on offense, and it comes down to how I play. And this one's gonna haunt me. This falls on my shoulders.\"\n\nAsked whether the issue related to decision making, Mayfield was clear on what he needed to do: \"Make the throws. Make the throws.\"\n\nUp eight in the fourth quarter, Mayfield threw an interception to Falcons defensive back Dee Alford.\n\n\"It wasn't even a disguise, you know,\" Mayfield said. \"It's quarters coverage. He's playing outside leverage, which is really not what he normally does on tape. You gotta go through the reads and if it's not there, take the damn check down. And it's plain and simple. This one's, like I said, it's gotta beat me up for a little bit.\"\n\nMayfield also was asked about coach Todd Bowles's message to the team.\n\n\"He hit the nail on the head, saying and questioning does it mean anything to the guys?\" Mayfield said. \"Like, 'Does this hurt enough for you to actually make changes. To come in, do the work that you need to do, to do the things that we need to do as a team to get better, fix these things and win ball games?' And he repeated it, and it really is as simple as that. We have talent. Talent doesn't get you shit though. Doing the work and executing on game days does, and that's — we didn't do that today. Like I said, I did not do that.\"\n\nMayfield said it's not an issue with preparation but execution. He also acknowledged the possibility that it's a matter of concentration in crunch time.\n\n\"I don't know if it's losing focus late in games,\" Mayfield said. \"You know, mine was just lack of execution. But I don't know if it's losing focus late in games. I mean, I can't speak for the defense, but I can speak for the offense. I can speak for myself, and that was that was just execution on my part.\"\n\nThe end result is that the 7-7 Buccaneers are not happy.\n\n\"We're pissed off,\" Mayfield said. \"We expected to win that game. We want to win that game. Should be pissed off. And, like I said, when you're up two scores and your offense has a chance to put the game away, and you don't — obviously, people are gonna blame the defense, but it's not the defense's fault. It's our fault. It's my fault. And that's that's how I view it, and that's how I'm gonna handle it.\"\n\nThey can still get to the playoffs, if they handle their business.\n\n\"We have to win out, and we know that,\" Mayfield said. \"It's — that's as plain and simple as it is. We put ourselves in a position to have to do that. So if guys don't handle that the right way, then we have a much deeper issue. But I don't believe that we have a culture issue. We've just got to be able to translate the stuff that we prepare, we talk about, and do on a consistent basis. We've got to translate it to game day.\"\n\nThe next game day comes in nine days, when they face the Panthers for the first of two meetings in the final three weeks of the season, with a visit to Miami in between.\n\nWin them all, and tonight's outcome will become a faded memory. Fail to deliver, and the Week 15 Thursday night could be haunting a lot more people than Baker Mayfield.",

    "fullText": "According to Jeff Kassouf of ESPN, the NWSL board of governors have approved a new roster mechanism that would allow select star players to be paid above the current salary cap.\n\nBehind the scenes, it has been dubbed “High Impact Player.” This would allow teams to spend up to $1 million over the salary cap on megastar players while only incurring a small portion of that salary as a cap hit.\n\nThe NWSLPA would still need to review it due to the current collective bargaining agreement, requiring consultation due to potential salary cap changes.\n\nIt is still unclear on what qualifications a player must check off to qualify for this. However, Kassouf mentions rankings on lists like the Ballon d’Or, appearances on the NWSL Best XI, or USWNT minutes earned (recent years). It also requires commercial benchmarks as well – which has not been clarified.\n\nWith the NWSL board convening next week for their end-of-the-year meeting, could this be done in time for Trinity Rodman to re-sign and remain with Washington Spirit, or is too late?\n\nNothing is finalized yet, but it does seem very close.",

And in terms of score predictions, he is one of those who I will always go to when I want to see what people are saying about the game, because he has a pretty decent track record of calling these games spot on.\n\nWe all know the drill right now, Enzo Maresca and Chelsea are in a bit of a slump after failing to win any of their last four games in all competitions. As a result, they have dropped to 5th in the Premier League, and 13th in the Champions League.\n\nIt’s safe to say that this game against Everton now on Saturday afternoon, has become a very big game for Maresca, the players, and everyone at Chelsea. They need to win, it has to be seen as a must win now.\n\nPaul Merson worried about Chelsea on Sky Sports.\n\nWriting for Sportskeeda, Merson says:\n\n“Everton have looked good in recent weeks, apart from that shocking loss at home to Newcastle United. They went to Bournemouth and won quite comfortably – something Chelsea failed to do in their last league game. If Maresca wins this game, he can play his fringe players in the Carabao Cup quarter-final against Cardiff City on Tuesday. But if he doesn’t, he will be forced to play his strongest team in that game.\n\n“Moises Caicedo is unavailable for this match. I’m still going to back Chelsea for the win. But I must admit that I went with Chelsea mainly because I support them. This will be a tight game.\n\n“Prediction: Chelsea 2-1 Everton.”",

    "fullText": "Panthers’ Jaycee Horn upgraded on injury report before Saints game appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Carolina Panthers had a perfect Thursday practice, with all injured players fully participating before the Week 15 games versus the New Orleans Saints. Most notably, cornerback Jaycee Horn practiced fully for the first time since suffering a concussion during Carolina’s 20-9 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in week 12, still advancing through the NFL’s five-step protocol.\n\nAfter Wednesday’s limited practice, Horn took a major step forward in Thursday’s practice. Head coach Dave Canales stated earlier in the week that the 26-year-old is on track to return Sunday. However, he must still receive clearance from an independent neurologist before rejoining the starting lineup.\n\nThe Panthers’ latest injury report was as clean as it could get. All 53 players on the active roster were on the field Thursday, and all five players listed, including Horn, inside linebacker Claudin Cherelus (concussion), center Cade Mays (ankle), linebacker Christian Rozeboom (hip/hamstring), and safety Lathan Ransom (thumb), were full participants.\n\nHorn’s return couldn’t come at a better time for the 7–6 Panthers, who are tied with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at the top of the NFC South as the playoff push heats up. Carolina returns from its bye week after a dramatic 31–28 win over the Los Angeles Rams, a game in which the defense forced three turnovers, including a pick-six and a game-sealing fumble. Horn did not play in that matchup but has been one of the team’s most impactful defenders throughout the season.\n\nIn 12 games, Horn has produced five interceptions, the second-most in the NFC, and six pass breakups with 15 tackles. His performance has made him the leading Pro Bowl vote-getter among cornerbacks, positioning him for his second straight Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nThe fifth-year defensive back has also earned strong recognition from across the league. Before Carolina’s Week 12 matchup, San Francisco 49ers star Christian McCaffrey praised Horn’s ability, a sentiment reinforced when Horn recorded two first-half interceptions in that game before exiting with a concussion. Defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, now in his third season with the Panthers, has also acknowledged Horn’s continued development after injuries limited him to 29 missed games over his first three years.\n\nCarolina now focuses on a decisive rematch with 3–10 New Orleans, who handed them a 17–7 loss in Week 10. Horn’s return could be just what the Panthers need as they chase their first division title since 2015.",

    "fullText": "Two key Cavs players ruled out vs. Wizards, but there’s a positive update appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers will not have Jarrett Allen and Sam Merrill for Friday’s road matchup against the Washington Wizards, extending their absences and leaving the wine and gold without those two key players for the fifth straight game. Despite the team ruling them out, however, both have made progress this week.\n\nAfter Thursday’s practice, Merrill was wearing a wrap partially on his right hand while going through a workout.\n\n“Really good news,” Cavs head coach Kenny Atkinson said, glancing over at Merrill dribbling against two of his assistant coaches. “[He’s] actually shooting with his shooting hand, which is a pleasant sight to see.”\n\nBefore that, Merrill hadn’t been able to do anything with his right hand, which has been swollen and sprained since a reach-in attempt on Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo in mid-November. There is nothing structurally wrong with it, but Cleveland’s swingman hadn’t been able to catch or shoot. At least now he’s showing the ability to do one of those things.\n\nAllen only participated in half of the Cavs’ latest practice and didn’t take full-on contact. Unfortunately, that is a downgrade from Tuesday afternoon’s session where he did everything. Allen has been dealing with two separate finger injuries on each hand, with his left ring finger fractured and his right third finger strained.\n\nIn addition to Merrill and Allen, Cleveland veteran forward Larry Nance Jr. was getting shots up after practice at the near court with a wrap on his right calf.\n\nAtkinson also spoke about Max Strus’ return status, which hasn’t changed from the three-to-four months the organization initially estimated as the recovery time post-surgery.\n\n“Just kind of no update in terms of, ‘Hey, it’s gonna be faster or slower,'” Atkinson said. “Same timeline. I think he’s in a good way in terms of his recovery.”\n\nStrus is making his way back from a Jones fracture in his left foot, while Merrill and Allen are inching closer to coming back to the floor.",

    "description": "Tigres pounced on a mistake from Hugo Gonzalez, who up to that point saved Toluca from a much worse scoreline.",
    "fullText": "Tigres dominated the game as Toluca failed to make any kind of impact. They were totally lost and everything will be on the line at home on Sunday. Tigres was aggressive and will need to maintain that and a 1-0 scoreline as they head to what is known as “El Infierno” as they look for the ninth Liga MX title.\n\nEven before the game started the environment was electrifying as the fans at “El Volcan” were loud as they cheered on their team. Screams of “La U!” “La U!” “La U!” rang out for all of Nuevo Leon to hear.\n\nThe home side got all the action started within seconds as Angel Correa got a chance as he made his way towards the ball but Hugo Gonzalez got to it first. A minute later Toluca looked for their opening chance as Jesus Gallardo sent a pass into the box intended for Paulinho but the Tigres defense was able to defend the ball out before it reached the Portuguese. A few minutes later Correa was fouled outside of the box and Diego Lainez took the shot but the ball went just over the crossbar. 15 minutes later and the game was all Tigres as Toluca was unable to get comfortable the first bit of the match. Goalkeeper Hugo Sanchez had to make multiple stops in the first half to keep the clean sheet. The first stop came in the 18th minute when Jesus Garza took a shot at goal that Gonzalez had to send over the crossbar. A minute later Gonzalez had to make another save from Correa. 30 minutes later Correa was fouled outside of the box and Lainez stepped up to take the shot that Gonzalez sent up and over the bar. His defense was able to get the ball out of danger on the following corner. As the first half came to a close Toluca had attempted to make their way up the field but any attempt was broken down. The Diablos had a difficult time stringing passes together and their star forward and midfielder were nowhere to be seen. The visitors were more than happy for halftime as they had a lot to work on in the second half. In 45 minutes Toluca was unable to register any shots while Tigres had seven of them and all of their chances up top were dangerous.\n\nTo start the second half neither of the teams made any changes to their lineups. This was confusing for Toluca as they needed a change but Antonio Mohamed decided to wait. Just like the first half, Tigres opened with a bang.\n\n¡¡¡Dale, dale Angelito!!! Correa abre el marcador en la Gran Final del Futbol Mexicano. 🪽 pic.twitter.com/W9jrog0o1p\n\n— Club Tigres 🐯 (@TigresOficial) December 12, 2025\n\nHugo Gonzalez had been a hero in the first half but one mistake cost it all for them. As he attempted to restart play from the back, he sent a pass to Lainez instead of his teammate and the winger took advantage. He passed the ball to an open Correa who made his way inside the box and sent the ball into the back of the net. Gonzalez quickly went from hero to villain with one grave error. On the next play Toluca was close to equalizing as Jesus Angulo took a shot at goal as he sent the ball between Nahuel Guzman’s open legs but Garza was able to kick the ball out of danger before it crossed the line. Just like that, Tigres was saved. It wasn’t until the 57th minute that Mohamed decided to make some changes. Angulo and Bruno Mendez were subbed off for Robert Morales and Diego Barbosa. Taking out Angulo was a questionable decision as it did not make any sense. Yes, Angulo had some difficulty on the field but so did everyone else and he was the one who had their most dangerous play of the night. Mohamed can be put on the list of coaches who made mistakes in the final. By the 60th minute Toluca had yet to break through the Tigres defense. The home side was holding up well as their defense was unbreakable even though they had one moment of weakness in the beginning of the half. It wasn’t until the 71st minute when Guido Pizarro made his first change of the night. Nicolas Ibañez came on for André-Pierre Gignac who might have seen his last game at “El Volcan” as rumors have swirled of his retirement even though he has six months left in his contract.\n\nIn the 69th minute Barbosa found himself with a shot from distance that went over the crossbar after his teammates found themselves with no open angel. A few minutes later Mohamed made another change as he brought on Helinho for Paulinho hoping the Brazilian would be the spark the team desperately needed. Minutes later Toluca did have a big chance when Morales had a big chance at goal but the ball went over the crossbar after a pass from Castro. Minutes later Tigres made another change as Juan Brunetta was subbed out for Uriel Antuna. Antuna was supposed to be an impact signing for Tigres but so far he has been a bust as he had, up to that point, not had any minutes in the liguilla. 90 seconds later Tigres were dealt some bad news as Pizarro had to make an unexpected change as Angulo was subbed off for Javier Anquino as Angulo was seen limping of the field and one of the medical assistants had to help him to the bench. As the game headed into stoppage time it was evident that Toluca was frustrated with how the game had gone. Morales then made a big mistake as frustration boiled over and he kicked Joaquim Henrique in his private area. The action did not have to go to VAR as the referee saw it happen and gave Morales a direct red card. Morales will now miss the final game at home where his teammates will attempt to make a comeback to defend their title.\n\nToluca was nowhere to be seen as Tigres dominated the game. The home side did not ease their foot off the gas pedal as they had many chances to seal the deal all game long. While Hugo Gonzalez did make an expensive error, if not for him the scoreline would have been different. With a slender lead, Tigres will now travel to “El Infierno” where Toluca will do everything in their power to be crowned bicampeones while Tigres will do everything they can to make sure Gignac leaves with another trophy.",

    "description": "We're a few days out from the game now… how are your nerves? Are you confident? How are you feeling about the game? Are you looking forward to it?",
    "fullText": "I feel just how I felt about the play-off final… calm, confident, and assured.\n\nAs we’ve seen already this season, the quality of football we play with the caliber of players we possess has given the league’s top teams the runaround already.\n\nEveryone related to Sunderland AFC knows how much this game means to the club, they don’t need reminding of it, and come kick-off, I’m sure RLB will not doubt a rousing team talk supported by her rock-solid leader on the pitch, Granit Xhaka – with his experience in high intensity games, he’s sure to be a calming influence on the pitch.\n\nI said at the start I’m ’confident’. Why? Because of our current home record, the fact that we’ve evolved as a club and team, and the manager at the helm.\n\nWould I say I’m nervous? Probably not. More anxious as I just can’t wait for kick off!\n\nI’m suitably calm. Firstly, I know that this team has proven itself in so many different scenarios, whether that be the opening game of the Premier League season or more challenging away days, like Stamford Bridge.\n\nHowever, it’s more than that. I know that this team is built differently. It’s not the same walkover that we saw under the dreaded Michael Beale. The gap between the two teams isn’t as pronounced as it once was, thanks to superb recruitment and scouting from Speakman and others.\n\nI’m calm, though, because of the mentality of this team, and that’s led by one man: Granit Xhaka. We’ve already seen how he’s responded to performances that have fallen below expectations. He understands the significance of this game. As a result, the rest of the team is under no illusions either.\n\nMarry that with our home form and atmosphere that we’ve been able to generate, and you have a brilliant melting pot. We all know how important this game is. Obviously, when kick-off nears on the day, I’ll be a bit jittery, but this is Sunderland AFC, and I have full faith in this manager and in this group of players.\n\nFor me, this is a really hard one to place; I’m confident, but I’m also feverish with nerves, although I’m not entirely sure why.\n\nMy confidence is born not from any comparison I have made with Newcastle since the season began, but is entirely predicated on the back of our own ability. This is a team of warriors, of great experience and also of great ability. So far this season, we have comfortably held our own in all but one game and have regularly upset the apple cart when it comes to aspersions cast upon promoted teams.\n\nThe recent history of this side is another confidence booster, with Regis Le Bris preparing the lads perfectly for play-off success and success in the Premier League, with eye-catching performances aplenty despite not being even halfway through the season.\n\nI have total faith in the lads, the leadership, and the management in judging this game to perfection, which no doubt required, which is why my nervousness — although it cannot be helped — seems rather misplaced and in contradiction to the above statements.\n\nPerhaps the nervousness is born from the lack of control over the situation and the step into the unknown that brings on such nervousness, or perhaps it is just the desire to win, which adds another, more complicated element to this game.\n\nWhatever happens will happen, and whilst not winning feels unthinkable, if it is to be the case, it will not define our season nor what has come before it, and one would hope the only effect after the fact should be a positive one.\n\nOverall, my emotions lurch fromone extreme to the other, but the only consistency is the knowledge that every player entrusted to take to the pitch on Sunday will give their absolute all – and ultimately, so long as we give the best version of ourselves, that is enough for me.\n\nI think any fan who says they aren’t nervous is lying!\n\nIt is important on so many levels. We need to bounce back from last weekend. We were beaten by a very good City team, who beat Real Madrid in Spain this week to prove that.\n\nI thought we were well in the game until the two quick goals, and had a couple of decent chances at 2-0.\n\nWith several of the squad heading to Africa next week, we would need to pick up the momentum again, whoever we were playing. The unbeaten home record will serve us so well this season, and by God, we need to keep it going on Sunday. Three points and we can head into Christmas on good heart.\n\nNewcastle have been hit and miss, and the atmosphere will be electric. If we get on the front foot early, it could be a great afternoon to be in red and white.\n\nForget the bragging rights — we have every reason to approach the game with a view that we can win it.\n\nIt won’t stop me stressing right up to 2pm Sunday, though!",

    "fullText": "The revised schedule for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) is set to affect nearly every Premier League team, with the tournament set to run from December 21 until January 18.\n\nChelsea, Leeds United, Bournemouth, Newcastle United, Aston Villa, and title favourites Arsenal are the only teams that do not have any players jetting off to Morocco in a few weeks.\n\nHowever, 2025/26 surprise package Sunderland and relegation-battling Wolverhampton Wanderers are among the teams that will lose the most players to the tournament.\n\nThese players could miss up to six games in all competitions, depending on how their countries perform at AFCON 2025. Read on as we look at which teams are due to lose players this month.\n\nSunderland have taken the Premier League by storm this season, but that momentum could take a nose-dive over the festive period with the Black Cats set to lose seven players to AFCON.\n\nMorocco winger Chemsdine Talbi, Senegal midfielder Habib Diarra, Mozambique full-back Reinildo, Burkina Faso forward Bertrand Traore and DR Congo pair Arthur Masuaku and Noah Sadiki are all set to represent their countries this winter.\n\nWolves have only taken two points from 15 league games and are on course to record the worst point tally in Premier League history.\n\nHowever, the Midlands club could lose just two players to AFCON, with only Zimbabwe midfielder Tawanda Chirewa and Ivory Coast defender Emmanuel Agbadou set to jet off to Morocco.\n\nManchester United seem to have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim, but they’ll be without Cameroon forward Bryan Mbeumo, Ivory Coast winger Amad Diallo, and Morocco’s Noussair Mazraoui over the festive period.\n\nFulham has become a safe haven for Nigerian players over the past couple of years, but Marco Silva will have to get through the festive period without midfielder Alex Iwobi, defender Calvin Bassey, and winger Samuel Chukwueze.\n\nIwobi and Bassey are first-team regulars for the Cottagers, while Chukwueze’s recent form has made him more popular among the fans at the West London club.\n\nRelegation battling Burnley will lose three players to AFCON, with former England Under-21 defender Axel Tuanzebe set to feature for DR Congo at the tournament.\n\nStriker Lyle Foster and midfielder Hannibal Mejbri have also been called up by South Africa and Tunisia, respectively.\n\nNottingham Forest have been on the upswing since Sean Dyche stepped in, but they’re also set to be affected by AFCON, with two players set to leave the squad.\n\nIvory Coast duo Ibrahim Sangare and Willy Boly have been called up, but Nigerian internationals Ola Aina and Taiwo Awoniyi have been left out.\n\nEverton have raised a few eyebrows this season as they look to push for a place in Europe under David Moyes’ leadership.\n\nThey’ll have to further those ambitions without Senegalese duo Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye at least through the festive period.\n\nBrentford are poised to lose two players to AFCON.\n\nClub-record signing Dango Ouattara will be on duty with Burkina Faso, while Frank Onyeka has been named in the Nigerian squad despite playing just 88 minutes of Premier League football for the Bees so far this season.\n\nTitle-chasing Manchester City will lose Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush and Algerian defender Rayan Ait-Nouri to AFCON.\n\nFortunately for Pep Guardiola’s side, neither of those players have managed to establish themselves as first-team regulars at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nTottenham Hotspur will miss two midfielders during the AFCON tournament, with Pape Matar Sarr and Yves Bissouma set to represent Senegal and Mali, respectively.\n\nBissouma has had his issues off the pitch and is yet to play a single minute for Spurs, but that hasn’t affected his place in the national team.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo has overseen a resurgence at West Ham United that has improved their chances of avoiding relegation.\n\nHowever, he has to find a solution to his defensive line-up with starting full-backs Aaron Wan-Bissaka and El Hadji Malick Diouf set to feature for DR Congo and Senegal, respectively.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion must find a way to cope without highly sought-after midfielder Carlos Baleba, who is set to represent Cameroon at AFCON.\n\nThe 21-year-old has started nearly every game for Brighton this season.\n\nFA Cup holders Crystal Palace have a few African players on their roster, but Oliver Glasner’s side will only lose Ismaila Sarr to AFCON.\n\nNevertheless, it’ll be a huge blow considering Sarr has scored eight goals in all competitions for the Eagles this season.\n\nLiverpool fans may be happy to see the back of Mohamed Salah, who is set to join the Egyptian national team at AFCON after his blockbuster interview.\n\nHe has already been isolated from the Liverpool squad, and his future at the club could be decided in the coming weeks.",

    "fullText": "As I was growing up, a lot of songs and chants which were commonplace around Roker have since disappeared.\n\n“We hate Nottingham Forest, we hate Liverpool too (and Leicester)\nWe hate Man United, but Sunderland we love you”\n\nTo the tune of “Land of Hope and Glory”, fans could obviously insert different teams to suit.\n\nOne of our most missed tunes is “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”, sung to the Christmas carol of the same name. I don’t hear it at our place anymore, but I’ve heard it at Mags matches. It stems from the times when derbies were most often held on New Year’s Day and Easter Sunday. It goes like this:\n\n“Hark now hear the Sun’l’nd sing,\nThe Mags have ran away.\nAnd we shall fight for evermore,\nBecause of New Year’s Day”\n\nAnd the Mags transpose the names of the teams. Interestingly still singing “the Sunderland ran away” rather than “the Mackems ran away”.\n\nIt’s a bit of a myth that derbies were often played on New Year’s Day, as I can only see three instances of the fixture taking place then. Firstly in 1904, then 1980, and most recently in 1985.\n\nThis latter date was my first taste of the derby – and an away one, to boot. I had managed to get my sweaty 19-year-old hands on a ticket, and me mam organised family friends to take me there and back from Washington. As there’s never any public transport on New Year’s Day in the north-east. Imagine my dismay when I discovered these so-called friends were all Mags.\n\nWe were in dismal form running up to the game, having lost our previous five out of six games.\n\nLen Ashurst was the manager and was making a pig’s ear of the season after chairman Tom Cowie had despatched Alan Durban the previous season. The bulk of Durban’s team remained, with Chris Turner, Barry Venison, Nick Pickering, Colin West, Mark Proctor, and John Cooke all playing. Ashurst had brought in Peter Daniel, Gary Bennett, Steve Berry, and Howard Gayle the previous summer.\n\nThe atmosphere was raucous and Jackie Charlton’s Newcastle set about us right from the off. Bennett set the tone, getting booked in the first minute. It wasn’t long before Peter Beardsley opened the scoring on the quarter-hour, slipping the ball under Turner at the Leazes End.\n\nThe reception given to our two black players (Gary Bennett and Howard Gayle) was disgusting. Neither player could cope with the extreme provocation, each being sent off due to two yellow cards. The number of bananas on the pitch was astonishing to a wet-behind-the-ears woke lad like me.\n\nBeardsley completed his hat-trick on 81 minutes, with Colin West offering a consolation for the red-and-whites. It could have been worse as Turner saved a second penalty from Beardsley on 59 minutes.\n\nNeedless to say, the resulting trip back to Washy was a miserable one I will never forget.\n\nThankfully, I have had happier visits to St James’ Park since, being there to witness Tommy Sørensen save Alan Shearer’s penalty in November 2000 — but this baptism to the Tyne-Wear derby adds to my hatred of the black-and-whites and why I will never want to see them do well.",

    "fullText": "I was already in love with Sunderland by the 5th of April 2015, but after that day, I was head over heels.\n\nI remember rushing to the Stadium after playing for my football team in the morning. It was my first taste of the Wear-Tyne derby, but I was already very aware of its importance. Even if I didn’t know before, just the atmosphere in the ground would have told me that. It was different to anything I had experienced before. There was an extra layer of tension, like the stadium was humming with electricity.\n\nI remember the goal so vividly. It is burnt into my mind. It’s one of my earliest memories of Sunderland and definitely one of my favourites too. I am looking at the picture of the goal on my wall as I write this. It’s easily the best goal I’ve seen live at the Stadium of Light, intensified by the occasion.\n\nEverything about it was perfect. The timing — it being the last kick of the first half. The commentary — some of Martin Tyler’s most iconic and excellent work. The unexpectedness — how it came from nothing, just a hopeful flick from Fletcher. The brilliance of it – the technique, power and talent it takes to put a dropping ball into the top corner is hard to understand. The legacy of it – here I am, almost 11 years later, talking about how it made me fall in love with the club. I especially love how it came to be the difference at full-time. A goal like that should be a game-winner, particularly in a game like that.\n\nAs you might expect, 7-year-old me was consequently infatuated with both the club and Jermain Defoe. He was, is, and will remain one of my favourite players to play for our club. He has described it as the best goal he scored in his career, elevating it, considering his magnificent goal catalogue. Defoe even admitted that it almost made him cry. He very clearly loves the club, that game and that goal.\n\nIt is in games like this where legends are made. It is in games like this where players write their name into a club’s history. It is in games like this where a young fan in the stands falls in love with a club.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza wasn't expected to be the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft. Following his surprise Heisman Trophy-caliber 2025 season at Indiana, however, now he will be taken high in the first round as the first QB off the board on April 23.\n\nWhy has Mendoza shot up draft boards for his play, and what's his pro outlook?\n\nHere's a profile of the Hoosiers passer, including what teams are most likely to draft him:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Fernando Mendoza for the Heisman\n\nMendoza (6-5, 225) has the ideal size as a strong pocket passer. The Cal transfer and Miami high school product was a hit in Curt Cignetti's dynamic offense. He's developed all the physical and mental qualities to be a top-10 pick for a QB-needy team.\n\nMendoza is very accurate with his short-to-intermediate passing. He is a good decision-maker who processes the field well. When he has a clean pocket, he can make all the throws. He also hangs tough in the pocket when facing pressure and is fearless in his execution. Mendoza is an aggressive thrower, but also avoids forcing the ball into coverage. He can zip it to take shots, but also adjust to show touch on passes when needed.\n\nMendoza can scramble for yardage when the defense breaks down and his big frame can help him on quarterback sneaks, but he won't add an element of plus athleticism to a team, as he's far less comfortable throwing on the run and won't provide any designed support for the running game. He will need to learn better how to dissect more complex pressure and coverage schemes in the NFL.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nWith the Giants (Jaxson Dart) and Titans (Cam Ward) taking first-round QBs in 2025, it's pretty clear where Mendoza might be headed. Here are the five teams to watch most to draft him\n\nWith Chip Kelly gone from the offense, Pete Carroll can look for a new OC with a pocket passer in mind to replace Geno Smith. It doesn't hurt that Mendoza's Big Ten clutch style would get a stamp of approval from part-owner Tom Brady.\n\nThe Browns will learn more about Shedeur Sanders for the rest of the 2025 season to see whether the rookie fifth-rounder deserves a more extended look to start in '26. If not, Cleveland would be firm play to try again at franchise QB.\n\nMORE: Where Fernando Mendoza projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nWill the Saints see enough from Tyler Shough to make a call either way on the second-round rookie QB? If they want to go higher into the draft pool for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, Mendoza has the Dak Prescott-like pocket qualities to execute his offense well.\n\nAaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw the success of pocket-passing winning with Jared Goff (6-4, 217) in Detroit and may want to go that route to try again to strengthen the position for the long haul.\n\nThe Cardinals are heading to part ways with Kyler Murray and there might be some offensive coaching changes in store, too. Mendoza, Marvin Harrison Jr., Trey McBride and Michael Wilson would make for a good young passing game foundation.",

    "title": "On This Day (12 Dec 1995): ‘Newcastle United Have Got Their Sums Wrong’ Says Murray",
    "description": "A 29,000 capacity Stadium of Light? It was almost the case, but for our neighbours' mistakes. And Peter Reid.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his tenure as Sunderland chairman, Bob Murray always seemed to be driven – almost in equal measure – by a desire for Sunderland to do well, combined with a deep-rooted dislike of ‘them up the road’.\n\nTo be fair, that’s not too different from many Sunderland supporters, particularly those raised in halfy-half places like Consett, as Murray was.\n\nThe first few years of Murray’s chairmanship were stifled by the ongoing dispute with Barry Batey, but as the early 90s progressed, a new stadium was high on the to-do list. While many wanted to keep Sunderland at Roker Park, it was deemed an undesirable path to explore. While the ground was hemmed in by housing on three sides, the car park at the front of the Main Stand did offer scope to build something bigger – however it would have come at a significant cost, and Murray’s mind was firmly set elsewhere.\n\nThe Wembley of the North didn’t progress, but a new development at Monkwearmouth did – and it’s often forgotten that the original plans for the new ground were significantly different to what we know and love today.\n\nOn this day 30 years ago, Murray announced the original 29,000 capacity footprint for the new stadium (with provision for it to be extended to 34,000) was to be extended to an initial 40,000-plus.\n\nAnd he suggested that the decision to extend the ambition of the stadium was down to both Newcastle and Middlesbrough ‘getting it wrong’.\n\nTo the south, Middlesbrough – with a capacity of under 30,000 – were having to turn people away from their new Cellnet Stadium, while to the north, Newcastle’s redevelopment had left them with a capacity of just 36,000. And the fabled waiting list of 12,000, of course.\n\nWe have learned from Middlesbrough and Newcastle since we first submitted our plans for our new Wearmouth Stadium. Middlesbrough can only extend by a couple of thousand and Newcastle have obviously got their sums wrong. \nNewcastle have built a stadium for today, not for tomorrow. And there will be no bonds or debentures here. We want as many ordinary football fans to get into our ground as is possible.\n\nWith the extended capacity, the cost of the new stadium had risen from £12m to £14m, and the revised plans were 15 metres higher and wider than the originals, with the pitch dropped into the ground to create much of the space the additional capacity demanded. The new ground was set to be the fifth-largest in the country – only Manchester United, Leeds, Liverpool, and Everton had capacities over 40,000 at this point. Murray said the desire to capitalise on a huge population, and ensure as many supporters as possible could get access to the club, were also key motivators.\n\nWearside has the largest concentration of population between Leeds and Edinburgh, and we have been encouraged to increase our capacity if we want to compete.\n\nI would not wish to see any loyal Sunderland supporters become a casualty of success, either in terms of access to the club or affordability.\n\nWe do not want to see Wearsiders locked out of the new stadium. We must learn from the experiences of other clubs and not copy their mistakes.\n\nIn good local journalism fashion, The Journal gave Newcastle a right of reply – and while former Roker season ticket holder Sir John Hall wasn’t available for comment, a chap by the name of Mike Elrick ‘hit back!’.\n\nMr Murray is entitled to his opinion, but we aren’t going to get involved in a slanging match.\n\nThe fact is we could probably fill a 50,000 capacity stadium with planning permission, or if it was possible in engineering terms.\n\nSunderland’s on-field performances under new manager Peter Reid were surely giving Murray confidence in the new stadium project, and the input on the buzz around the place created by Reid cannot be underestimated here.\n\nIt would have been interesting to see whether the desire, or funding, for the ‘new’ new stadium would have been as great if we’d been mid-table at this point in the season, regardless of what was happening up or down the road.\n\nAs it was, we were top of the league after beating Millwall 6-0 at home, and were heading to Reading in buoyant mood as we eventually made our way to the title.\n\nGiven that, on this day in 1995, club officials were preparing the planning application for the extended capacity, and four construction companies had just been asked to tender on the construction of the new ground, it’s incredible to think that, just over 18 months later, Status Quo were flying into town to get the new place rocking…",

    "fullText": "DENVER — It’s been a recurring theme throughout Nathan MacKinnon’s brilliant career — and on Thursday night, he made history again.\n\nWith his 25th goal of the season, MacKinnon passed Joe Sakic to become the all-time leading goal scorer in Colorado Avalanche history, helping propel the Avs to a dominant 6–1 win over the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers. MacKinnon finished the night with a goal and an assist.\n\nBrock Nelson, Gavin Brindley, and Sam Malinski each contributed a goal and an assist for Colorado, while Artturi Lehkonen and Gabe Landeskog also found the back of the net. Josh Manson added two assists, and Mackenzie Blackwood turned aside 22 shots.\n\nNATHAN MACKINNON SNIPE THROUGH TRAFFIC #GoAvsGo pic.twitter.com/ZEp5b0Vu9m\n\n— PrimeMakar8 (@retro_colorado) December 12, 2025\n\nNoah Gregor and Mackie Samoskevich scored for Florida. Daniil Tarasov had a difficult night in goal, surrendering six goals on 42 shots — including three in a lopsided second period.\n\nMalinski opened the scoring just 1:14 into the game, taking a pass from Necas in the right circle and snapping a wrister that slipped off Tarasov’s glove and in.\n\nThrough six minutes, Colorado held a 7–1 advantage in shots. Florida capitalized on its second shot of the night when Gregor broke into the zone off a feed from Seth Jones, accelerated down the left wing, and beat his former San Jose Sharks teammate Blackwood short side. Devon Toews and Samuel Girard were a step late closing in, and the game was tied.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe went to the box for slashing Parker Kelly into the boards, but the Avalanche failed to convert on the power play.\n\nParker Kelly gets slashed and crashes into the boards.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe will go to the box. Avs on the power play. #goavsgo #avs @TheHockeyNews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nColorado found itself shorthanded with 6:41 left after Manson hooked Eetu Luostarinen, who was staring at an open net off a rebound. It was a smart penalty to take, and the Avs killed it off to the delight of the crowd.\n\nNelson restored the lead with 1:30 left in the period, cleaning up a rebound from a Cale Makar shot that bounced off Tarasov. It was Nelson’s twelfth of the season and gave Colorado a 2–1 advantage.\n\nAt 5:06 of the middle frame, Brindley scored in his return from a 10-game absence due to a lower-body injury. Brent Burns released the initial shot, and Brindley buried the rebound to make it 3–1.\n\nGAVIN BRINDLEY!!!!!!!! \n\n3-1 AVS!!!#goavsgo #avs @TheHockeyNews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nNot long after, MacKinnon collected a pass from Girard and snapped his twenty-fifth goal of the year over Tarasov’s glove, extending the lead.\n\nLehkonen made it 5–1 on a breakaway, finishing five-hole after being sprung by Toews and Brindley.\n\nLehkonen nearly scored again with 4:41 left when he one-timed a feed from MacKinnon, but Tarasov smothered it in the chest. Lehkonen stared up at the rafters in disbelief.\n\nColorado earned another power play after Niko Mikkola was called for holding, though the Avs could not cash in. The officials missed a clear tripping call on Nelson when Verhaeghe took his legs out in the dying seconds of the man advantage.\n\nFlorida was soon back in the box anyway, as Samoskevich tripped Brindley. Necas appeared to score on the ensuing power play, but the goal was overturned for offside. Colorado carried a four-goal lead into the intermission with fifty-two seconds remaining on the man advantage.\n\nVerhaeghe had a goal wiped out nearly five minutes into the period after officials ruled he deliberately kicked the puck in. The review was brief and the call stood.\n\nLandeskog made it 6–1 at 6:18, jamming in a loose puck after Josh Manson’s shot was redirected by Necas and bounced off Tarasov’s pad. Landeskog jumped on the rebound at the back door and finished the play.\n\nREBOUND SCORE!!!\n\nIt's GABE LANDESKOG\n\n6-1 Colorado#goavsgo #avs @thehockeynews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nSamoskevich scored with just under seven minutes remaining in regulation on a beautiful sequence set up by crisp passes from A.J. Greer and Evan Rodrigues, cutting the deficit to 6–2.\n\nJoel Kiviranta suffered an upper-body injury and will be evaluated, though Coach Jared Bednar told reporters after the game that it’s “nothing too serious.”\n\nA.J. Greer also left late for the Panthers after suffering an injury and was taken to the medical tent. No further updates were provided.\n\nGavin Brindley, Nathan MacKinnon, and Brock Nelson were named the three stars of the game.\n\nThe NHL-leading Colorado Avalanche (22-2-7) square off against the Nashville Predators (15-13-2) on Saturday at Ball Arena.

    "description": "TAMPA — The game was won, and the season was rescued. Until it wasn’t.",
    "fullText": "TAMPA — The game was won, and the season was rescued.\n\nMike Evans was a hero, Baker Mayfield was a gamer and Todd Bowles was a survivor.\n\nSole possession of first place once again belonged to the Bucs.\n\nIn their 50 years of football, this was not the first time the Bucs had blown a two-touchdown lead but, good gosh, Thursday night’s 29-28 loss to the Falcons certainly ranks among the most devastating collapses in franchise history.\n\nIt is absolutely accurate to say hope still remains and a division title is within reach if the Bucs win their final three games, but how do you believe in a team that doesn’t seem to believe in itself? How do you expect to beat the Panthers next week when you continually beat yourself?\n\nThis was not a comeback by Josh Allen and the Bills. It was not a last-minute miracle by Matthew Stafford and the Rams. This was a Falcons team with a 4-9 record that had lost every close game it had played, committed a ridiculous 19 penalties Thursday night and was starting a 37-year-old backup quarterback.\n\nAnd that’s the result that could cost Bowles his job.\n\nThe normally mild-mannered Bucs coach went off-script with a profane postgame news conference that still did not match the enormity of this choke. He repeatedly called the outcome inexcusable and uncharacteristically lambasted his players before acknowledging that finger-pointing was not the way to go.\n\n“It’s inexcusable. We don’t make excuses,” Bowles said. “You’ve got to f--king care enough where this s--t hurts. It’s got to f--king mean something. It’s more than a job, it’s your f--king livelihood. How well do you know your job, how well can you do your job? You can’t sugarcoat that s--t. It was in-f--king-excusable. There is no f--king answer for it.\n\n“That’s what you tell them in the locker room. Look in the f--king mirror.”\n\nWere you inclined to point fingers, you would need to use both hands to adequately explain Thursday night’s shortcomings.\n\nMayfield threw a critical interception with 8:22 remaining that led to an Atlanta touchdown that cut Tampa Bay’s lead to 28-26.\n\n• With a chance to kill the clock in the final two minutes, the offensive line self-destructed. Bucky Irving was thrown for a 4-yard loss, Mayfield threw an incompletion and then was sacked on third down.\n\n• And a defense that has steadily deteriorated this season allowed quarterback Kirk Cousins to complete back-to-back passes on third and 28 to set up a game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n• “I didn’t execute enough,” Mayfield said. “When a quarterback doesn’t execute enough in a tight game, you’re not going to win.”\n\nWhile the blame can be spread from offense to defense to special teams, Bowles will take the majority of the hits. At least as far as the average fan is concerned. It won’t matter that injuries decimated the Bucs at midseason. It won’t matter that a pass rusher was not acquired in the offseason. It won’t matter that he’s led the Bucs to three consecutive NFC South crowns.\n\nThe bottom line is the Bucs are in danger of ruining a 5-1 start to the season, and that almost always means a head coach takes the blame.\n\nA generation ago, Jon Gruden’s time in Tampa Bay ended when the Bucs lost four consecutive games in December after starting the season at 9-3.\n\nIs it possible that Bowles and the Bucs will get a reprieve by winning their final three games?\n\nPerhaps, but that seems like a tall order right now.\n\nAnd, even then, there will be pressure to win a playoff game after losing being one-and-done twice in the past three seasons.\n\n“We understand what’s happening,” Bowles said. “We know exactly what’s happening. We’ve got to execute better. If you have to execute better, you definitely have to coach better.”\n\nThe Bucs have now dropped five of their last six games, including back-to-back losses at home to the hapless Saints and Falcons.\n\nTwo months ago, Mayfield looked like an MVP candidate and Bowles seemed to justify the contract extension he got in the offseason.\n\nAnd now they are one loss away from finishing one of the most disheartening collapses ever seen.\n\nAs the man said, it’s inexcusable.\n\nJohn Romano can be reached at jromano@tampabay.com.

    "description": "Meta's lines of code, shared meals, a familiar melodies, and the All the Smoke podcast, are finding ways to bring people together by a common thread.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES –– Indelible connections often unassumingly begin. They make their marks on out hearts and psyches with the whisper of a question: What if?\n\nWhat if a link could be more than a link?\n\nWhat if sharing a favorite podcast episode felt less like a broadcast and more like an invitation?\n\nEarlier this month, Threads answered. Meta introduced features that let podcasters and their afficianados plant their flags, pinning their work to their profile with pride.\n\nThey made episode shares not just visible, but vibrant. This was the technical seed. But the true story is about the soil where it was planted.\n\nThis is about the community that formed around a restaurant called Somerville.\n\nTo cross its threshold was to slip through time. Its decoration is an homage to the loving spectral echoes of Black excellence speakeasies that defined the Harlem Renaissance. This was no mere venue; it was a vessel.\n\nWooden beams, skeletal and sincere, stretched overhead like the bare ribs of a great, welcoming beast, married to the soft glow of romantic lighting.\n\nThe air hummed with a latent energy, the quiet thrill of a secret too good to keep. Plush brown seats held bodies leaning in, not back. This was the clubhouse for a playground's elite, and on Thursday, the NBA was the conversation.\n\nOn delicate plates, the philosophy of connection was served in edible metaphors.\n\nScrumptious tuna tartare, a diminutive masterpiece, its ginger-soy dressing performing a delicate dance on the palate. A sesame ice cream cone waltzed in perfect, savory harmony with shallots and chives.\n\nTruffle-flavored popcorn bursts with umami —a complex chorus of garlic, pepper, and a unique woodsy blend—each bite a tiny explosion of crafted communion.\n\nAnd weaving through it all, the sultry, sinuous voice of Briana Washington at the piano, wrapping around ballads like \"A Lovely Day.\" This was the soundtrack of shared humanity.\n\nBecause some truths are universal. Food, music, sports—these are the ancient, unbreakable codes that bypass borders, beliefs, every arbitrary self-absorbed monument that we build.\n\nThey are the common tongue. And in this temple of that truth, Threads made its stand, not with a mere press release, but with a party.\n\nAt the center sat Connor Hayes, Head of Threads, a man whose love for basketball was the engine of this experiment. His was not a corporate passion. It was born in the upper deck of the old Boston Garden, a childhood etched with the struggles of a bad Celtics team and the singular obsession with a player like Ron Mercer.\n\n\"I've been watching…I could watch all 82 games of that team,\" Hayes said. His fan's heart still beats beneath a builder's hoodie.\n\nFor him, Threads was a chance to rebuild the digital arena as it should be: a \"second screen\" where the community's roar during a Wembanyama highlight feels electric, intimate.\n\n\"I have a ton of people that I've met through Threads who are also Celtics fans,\" Hayes shared, describing a group chat that spanned from the Philippines to Brazil. \"One person… made Joe Mazzulla magnets for everybody and mailed them to them. That's the kind of magic we're trying to create.\"\n\nHis vision is to formalize the fellowship fans have already forged. To add the flair of team loyalty, so \"you know who you're dealing with.\"\n\nTo move from hot takes to heartfelt bonds.\n\nThis event, Hayes noted, was about \"the intersection of podcasts that are growing, communities that are growing on Threads, and commentators that we think speak to us.\"\n\nAnd into this curated crucible stepped the day's hosts. Matt Barnes. Stephen Jackson. And their guest, the formidable, unfiltered Kendrick Perkins.\n\nThe podcast taping of \"All the Smoke\" became a séance.\n\nThe proverbial smoke cleared not to obscure, but to reveal.\n\nPerkins, the ESPN persona known for volcanic takes, softened into something more vulnerable, more valuable.\n\nHe spoke of the athlete's tunnel vision, a poignant regret that hung in the perfumed air.\n\n\"One of my biggest regrets as a player,\" Perkins confessed, \"we may pass people up, they may give us their business cards. We keep it moving… Now we're in this space… those business cards actually mean something.\"\n\nIt was a stunning admission of life deferred, of human connections missed in the single-minded pursuit of the game.\n\nHe dissected the alchemy of team chemistry not with cold stats, but with the warmth of memory. He shared where things went awry in Oklahoma City.\n\n\"After you won a championship, man, you think you was the reason why. Everybody in the locker room think they was the reason.\"\n\nHis analysis was layered, empathetic, and born of experience. This was the content Threads dreamed of housing: not just debate, but depth. Not just reaction, but reflection.\n\nMeta's Jocelyn Jones, from Threads, watched it fuse into her soft manifesto.\n\n\"We think that Threads can be the place,\" Jones said. \"Where's the conversation that happens around podcasts? There's not a natural place… So, like, why not there be a place for that to happen?\"\n\nSomerville was the answer. It was the \"why not.\"\n\nIt was the physical manifestation of a digital thesis: that discovery is not a fleeting feeling, that discussion is a meal, that community is a melody you feel in your bones.\n\nThe new features on the app are mere signposts. Still, this—this warmth, this whiskey-washed wisdom, the collective silence of onlookers who hung on to every word as \"Big Perk\" peeled back layers of his persona, exposing a vulnerable underbelly, was the destination.\n\nAs Meta updates their code, users of the platform will find convenants in their conversations.\n\nIn a room lit by the glow of screens and content creators, where common threads formed the smells of truffles and heritage wafted, uncommon connections.\n\nThe joy of discovery has found its home. And this, as they say, is just the opening act.",

    "fullText": "Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez has suffered his latest career setback.\n\nThe striker know as Chicharito joined the Red Devils from Mexican side Guadalajara in 2010.\n\nHe took to English football like a duck to water, scoring 20 times during his first season in which United were crowned league champions.\n\nThe Mexican would score a total of 59 goals in 157 matches for United, before leaving the club in 2015.\n\nHernandez moved to Real Madrid on loan in 2014 before spending time at Bayer Leverkusen, West Ham United and Sevilla.\n\nAfter his career in Europe ended, he played four seasons for LA Galaxy in the United States before returning to his native Mexico in 2023.\n\nNonetheless, he could not return to the goalscoring ways that defined the majority of his career, only finding the net three times in 31 matches over two seasons.\n\nTherefore, it probably comes as little surprise that the Mexican side have decided to release the now 37-year-old forward.\n\nPosting on the club’s official Instagram site they commented, “Club Deportivo Guadalajara announces that Javier Hernández Balcázar is ending his second spell as a Chivas player.”\n\nThe Mexican side went on to state, “the bond between Chicharito and the club he loves, which trained him and helped him become a legend in Mexican football, will last forever.”\n\nThe statement continued, “Javier is undoubtedly one of the greatest figures in Mexican football. With the Rebaño, he won the 2006 Apertura League title and the 2010 Bicentennial individual scoring title, before embarking on an international career that led him to success at several of Europe’s most important clubs.”\n\nThe club also thanked him for his “dedication” and “passion” during his second spell at the club.\n\nThe former United star found himself in hot water earlier this year after he made sexist comments online, which he later apologised for.\n\nHis actions resulted in a fine and criticism from the country’s president.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles unleashed a profanity-laced outburst, calling his team's blown lead \"inexcusable\" after a stunning fourth-quarter collapse.",
    "fullText": "It was safe to assume that Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles wouldn't be pleased with the way the Thursday game against the Atlanta Falcons turned out.\n\nTied for first place in December and playing a 4-9 team already out of playoff contention, Tampa Bay had a two-touchdown lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith 1:20 left, Tampa has a 92.8% win probability, according to multiple sources.\n\nA 21-yard pass from Kirk Cousins to David Sills V put Atlanta at the Tampa Bay 36, needing just a field goal to win. Eventually, Atlanta-- aided by an offsides penalty-- drove to Tampa's 25, setting up Zane Gonzalez for a game-winning field goal.\n\nSo everybody watching Bowles' postgame presser knew he'd be upset.\n\nBut even knowing that context, his words were still eye-opening —and not at all PG-rated.\n\nIt started when a reporter asked Bowles what he told his team after this type of loss.\n\n\"It's inexcusable,\" Bowles said.\n\n\"We don't make excuses. We... you gotta *expletive* care enough to where the *expletive* hurts. You gotta *expletive* care enough to where the *expletive* hurts. It's gotta *expletive* mean something to you. It's more than a job. It's your *expletive* livelihood. How well do you know your job? How well can you do your job? We can't sugarcoat that *expletive.* It's in-*expletive*-excusable, and there no *expletive* answer for it. No excuse for it, and that's what you tell them in the locker room. Look in the *expletive* mirror.\"\n\nIt may not eclipse that of former coach Jerry Burns on the list of NFL head coach press conference rants, but by 2025 standards, it was pretty competitive.\n\nSome may not have approved of Bowles' use of profanity in a professional setting such as a press conference. However, one thing most will agree with Bowles on, is that Tampa's loss was \"inexcusable.\"\n\nNot too long ago, Tampa Bay was 5-1. It came into Thursday Night Football having lost five of seven and not only needing a win to jump back into sole possession of first place, but simply to remember what winning feels like.\n\nNow, the Carolina Panthers (7-6) are in the driver's seat, with a chance to add to their new NFC South lead Sunday in New Orleans.\n\nThe good news is that Tampa has a crack at Carolina next Sunday at 1, with a chance to move into a tie for first place.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, Bowles will have more reason to use profanity.",

    "fullText": "One former Premier League star believes that Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is now under some huge pressure.\n\nIt comes off the back of a 2-1 defeat to Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday night, which followed up some other poor results as well, including a 3-1 defeat against Leeds United a week before in the Premier League.\n\nRight now, they need to bounce back, that has to be the main focus, and that can start against Everton tomorrow afternoon in their next Premier League match.\n\nFormer Arsenal star Paul Merson has predicted that Chelsea will win this game 2-1, but he is certainly not sounding too convincing about those predictions.\n\nBut Merson has also gone on to say that he now feels that Maresca and Chelsea are under huge pressure and that this game has become massive for them at the weekend after the recent slump in form.\n\nEnzo Maresca discusses his half time changes.\n\nWriting for Sportskeeda, Merson says:\n\n“This is a huge game for Enzo Maresca. If Chelsea don’t win this football match, they could be out of the top six. After beating Barcelona and producing a spirited display against Arsenal, Chelsea have failed to kick on. They have lost two out of their last three games in all competitions and are under huge pressure.\n\n“It’s not long ago that they were still within touching distance of Arsenal, but look at them now. If they lose this game, Everton will go above them in the points table. There are at least five teams who can move ahead of Chelsea, if they fail to win this weekend.\n\n“Everton have looked good in recent weeks, apart from that shocking loss at home to Newcastle United. They went to Bournemouth and won quite comfortably – something Chelsea failed to do in their last league game. If Maresca wins this game, he can play his fringe players in the Carabao Cup quarter-final against Cardiff City on Tuesday. But if he doesn’t, he will be forced to play his strongest team in that game.”",

    "fullText": "Former England striker Wayne Rooney says he received death threats when he made the move from boyhood club Everton to Manchester United.\n\nAged 18, Rooney signed for the Red Devils in a £27m deal in 2004 after turning down a club record contract offer from the Toffees.\n\nBut Rooney's move from Merseyside led to a heavy backlash from some Everton supporters.\n\n\"I got death threats,\" Rooney said on the latest episode of BBC Sport's The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"My parents' house was getting spray painted and smashed up. My girlfriend at the time, wife now, her house was getting spray painted.\n\n\"I think that's where you have to be mentally strong. The people around you have to help.\n\n\"Leaving was difficult because I went to Manchester United, and Liverpool and Manchester was a big rivalry so that made it a lot more difficult.\n\n\"But I was always of a mindset of 'I don't care'. I knew what I wanted and I knew how to get there.\n\n\"I had to stay tough in my mind. This was people from my city so it was tough but I thought 'I don't care', you have to be selfish and make these decisions.\"\n\nWhen Rooney made the move to Manchester United it was at a time with far less social media, the increase of which he feels creates a different kind of pressure on young footballers in the modern game.\n\nRooney's oldest son, Kai, is currently on the books at United and has stressed the importance of making sure he has a strong support network as he looks to make it in professional football.\n\n\"Now the difference is social media,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"When I was young, I was in the local newspapers and so everyone in Liverpool really knew me.\n\n\"Now I have it with my boy who's 16 and he's on social media. He plays for my United, he's sponsored by Puma and there's hundreds of thousands or millions of people watching them when they're that young, and I didn't have that really.\n\n\"Being a young player and going into the first team especially, you're getting judged. Rightly or wrongly, you get judged and that's where you need the people around you, people at the club or your family to keep you in a good place.\n\n\"We can all get carried away with social media as well. So it's really important that the people who are close to you have your best interest. It's the main thing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rooney also revealed that he used to exchange letters with Duncan Ferguson as a child while the Everton striker was in jail for assault.\n\nIn 1995, when Rooney was 10, Toffees striker Ferguson served a 44-day jail term for headbutting Raith Rovers defender John McStay at his previous club Rangers.\n\n\"I was a young boy who supported Everton so I used to write to him in jail, and then he'd write back,\" said Rooney.\n\n\"It was just me telling him how much I love him. [He'd say] 'thanks, it means a lot'. Obviously, when you're in jail as well you take anything.\"\n\nRooney joined Everton's academy in 1996 and made his first-team debut aged 16 in 2002 while Ferguson was still at the club.\n\n\"Because I was too young to drive as well he'd take me home from training,\" Rooney added.\n\n\"My family were all massive Evertonians, so Duncan Ferguson used to take me home to my mum's house and my dad was out the window [waving]. So that was surreal.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "AFC Champions League Match Day 6 proved to be one of mixed fortunes for K League sides, with no wins recorded in ACL Elite. It also saw FC Seoul bid farewell to Jesse Lingard who was making his final appearance for the club.\n\nIt was a winless match day for K League sides in ACL Elite. Ulsan HD suffered a 3-1 away loss to Machida Zelvia, in a match that saw former Horangi Oh Se-hun score the Japanese side's third goal. Ulsan found themselves 2-0 behind with just 21 minutes on the clock, and 3-0 down just two minutes into the second half. Um Won-sang linked up with Gustav Ludwigson for what was a consolation goal 10 minutes after the restart. Ulsan remain in the top eight, the qualification places for the knockouts, but only just, holding a one-point lead over ninth.\n\nGangwon FC picked up what will be seen as the pick of the results for K League sides in Match Day 6, earning a 2-2 draw away to Thai giants Buriram United. Mo Jae-hyun's close-range effort gave the Bears a 33rd-minute lead, only for former Daejeon and Bluewings centre back Ko Myeong-seok to level on 58 minutes. Buriram took the lead on 65 through Mueanta before Kim Dae-won rescued a point with a 74th-minute penalty. Gangwon sit outside the top eight but by just a point.\n\nIn what was Jesse Lingard's final match for FC Seoul, the former England international marked the occasion with a goal in a 1-1 draw with Melbourne City. Lingard gave Seoul the lead on 31 minutes, but Kanamori's goal on 74 minutes meant the spoils were shared. Seoul sit fifth, but only two points clear of ninth\n\nA strong and experienced Pohang Steelers squad travelled to the Philippines for the Group H closer. In a game that could be Ki Sung-yueng's last ever before retiring, a 12-minute cameo off the bench, Pohang earned a 1-0 away win courtesy of a goal from An Jae-jun 17 minutes in. After a year of injury struggles, An's match-winner at least ended 2025 on a high for him and for the Steelers who will now await the draw for the Round of 16. Tampines Rovers beat BG Pathum United 2-0 in the other Group H match, meaning that the Steelers finished as group runners-up.",

    "fullText": "Following the Bucs’ 29-28 loss to the Atlanta Falcons Thursday night, their second defeat to a team eliminated from contention in four days, coach Todd Bowles unloaded on his club with a profanity-laced assessment that questioned how much some players cared about the way they’re going about their jobs.\n\n“It’s inexcusable. We don’t make excuses,” Bowles said. “You’ve got to f--king care enough where this s--t hurts. It’s got to f--king mean something. It’s more than a job, it’s your f--king livelihood. How well do you know your job, how well can you do your job? You can’t sugarcoat that s--t. It was in-f--king-excusable. There is no f--king answer for it.\n\n“That’s what you tell them in the locker room. Look in the f--king mirror.”\n\nLeading 28-14 in the fourth quarter, the Bucs couldn’t finish the game, and now their season may be ending soon as well.\n\nThe offense had a chance to run the final 3:29 seconds off the clock but managed only one first down.\n\nThen they had the lead but not the football. The Bucs defense had the Falcons and Kurt Cousins facing third and 28 and fourth and 14.\n\nHaason Reddick even sacked Cousins and forced a fumble that he appeared to recover, but officials ruled simultaneous possession and the ball remained with the Falcons.\n\nThe veteran quarterback led Atlanta on a nine-play, 45-yard drive capped by Zane Gonzalez’s game-winning 43-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nThe defeat dropped the Bucs to 7-7 and forfeited their season-long lead in the NFC South to the Carolina Panthers (7-6), who play New Orleans on Sunday.\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield took the blame for the loss, particularly handing the ball back to Atlanta when he threw a fourth-quarter interception trying to hit Emeka Egbuka while leading by eight points.\n\n“Disappointing, obviously, but falls on my shoulders,” Mayfield said. “Can’t turn the ball over. Can’t have that interception. Got to hit Mek in stride on that third down.\n\n“Listen, you can say what you want about being up two scores and the defense right there. We have to be better on offense. It comes down to how I play. This one is going to be hard on me. It falls on my shoulders.”\n\nUnbelievably, the Bucs still have a chance to win the NFC South if they just beat the Carolina Panthers twice in the next three weeks.\n\nBut nobody felt like talking about that after dropping back-to-back games to New Orleans and Atlanta in four days.\n\nThe Bucs lost because the defense had no answers for Falcons tight end Kyle Pitts and running back Bijan Robinson.\n\nPitts had 11 catches for 166 yards and three touchdowns. Robinson rushed for 93 yards and a score and caught eight passes for 82 yards.\n\nThe Bucs lost despite Atlanta doing everything they could to give the game away. They had 19 accepted penalties for 125 yards. They fumbled three times, losing one.\n\nBut Cousins passed for 373 yards and three touchdowns and was only sacked once.\n\nThe loss spoiled terrific returns to the lineup by Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan.\n\nIt was impossible to remember just how much the Bucs missed Mike Evans — not truly, not completely — until he returned Thursday to remind us all.\n\nFifty-two days after breaking his collarbone in Detroit, the greatest offensive player in club history stepped back onto the field and lifted his team as only he can. He turned routine throws into first downs, back-shoulder throws into momentum and turned the Bucs back into themselves.\n\nEvans’ first three catches resulted in first downs. But it was his grab of a 45-yard bomb in which he leaped over defensive back Cobee Bryant that set up the Bucs’ go-ahead touchdown — a 6-yard pass to tight end Devin Culp, his first catch of the season.\n\nWhen Jacob Parish recovered a fumble by Bijan Robinson at the Atlanta 25-yard line, it was Evans who drew a pass-interference penalty to lead the Bucs to Chris Godwin’s TD and two-point conversion.\n\nEvans finished with six catches for 132 yards.\n\nThe Bucs had an eight-point and the ball near midfield when Mayfield was intercepted by Dee Alford with 8:22 remaining.\n\nCousins drove the Falcons 67 yards in 10 plays, hitting Pitts in the corner of the end zone for a 7-yard touchdown. The two-point conversion pass attempt failed.\n\nThe Bucs managed to get one first down on the ensuing drive, but Bucky Irving was dropped for a 4-yard loss on first down, and Mayfield threw incomplete to Egbuka before he was sacked on third down.\n\nIt looked as though Reddick ended the game when he sacked Cousins and forced a fumble. But officials ruled the ball belonged to the Falcons.\n\nEven so, there was no excuse for not ending the game on defense when the Falcons were faced with third and 28 and fourth-and-14. But Cousins hit David Sills for 21 yards and a first down.\n\nThat basically put the Falcons within range of Gonzalez’s game-winner.\n\nat Panthers, 1 p.m. Dec. 21 TV/radio: Fox; 97.9-FM\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "title": "LA Bowl Opponent Q&A: Boise State Broncos",
    "description": "Aiden Petterson of Mountain West Connection joins me to talk Boise State football!",
    "fullText": "Ahead of the LA Bowl on Saturday, I caught up with Aiden Petterson of Mountain West Connection, to get the skinny on the Broncos ahead of the showdown on Saturday night in SoFi Stadium!\n\nMS: This is the second full season for Spencer Danielson at the head of the Bronco football program. He capped off this season with the Broncos’ 3rd straight MWC title, and a 9-4 record. What do you like about the job that Danielson has done?\n\nAP: You have to give credit to him for retaining pivotal players that have gone on to make an impact the following season. The most obvious example being Ashton Jeanty refraining from entering the transfer portal prior to last year’s College Football Playoff appearance. Danielson has been a member of the Boise State staff in some capacity since 2017, working his way up from graduate assistant to defensive ends coach before finally earning the title of defensive coordinator in 2021. He has lived the mentality that he preaches week in and\nweek out, and despite some of his cliches becoming tiresome after underwhelming performances, he is as true as they come. I also think we have to remind ourselves that this is his first stint as a big-time college football coach and that there are going to be bumps and bruises along the way.\n\nMS: This is the Broncos’ first season without Ashton Jeanty or Dirk Koetter since 2022. Nate Potter has stepped into that OC role nicely, with the Broncos averaging 31.4 points per game on offense. What does he do differently than Koetter, and who are the major weapons on offense that Maddux Madsen has to throw to?\n\nAP: Nate Potter is growing into his own skin as a play-caller, but there have been growing pains. During the beginning portion of the season, the offense was very dependent on runs designed to operate between the tackles. However, there was very little motion to keep defenses honest, allowing them to hone in Boise State’s stable of running backs – Dylan Riley, Sire Gaines, and Malik Sherrod. Dirk Koetter was very much of the mindset that prioritized creating an offensive gameplan that centered around his players’ strengths. Potter began to branch out during October and November, but a leg injury suffered by QB Maddux Madsen forced him to go back to vanilla concepts. More than anything, this offense is much more efficient when facing third-and-medium or better. Converting long -distance situations- not so much. As for who Madsen has at his disposal on the perimeter, there isn’t one certified top dog in the receiver room. Many hoped that former five-star recruit Chris Marshall would have a breakout year, but that did not materialize. Ben Ford was having a surprise campaign, yet a season-ending injury cut his year short. The three receivers that continue to be Madsen’s favorites are slot receiver Latrell Caples (46 receptions, 547 yds, 3 TDs), Chase Penry (27 receptions, 363 yds, 1 TD), and Cameron Bates (18 receptions, 307 yds, 1 TD). However, keep an eye out for Boise State’s tight end duo that features Matt Lauter (32 receptions, 293 yds, 1 TD) and Matt Wagner (22 receptions, 239 yds, 1 TD). And there is one true freshman named Quinton Brown who has seen more action as of late and was responsible for a vital 66-yard touchdown in the Broncos’ win over Utah State.\n\nMS: Erik Chinander and Tyler Stockton coordinate the defense, which is anchored by DB Ty Benefield, who leads the team with 98 tackles. What does this defense do schematically, and who are the other playmakers that the Huskies need to watch out for?\n\nAP: The Broncos are known for planting bodies inside the box and limiting opposing rushing attacks. More often than not, they implement a four-man front while making sure to set the edge against opposing tackles. Defensive coordinator Erik Chinander loves to show pressure prior to the snap, and when he is feeling it,\nhe’ll commit to the bit. But, they will simulate said pressure and then fall back into a zone concept when defending the chains. In recent years, Boise State has been burnt downfield by opposing speedy wideouts, but according to Pro Football Focus, they have graded higher than an 80 four times in 2025 when it comes to their pass coverage. Player-wise, the defensive line is led by EDGE Jayden Virgin-Morgan (52 tackles and four sacks) and DL Braxton Fely (22 tackles and 5.5 sacks). The latter is a monster within the interior of the Broncos’ front and is an absolute run-stuffer. Moving to the secondary, DB Ty Benefield (98 tackles and two interceptions) is a hard-hitting Swiss Army Knife while the combo effort of Jeremiah Earby and A’Marion McCoy resulted in eight interceptions. However, McCoy is out for the remainder of the year due to a knee injury, paving the way for youngster Sherrod Smith to step into the limelight. Notre Dame transfer Jaden Mickey has also been a nice addition to an improved backline.\n\nMS: With this season winding down, and it being the Broncos’ last in the Mountain West, are fans excited to go to the newly reloaded PAC 12? What are the prospects like for Boise State as a member of that conference, both next year and beyond?\n\nAP: I certainly think you sense enthusiasm for the move, even if the sought-after Pac-12 invitation came via a different scenario than what it was a decade ago. Boise State has been a part of the Mountain West for nearly 15 years, and it does feel as though the relationship between them and the conference has run its course. Former commissioner Craig Thompson carved out a Boise State-specific media “sweetheart” deal that awarded the Broncos an additional $1.8 million per year, something that as time wore on, was looked at with more disdain from its fellow members. The flagship program is always going to be looked at in a unique way, but with conference realignment seemingly never ending, it felt as though this was a life raft worth taking, especially with the Gonzaga Bulldogs joining in every non-football sport. Frankly, this was a chance to join a conference full of like-minded schools that are willing to spend and be competitive year in and year out. On the football side of things, I am bullish on the Broncos’ chances to win its first Pac-12 championship in 2026. San Diego State is 9-3, Fresno State is 8-4, Utah State is 6-6, and Colorado State is 2-10. Combine that with Texas State finishing 6-6, Washington State being 6-6, and Oregon State limping to a 2-10 record, and the opportunity feels ripe for the taking. Beyond next year, the Broncos should be able to maintain their recent recruiting highs as they finished this cycle with their highest-rated class in school history, ranking 51st in the country and ahead of Arkansas, Kentucky, UCLA, Wisconsin, and California. Boise State, barring some unforeseen collapse, should consistently finish inside the top three of the conference standings, reach ten wins, and be in the conversation for a College\nFootball Playoff bid.\n\nMS: It’s score prediction time! What will the score be in another installment of Huskies v.\nBroncos, this time in the City of Angels?\n\nAP: My heart wants to take the blue and orange, but my mind says otherwise. There isn’t one specific stat or player that makes me think that Washington has a massive edge, but it is actually the lack of a recent P4 win for Boise State that makes me hesitate to take the leap of faith. The Broncos’ last win against a “big-time” school came against Florida State back in 2019 when Hank Bachmeier was a true freshman starting his first game in Tallahassee. This is the same Bachmeier that eventually transferred to Louisiana Tech before finishing his college career at Wake Forest. Since that win at Doak Campbell Stadium, the Broncos have lost to Washington (2019 Las Vegas Bowl), Oklahoma State (2021), Oregon State (2022), Washington (2023), UCLA (2023 LA Bowl), Oregon (2024), Penn State (2024 CFP Quarterfinal), and Notre Dame (2025).\n\nI need to see it to believe it.\n\nThank you Aiden, and good luck to the Broncos in this game, and in the brand new PAC 12!",

    "description": "Six different goal scorers contributed for the Avalanche.",
    "fullText": "Tonight, the Colorado Avalanche welcomed the Florida Panthers into Denver after coming home from a road trip. This was the first of two regular-season matchups between these two teams, which the Avs won by a total score of 6-2 with goals from Sam Malinski, Brock Nelson, Gavin Brindley, Nathan MacKinnon Artturi Lehkonen and Gabe Landeskog.\n\nLet’s take a look at all the action from tonight!\n\nSam Malinski was the one to get the scoring started for Colorado in this game, and he snuck the puck past Florida netminder Daniil Tarasov just over a minute into the first period. Martin Necas would find Malinski in the slot with a beautiful cross-ice feed, and Malinski was able to sneak it past the goalkeeper.\n\nMalinski squeeks one in early! pic.twitter.com/UG3tUs2jjz\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nNoah Gregor would then respond for the Panthers, as he came flying into the Avalanche zone down the wing, and managed to elevate the puck past Mackenzie Blackwood to tie the game at 1-1 before the halfway mark of the first period.\n\nwhat a beauty for his FIRST as a cat 😼 pic.twitter.com/hXsSrGP8sv\n\n— Florida Panthers (@FlaPanthers) December 12, 2025\n\nBrock Nelson would the score the go-ahead goal for Colorado just before the end of the period, and what was ultimately the game-winning goal, as he battled in front of the Avalanche net and was able to just find some space between the goalie and the post, and poke the puck past Tarasov. Colorado held a 2-1 advantage at that time.\n\nBrock battled in front 🚨 pic.twitter.com/8JSzFfqade\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nGavin Brindley would get in on the scoring action next, as Brent Burns once again turned back the clock, flew into the zone down the wing and put a shot on net, creating a big rebound for Brindley to jump on, as he was able to put it into a near empty net to go up 3-1.\n\nWould you believe us if we said Brent Burns just got an assist to someone (Brindley) who wasn't born yet when he was drafted?\n\nBecause it's true. pic.twitter.com/eE8aparvI9\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nSoon after Brindley scored, Nathan MacKinnon continued to add to his absolutely ridiculous season and gave Colorado a three-goal lead, as he let the puck fly from the point, and managed to beat Tarasov clean.\n\nIt's what the Dogg does 🐶 pic.twitter.com/gpcja7kN4v\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nGavin Brindley would get on the score sheet again on this goal, as he sprung Artturi Lehkonen for a breakaway, and when you have nothing but time and space in front of the net, that one’s pretty easy for Lehkonen, and it was suddenly 5-1. The game was pretty much over by that point but why not add a little meaningless drama with a Martin Nečas power play goal which was challenged by Florida and called back due to an offside call. The second period ended with Colorado up 5-1.\n\nLehky on the breakaway! pic.twitter.com/4KnITM5iTj\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nFlorida started off the period with an overturned goal of their own as Eetu Luostarinen had a kicked-in goal taken off the board. At this point Colorado could truly coast, but a little insurance is always nice, as Gabe Landeskog got on the board as he got to stare down an empty net, and that one is also pretty easy.\n\nLandy adds on to the lead! pic.twitter.com/cmyq1kGcYm\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nFlorida would get a garbage-time goal as well, as AJ Greer was able to make a ridiculous pass to Mackie Samoskevich, who would put the puck into an empty net, to arrive at the final score of 6-2. Also, Nathan MacKinnon received a penalty shot late in the third period and his shot was saved by Tarasov, not that the Avalanche needed to pad their victory even more, and the game was finally over.\n\nCats get one back pic.twitter.com/DV7aY9ZGha\n\n— Florida Panthers (@FlaPanthers) December 12, 2025\n\nLet’s be honest, this game was over by the time the second period ended. Colorado got out to a really quick start in the first, and for a moment, this game looked like it might be a 3-1 win or a 4-3 overtime win after the Panthers responded and the Avs had to fight and claw a bit for the go-ahead goal. After the first period, though, Colorado just decided that the game was over, and scored accordingly, or that’s what it felt like anyway. In the third period, they were able to coast their way to another win and became the first team in the NHL to cross the 50-point threshold on the season. The one issue tonight, as it’s been for the past few games, was the power play once again. Martin Nečas dud technically score on the man advantage but Colorado officially went 0/3 on the night, Not that it rightly mattered in this game, given the final score, but the power play continued to struggle once again.\n\nNext up, the Colorado Avalanche get another shot at the Nashville Predators, as those two teams play again on Saturday at Ball Arena. Puck drop will be at 7:00 p.m. MT.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Clippers entered Thursday night's game in Houston looking to snap out of their season-long struggles, but once again came up short in a game that went down to the wire.\n\nDespite strong efforts from their star players, the Clippers fell to the Houston Rockets 115-113 at the Toyota Center in a contest that had no shortage of late-game chaos.\n\nWith the loss, the Clippers dropped to 6-19 on the season and remain near the bottom of the Western Conference, while the Rockets improved to 16-6 and continue to establish themselves as one of the top teams in the West.\n\nThe game was tied at 110 with less than 30 seconds remaining when the Rockets had possession, and after a wild sequence of missed shots and offensive rebounds, Amen Thompson finally grabbed the ball and put in a layup while drawing a foul.\n\nHe knocked down the free throw to give Houston a 113-110 lead with just 17.2 seconds left on the clock.\n\nFrom there, the Clippers could never recover despite their best efforts to claw back.\n\nThe ending sequence was messy for both teams.\n\nAmen Thompson with a huge play with 17.2 sec left pic.twitter.com/cGFugIbSG4\n\n— ClutchFans (@clutchfans) December 12, 2025\n\nAfter Ivica Zubac made one of two free throws to cut the deficit to two, Jabari Smith Jr. elbowed Kris Dunn after grabbing the rebound and gave the ball back to the Clippers.\n\nThen, with a chance to tie or take the lead, Kawhi Leonard drove into the paint but was called for an offensive foul after shoving Aaron Holiday.\n\nThe Clippers challenged the call but were unsuccessful, and the Rockets held on from there.\n\nEven though the Clippers came away with the loss, there were some bright spots from their top players.\n\nZubac was a force all night long, finishing with a team-high 33 points while dominating in the paint. Leonard added 24 points as he continues to show he can still be one of the best players in the league when healthy, and James Harden chipped in 22 points in his return to Houston where he spent eight seasons.\n\nIVICA ZUBAC TONIGHT:\n\n33 POINTS\n7 REBOUNDS\n2 BLOCKS\n13/14 FG\n\n(via @realapp) pic.twitter.com/aXCTojLFs9\n\n— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) December 12, 2025\n\nThe Clippers actually led 82-80 heading into the fourth quarter after Leonard and Zubac combined to carry the offense through three quarters.\n\nHowever, the Rockets stormed back in the final period with a 10-0 run early in the fourth that gave them the momentum they needed to pull away.\n\nThe Clippers will need to regroup quickly as their struggles continue to pile up in what has been a season to forget so far. Their veteran-heavy roster has dealt with injuries and inconsistency throughout the year, and close losses like this one make it even harder to climb out of the hole they've dug themselves.\n\nTy Lue WAS made available tonight to media, but there was nobody in the press room in Houston, the Clippers said.\n\nThere was no traveling media with the team tonight. https://t.co/lhFoCBu9ip\n\n— Grant \"Money\" Mona (@Gmona48) December 12, 2025\n\nThe two teams will meet again on December 23 in Los Angeles when the Clippers will look for revenge on their home floor.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nJeremy Lin took the NBA world by storm midway through the 2011-12 season when he moved into the New York Knicks' starting lineup and put together an extended stretch of big-scoring games. He had gone undrafted in 2010 out of Harvard University, not exactly a high-level basketball school, and was a seemingly invisible rookie with the Golden State Warriors, but he seemingly shot himself out of a cannon with New York.\n\nIt sparked a phenomenon people referred to as \"Linsanity,\" and even after the rest of the league adjusted to him and his production regressed to a more consistent mean, a sizable amount of the hype surrounding him remained.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the rebuilding Lakers acquired Lin in a trade with the Houston Rockets. By now, he was straddling the line between a low-tier starting point guard and a very solid reserve point guard. He played one season with the Lakers and started in 30 of 74 games while averaging 11.2 points and 4.6 assists in 25.8 minutes a game.\n\nHe left L.A. following that season and would have short stints with the Charlotte Hornets, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors before his NBA career ended. He finished with league career averages of 11.6 points on 43.3% field-goal shooting and 4.3 assists in 25.5 minutes a game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 17 — Jeremy Lin",

    "fullText": "The January transfer window is already taking shape and few names carry as much intrigue as Antoine Semenyo. An original report by Sami Mokbel of BBC Sport lays out the landscape clearly, with Liverpool firmly positioned among the clubs weighing their next move as Bournemouth brace for serious interest in their forward.\n\nSemenyo’s situation is defined by clarity. Interested clubs know the terms, “a release fee of £65m that can be activated for around the first two weeks of the month.” That certainty sharpens decision making and removes the prolonged negotiation phases that Liverpool traditionally prefer, placing pressure on timing and conviction.\n\nLiverpool’s interest is framed heavily by uncertainty around Mohamed Salah. As BBC Sport states, “the uncertainty over Mohamed Salah’s future at Anfield has cast a deeper glare on Liverpool’s interest in Semenyo.” That context matters, but it does not tell the full story.\n\nWell placed sources told BBC Sport that “a Liverpool move for Semenyo was in the offing” as early as October, long before Salah’s comments following the 3-3 draw with Leeds. This reinforces the sense that Liverpool’s recruitment planning runs independently of short term noise, even when that noise involves a generational forward.\n\nThe report adds that “Liverpool’s interest in the Ghana international pre-existed the current hullabaloo that is surrounding Salah,” while also noting the club remain “well-stocked with attacking talent.” That balance explains why interest does not automatically translate into urgency.\n\nAge and planning are also factors. “Salah is 33 and Liverpool are acutely aware that they need a plan in place for when he leaves.” From a financial standpoint, “it would be less of a strain if they signed Semenyo in the same window that Salah departs,” a scenario that remains possible given Salah’s looming Africa Cup of Nations involvement and Semenyo’s availability.\n\nManchester City’s presence adds competitive tension. BBC Sport notes that “there have been indications in recent weeks that City’s interest in Semenyo is the most solid as January approaches.” A fixed price suits City’s recent approach, avoiding bidding wars and sticking to internal valuations.\n\nSporting incentives also feature. Joining a club “in the midst of a Premier League title race with Arsenal” offers an immediate appeal, particularly when Liverpool’s season has been described as inconsistent. Arsenal and Manchester United, despite admiration, appear less likely to prioritise a move given squad balance and financial focus elsewhere.\n\nTottenham’s interest is real, and sources suggest their proposed package “could be the most personally lucrative to the player.” However, the report is clear that if Semenyo prioritises sporting success, “Liverpool or City would likely provide him with a better chance of fulfilling his ambitions.”\n\nRemaining at Bournemouth remains possible, but only if no club activates the clause. As BBC Sport concludes, the club are “effectively powerless” if that threshold is met, with delaying the inevitable “the best Bournemouth can hope for.”\n\nFrom a Liverpool supporter’s perspective, this report reads like classic Anfield pragmatism. Semenyo is admired, tracked, and understood, but not chased recklessly. That £65m clause feels significant, especially in January, and supporters will recognise that Liverpool rarely move early unless the fit is exact.\n\nSalah’s future naturally hovers over everything. Yet many supporters will agree that Liverpool planning beyond him is sensible rather than disloyal. Semenyo’s profile, physical, direct, Premier League proven, fits the league, but the price demands certainty.\n\nUltimately, this feels like Liverpool staying informed rather than being pulled into a market rush. If circumstances align, the move makes sense. If not, supporters will trust that the club’s long term vision, sharpened by recent success, will guide them towards the right call.",

    "description": "DJI wants its required audit before it's too late.",
    "fullText": "With just weeks left before DJI’s products will be banned in the United States pending a last-second security audit, as mandated by law, DJI is pulling out all the stops and imploring federal officials to take the necessary actions.\n\nIn a letter addressed to very high-ranking federal officials Kash Patel (Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), Lt. Gen. William Hartman (Acting Director of the National Security Agency), Tulsi Gabbard (Director of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence), and Pete Hegseth (Secretary of the Department of War), DJI’s Head of Global Policy, Adam Welsh, urges any relevant agency of the federal government initiate the security review of DJI Technology products, as mandated by Congress under Section 1709 of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\n“With less than one month left before the December 23, 2025 deadline, we urge you to take up this audit immediately to avoid any negative consequences to American drone users, including our public safety and law enforcement officers, and to provide them with answers about the security of DJI products,” Welsh writes.\n\nWelsh continues, stating that DJI’s position on the audit “has never wavered,” and that the company is prepared to work with the federal government, maintain complete transparency, and provide all necessary information to complete the review.\n\n“To date, these offers have gone unanswered, and public reports suggest that this audit has not yet commenced,” Welsh writes. “With time running out, we once again are calling for this audit to take place immediately to avoid the automatic addition of DJI products to the FCC’s ‘Covered List’ that would take place if the audit is not completed by December 23.”\n\nWelsh argues that if DJI’s products are added to the FCC’s “Covered List,” resulting in their ban from the American market, it would lead to widespread consumer confusion and “deprive American drone users of due process — and of answers about the safety and security of the DJI products they use every day.”\n\n“Failing to undertake the review further goes against Congressional intent for a security review to be completed,” Welsh says, before explaining that DJI is confident that its products can withstand any U.S. government scrutiny.\n\nDJI’s products have already gone under audits before, including from some U.S. government agencies like the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Idaho National Laboratory at the direction of the Department of Homeland Security. Kristi Noem, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, also received a separate, mostly identical letter from DJI.\n\nIn that letter, Welsh notes that Noem had indicated “through written communication” in September that her agency was willing to work with DJI. DJI notes that more than 80% of state and local law enforcement and emergency services in the U.S. operate drone programs that rely on DJI technology.\n\n“We stand behind the security of our technology, and with time running out, we are keen to meet with you and ensure that this Congressionally-mandated security review takes place as soon as possible. My team and I are available at any time to provide information that may be helpful and ensure that a fair and thorough audit is indeed carried out before it is too late,” Welsh concludes. “The American people, including those who use DJI drones for their jobs, for their livelihoods, or for ensuring the safety and security of our communities, deserve no less.”\n\nIf the required audit is not initiated or completed by December 23, 2025, DJI’s drones will be automatically added to the FCC’s Covered List, as required by federal law, and will therefore be banned from entering the United States. As of now, with less than three weeks left before the deadline, the situation looks dire for DJI.",

    "fullText": "One of my wife's guilty pleasures is reality TV, usually ones centred around dating - the more American, the better. By extension, I absorb some of this noise and I'm happy to admit I can sometimes get invested.\n\nAt one point, she was (let's face it, we were) watching a show called \"Are you the one?\" on MTV. I'm going to show you how this game is pretty much free money.\n\nConsider a group of equal numbers of men & women:\n\nEach contestant has exactly one perfect match of the opposite sex that is pre-determined for them, as represented by the colours. Click the \"Match\" button to pair up the contestants correctly. Crucially, they don't initially know who their perfect match is. If the group can correctly guess all the perfect matches, they win a cash prize of $1M.\n\nYou probably have the follow up question of how the perfect matches are calculated, which is a great question. In short: dunno, it's black-boxed, but let's just say \"science\"? How this is calculated isn't really the point, I could even argue that it doesn't matter so long as you get your strategy right. For what it's worth, the plot of the TV show mentions employing \"the most extensive match-making process ever seen\".\n\nLet's get into it. Here are the two ways in which contestants can learn new pieces of information throughout the game: truth booths and match ups.\n\nA truth booth is where a male & female are chosen by the contestants, and it is revealed definitively whether they're a perfect match or not. So there are two potential outcomes:\n\nIf you've found a way to stream this and want to skip straight to the good stuff, I'd fast-forward to the fallout from these. In S1E6 it took Shanley an entire episode to come to terms with Chris T & Paige being a perfect match, even though in E1 she learned she was no match with him anyway (sigh).\n\nAt the end of each episode, all contestants match up and they are informed (via dramatic lighting) how many correct matches they've got. If they've got all matches, the game is over and they win.\n\nCrucially, they don't know what the correct matches are, just how many they got in total. The only way they can definitively rule out a pairing is if they scored zero: the dreaded blackout. Though it might seem like a bad thing, a blackout can in fact be helpful in the long-term, as it gives you a definitive answer for all pairs that were matched up, it's like getting a free truth booth for each pair.\n\nMuch like a high school disco, let's put all the boys on one side and the girls on the other, and re-use the pairs from the match up example above:\n\nHere we have two correct pairs red and pink at position 1 and 5 respectively. The orange man at position 2 was paired with the purple woman from position 6, and so on.\n\nHow good is a score of two? Is that any better than if you were to randomly pair people up? Let's experiment by doing just that: click the 'shuffle' button to re-pick:\n\nYou'll notice that the average score comes out at around 1 after a while, which this line chart keeps track of.\n\nBelow is a chart capturing the frequency of each score, you'll notice it eventually converges to a specific shape.\n\nThe height of each outlined bar is the probability of scoring that number in a random pairing in a game of 6 couples. Interestingly, both these probabilities and the average score stay the same no matter how many couples we use.\n\nWhatever the selected # couples, the probability stays this same. There's tonnes of tangents we could explore that you might find interesting here1, but for our purposes we just wanted to put some data behind \"how good is a score of X\".\n\nI created a model that computes the remaining viable matchings of all couples. By 'viable', I mean that there's still a chance that it's the perfect match. Initially, as you can imagine, this is a big number. The aim of the game then becomes getting that number down to 1 as quickly as possible.\n\nEach time new information is learned, we recalculate the remaining matches. For example if we have a positive truth booth result, the remaining matches are filtered out to only those that contain these two people as a pair. Conversely, if the truth booth result was negative, then the remaining matches cannot contain any where these two are paired. Imagine a huge a game of \"Guess Who?\" where each image is a viable matching and you flip down the options that become invalid each time you learn new information. Match ups also massively help you reduce this number, however their impact is a bit more indirect and it's very difficult for a human brain to figure out the implications of the result of one.\n\nHere is a graph of the remaining viable matches in Season 1 as the season progresses. It may surprise you that in this game of 10 men and 10 women, the initial number of viable matches is almost 4 million:\n\nHovering over the dots will tell you what's responsible for that change in the remaining matches. As you can see, they gain enough information to win the game by episode 8, so why does it take them so long to get it right? As mentioned earlier, it's almost impossible for humans to keep tabs on all these potential matchings so it's very likely they just didn't know.\n\nThat being said, the graph itself isn't particularly useful, is it? After a couple of events, the line hugs the x-axis, and it's hard to see the difference between 1 and 5,773 seen in episodes 8 and 2 respectively. Let's try a log base 2 graph:\n\nThat's hopefully a lot clearer. You can see how they learn information as they go, and at which point the model 'cracks it' with the match up in episode 8. You can also clearly see that the most valuable piece of information they gained was the match up in episode 2 - with a decent early score of 4. This might be intuitive to you, but as we found earlier you've got a less than 2% chance of scoring 4 when randomly selecting.\n\nLet's plot this again along with a few more seasons2:\n\nOther than S3 and S7, the contests mathematically learn enough information to win the game with time to spare. Could they have got there sooner though? Could they have chosen better truth booths/match ups to spare us all of the extra episodes of trashy TV? Before I get into this, I need to cover some basics of information theory.\n\nWe're going to revisit the \"Guess Who?\" game now, which you can think of as a simplified version of \"Are you the one?\". Stick with me; the idea is that we can use the more straightforward game mechanics to establish an information theory based strategy that we can then apply to \"Are you the one?\". These two games are similar in that:\n\nConsider an 8x8 grid of potential answers:\n\nNow I'm a terrible artist so I thought I would be able to articulate this more clearly with shapes instead. There are 4 shapes (\n,\n,\n and\n), 2 different types (opaque or outlined), and 8 colours - this makes 64 unique combinations. The aim of the game is to guess the correct answer before your opponent guesses yours. To give yourself the best chance of winning, you need to rule out as many answers as you can, as quickly as you can. Should you then employ a strategy that splits the potential answers in half (e.g \"is it opaque?\"), or something a bit more specific (e.g \"is it an orange star?\"). The latter is high-risk, high-reward, whereas the former will almost always rule out half of the remaining answers.\n\nConsider a bit of information as reducing the problem space by half. That is, by ruling out half the remaining answers. I want to stress that the word bit is a common term in information theory, as opposed to something that might sound less exact as it's intended in this context.\n\nThe opaque question is a sure-fire way of gaining 1 bit of information. On the other hand, let's say you find out that the answer is a which allows you to flip down three quarters of the answers, that's the same as halving the problem space twice and therefore gaining two bits of information.\n\nAs you can see, different answers are more useful than others. \"Opaque?\" rules out half of the remaining answers (1 bit), whereas \"Blue?\" rules out 7/8ths of them (3 bits).\n\nGetting from 64 potential answers to 1 involves halving the problem space 6 times - 64 becomes 32, then 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1. In other words, if you're able to gain 6 bits of information, you'll know for sure what the answer is. This is supported by the fact that the sum of the information gained by asking all three above questions is 6.\n\nLet's simulate an actual game now, keeping tabs on the information gained throughout.\n\nOnce everything but remains, you'll have gained 6 bits of information and can be 100% confident in the answer. Now we know we need to get to 6 bits of information as quickly as possible, our strategy becomes picking the question that we expect to give us the most information. That is, the sum of the information we would gain if that answer were true or false, multiplied by the probability of that specific outcome. Let's work through our three questions to give the expected information for each:\n\nThis table shows the expected information for each of our 3 questions. As you can see, the more \"Hail Mary\" the question, the lower expected information. \"Blue?\" comes out at 0.54, which is almost half the amount of expected information as \"Opaque?\". Therefore, we can speculate that a decent strategy for this game would be to ask questions that split the remaining problem space in half. To support this, we can plot a graph3 for all possible probabilities between 0 and 1:\n\nThis shows that splitting the problem space in half (where the probability is 0.5), gives the highest expected information. This means that asking a very specific question like \"Blue?\" is statistically the worst thing you can do.\n\nLet's play one final game, this time I'll show you the questions ordered by most to least expected information:\n\nHow did you do? You'll notice that picking the questions at the top of the list gets you to the answer quicker, whereas the opposite is true when picking from the bottom. You'll also notice that you're never presented with a question that gives you more than 1 expected information, which is backed up by the above graph never going higher than 1.\n\nNow we've got a strategy that works well for \"Guess Who?\", we can get back to the proper game.\n\nEarlier on, I posed a (until now) rhetorical question as to the performance of the contestants on the show. In order to answer this question, we need two things:\n\nA way to measure performance: For this, we'll use the average bits gained per event. That is, each time there is a match up or truth booth, how many bits of information did they gain?\n\nA sensible benchmark: How do the contestants stack up against something that employed a strategy of randomly selecting match ups and truth booths?\n\nFor this sensible benchmark, I simulated over 100 fake seasons of \"Are you the one?\" to see how much information was gained if the match ups and truth booths were selected (almost4) arbitrarily.\n\nThe performance of the random simulated models was . Let's plot all the simulations on a graph, with trendlines for random and actual performance:\n\nSo the actual performance hits the x-axis sooner, meaning it's able to zero-in on the perfect match earlier. That's reassuring, right? Maybe love is real after all. That, or they're just performing better than someone shooting fish in a barrel. Here's the numbers behind this comparison:\n\nThe success rate is calculated as the number of seasons in which they're able to mathematically determine the perfect match before the game finishes. As you can see the success rate for the random simulation is higher than in real life. The sample of size of only 7 seasons of \"Are you the one?\" undoubtedly is too small for this to be a useful comparison.\n\nNow that we know the contestants make better decisions than randomly selecting pairings, the remaining question is exactly how much better. To show this, we'll employ our information theory strategy that we used for \"Guess Who?\" to this game.\n\nThis simulation works similarly to the random simulation, only the mechanism for selecting pairings is different. That is, the pairings that are selected for either a truth booth or a match up are the ones that are statistically likeliest to give the most information.\n\nSuppose we have calculated the expected information gained by potential truth booths like below:\n\nThe model would therefore pick and as it's the most likely to give it the most information.\n\nMatch ups work similarly, however we know that it's not a simple true or false question. Instead, we've got to calculate the information we would gain for every score between 0 and 10 (where 10 is the number of couples), for every viable matching.\n\nI ran this information theory simulation 41 times (for no other reason than I got bored waiting), and saw it perform significantly better than random simulation or real life data:\n\nThis means that, all you need is a bit of code and a can-do attitude to perform better than the \"vibes\" approach of the contestants in the show. Before you pop the champagne, we still haven't shown if this is good enough such that we get to the perfect match before we run out of time (or episodes). In a game of , the problem space is (for brevity, you can take my word for this), which is bits of information. This means you would need to gain bits of information per event minimum to ensure that you go into the final match up knowing for certain what the perfect match is.\n\nWait, isn't that a lower number than the random simulation? Doesn't that mean that someone shooting fish in a barrel could win this game? I should stress that these are averages, and in 26% of random simulations they didn't get to there in time.\n\nHopefully now you agree with me that \"Are you the one?\" is free money, albeit with a just about near-perfect success rate. I showed that even picking pairings at random will more often than not give you enough information to win the game, as well as showing how to use classic information theory practices to get you there with episodes to spare. Maybe this haemorrhaging of money is what got the show cancelled in the first place, or maybe love is real, whatever you prefer.\n\nThis post is my first foray into content like this. I wanted to scratch the itch of an interesting maths problem, with a light-hearted spin that I hope you enjoyed as much as I did making it. The techniques shown in this post are very common information theory approaches, though I was inspired to apply them based on this video on wordle by 3Blue1Brown. I very rarely watch youtube videos over 10 minutes long (maybe that's my loss), but I wholly recommend this one if you found this interesting.\n\nOther than that, in my research I came across a boardgame called Mastermind, which has been around since the 70s. This is a very similar premise - think of it as \"Guess Who?\" on hard mode.\n\nI also pitched this idea to The Pudding, and had a great experience with them nerding out about this subject. Though they didn't take my up on my idea, I left with really great and actionable feedback, and I'm looking forward to my next rejection.\n\nNext steps for me would be to see if I can make a web-based game (don't hold me to this) on this theme. I'm interested in how people would intuitively make decisions based on information gained so far so the plan would be to see if I can find a way to capture that, and ideally make it fun.\n\nFinally, the code for my OR Tools model can also be found here.",

    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nWhen a zygote begins cell division at a rapid rate, errors happen, and a new study found that base pairs near a gene’s transcription state sites (TSS) are particularly vulnerable.\n\nFinding this new source of mutation could improve modeling by accurately reflecting the baseline mutations of these vulnerable regions.\n\nThe biological process of a zygote eventually transforming into a living, breathing human is one of the true masterpieces of evolution—but the process is far from perfect. Mutations, malformities, and strange fusions can cause a variety of birth defects and other kinds of biological strangeness (such as chimerism).\n\nNow, in a new study published in the journal Nature Communications, a team of scientists (from the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain, and Harvard Medical School in Boston) has identified a “weakness” in DNA that may drive mosaic mutations—a subset of post-zygotic mutations that can create different cell lines in one person. The vulnerable region is located within the first 100 base pairs following the beginning of genes, which are known as transcription start sites (TSS).\n\n“These sequences are extremely prone to mutations and rank among the most functionally important regions in the entire human genome, together with protein-coding sequences,” Donate Weghorn, the senior author of the study from the Center for Genomic Regulation, said in a press statement. “Finding a new source of mutations, particularly those affecting the human germline, doesn't happen often.”\n\nThe authors discovered that these mosaic mutations usually took place after conception during the first stages of cell division in the embryo. This is similar to chimerism in some respects, but mosaic mutations occur from a single zygote, whereas chimerism typically involves the fusion of two fertilized eggs that create different cell lines.\n\nWhile chimera cells are typically present throughout the entire body, these mosaic mutations are not as evenly distributed, which is why they’ve remained undetected until now. In fact, a person who carries these mutations may never notice due to a lack of symptoms. However, if offspring inherit these genetic changes, they can carry over to every living cell and cause a variety of health issues and defects.\n\nTo uncover this well-hidden vulnerability, scientists relied on the Genome Aggregation Database (which gathers genomic data from a variety of human sequencing projects) and the U.K. Biobank to create a pool of some 225,000 transcription start sites. This data was then cross-referenced with eleven family studies that provided details about mosaic mutations specifically. Within these vulnerable TSS regions, researchers found mutations in the starting regions of genes impacting cancer, brain function, and abnormal limb development.\n\nLuckily, there is some good news. Rare variants of mutations (typically indicating a recent genetic change) contained a particularly strong concentration of mutations, but those changes lessened in more common variants. This suggests that natural selection slowly removed these mutations, and over generations in particular families, they eventually disappeared entirely.\n\nThis research could help improve the challenging study of mosaic mutations, which are hard to pinpoint compared to mutations present in every parent cell. It could also fine-tune genome mutation models, which might currently set the baseline mutation number at these TSS regions too low and thus alter the outcome of the model.\n\n“If a model doesn’t know this region is naturally mutation-rich, it might expect, say, 10 mutations but observe 50. If the correct baseline is 80, then 50 means fewer than expected and is a sign harmful changes are being removed by natural selection,” Weghorn said in a press statement. “You would completely miss the importance of that gene.”\n\nA zygote’s first moment of existence is one of chaos and a building pressure to grow, divide, and grow again. While cells can often repair errors that pop up, some mistakes get left behind. Now, scientists have a whole new area to analyze when trying to solve a mutation mystery.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "A 5,000-year-old ceremonial temple found buried in Peru changes our understanding of early religious practices.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nArchaeologists uncovered a 4,000–5,000-year-old ceremonial temple in Peru, revealing ancient walls, friezes, and a central staircase likely used for early ritual performances.\n\nThe team also found three adult skeletons and a possible offering, offering new clues about early religious practices and a little-known culture that existed before documented Andean civilizations.\n\nA second, later temple from 600–700 A.D. was also discovered, including the remains of a young child, showing how complex belief systems evolved in the region across thousands of years.\n\nArchaeologists recently found the lost ruins of a ceremonial temple—covered in sand and 4,000 to 5,000 years old—in northwestern Peru. The excavation team first discovered the walls, and subsequently unearthed a mix of features indicating that the structure was once a temple. And then came the skeletal remains of three adults tucked between walls.\n\n“We may be facing a 5,000-year-old religious site that constitutes an architectural space defined by walls built by rammed earth,” Luis Armando Muro Ynoñán, director of the Cultural Landscapes Archaeological Project of Ucupe — Valle de Zaña, said in a translated statement from the Peruvian Ministry of Culture.\n\nThe oldest portion of the site features not only the up-to-5,000-year-old walls, but also various architectural features that help define the site as a ceremonial temple. “We have what would have been a central staircase from which one would ascend to a kind of stage in the central part,” Muro Ynoñán said, noting that the stage could have hosted ritual performances in front of an audience.\n\nThe ruins include friezes with images of cats, the claws of a reptile, and a human body with the head of a bird. The designs are preserved in “fine plaster,” which has helped scientists nail down the exact age of the site and the origins of the religion. The team plans to study the chemical makeup of the pigments in the murals painted on the walls to help confirm how old the site is this fall.\n\nBut it wasn’t just architecture located in these sand dunes—there were human remains, too. According to Reuters, the excavation team located the remains of three adult bodies positioned between the walls of the temple. Nearby was also a bundle wrapped in linen that potentially served as an offering.\n\n“It was amazing,” said Muro Ynoñán, according to a statement from the Field Museum in Chicago. “This discovery tells us about the early origins of religion in Peru. We still know very little about how and under which circumstances complex belief systems emerged in the Andes, and now we have evidence about some of the earliest religious spaces that people were creating in this part of the world.”\n\nMuro Ynoñán said that the newfound temple likely contains more information about a people group that predated the known inhabitants of the region. “We don’t know what these people called themselves,” he said, “or how other people referred to them. All we know about them comes from what they created: their houses, temples, and funerary goods.”\n\nThe excavation team was invited to the site after the local government observed looting in the area. “It was so surprising that these very ancient structures were so close to the modern surface,” Muro Ynoñán said. “We think that a large temple was built into the side of the mountain, and we’ve found one section of it.”\n\nArchaeologists also found a more recent temple, dated to sometime between 600 and 700 A.D. Muro Ynoñán believes the second site comes from the Moche culture. This one also features remains—those of a young child, possibly between 5 and 6 years old—but from a more recent time.\n\n“The people here created complex religious systems and perceptions about their cosmos,” Muro Ynoñán said. “Religion was an important aspect of the emergence of political authority.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Newly released videos show six Israeli hostages celebrating Hanukkah in a tunnel in Gaza months before they were killed by Hamas in August 2024.\n\nTwo of the clips show the hostages gingerly lighting makeshift candles on a menorah made of disposable cups. The hostages – Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Ori Danino, and Alex Lobanov – say the Jewish blessings before lighting the candles in what would have been early-December 2023.\n\nIn a video that appears to be from the second night of the holiday, Sarusi smiles at the camera and says, “Now it’s the holiday of Hanukkah. Happy holiday to us and to all the people of Israel. We should celebrate every year and be happy and joyous, and with the help of this holiday’s miracles, we’ll get home with a great miracle, and return to a normal and happy life, and be happy – all of us.”\n\nThe six hostages in the videos were killed as Israeli forces drew closer to their position, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which said at the time that they were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, a short while before we reached them.”\n\nThe incident is widely considered one of the most painful moments of the war for Israelis and sparked fresh outrage at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to secure a hostage deal. Three of the six hostages were expected to be released in the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe videos, released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum on Thursday, provide a glimpse into the life of the hostages during their captivity. All of the videos, which were first aired in full by Channel 12’s UVDA, are watermarked “From materials captured by the IDF.”\n\nThroughout the war, Hamas had released propaganda videos showing Israeli hostages pleading with the Israeli government or US President Donald Trump to secure their release. But these videos and still images, which the forum says were filmed by Hamas, show part of the hostages’ time in the tunnels under Gaza.\n\nIn two short clips, some of the hostages can be seen playing cards or chess while sitting on mats on the floor. In another, a member of Hamas sets some fruit on the floor between the group.\n\nOne video shows the hostages counting down on New Year’s Eve. As they reach zero, they stand up for a group hug as they say “Happy New Year” to each other. The hostages appear relaxed in the clip as they look into the camera and share their hopes for release.\n\n“Happy New year to everyone, all of the families, all of the people of Israel,” says Yerushalmi. “We’re very much waiting to come home.”\n\nGoldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American dual citizen, waves at the camera as he says, “We’re here, healthy, alive – they’re taking care of us, we’re ok. We want to return home.” His left arm, partially blown off in a grenade attack on October 7, 2023, is visible in the video.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the release of the videos, the forum said, “Hamas filmed these videos as propaganda, but the humanity of the beautiful six shines through this footage. The entire world must see our loved ones in these moments, their unity, strength, and humanity even in the darkest times.”",

In Bedford's financial disclosures, he estimated that his Republic stock was worth somewhere between $6 million and $30 million.\n\nRepublic completed a merger last month with another major regional airline, Mesa Air Group. Republic's stock closed Thursday at $19.02, nearly double what it was before the deal was announced in April.\n\n“It appears you continue to retain significant equity in this conflicting asset months past the deadline set to fully divest from Republic, which constitutes a clear violation of your ethics agreement. This is unacceptable and demands a full accounting,” Cantwell said in the letter.\n\nBedford declined a request for comment, and an FAA spokesperson said he plans to respond directly to Cantwell.\n\nThe agency has been in the spotlight since January, when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. The investigation has already highlighted shortcomings at the FAA, which failed to recognize an alarming number of close calls around Reagan National Airport in the years beforehand.\n\nThen, in the spring, technical problems at the center that directs planes into New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport highlighted a fragile and outdated system relied on by air traffic controllers.\n\nAnd in the fall, a longstanding shortage of controllers led to thousands of flight cancellations and delays during the longest government shutdown ever as more controllers missed work while going without a paycheck.\n\nBedford has pledged to prioritize safety and upgrade the nation’s outdated air traffic control system.

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rains drenched Gaza’s tent camps and dropping temperatures chilled Palestinians huddling inside them Thursday as winter storm Byron descended on the war-battered territory, showing how two months of a ceasefire have failed to sufficiently address the spiraling humanitarian crisis there.\n\nFamilies found their possessions and food supplies soaked inside their tents. Children’s sandaled feet disappeared under opaque brown water that flooded the camps, running knee deep in some places. Dirt roads turned to mud. Piles of garbage and sewage cascaded like waterfalls.\n\n“We have been drowned. I don’t have clothes to wear and we have no mattresses left,” said Um Salman Abu Qenas, a displaced mother in a Khan Younis tent camp. She said that her family couldn't sleep the night before, because of the water in the tent.\n\nAid groups say not enough shelter materials are getting into Gaza during the truce. Figures recently released by Israel's military suggest it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, though Israel disputes that finding.\n\n“Cold, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments heighten the risk of illness and infection,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X. “This suffering could be prevented by unhindered humanitarian aid, including medical support and proper shelter.\"\n\nSabreen Qudeeh, also in the Khan Younis camp, in a squalid area known as Muwasi, said that her family woke up to rain leaking from their tent's ceiling and water from the street soaking their mattresses.\n\n“My little daughters were screaming,” she said.\n\nAhmad Abu Taha, also living in the camp, said there wasn't a tent that escaped the flooding. “Conditions are very bad, we have old people, displaced, and sick people inside this camp,” he said.\n\nFloods in south-central Israel trapped more than a dozen people in their cars, according to Hebrew media. Israel's rescue services, MDA, said that two young girls were slightly injured when a tree fell on their school.\n\nThe contrasting scenes with Gaza made clear how profoundly the Israel-Hamas war had damaged the territory, destroying the majority of homes. Gaza’s population of around 2 million is almost entirely displaced, and most people live in vast tent camps stretching along the coast, or set up among the shells of damaged buildings without adequate flooding infrastructure and with cesspits dug near tents as toilets.\n\nAt least three buildings in Gaza City already damaged by Israeli bombardment during the war partially collapsed under the rain, Palestinian Civil Defense said. It warned people not to stay inside damaged buildings, saying they too could fall down on top of them.\n\nThe agency also said that since the storm began, they have received more than 2,500 distress calls from people across Gaza whose tents and shelters were damaged.\n\nWith buckets and mops, Palestinians laboriously scooped water out of their tents.\n\nAliaa Bahtiti said her 8-year-old son \"was soaked overnight, and in the morning he had turned blue, sleeping on water.” Her tent floor had an inch of water on it “We cannot buy food, covers, towels, or sheets to sleep on.”\n\nBaraka Bhar was caring for her 3-month-old twins inside her tent as the rain poured outside. One of the twins has hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluids in the brain.\n\n“Our tents are worn out ... and they leak rain water,” she said. “We should not lose our children this winter.”\n\nAid groups say that Israel isn't allowing enough aid into Gaza to begin rebuilding the territory after years of war.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel agreed to comply with aid stipulations from an earlier January truce, which specified that it allow 600 trucks of aid each day into Gaza, It maintains it's doing so, but The Associated Press found that some of its own figures call that into question.\n\nThe January truce also specified that Israel let in a number of caravans and tents. No caravans have yet entered Gaza during the ceasefire, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli group advocating for Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, said on Dec. 9 it had “lately\" let 260,000 tents and tarpaulins into Gaza and more than 1,500 trucks of blankets and warm clothing.\n\nShelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, sets the number lower. It says the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations have gotten 15,590 tents into Gaza since the truce began, and other countries have sent about 48,000. Many of the tents aren't properly insulated, it says.\n\nAmjad al-Shawa, Gaza chief of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that only a fraction of the 300,000 tents needed had entered Gaza. He said that Palestinians were in dire need of warmer winter clothes and accused Israel of blocking the entry of water pumps to help clear flooded shelters..\n\n\"All international sides should take the responsibility regarding conditions in Gaza,” he said. “There is real danger for people in Gaza at all levels.”\n\nKhaled Mashaal, a Hamas leader, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Gaza needs the rehabilitation of hospitals, the entry of heavy machinery to remove rubble, and the opening of the Rafah crossing — which remains closed after Israel said last week it would shortly open.\n\nCOGAT didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims that Israel wasn’t allowing water pumps or heavy machinery into Gaza\n\nAmnesty accuses Hamas of crimes against humanity\n\nAmnesty International said in a report released Thursday that Hamas and other militant groups committed crimes against humanity in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 173-page report, Amnesty pointed to what it found to be widespread and systematic killing of civilians in the attack, as well as torture, hostage-taking and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the attack, Hamas fighters and other militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 others hostage. Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 70,300 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. Last year, Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denied.\n\nAmnesty said it conducted interviews with 70 people, including 17 survivors of the attack and family members of some of those killed. It also reviewed hundreds of open-source videos and photos from the day of the attack.\n\nContrary to Hamas claims it was targeting the military, it said, the attack was intentionally “directed against a civilian population” and met international law standards for crimes against humanity.\n\nIt said sexual assaults were also committed, though it said it could not reach a conclusion on their “scope or scale.” It interviewed one man who testified he was raped by armed men at the Nova music festival, as well as a therapist who said she provided intensive treatment to three other survivors of rape.\n\nHamas condemned the report, saying it “echoed false claims” by Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister spokesperson Oren Marmorstein derided the report in a posting on X, saying it took more than two years for Amnesty to address the attack “and even now its report falls far short of reflecting the full scope of Hamas’s horrific atrocities.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly two dozen House Republicans joined Democrats Thursday to pass a bill that would restore collective bargaining rights for hundreds of thousands of federal employees, an attempt to overturn an executive order that President Donald Trump issued earlier this year.\n\nThe measure passed 231-195 after reaching the floor through a bipartisan maneuver that bypassed GOP leadership — a so-called “discharge” tactic that is being used with growing frequency as Republicans seethe over dysfunction in the chamber. The bill still needs Senate approval to become law, but 20 Republicans sided with Democrats in a rare break from the president.\n\nThe executive order that Trump issued in March aimed to end collective bargaining for employees of agencies with national security missions across the federal government. He said he had the authority to revoke the rights under a 1978 law.\n\n“Reinstating these rights is not a concession — it is a commitment. A commitment to treat federal workers with dignity, to reinforce a resilient public service, and to honor the commitment of the men and women who show up for the American people every single day,” GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a co-sponsor of the bill, said on the floor before passage.\n\nTrump's order targeted the union rights of roughly 600,000 of the 800,000 federal workers represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, including those at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.\n\nThe union is challenging those moves in court, arguing they are illegal and retaliatory. In May, an appeals court said the administration could move forward with the executive order while the lawsuit plays out.\n\nIn a statement after Thursday's vote, the AFGE said it “extends its deep appreciation to every member of Congress who voted for the bill.” The group's president, Everett Kelley, called it a “seismic victory.”\n\nThe bill's approval was also praised by the AFL-CIO, the biggest labor federation in the U.S.\n\n“We commend the Republicans and Democrats who stood with workers and voted to reverse the single largest act of union-busting in American history,” said Liz Shuler, the group's president.\n\nThe bill reached the floor through a discharge petition led by Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine. It’s a tactic that has been used with increasingly frequency this Congress due to frustrations with GOP leadership, including in the high-profile push to force release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Any lawmakers can force a vote on legislation if their petition gains 218 signatures, a majority in the 435-member House.\n\nAll House Democrats who voted supported the measure to restore the bargaining rights. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries supported the bill, saying on the floor prior to its passage that it would help “public servants who have been targeted viciously by the Trump administration from the very beginning of his time in office.”\n\nWhile passage in the Republican-held Senate appears unlikely, the vote represented one of the chamber’s first formal rebukes of the president and the flurry of executive orders he has issued during his second term.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStill, most of the Republicans who backed the bill still held back from directly calling out the president. Speaking on the House floor before voting in favor of the bill, New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler said that “earlier this year, an executive order changed the collective bargaining status.”\n\n“Every American deserves a voice in the workplace, and that includes the people who keep our government running and open,” said Lawler.\n\nOf the 20 Republicans who backed the bill, many, including Fitzpatrick, face tough reelections next year. It comes at a time when some Republicans, following Trump's lead, have become more supportive of labor unions, long a key part of the Democratic Party's coalition.\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who switched parties in Trump's first term, was among the Republicans to support the bill, but told reporters prior to the vote that he wasn't trying to send a message to the president with his vote.\n\n“No message here at all,” said Van Drew. “This is a New Jersey message. I got to take care of my people. And I’ve always been supportive of unions.”",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Switzerland have arrested the husband of a former finalist for Miss Switzerland, alleging that he strangled her to death before dismembering her and blending her body parts.\n\nKristina Joksimovic was killed during the February of 2024, according to the BBC.\n\nPolice referred to the 38-year-old beauty queen by her initials in court documents, which further noted she was a finalist in the Miss Switzerland competition back in 2007. Swiss media has identified the husband — who is not named in the docs — as Thomas. Investigators, however, did reveal that the suspect is a 43-year-old male.\n\nThomas has been formally charged with his wife's murder as well as disturbing the peace, prosecutors announced on Thursday, December 10.\n\nThomas had previously told investigators that when he returned to their Binningen home the night of the murder, he found Joksimovic already dead. But less than a month later, the husband was changing his tune, according to police. He allegedly later told detectives he had actually killed his wife in an act of self-defense.\n\nBut forensic experts later determined Joksimovic had been beheaded Joksimovic prior to her death, and that her remains showed no signs of a struggle, contradicting her husband's account of the events.\n\nDetectives started investigating Joksimovic's death almost immediately after it happened, noting its suspicious nature, but her husband was not officially charged with the beauty queen's murder until this month, according to prosecutors.\n\nThrough an autopsy, medical examiners were able to determine the husband allegedly dismembered Joksimovic using a jigsaw and garden shears.\n\nThe reports further claim police said that the victim's womb had been \"carefully removed\" by Thomas as part of a \"deliberate mutilation or ritualized degradation of the body.\"\n\nThe husband allegedly proceeded to slice up her body parts and then used an industrial grade blender to liquefy her remains.\n\nLindsay Shiver Set to Be Released on Bail After Allegedly Plotting to Kill Estranged Husband\n\nLocal reports described the body as having been \"puréed.\" The husband also allegedly added a chemical dissolvent to help break down his wife's body.\n\nAs he cut up her remains, the husband allegedly watched videos on YouTube.\n\nJoksimovic and Thomas have two young children together.\n\nUs Weekly was unable to determine if the husband has been asked to enter pleas to the two charges filed against him. It was also unclear if he had hired an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nLocal media is reporting Joksimovic's own father found her remains, after noticing strands of blonde hair sticking out of a black bag.\n\nThe husband will remain in custody until his next court date, which has not been set yet.\n\nAccording to her Instagram profile, Joksimovic primarily worked as a modeling coach. Her page features instructional videos on mastering the catwalk as well as footage of her working with her clients on their walks.\n\nIf you or someone you love is experiencing domestic violence, you are encouraged to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799-7233 or visit thehotline.org.

An August note said that store inventory was \"very high\" as the brand tried to clear aged stock.\n\nA July Jefferies note, analysts said some of the stores they visited were missing critical stock, like the brand's yoga leggings without front seams.\n\nLululemon reported a third-quarter revenue of $2.6 billion, a 7% increase from the same period last year. Its net revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, while its international sales increased 33%, buoyed by strong sales in China.\n\nMcDonald announced in the call that he would be stepping down at the end of January. Frank, as well as the CCO, André Maestrini, will serve as interim co-CEOs until the company finds a replacement for McDonald.\n\nIts stock rose more than 10% in after-hours trading on Thursday after earnings and the announcement of McDonald's resignation.

    "fullText": "If you're waiting for Michael Burry to tell you when the AI bubble will burst, don't hold your breath.\n\nIn Burry's new post on his Substack, the famed \"Big Short\" investor said that there \"is no way to time or predict\" the bubble pop, especially when the bubble may still have room to grow.\n\n\"Shorts are almost always short-term trades. Usually less than a year, maybe a couple years at most,\" wrote Burry. \"Not 5 years, not 10 years.\"\n\n\"I believe today the stock market is in a phase that could become a blow off top of extreme magnitude on the upside, while at any time, maybe even today or tomorrow, making a generational top,\" Burry added.\n\nIn the lengthy blog post, Burry answered reader questions on his earlier posts. He argued that there is \"supply-side gluttony,\" meaning massive data-center build-outs, GPU orders, and multibillion-dollar commitments without real end-user demand, which investors are mistaking for supply-chain activity. He attributed much of the hype to being driven by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's marketing.\n\n\"Even when it finally tops, it will not be for any specific reason,\" Burry said later in the post. \"Even if the reason is an AI buildout bubble popping, that will likely not be apparent until a year or two later.\"\n\n\"Mostly, it is prudent neither to short stocks nor to buy puts on stocks. Stocks that are obviously overvalued tend to have the most upward momentum yet have puts that are very expensive,\" Burry added.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's latest digs.\n\nIn November, Burry launched a paywalled Substack called Cassandra Unchained. After posting charts on X that show circulatory investment deals between Nvidia and other tech giants, his first post took aim at Nvidia. He called the chipmaking giant \"a Cisco\" in the AI bubble debate, referring to the internet-networking giant whose stock plunged by over 75% during the dot-com crash.\n\nNvidia released a note to Wall Street analysts in late November, pushing back against some of Burry's claims.\n\nEarlier in November, during Nvidia's Q3 earnings call, the CEO addressed concerns about the AI bubble.\n\n\"From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" Huang told investors, \"We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\"",

    "description": "Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says robotaxis are a \"trillion-dollar-plus\" business and he expects Asia to drive the wave of autonomous expansion.",
    "fullText": "Uber is preparing for a robotaxi surge, and its CEO says one market will drive it.\n\nDara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television published Friday that robotaxis are a \"trillion-dollar-plus\" opportunity and Asia is a huge growth market for the ride-hailing giant.\n\n\"I expect to be in 10-plus markets by next year. And we want those markets to be in the Asia-Pacific region as well,\" Khosrowshahi said. Uber has self-driving vehicles in the US and the Middle East.\n\nAnalysts have long touted autonomous mobility as one of the biggest bets in the transportation industry. In 2023, McKinsey estimated that if robotaxis and roboshuttles scale, the shared-mobility market could reach $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nKhosrowshahi said Japan has \"great potential\" for its robotaxi push, despite being behind in regulation.\n\n\"With an aging population, there's a real need for transportation, not just in the large cities but in the rural areas,\" he added. He also pointed to Hong Kong and Australia as potential key markets for its robotaxi services.\n\nKhosrowshahi said Uber now works with more than 20 autonomous-vehicle partners — including China's Baidu, WeRide, and Pony.ai, as well as Waymo in the US.\n\n\"We will have access to autonomous technologies in the large cities and markets that really count,\" he added.\n\nWith a market that large, Khosrowshahi said autonomous driving is unlikely to be a \"winner-take-all\" industry.\n\n\"It's an exciting technology, but there are many players getting to the finish line,\" he said.\n\n\"We just have to make sure that the players that we work with are safe and that again, we're working with the regulators in a constructive manner,\" he added.\n\nUber has been leaning hard into autonomous driving. During its third-quarter earnings call in November, Khosrowshahi said the company is already seeing signs that robotaxis can boost demand.\n\n\"The biggest scale operations that we've got are with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And what we are seeing is that those markets are growing faster than other US markets,\" he added.\n\nOther industry leaders have also been hyping the sector.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly said that robotaxis will power the company's growth. In May, Musk said in an interview with CNBC that Tesla would hit one million self-driving cars by the end of next year, a claim he also made in 2019 that did not materialize.\n\nThe path to profitability remains murky. HSBC analysts warned in July that the robotaxi market has been \"widely overestimated,\" and said it could be years before fleets make real money.\n\nEven the most advanced players are burning cash. Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" division — which includes Waymo, as well as other subsidiaries — lost $1.42 billion in the third quarter.\n\nThe cost of an autonomous driving vehicle is steep. Analysts estimate that each Waymo vehicle costs about $150,000 to produce. The high costs have squeezed some companies out of the robotaxi market, including Ford and General Motors.",

    "fullText": "After years of wartime splurging, Russian shoppers are tightening their grip on their wallets — a shift that hints at growing stress in the country's economy.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has weakened across most regions, the Central Bank of Russia said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nIn October and November, demand softened even as unemployment remained near historic lows and inflation expectations ticked higher.\n\n\"According to retailers across the country, an increasing share of products are being purchased during promotions, sales, and discounts. Household behavior has become more frugal,\" according to the central bank report.\n\nRetailers in many regions report weakening demand for big-ticket and nonessential goods, marking a clear cooling after the post-2022 consumer boom.\n\n\"More subdued consumption may indicate a gradual reduction in labor market overheating and more moderate expectations for future income dynamics,\" wrote Russia's central bank.\n\nIt's a notable shift for an economy that witnessed a boom in consumer spending after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, even amid sweeping sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThat boom was fueled by surging defense spending and intense competition for scarce workers. Wages jumped, and many households went on spending sprees.\n\nNow, that momentum appears to be fading.\n\nWage growth has slowed, and firms across multiple regions report reduced manpower demand and less urgency to hire, reflecting a cooling labor market, according to the central bank report.\n\nMany firms told the central bank they expect even more modest wage increases in 2026, suggesting that households may be bracing for leaner times.\n\nThe central bank's latest report arrives as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, and the limits of wartime economic stimulus become more apparent.\n\nOil and gas revenues — the backbone of Russia's budget — dropped 34% year-over-year in November.\n\nEven before this, analysts had warned that Russia's economy was being sustained largely by defense spending, subsidies, and emergency policy interventions.\n\nTop officials had sounded alarms. In December 2023, Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank governor, warned that the economy was at risk of overheating.\n\nLast June, the head of Russia's largest bank said the economy was \"definitely and strongly overheated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a deepening demographic crisis and ongoing competition for labor between the military and industry continue to weigh on Russia's growth prospects, both now and in the years ahead.",

    "description": "At least four provinces will be using the sales of their American liquor to fund food banks and charities.",
    "fullText": "Canada is coming up with ways to put its stockpiled American liquor to good use.\n\nSeveral provinces in the country halted imports of US booze and removed it from store shelves in March in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nNow, at least four provinces are planning to sell the remaining inventory and donate proceeds to food banks.\n\nCanada's far eastern province, Prince Edward Island, told Business Insider that its government will put its stock of American booze, which it had pulled off the shelves, back in stores starting on December 11.\n\nA representative for the province's finance department said the government anticipates profits of $600,000 Canadian dollars, or about $434,000, from the sale. The proceeds will be distributed to food banks across the island. The province says it does not intend to place any further orders for American alcohol.\n\nThe finance office of Newfoundland and Labrador told Business Insider it had made an upfront payment of $500,000 on Tuesday to 60 provincial food banks before the sales of any liquors, a move that will help more than 15,400 people. After the liquor is sold, more donations will go to the food banks for a total sum of up to $1 million.\n\nManitoba and Nova Scotia have similar plans.\n\nManitoba said it will sell its inventory through private retailers and restaurants, with the estimated $500,000 in net revenue going to food banks, holiday charities, children's organizations, and an advocacy group for First Nations.\n\nAs for Nova Scotia, the province is making a $4 million upfront payment to groups that provide food access, and the money will be recouped when the $14 million worth of liquor is eventually sold.\n\n\"We will not be ordering any more from the United States once this inventory is gone,\" the province's premier, Tim Houston, said in a statement. \"But Nova Scotians have already paid for this product.\"\n\nHe added, \"We don't want it to go to waste. That's why we're selling it and using the proceeds to help those in need.\"\n\nIn Canada, the sale of alcohol is mainly controlled by provincial governments, each of which establishes a board to oversee the matter. Only Alberta has a completely privatized alcohol retail system, while Saskatchewan has a partially privatized system.\n\nCanada mainly imports whiskey and bourbon, alongside beer and other spirits, from the US.\n\nA spokesperson for Ontario's finance ministry told Business Insider that the province had no plans to put the booze on store shelves soon.\n\n\"US alcohol will remain off shelves and is being held in storage until further notice,\" said the spokesperson. \"We are currently exploring options for the products.\"\n\nOntario did not disclose how much inventory it still has, but the province said the inventory it had pulled off the shelves in March was worth around C$80 million.\n\nA government representative from the Northwest Territories and a spokesperson of the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch both told Business Insider that they ceased US liquor imports in March, but will continue selling the stockpiled products until they are depleted.\n\nA Yukon government cabinet representative said Yukon has the same plan.\n\nHowever, the mountainous province of Alberta continues to import and sell American booze.\n\n\"In June this year, Alberta lifted restrictions on the purchase of US alcohol from American companies, signalling a renewed commitment to open and fair trade with our largest partner,\" a spokesperson of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction told Business Insider.\n\nThe matter of US booze has been fueling the trade tension between the two neighbors.\n\nThe animosity started when Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canada in March and commented that Canada should become a state of the US.\n\nDespite later walking back some of his broader tariffs and upholding a previous agreement that ensured most goods remain tariff-free, Trump's moves have drawn the ire of Canadians, who have canceled travel plans and boycotted American goods in stores.\n\nAccording to the Distilled Spirits Council, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025, falling below $10 million in export value.\n\n\"We hope both the US and Canada can address their respective concerns,\" said Chris Swonger, the CEO of the council. \"And that our products can return to Canadian retail shelves as soon as possible.\"\n\nIn March, Kentucky's bourbon makers said Canada's ban on American alcohol would hurt them.\n\nEric Gregory, the president of the Kentucky Distillers' Association, said in March that retaliatory tariffs would have \"far-reaching consequences across Kentucky, home to 95% of the world's bourbon.\"",

    "title": "What smart people are saying about Disney's licensing deal with OpenAI",
    "description": "OpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property.",
    "fullText": "It's likely just a matter of time before we see the wisened duo of Rafiki and Jiminy Cricket weilding lightsabers on the icy plains of Arendelle.\n\nThat's courtesy of artificial intelligence, of course, and a new deal between Disney and OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property. Disney will also invest $1 billion in OpenAI and will purchase ChatGPT Enterprise for its employees.\n\nIt's a major shift for Disney, which has historically been deeply protective of its intellectual property. And it's a big win for OpenAI, which is on a quest for more content to feed its AI models.\n\nFor users, the deal will enable them to recreate Disney characters on Sora, OpenAI's short-form video generation app, and to create images of Disney characters using ChatGPT.\n\nBeyond the limitless possibilities for creative content, the deal reveals a lot about Disney's strategy in the AI age and the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nFor Nick Cicero, the founder of Delmondo, a social media video analytics company that was acquired by Conviva in 2018, Disney's deal with OpenAI is less about AI and more about revenue.\n\nCicero argued in an X post on Thursday that Disney was aiming to solve two \"existential\" problems: creators using unauthorized Disney content and kids watching YouTube instead of Disney+.\n\n\"Sora gives Disney its first scalable way to pull creator-made content into its own premium ecosystem — brand-safe, trackable, legal, and ready for CTV monetization,\" he said, referring to the practice of delivering targeted advertising to internet-connected televisions.\n\n\"This move isn't about tech,\" he added. \"It's about revenue physics.\"\n\nChatbots like ChatGPT rely on data to power their outputs, and when it comes to collecting that data, AI companies are insatiable.\n\nThe drive to collect data often pits AI companies against content creators. Numerous media companies have sued OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other leading AI outfits for using their copyrighted content without permission. Other media companies, like Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, have struck deals with AI companies to license their content.\n\nPeter Csathy, a longtime media consultant and analyst, said Disney's deal with OpenAI is a \"watershed\" moment for AI and media licensing.\n\n\"Now THIS is a generative AI use that makes sense to me and I support,\" Csathy wrote on LinkedIn. \"Fully licensed characters, thereby respecting copyright and embracing partnership with the creative community (rather than theft of IP). New revenue streams for IP rights-holders. And overall delight by fans of those beloved characters.\"\n\nThere are just so many cease-and-desist letters a media lawyer can send.\n\nCarline Giegerich, a vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau who once led emerging tech at HBO, says Disney's deal with OpenAI feels like a \"can't beat 'em, join 'em\" moment.\n\n\"When I was at HBO from '05 - '09, I marveled at the sheer volume of cease and desists from the legal team when mobile video was up and coming,\" she wrote on LinkedIn. \"I thought it seemed difficult to fight against the entire internet, and it turns out it was. And AI presents a similar challenge.\"\n\nShe also said the deal presents a valuable marketing opportunity for Disney.\n\n\"Important to note that a selection of these fan-created videos will be available to stream on Disney+. What that means to me is that Disney sees this also as a marketing and content opportunity, which it is,\" she said.\n\nDisney's pivot from aggressively defending its IP at every turn to giving it over to the world's leading AI startup might be strategic for another reason.\n\nJames Miller, the head of business development at Amazon for media, entertainment, and Amazon Creators, said he suspects it's a matter of \"controlling the inevitable.\"\n\nAny IP eventually enters the public domain. In 2024, the copyright for Mickey Mouse himself — at least the sans white gloves version of the 1930s — expired, allowing anyone to use his likeness. Winnie the Pooh, Snow White, Cinderella, and a handful of other Disney characters also entered the public domain at the same time.\n\n\"By officially licensing these characters now, Disney does three things,\" Miller wrote on LinkedIn. \"1. Monetizes the AI trend rather than just fighting it in court. 2. Sets the quality standard for how their characters appear in AI video (likely drowning out lower-quality unauthorized versions). 3. Captures data on how fans want to use their IP before they lose exclusive rights.\"\n\nOne consumer expert said that Disney might have gotten the short end of the stick in this partnership.\n\n\"Looks like OpenAI used the #jedimindwarp on The Walt Disney Company, not the other way around,\" Karl Haller, an IBM partner and the leader of the firm's Consumer Center of Competency, said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nHe said he was \"more than a bit surprised\" to see that Disney is letting OpenAI license its IP for Sora and other AI tools, with some of the videos being made available to stream on Disney+.\n\n\"And what does Disney receive for this? Negative $1 billion,\" he wrote. \"Rather than receiving a heftly license fee, Disney is instead investing $1B in OpenAI and receiving warrants to buy \n\nOne entertainment lawyer pointed out that the deal comes with a lot of unanswered questions.\n\n\"This is a fairly stunning story all round with many questions,\" Simon Pullman, a partner at law firm Pryor Cashman, wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.\n\n\"Will audiences want/accept 'AI UGC' on Disney Plus,\" he wrote, referring to user-generated content. \"Will it be possible for Disney to unring the bell after three years and not extend the license? How will they protect against misuse and brand damage?\"\n\nDisney's $1 billion bet on AI is the right move for the media giant, according to Mike Walsh, the CEO of consulting firm Tomorrow.\n\n\"By partnering with OpenAI while suing Midjourney and warning Google, Disney is drawing a clear line,\" Walsh wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday. \"Remix culture isn't going away, but it will be licensed, governed, and designed on its terms.\"\n\nHe added that Disney has always survived new media eras with this strategy.\n\n\"The future of entertainment belongs to companies that shape participation instead of fighting it,\" he wrote.",

John Aiken is chatting in the courtyard of a Brisbane hotel when he is spotted by two former England spinners – Phil Tufnell and Alex Hartley.\n\nTuffers asks for a video to send to his wife and her friends. Hartley gets a selfie to put in the girls' WhatsApp group.\n\nAll standard stuff. As a relationship expert on Married at First Sight Australia (MAFS), Aiken is one of the most recognisable TV personalities in the country. If you've not seen it, the show does exactly what it says on the tin – strangers are matched then meet at the moment their wedding begins.\n\nThere are numerous versions, including in the UK, but it is the Australian brand that has a cult following across the globe.\n\nBut here's the thing. Neither Tufnell nor Hartley are aware they have just met a former first-class cricketer.\n\nAiken, a left-handed opening batter, had an 11-year career on the New Zealand domestic scene between 1990 and 2001. His Wikipedia page has the heading \"John Aiken (cricketer)\".\n\n\"I've kept in contact with a lot of the Black Caps that I played with as I was growing up,\" Aiken tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"I've stayed in touch with Mark Richardson, Chris Cairns, Chris Harris and Craig McMillan.\n\n\"What's strange now is they see me as the guy from MAFS, not so much the left-hander who played for Wellington.\"\n\nAiken is now 55. His post-cricket career has made him a household name in Australia. The day before, he was in the crowd at the Gabba and approached by a man in a \"pink Hawaiian shirt\" wanting to know about the 13th series of Married at First Sight, due to air in the new year.\n\nAlmost four decades ago, Aiken was taking his first steps in professional cricket. Born in Sydney, he moved to New Zealand at the age of 12 and made his way through the Wellington system.\n\nIn 1989, he was alongside Cairns, Harris and Adam Parore in a New Zealand Under-19s team that toured England to take on a home side including Mark Ramprakash, Dominic Cork and Darren Gough. Aiken even got to taste playing at Lord's.\n\n\"Nick Knight put us to the sword every single time we faced him,\" says Aiken.\n\nSix months later, Aiken was making his first-class debut for Wellington. He made 156 not out against Canterbury at the famous Lancaster Park in Christchurch.\n\n\"I was a bit more conservative than the likes of Ben Duckett, Michael Slater or Matthew Hayden,\" says Aiken. \"If I was playing today I'd have to change my game and be more attacking.\n\n\"The one thing that held me back was that I would over-analyse pretty much everything. I'd be up at night in front of the mirror, shadow batting, all that sort of thing.\"\n\nAiken combined his early years as a professional cricketer with studying for a master's degree in clinical and community psychology. Though he graduated at the age of 25 and psychology would eventually become his life, Aiken's first ambition was to play cricket for New Zealand.\n\nHe thinks he got \"close\", but never managed the weight of runs to earn a black cap.\n\nInstead, there were brushes with greatness in domestic cricket. New Zealand legends Martin Crowe and Stephen Fleming were team-mates at Wellington and an opponent was left-arm spinner and current Australia assistant coach Daniel Vettori. \"He landed it on a handkerchief,\" says Aiken.\n\nAiken regularly played against touring international teams and was run out in a one-day game by South Africa's Jonty Rhodes, probably the best fielder of all time.\n\n\"Any day of the week it was an easy single,\" says Aiken. \"I hit it into the gap, I said, yes, easy one. He ran me out by half the pitch.\"\n\nWhen Aiken left Wellington to join Auckland, he came up against a West Indies team including the great Brian Lara.\n\n\"We had a meeting the night before and we just said: 'Nobody say anything to Brian Lara,\" recalls Aiken. \"We greet him as Mr. Lara. We are polite. And if he gets bored, he may get out early. We all know that if you sledge him, he's likely to get 400.\n\n\"So sure enough, he walks out. 'Hello Mr Lara, how was your stay? How's it going?' It was delightful. He must have pumped our opening bowler out of the ground twice, then hit one up in the air and he was out. We all just breathed an immense sigh of collective relief.\"\n\nAnother opponent was a young wicketkeeper-batter from Otago called Brendon McCullum – now a MAFS watcher, on orders of Australian wife Elissa.\n\n\"Anyone from Otago, you've got to roll your sleeves up because they're going to come hard at you,\" says Aiken.\n\n\"He had a style where he was going to really make a name for himself right from the word go. I don't know him very well, but he doesn't seem someone who worries too much about what others have to say.\"\n\nHe registered a pair in his final first-class match, in February 2001. Aiken ended with four hundreds in 46 first-class matches, averaging just under 29. He made another ton in 39 List A matches.\n\nSeven years later, Aiken moved back to Australia and set up his own private practice \"seeing couples, singles, and minding my own business\". He had dabbled in some slots as a relationship expert in daytime TV, but it was an email he received in 2014 that would change his life.\n\nAiken was invited to audition for Married at First Sight and got the role. More than 11 years on, the show will air its 13th series in Australia in January and will follow in the UK in the spring. It is an Australian phenomenon, probably behind only children's cartoon Bluey as the current biggest TV export from this country.\n\nThe fascination of the show is not only whether two strangers can fall in love, but also the interactions of 12 different couples – usually with fiery consequences.\n\n\"It is unscripted, it is real and it is authentic, and you don't know what they're going to do,\" says Aiken.\n\nIt is Aiken's role to guide the couples and \"hold them to account\". The tongue-lashings he delivers are up there with the most entertaining parts of the show. Quite a character swerve from the opening batter who over-analysed himself in front of the mirror.\n\n\"I'm not inside my head when I'm in MAFS and doing my role,\" says Aiken. \"When I was playing cricket I was inside my head.\n\n\"Over-analysing things generally slows you down and in cricket, if you're thinking about your technique all the time, I found that it would ultimately lead you to getting out and feeling insecure about your game.\n\n\"TV is about getting there and just dealing with whatever's in front of you, call it out and just roll with it. I feel like I'm much more relaxed in the world of media than I was when I was playing cricket.\"\n\nIn terms of his two distinct careers, Aiken says the \"excitement\" of Married at First Sight has the edge over the \"anxiety\" of opening the batting, and he would not exchange his place on the MAFS couch for a coveted New Zealand black cap.\n\n\"Cricket gave me some great moments, but I wasn't able to flourish, to sit back and enjoy the ride,\" says Aiken.\n\n\"On Married at First Sight that's all that I do. MAFS is something that just has given me such joy.\n\n\"And you know what? It can work. Strangers can fall in love. This year we have some love among the chaos.\"",

    "description": "At The Game Awards, developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, confirming a release date of September 9, 2026 on PC and PlayStation 5.\nThe trailer was pretty epic, starting with some CGI of a martial artist crossing swords with some thugs while carrying a baby in some Death Stranding kind of way. We then cut to some actual gameplay of our protagonist, the elite assassin Soul, as he travels around various environments, enters various cutscenes, and engages in various battles. It's not quite a souls-like, but based on combat encounters and enemy designs, you'd think it was one. Actually, it looks like a cool mix between Where Winds Meet, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.",

The narrative direction of the game is different too, opting for something that looks more high fantasy (like horses, magic, and pet familiars) while still maintaining that science-fiction flair when it comes to the various characters' abilities and firearms.\nOn Steam, Highguard is described as a \"PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.",

Now they need some stops.\n\nThe third quarter is under way!\n\nWell, as we noted earlier, this is a bit surprising. Not necessarily that Gainesville would leading, but 24-0, is a way bigger margin than expected tonight. It's still within reach, but Rome has to figure out something offense really quick.\n\nGainesville tacks on a field goal. Rome has to come up with an answer quick. It's possible they're already in a hole too deep to climb out of, but if they're going to have a chance, they can't let this get any worse.\n\nIt's all Gainesville so far in Rome.

It was also the Raiders’ 35th consecutive playoff victory during Roger Harriett’s tenure as head coach.\n\nOn the flip side for Lakeland, its the second straight state championship loss after the Dreadnaughts won two in a row in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWhat was certain, however, was Lakeland and St. Thomas Aquinas Part II was much more competitive than the 2024 edition as the latter dominated the contest from start to finish. The redux was a lot closer as the Raiders were only able to muster up three DiSalvatore field goals in the first half.\n\nA reason Lakeland was able to remain in the contest was the play of quarterback Keelin Hendrix, who was making plays with his arm and legs all throughout the evening. Hendrix finished the night totaling 226 all-purpose yards.\n\nThe mtachup the last two seasons between the two perennial powers hasn’t been all too close, with St. Thomas Aquinas edging Lakeland by a combined 63-0 score.\n\nFor Florida high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Mammoth center Logan Cooley is expected to miss a minimum of eight weeks with what the team is calling a lower-body injury.\n\nGeneral manager Bill Armstrong announced Cooley’s timeline Thursday.\n\nCooley, 21, was injured Dec. 5 in Vancouver when he slid into the net, with his left leg crashing into the right post. Being out eight weeks would take him to the Olympic break in early February and could put him in line to return when the season resumes later in the month.\n\nStill the Mammoth’s leading goal scorer with 14, Cooley was one of the biggest reasons they got off to a strong start to the season and were in a playoff spot the night he got hurt. Utah has lost all three games since Cooley was sidelined.\n\nThe long-term injury also all but certainly ends Cooley’s already long-shot chances of being picked for the U.S. roster to take part in the Games in Milan.\n\nTaken with the third pick in the 2022 draft when the club was the Arizona Coyotes before moving to Salt Lake City, Cooley is one of the NHL’s rising stars and in late October signed an eight-year extension worth $80 million. The Pittsburgh native has 23 points in 29 games this season.",

At 6:52 of the period, Horvat became tangled with Ducks defenseman Drew Helleson. The 30-year-old's left foot twisted as he fell to the ice. He had trouble putting weight on his foot as he went directly to the locker room and never returned to the Islanders bench.\n\nHead coach Patrick Roy did not have an update on Horvat's condition after the game, but said he will be day-to-day.\n\nEntering Thursday's action, Horvat had a team-high 19 goals and 31 points. He had not missed a game this season and played in all 81 games the past two seasons with the Islanders.\n\nSince he was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks in the 2022-23 season, Horvat has been solid. In his first full season on the island, Horvat scored 33 goals (68 points) and followed up with a 28-goal year (57 points). He was on pace to blow past those numbers this year.\n\nBo Horvat will not return to tonight's game with a lower body injury.\n\nHere is the play where Horvat gets injured. #Isles \n\n(🎥: @RTaub_ / @IslesMSGN) https://t.co/giLXHosQ7i pic.twitter.com/olHPhG4isc\n\n— Isles Rumor (@IslesRumor) December 12, 2025",

    "title": "Hart sits in return to Philly",
    "description": "Carter Hart was a spectator as the Golden Knights went with Akira Schmid against the Flyers.",
    "fullText": "Thursday, the former Philadelphia Flyers goaltender returned to the scene of where he played for six NHL seasons before his career took a legal hiatus nearly two years ago. But his participation was limited to pregame warmups and a seat on the visitors’ bench wearing a baseball cap.\n\nNo welcome back acknowledgment. No video tribute from the Flyers. It was as persona non grata as it gets.  \n\nHe wasn’t needed as once again the Vegas Golden Knights found themselves in an overtime game and they leaned on two of their best players — Mark Stone and Jack Eichel — to get them over the top as Eichel forced a turnover, found Stone alone in front and the captain beat Dan Vladar 2:47 into OT for a 3-2 victory at Xfinity Mobile Arena.\n\n“I think we’re comfortable playing in close games,” said Stone, who scored a second-period power-play goal as well to give his team a 2-1 lead at the time. “We’ve played a lot of these this year so out’s nice that we’re winning more of them.”\n\nAs for Hart, by now, you know all the sordid details that resulted to his suspension. The 27-year-old goaltender is back in the NHL, has played three games with the Knights and he’ll likely make his next start in the relative obscurity of Columbus come Saturday.\n\nThursday was a different story. ESPN was there. So was a gaggle of Philly puck media wanting to take Hart’s temperature about his return, to ask him what he expected the reaction from the fans would be for him, about facing his former team and the usual assortment of queries a former player would be expected to receive upon his return.\n\nFrom Hart, nothing but silence on this day. The team didn’t make him available after the morning skate. Coach Bruce Cassidy said it was a decision by the coaching staff to not play Hart Thursday, adding that Hart “wants to play every game.”\n\nWell, he didn’t play this one. Akira Schmid did. And in all honesty, he probably needed to having last played six days ago in Newark where he shut out his former team, the Devils, 3-0 to start this five-game road swing through the Metropolitan Division.\n\nThe reality is the two points up for grabs Thursday was bigger than one person’s return to his former city. The Knights are still pursuing first-place Anaheim and when you look at the nine points they’ve squandered this year in losing in either overtime or a shootout, they’re in a desperate chase to make up those nine points. So that’s where Cassidy’s focus was — win the game.\n\n“We’re a good team; It wasn’t going to continue that way,” Cassidy said of the team’s OT struggles earlier this year. “Today, we forced a turnover and we make a play. Eventually it was going to turn our way.”\n\nHis decision to go with Schmid paid off. He only faced 19 shots while allowing two to get by him. But he was strong, particularly when the Knights were on the penalty kill. Vegas took three offensive zone penalties Thursday but the Flyers were unable to cash in.\n\n“He’s been playing well and he gives us a chance every night,” Cassidy said of Schmid, who picked up his 11th win of the season.\n\nThe Knights also received some offense from defenseman Zach Whitecloud, who scored his first of the year while showing some Eichel-like moves in beating Vladar in the first period, faking with his forehand, then going to his backhand for the goal.\n\n“I thought it was Jack who scored,” Cassidy said. “Then I saw the bubble and I knew it was Whitey.”\n\nWhitecloud has been wearing a full face shield after taking a puck to the face a couple of weeks ago. It obviously didn’t inhibit his vision when it came to handling the puck and finishing off a play.\n\n“It’s exciting and fun,” Whitecloud said of his being able to contribute offensively. “It’s not my job to score goals, especially that way. But anytime you can get into the offensive zone and get in the rush and get involved, it’s something I’ve prided myself on since I’ve been in this organization, and that’s to be a two-way guy.”\n\nThe Knights, who have scored first in each of the four games on the five-game trip and have picked up seven of a possible eight points so far, will try and finish it off the right way Saturday against the Blue Jackets.\n\n“I think we’ve done a good job of rolling four lines and six D and wearing teams down,” Stone said. “Our special teams have been really good. We scored on the power play, we had a big (penalty) kill late (Thursday).\n\n“It’s been a good trip already but we have a chance to make it a great one. Nine out of 10 points would be a hell of a trip.”",

    "description": "- - -INVICTA GAMES, LTD.\nPackaging Team — Official Minutes \nProject: Mastermind / New Cover Presentation\nMARTIN SMITH (Marketing Senior Vice Presi...",
    "fullText": "MARTIN SMITH (Marketing Senior Vice President): Okay. Gary’s got a new cover comp. Gary, walk us through your vision.\n\nGARY LARKIN (Design Lead): Right. Here it is. Black void. Two adults. No board. No pegs.\n\nPAM REYNOLDS (Product Development): Where are the children?\n\nLARKIN: Exactly. Also, who cares?\n\nREYNOLDS: You know this game is eight-plus, right?\n\nLARKIN: If you put a kid on the cover, you’re telling buyers it’s a kid game. If you put adults on the cover, you’re telling kids it’s a gateway to adulthood. This is basic aspirational psychology. They’ll feel like tiny professors. Or tiny villains. Both sell.\n\nSHEILA GRANT (Sales Director): Why no kitchen table?\n\nLARKIN: Because kitchen tables are for fucking Candyland. We’re selling a political mode of thinking: deduction as power. Think less “family night,” and more “I will find the hidden structure of your choices, and then I will destroy you.”\n\nREYNOLDS: Talk to me about the man. He looks… a little smug?\n\nLARKIN: Yes. Smug is the emotional tone of Mastermind. I want the buyer to feel judged by the box. Like the box is already disappointed in them. If you don’t want smug, don’t name the game Mastermind. This isn’t fucking checkers. This is a duel in a seminar room at Davos.\n\nSMITH: Yes! “Smug” can be our brand essence. The product is a controlled experiment in superiority.\n\nLARKIN: She’s the counterforce. Wittgenstein’s ghost at a cocktail party. Quiet, precise, dangerous because she doesn’t need to explain herself. She’s the one who knows the rules and knows when to break them.\n\nREYNOLDS: She also looks like she’s here to ruin his career.\n\nLARKIN: Sure. That’s part of it. Mastermind is adversarial epistemology. Two people testing the limits of what can be known. Plus, maybe they’re fucking?\n\nREYNOLDS: Do we want sexual tension on a board game cover for eight-year-olds?\n\nSMITH: We want adult tension. The tension of brains. If anyone sees sex, that’s on them. We’re not responsible for the public’s imagination. We’re responsible for moving units in Woolworths. Gary, I see what you’re going for… a Cold War posture: mutually assured… embarrassment? You probe, they conceal, you infer, they flinch. Gorgeous.\n\nREYNOLDS: Jesus. All that from colored pegs and a plastic tray?\n\nGRANT: Okay, but where’s the warmth? The fun? Where’s the invitation?\n\nLARKIN: Warmth is for Sorry! This is not a hug. This is a chess clock in a stranger’s living room telling you your parents are getting divorced. The invitation is “Are you smart enough to sit at this table?”\n\nREYNOLDS: I’m still hung up on the no kids thing. Aren’t we basically telling children they’re not the audience?\n\nSMITH: No, we’re telling them they’re not the current audience. But they could be…\n\nREYNOLDS: Fine. But can we at least flag the age range on the front so parents don’t think we’re selling them a goddamn espionage novel?\n\nSMITH: Yes. Small type. Discreet. Like a classified stamp.\n\nGRANT: Could we put a badge on it? Something like “Awarded Game of the Year.”\n\nSMITH: Yes. We need medals. We need royal crests. We need to reassure the buyer that they are purchasing status. I want the box to feel like it won a war.\n\nLARKIN: Also, note the diagonal yellow banner in the corner that says “Improved.” People love improvement—even if they don’t know what was wrong before. “Improved” says we were humble enough to evolve, but not humble enough to specify how.\n\nSMITH: Brilliant. “Improved” in a bold modern font. It’s like saying “Now with more mind.”\n\nREYNOLDS: The board isn’t in the photo.\n\nLARKIN: The board is implied. If you show the board, you limit the imagination. If you don’t show the board, anyone could be playing Mastermind at any time. In a limo. In a bunker. On a yacht while plotting the downfall of a minor principality.\n\nREYNOLDS: Or at my kitchen table? With my nephew?\n\nSMITH: Goddammit, Pam. Fuck the kitchen table. Get on board!\n\nGRANT: So the story is: Mastermind isn’t a board game, it’s a world view?\n\nLARKIN: Yes, a world view where inference leads to domination!\n\nSMITH: I want every eight-year-old to look at this and think, “Someday, I will destroy my father’s confidence with pure logic.”\n\nREYNOLDS: You guys are monsters.\n\nSMITH: We’re toy executives, Pam. Just toy executives.\n\nGRANT: All right. I’m sold. It’s smart, it’s sharp, it’s fucking terrifying. In other words, it’s finally Mastermind.\n\nLARKIN: So, we’re green-lighting this direction?\n\nSMITH: Yes. Let the box look like it could pass a doctoral defense and start a coup d’etat at the same time.",

    "fullText": "Would you trust a medical system measured by: which doctor would the average Internet user vote for?\n\nYet that malpractice is LMArena.\n\nThe AI community treats this popular online leaderboard as gospel. Researchers cite it. Companies optimize for it and set it as their North Star. But beneath the sheen of legitimacy lies a broken system that rewards superficiality over accuracy.\n\nIt's like going to the grocery store and buying tabloids, pretending they're scientific journals.\n\nHere's how LMArena is supposed to work: enter a prompt, evaluate two responses, and mark the best. What actually happens: random Internet users spend two seconds skimming, then click their favorite.\n\nThey're not reading carefully. They're not fact-checking, or even trying.\n\nThis creates a perverse reward structure. The easiest way to climb the leaderboard isn't to be smarter; it’s to hack human attention span. We’ve seen over and over again in the data, both from datasets that LMArena has released and the performance of models over time, that the easiest way to boost your ranking is by:\n\nIt doesn't matter if a model completely hallucinates. If it looks impressive – if it has the aesthetics of competence – LMSYS users will vote for it over a correct answer.\n\nWhen you optimize for engagement metrics, you get madness.\n\nEarlier this year, Meta tuned a version of Maverick to dominate the leaderboard. If you asked it “what time is it?”, you got:\n\nVoilà: bold text, emojis, and plenty of sycophancy – every trick in the LMArena playbook! – to avoid answering the question it was asked.\n\nIt wasn't just Maverick. We analyzed 500 votes from the leaderboard ourselves. We disagreed with 52% of them, and strongly disagreed with 39%.\n\nThe leaderboard optimizes for what feels right, not what is right. Here are two emblematic examples of LMArena users punishing factual accuracy:\n\nIn the world of LMArena, confidence beats accuracy and formatting beats facts.\n\nInstead of rigorous evaluators, we have people with the attention span of the average TikTok user determining which AI models shape the industry.\n\nWhy is LMArena so easy to game? The answer is structural.\n\nThe system is fully open to the Internet. LMArena is built on unpaid labor from uncontrolled volunteers. There's no incentive for those volunteers to be thoughtful. No quality control. No one gets kicked off for repeatedly failing to detect hallucinations.\n\nWhen LMArena’s leaders speak publicly, they talk about the various techniques they use to overcome the fact that their input data is low quality. They admit their workers prefer emojis and length over substance. So the LMArena system, they proudly tell us, includes a variety of corrective measures.\n\nThey're attempting alchemy: conjuring rigorous evaluation out of garbage inputs.\n\nBut you can't patch a broken foundation.\n\nWhen the entire industry optimizes for a metric that rewards “hallucination-plus-formatting” over accuracy, we get models optimized for hallucination-plus-formatting.\n\nThis isn't a minor calibration problem. It's fundamental misalignment between what we're measuring and what we want: models that are truthful, reliable, and safe.\n\nThe AI industry needs rigorous evaluation. We need leaders who prioritize accuracy over marketing. We need systems that can't be gamed by bolding more aggressively.\n\nLMArena is none of these things. And as long as we pretend it is, we're dragging the entire field backward.\n\nPeople often say they can’t avoid LMArena.\n\n\"We have to optimize for it. We have to sell our models. The leaderboard shows customers which model is best, and we have to play the game.\"\n\nBut the best products have principles they stick to.\n\nThis is the brutal choice every model builder must eventually make:\n\nThe choice is real. It’s hard. But we’ve seen some frontier labs hold the line.\n\nThey stuck to their values. They ignored the gamified rankings. And users loved their models anyway – because hype eventually dies and quality is the only metric that survives the cycle.\n\nYou are your objective function. Which path will each lab choose?",

The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages.",

But in the late 1500s and early 1600s, individual alchemists called the medicines they cooked up in their labs ‘secrets’. And thanks to a study published in Heritage Science, we now know a little bit more about the secrets of one alchemist in particular.\n\nIt turns out that Tycho Brahe, mostly known for his study of astronomy, had his own basement laboratory for mixing medicines—including some particular elements.\n\nBrahe’s famed observatory, located in his castle-like Uraniborg observatory on the island of Ven, in what is now Sweden, was dismantled following his death in 1601. But recently, a team of researchers from the University of Southern Denmark and National Museum of Denmark analyzed five shards rescued from what would have been the site’s old garden between 1988 and 1990. It’s believed those shards came from the basement alchemical laboratory.\n\nThe authors examined cross sections of the shards for 31 trace elements using mass spectrometry by converting sample molecules into charged ions. While there was plenty of the expected elements on the shards (four of which were glass and one of which was ceramic)—including nickel, copper, zin, tin, antimony, gold, mercury, and lead—there was one find that surprised the experts: tungsten.\n\n“Tungsten is very mysterious,” Kaare Lund Rasmussen, archaeometry expert at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a statement. “Tungsten had not even been described at that time, so what should we infer from its presence on a shard from Tycho Brahe’s alchemy workshop?”\n\nThat’s a question that doesn’t have a clear answer. Rasmussen said that while tungsten does occur naturally in certain minerals, and could have made its way into Brahe’s laboratory that way, there’s another plausible theory: Brahe had a secret substance to help create his medicines for Europe’s elite.\n\nNot classified as an element until the 1780s, tungsten likely first popped up in German chemistry as ‘Wolfram,’ and Brahe’s medicine were known to have German influence. “Maybe Tycho Brahe had heard about this and thus knew of tungsten’s existence,” Rasmussen speculated. “But this is not something we know or can say based on the analyses I have done. It is merely a possible theoretical explanation for why we find tungsten in the samples.”\n\n“Most intriguing are the elements found in higher concentrations than expected,” Rasmussen said, “indicating enrichment and providing insight into the substances used in Tycho Brahe’s alchemical laboratory.”\n\nThe business of creating medicines was a secret one. Brahe, like others of the day, didn’t share the makeup of prescriptions. Brahe was known for his plague medicine—a highly complicated remedy to create that could have had up to 60 ingredients, including everything from snake flesh and opium to copper, oils, and herbs. Could the resulting medicine have also included tungsten as part of the finished product?\n\n“It may seem strange that Tycho Brahe was involved in both astronomy and alchemy, but when one understands his worldview, it makes sense,” said Poul Grinder-Hansen, senior researcher and museum curator at the National Museum of Denmark, in a statement. “He believed that there were obvious connections between the heavenly bodies, early substances, and the body’s organs.”\n\nGold and mercury were often used by alchemists (including Brahe) in medicines, and it was common for alchemists to link the Earth’s elements to properties in space and the human body. And there's a whole list of those connections. Silver tied to the Moon and the brain, while gold was a link to the Sun and the heart. Jupiter and the liver were connected through tin, Venus and copper by the kidneys, Saturn and the spleen by lead, Mars and the gallbladder by iron, and Mercury and the lungs by (of course) mercury. In this thinking, gold was a common ingredient for medicines of the day, including ones Brahe took.\n\nWhere tungsten fits into the mix, however, isn’t clear. So far, it remains a secret.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "The 4% rule helps you establish a safe withdrawal rate.\n\nSuze Orman says not to follow the 4% rule because you may take out money when you don’t need it and not have money when you do.\n\nOther evidence also points to the fact following the 4% rule is a bad idea.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, there are some longstanding rules of thumb many people rely on. Unfortunately, finance expert Suze Orman has a warning about one of those rules. Orman has urged people to stop following the 4% rule, saying \"I would not be using the 4% figure on any level.\"\n\nSo, what is the 4% rule, why is Orman urging you to abandon it, and should you listen to her and stop using it as a crutch? Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe 4% rule is a simple rule designed to help people choose a safe withdrawal rate for their retirement funds. According to the rule, if you take 4% out of your retirement accounts when you first retire and then adjust that amount each year to account for inflation, your money should last at least 30 years. So, if you had a $1 million nest egg, you would take $40,000 out of your retirement plan in year one of retirement.\n\nThe rule was developed in 1994 by a financial advisor named William Bergen to help simplify the process of deciding how much money you could withdraw without risking draining your account too fast and going broke.\n\nOrman does not believe you should follow the 4% rule because she believes that this rule sets you up to take money out of an account when you may not need it, leaving you at risk if you do need it in the future.\n\n\"Maybe you were taking out 4% and 4% even though you didn't need it,\" she said. Then one day, you may need long-term care that's very expensive but you won't have enough in your retirement accounts to afford it because you took withdrawals out earlier just to follow the 4% rule, even if your spending needs were lower.\n\n\"The more you can not take out of a retirement account, the better off you are,\" Orman said.\n\nOrman is right that you should not simply follow the 4% rule, especially if you don't need the money. If you can live comfortably on 2% or 3% of your retirement nest egg, withdrawing more just because of a default rule would be a shortsighted choice as preserving your savings is usually better than spending.",

Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.\n\nIn both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.\n\nDespite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has a TV series in the works with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.\n\n“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”",

    "description": "Keeper, founded in 2022, raised $4 million in pre-seed funding. Here's the startup's current pitch deck.",
    "fullText": "Keeper, an AI matchmaking startup, thinks it can help deliver your \"soulmate\" to you. And if it can't, it'll let you know.\n\n\"We're saying we actually know who could be your soulmate or not,\" Jake Kozloski, Keeper's CEO, told Business Insider. \"We're not going to waste your time and pretend that a hundred thousand of these people could be. We'll tell you no.\"\n\nFounded in 2022, the dating platform uses layers of algorithms and AI models to match people who The startup is now disclosing for the first time, exclusively to Business Insider, that it raised a $4 million pre-seed investment in October 2024, led by Lightbank and Lakehouse Ventures. Goodwater Capital and Champion Hill Ventures participated in the round, among others.\n\nInvestors \"see AI as an inflection point in the dating app landscape\" and an opportunity to \"disrupt the incumbents,\" Kozloski said.\n\nKeeper isn't the only startup attempting to shake up the online dating market. Other AI matchmaking apps, such as Sitch and Amata, have raised millions to build next-generation dating apps. Dating app incumbents like Tinder and Bumble are also making plays with AI-powered experiences.\n\nKozloski said the company's values were another piece of its pitch that attracted some investors.\n\n\"They feel like there's a marriage crisis adjacent to the whole Elon Musk fertility crisis stuff that he talks about,\" said Kozloski, who described Keeper as being \"friendly with the pronatalist movement.\"\n\nWanting kids, though, isn't a requirement to use Keeper, Kozloski added.\n\nSince launching, Keeper has had more than 1.5 million sign-ups, and about 300,000 of those have made accounts, Kozloski said. Among that pool, there have been a \"small number\" of matches. Keeper didn't share exactly how many matches it's made, but according to its pitch deck, 10% of dates from its beta version resulted in marriage. With its funding, Keeper has been building out its matchmaking technology over the past year.\n\nKeeper is limited to heterosexual couples right now, and doesn't offer explicit options for different gender identities.\n\n\"We basically have to build a new algorithm for homosexual relationships, which we're happy to do and we will do eventually, but for now, we want to get to product market fit with our core product first,\" Kozloski said. \"Frankly, heterosexual relationships, especially for finding life partnership, seems to be a bigger market, a stronger market for us right now.\"\n\nMaking a profile on Keeper is a sit-down process. The initial form to make an account asks for the standard details of many dating apps (like your age or height), as well as academic test scores (including SATs), your career ambitions, salary, and net worth. It even encourages taking an external personality test. After you fill out the initial onboarding questionnaire, there are 13 more steps, ranging from uploading photos to sharing your philosophy on love.\n\n\"We don't let our users create their own profiles,\" Kozloski said. Keeper uses the information it gathers to curate a profile for you.\n\nKozloski said Keeper uses a non-AI algorithm first to streamline potential matches, focusing on data points like age range initially.\n\n\"We use LLMs once we have your top hundred that our other algorithms have identified,\" he said. \"The LLMs are trained on our matchmaking insights that we've learned so far, and so they can narrow down those last hundred and do the final pass of, 'OK, who actually is worth offering among these.'\"\n\nSome of the AI matchmaking comes into play when analyzing \"general attractiveness\" and users' specific attributes, like baldness or hair color, Kozloski said. The startup has also partnered with a team of researchers at Stanford, Kozloski said, who help train the LLMs (Keeper provides anonymized data to the research team).\n\nHowever, Keeper isn't fully automated, and for the time being, includes human matchmakers in the process. If there's a match, Keeper connects the two people over text message.\n\nThe startup has a complicated payment structure with a hefty price tag — but only for men.\n\nKeeper has male users sign a \"marriage bounty\" that typically costs $50,000 (if the user gets married) and has them pay $5,000 for any dates from the service (the date fees go toward the total bounty cost, Kozloski said).\n\nRead the most recent version of Keeper's pitch deck.\n\nNote: Keeper has shared an updated version of its pitch deck, which it is now sharing with investors, that includes new details since its raise in October 2024. Some details have been redacted.\n\nKeeper describes the matchmaking market as \"old school yet shockingly massive,\" per the slide.\n\n\"With the opportunity to 10x,\" the slide says. \"When technology provides perfect matches, matchmaking will be the best way to meet your partner.\"\n\n\"The AI matchmaker that will introduce you to your soulmate on the first match,\" the slides says. It also includes product imagery.\n\n\"Our v1 worked extremely well,\" the slide says.\n\nIt says that 10% of dates lead to marriage.\n\nIt says it has had 1.5 million sign-ups. \"This makes us the largest pool of any traditional matchmaker,\" the slides says. It lists competitors like Tawkify, Keeper, Ditto, Sitch, and Known Dating.\n\n\"Everyone signs up if we deliver soulmates on the first match,\" the slide says.\n\n\"The first mover quickly becomes a monopoly,\" it says.\n\nToban Wiebe: Co-Founder, Head of AI\n\nHere are the names of the researchers:\n\n\"We're raising to scale profitable human-in-the-loop matchmaking to $2M in annual revenue,\" the slide says.\n\n\"80% of young singles want to get married,\" the slide says. \"40% actually will.\" It cites data from Match Group and data scientist Allen Downey.\n\nDating apps are \"bad at creating relationships, worth billions,\" the slide says. \"Imagine the value of the first product that's great at it.\"\n\n\"Matchmakers can't scale,\" the slide says.\n\n\"LLMs and vision models enable scalable matchmaking for the first time in history,\" the slides says.\n\n\"We've built the most accurate process in the world,\" the slide says.\n\nHere are the steps the slide lays out:\n\n\"We earn more, faster, by aligning with users' incentives,\" the slide says.\n\nIts current model, which has humans involved in matchmaking, is free for women and costs men $5,000 per date. For male users, the marriage bounty costs $50,000, and the slide says that Keeper has contracted $14 million \"so far.\"\n\nKeeper outlines that in a future model, where the tech is fully automated, dates will cost $250, and the marriage bounty contract will cost $5,000.",

Her eldest son, Joe Anders, 21, wrote the screenplay.\n\nShe said that Anders had expressed concern that people may think the film, which he wrote on a screenwriting course, was picked up only because of his famous parents. But Winslet defended his talent.\"The film would've been made with or without me. The script is so, so good,\" she said.\n\nAnders' father is the acclaimed film director Sam Mendes, 60, who was married to Winslet for seven years until their split in 2010. Anders starred alongside his mom in the 2023 movie \"Lee,\" and also appeared in the Oscar-nominated war film \"1917,\" which was directed by his father.\n\nMia Threapleton, Winslet's 25-year-old daughter, is also a rising star. She had a starring role in Wes Anderson's latest film, \"The Phoenician Scheme,\" which was released in May. It comes after she played Winslet's daughter in the 2022 BAFTA award-winning TV drama \"I Am Ruth.\"\n\nThe youngest of Winslet's children, 12-year-old Bear Blaze Winslet, has yet to grace the silver screen, but has already expressed an interest.

    "description": "Ahead of her Eras Tour docuseries, Taylor Swift said that she values career longevity and admires artists who can \"keep a good thing going.\"",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift has been known to accept feedback from fans and critics, but there's one request she refuses to heed: \"Go away.\"\n\nAhead of the premiere of her Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Swift appeared on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" to discuss her recent achievements and milestones.\n\nWhen Colbert asked Swift who she could turn to for advice, she listed rock star Stevie Nicks and pop producer Max Martin as confidants.\n\n\"What I look up to the most in people is career longevity — career longevity, friendship longevity, longevity in their relationships, you know? How do you keep a good thing going?\" Swift said.\n\n\"I think there are certain corners of our society that really love that and look up to longevity,\" she continued. \"There are also corners that are like, 'Give someone else a turn! Can't you just go away so we can talk about how good you were?' And I'm like, 'I don't want to.'\"\n\nSwift has faced accusations of overexposure throughout her career, but particularly in the last few years. Her cross-continental, 149-show Eras Tour, which concluded in December 2024, garnered extensive media coverage and consistently went viral on social media. The New Yorker said Swift had achieved \"complete domination over popular culture.\"\n\nWhen Swift released \"The Tortured Poets Department\" halfway through the tour's two-year run, fans and critics alike called the album overlong and overindulgent. When it topped the Billboard 200 for 17 weeks, fans of other artists complained that Swift was sabotaging her fellow pop stars, including Billie Eilish and Charli XCX, by preventing their albums from reaching No. 1 on the chart.\n\nSwift's newest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" was met with similar reproach. In his review for The Atlantic, Spencer Kornhaber wrote, \"'Showgirl' is the sound of an overworked and overexposed entertainer reaching the mountaintop to find something worse than disappointment: burnout.\" Swift's prolificacy and sales tactics have been described as shameless and excessive.\n\nStill, Swift has refused to shrink away from the spotlight. The first two episodes of \"The End of an Era\" will be available to stream on Friday, along with an extended version of her Eras Tour concert movie, featuring a new segment with songs from \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" The remaining four episodes of the docuseries will be released in pairs over the next two weeks.\n\nDuring her interview with Colbert, Swift also joked that she prefers to think of herself as \"passionate\" and \"hyperactive,\" rather than a workaholic.\n\n\"When I take time off, it's always just like, I can't slow down the fact that I need to get up and do a lot of things today. But I can change what those things are,\" she said. \"I can figure out how to chill out, but I'm never gonna be a chill person.\"",

    "fullText": "MAGA Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump amid their high-profile divorce.\n\nThe Georgia Republican told CBS News that she is “starting to feel very sorry” for the 79-year-old, saying that his attacks on her reflect poorly on him.\n\nThe great schism began when Greene, 50, broke with him on the cost-of-living crisis, which Trump insists is a “hoax,” and the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nThe escalation saw Trump call her a “traitor,” and the one-time MAGA die-hard decided to quit Congress.\n\nDuring the CBS News interview, MTG said that Trump’s refusal to embrace the economic realities facing many Americans could cost the GOP its majority next year.\n\n“I do believe at this time that Republicans will lose the midterms, and I think that’s unfortunate,” Greene said. “I very much wanted to be part of a Republican majority in Congress that solved problems for the American people, that delivered what we promised to America.”\n\nGreene’s interview was released 24 hours after Trump sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Politico’s Dasha Burns on The Conversation podcast.\n\nAsked what he’d rate himself on the economy, Trump said, “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.” As the Daily Beast has previously reported, Americans have given a markedly different assessment.\n\nAnd so does Greene. Speaking on CBS News, she offered more advice to Trump. “The president needs to be aware that he’s a billionaire president of the United States,” she said.\n\n“You can’t gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable, and you can’t tell them that the economy is in A-plus-plus-plus. You just can’t do that, and I think it’s insulting to people’s intelligence,” she added, dropping two plusses from Trump’s grade.\n\nGreene made a similar prediction about the midterms when she announced on Nov. 21 that she intended to quit Congress in January 2026.\n\nIn a message shared on X, she said, in part, “I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.”",

    "description": "Rumblings of a $1.5 trillion valuation for SpaceX may be forcing investors to view currently public space companies as undervalued.",
    "fullText": "Talk of a colossal 2026 IPO from SpaceX is already having an impact on the market.\n\nInvestors have been asking for years if Elon Musk will ever allow SpaceX to start trading on public markets, and reports indicate next year could see its long-awaited debut at a $1.5 trillion valuation.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, Musk appeared to confirm talk of a SpaceX public offering, describing a reporter's explanation of an imminent IPO as \"accurate.\"\n\nThe fresh focus on the space industry has sparked fresh momentum for stocks in the sector. Since the SpaceX IPO chatter picked up in the last week, a handful of space companies have seen their shares soar.\n\nHere are the top-performing space stocks in the last five days:\n\n\"SpaceX's IPO acts as a 'sector validator,' proving privates can command valuations despite thin profits, encouraging investors to focus on less well known public space stocks, like Redwire and Firefly Aero, for early exposure to a projected $1 trillion space economy by 2040,\" Tony Bancroft, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds told Business Insider.\n\nPure hype may not be the only reason that these space stocks are surging, though. According to Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, the prospect of SpaceX going public at a trillion dollar valuation is likely shifting the ways in which investors view smaller companies.\n\n\"When the anchor of the entire ecosystem is valued that highly, then companies like Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile suddenly screen as structurally undervalued because they participate in the same demand cycle SpaceX is proving out,\" he noted.\n\nBoloor added that SpaceX's lofty valuation means that investors will have to start looking at the industry not as a high-risk emerging market, but as critical infrastructure that will be crucial to the US's future in multiple areas.\n\nThe consensus among finance pros seems to be that the space investing landscape has already started shifting, making small-cap space stocks an appealing play.\n\n\"If anything, the biggest impact of a SpaceX IPO is psychological,\" stated Drew Wandzilak, a principal at Alumni Ventures. \"It tells the market that this ecosystem is entering its growth phase. That is encouraging for investors like us and even more encouraging for the founders who are building the next layer of the space economy.\"",

Read more here.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut of a quarter percentage point lowered the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75% in mid-December.\n\nThis move continues to spark optimism among market participants, as valuations of most risk assets are directly tied to the risk-free rate, at least when it comes to modeling out a company's discounted future cash flows. Bond yields have also come down considerably in recent months (lower yields mean higher prices), so investors are winning across the board.\n\nBut the thing is, millions of Americans unfortunately don't participate in this market. And for those who are retired, Social Security payments are the key lifeline that puts food on the table.\n\nAccordingly, the Social Security Administration's (SSA) cost of living adjustment (COLA) each year in October is a big event that millions focus intently on. There's good reason for this, as this COLA will dictate how much a given senior's monthly check will increase for the coming year.\n\nMost seniors may already be aware that this cost of living adjustment is tied to inflation, but let's dive into whether there's any correlation to how this cut may affect next year's COLA (2027).\n\nAs many investors may be aware, the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) put forward by the Social Security Administration is aimed at helping seniors navigate rising prices across the economy. There are many factors that measure this rise, but the consumer price index (CPI) is the key factor that plays into how the SSA determines what the cost of living increase will be for an upcoming year.\n\nThe connection between the cost of living adjustment (COLA) and the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts since 2025 centers around inflation management and economic stabilization.\n\nSimply put, lower interest rates could indicate a stabilizing economy, though recent data shows inflation has been somewhat stubborn. Given that COLA adjustments are typically tied to inflation rates, investors can assess via longer-duration bond yields where inflation may come in at over the coming year or two.",

    "description": "OpenAI says its latest model, GPT 5.2, was shown to outperform industry professionals in specific tasks across 44 different occupations.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI released its anticipated update to GPT-5 on Thursday, boasting that the new AI is \"the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work.\"\n\n\"We designed GPT‑5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people; it's better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step project,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIn a benchmark test called GDPval, OpenAI said its new AI model can outperform \"industry professionals at well-specified knowledge work tasks spanning 44 occupations.\"\n\n\"GPT‑5.2 Thinking produced outputs for GDPval tasks at >11x the speed and <1% the cost of expert professionals, suggesting that when paired with human oversight, GPT‑5.2 can help with professional work,\" the company said.\n\nAnd in a note that is sure to catch the attention of bankers, OpenAI wrote that in an internal benchmark of junior investment banking analyst spreadsheet modeling tasks — \"such as putting together a three-statement model for a Fortune 500 company with proper formatting and citations, or building a leveraged buyout model for a take-private\" — the new model's score per task was \"9.3% higher than GPT‑5.1's, rising from 59.1% to 68.4%\" on average.\n\nOpenAI said that GPT-5.2 will begin rolling out today for paid ChatGPT plans. Paid users will have access to GPT-5.1 for three months under legacy models before it is sunsetted.\n\n\"We deploy GPT‑5.2 gradually to keep ChatGPT as smooth and reliable as we can,\" the company said.\n\nThe company also touted its gains in agentic coding ability.\n\n\"Even without the ability to do new things like output polished files, GPT-5.2 feels like the biggest upgrade we've had in a long time. Curious to hear what you think!\" OpenAI CEO Altman wrote on X.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo said more changes will be coming next year once OpenAI rolls out age verification across ChatGPT. She said an \"adult mode\" for the chatbot will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThe release comes just over a week after Altman declared a \"code red\" in a private message to employees, marshaling more resources to ChatGPT amid increasing competition from Google and other companies.\n\n\"Code reds are not uncommon,\" Somo said during an interview on TBPN, adding that the hosts could \"be the judge\" of the results of Altman's declaration. She said she was \"pretty proud of\" GPT-5.2's advances, even though its development pre-dated the \"code red.\"\n\nGoogle has been considered by many in tech to be gaining, if not surpassing, OpenAI in the AI race with its recent release of Gemini 3.\n\nThe announcement also occurred hours after OpenAI brokered a major deal with Disney, which secured a $1 billion investment and access to the media giant's lucrative and popular IP.\n\n\"It has been a very cool last 10 years; OpenAI has been more special to work on than I could have possibly imagined,\" Altman wrote on X on Thursday.",

    "description": "Joni Ernst and Ed Markey are split over extending deadlines to pursue fraud in restaurant relief and the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant programs.",
    "fullText": "The top Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee said Democrats are blocking a measure to give federal prosecutors more time to investigate bailouts for restaurants and the live-entertainment industry.\n\nSenator Joni Ernst said Senator Ed Markey is holding up her bill that would give investigators until at least 2031 to file charges for defrauding the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund or the $14.5 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program.\n\n\"We are not getting a lot of cooperation coming from our Ranking Member, Markey, and the Senate Democrats,\" Ernst told Business Insider. \"I'm not very optimistic that it's going to happen, and it's very, very frustrating.\"\n\nMarkey's office declined to respond to a request for comment.\n\nLess than two weeks remain for the Senate to pass the legislation, which would enable the bill to move to the president's desk and possibly be signed into law.\n\nIt's not clear whether Ernst has formally sought unanimous consent to pass the statute-of-limitations extender bill because the process can take place informally, off the Senate floor. It's possible the measure could be passed next year, though the deadline to prosecute some SVOG fraud cases could lapse as soon as April 8.\n\nBusiness Insider documented how over $200 million from the SVOG program went to celebrities who used taxpayer money for private jets, lavish parties, luxury clothes, and other questionable spending.\n\nInvestigators haven't accused any of those recipients of wrongdoing, and most of the grants discussed in BI's stories were closed out by the Small Business Administration.\n\nMike Galdo, a former prosecutor who focused on pandemic fraud, said the bill could give agents, analysts, and prosecutors more time to build cases.\n\n\"Given some of the ambiguity in the language in the SVOG statute and regulations, as well as enforcement priorities other than fraud taking center stage for this Administration, it is unclear how many additional SVOG-related enforcement matters will be brought,\" he said in an email.\n\nErnst said Democrats preferred to \"rant and rail\" against President Donald Trump. At a committee hearing for SBA matters on December 10, Markey accused Republicans of waging \"an all-out assault\" on an SBA program that sets aside billions of dollars in federal contracts for small businesses owned by women and racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nA similar bill to extend the statute of limitations for the SVOG program and the restaurant fund has already passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support.\n\nBoth Ernst and Markey have pointed fingers across the aisle for delaying their legislative priorities. Ernst yesterday sought unanimous consent to pass a bill that would have clawed back more than $65 billion in unspent COVID relief funds, a measure that was blocked by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. And Markey blamed Republicans for blocking a one-year extension of two programs that dole out billions in grants to tech-oriented small businesses.\n\nRepresentative Gil Cisneros, a Democratic congressman from California, said earlier this month that the SBA's inspector-general has 31 open Restaurant Revitalization Fund cases and six open Shuttered Venue Operators Grant cases.\n\nA spokesman for the SBA's inspector-general's office didn't respond to a request for comment about those numbers.\n\nThe two programs cut checks of up to $10 million meant to support businesses that had been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, as waves of the deadly virus and government stay-at-home orders led businesses dependent on in-person gatherings to struggle.\n\nGovernment auditors faulted the SBA over its internal controls, and the combined total of fraud and waste in those and other pandemic programs may exceed $400 billion. Prosecutions have barely scratched the surface compared to the scale of the suspected fraud, but some misspent money could also be recovered through administrative actions or civil lawsuits.",

    "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle slam Big Tech's safety failures in reaction to Australia's social media ban for children under 16.",
    "fullText": "Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, have released a powerful statement via their Archewell Foundation regarding the world’s first law implemented in Australia that bans social media for children under the age of 16. The couple, who have focused their philanthropic work on online safety and mental wellness, lauded the nation's leadership while cautioning that the measure does not fix the root cause of the crisis.\n\nThe legislation took effect on December 10, targeting platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Snapchat, and imposing potential fines of up to AUD$50 million ($49.5 million USD) on companies that fail to keep young users off their services.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess summed up their complex reaction with a strong statement: \"It shouldn't have come to this.\" They expanded on their praise, celebrating the urgency of the intervention against addiction and exploitation. “We celebrate Australia’s leadership for seeing and acting on how these technology companies are negatively impacting young people with little to no recourse or accountability, and feeble efforts from the companies to stem the flow of harms,” the statement reads.\n\nHarry and Meghan emphasized that the bold move sends a necessary signal to Silicon Valley. They view the ban as vital for protecting children at a critical developmental stage. “This bold, decisive action to protect children at a critical moment in their development sends a strong signal that a child’s mind is not a commodity to be exploited. It buys young people valuable time back in their childhoods, but it doesn’t fix the fundamental issue we all still face with social media platforms.”\n\nThe couple pointed to the devastating human cost that necessitated the government’s action. “We’ve heard from too many grieving parents. Too many families devastated by cyberbullying, feeds that radicalize kids toward self-harm, and algorithmic manipulation designed to maximize engagement at any cost.”\n\nThe statement also acknowledged the significant positive potential of social media, particularly for vulnerable youth, arguing that these platforms can be a “genuine lifeline” for LGBTQ+ young people and those suffering mental health crises. However, the omnipresent harms often overshadow the benefits.\n\nThe core of the couple's critique is that the ban is only a temporary solution. “Here’s the truth: the ban is an effective measure to stop imminent harm, but ultimately only works as a band aid that does not address tech’s broken design and exploitive business incentives, requiring us to protect young people in the first place.”\n\nThe statement concluded by calling for a \"reckoning,\" hoping this Australian ban will force tech leaders to take responsibility for platforms built with growth as their first principle, rather than safety. The message notes what the Sussexes deem to be an ethical failure: \"The companies ‘unintended consequences’ of a decade ago are now part of their money making strategy, and children have become their collateral.”\n\nNext: Prince Harry Called Oprah in a Panic to Handle Delicate ‘Problem’ at Home",

Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.\n\nTrump has been pressuring Indiana to redraw its Congressional map to eliminate any Democrats holding seats in the state. The deep red state had previously shot down the idea in its Senate, but has since revived the effort under threats from Trump. Trump previously pushed Texas to redraw it map to favor the GOP, which in turn led California to move to eliminate Republican seats.\n\n“If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country, they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats. Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.

    "title": "Menopause treatment is getting personal",
    "description": "Menopause care innovations include at-home hormone testing, virtual appointments, and new non-hormonal therapies for symptom relief.",
    "fullText": "For decades, menopause has been treated like a medical nuisance to be managed silently. Women, knowing it's taboo to talk about, have quietly dealt with symptoms like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, restless nights, brain fog, mood swings, and plummeting libido.\n\n\"We've had a two-sided problem that is being unraveled: patients who have been left to suffer and providers who have been left without education,\" Jessica Nazzaro, a board-certified OBGYN, certified menopause practitioner, and a medical advisor for at-home hormone tracking company Mira, told Business Insider. Patients now \"know they are not alone, not crazy, and can find help.\"\n\nToday, many can test their hormone levels at home, talk to menopause specialists online, and get personalized prescriptions shipped directly to their doors.\n\nThis shift marks a reimagining of how women navigate their midlife years. Once dismissed as an inevitable decline, menopause is now treated as another phase of health — one that can be supported, studied, and optimized.\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) — which restores a patient's levels of estrogen, progesterone, or both to relieve menopause symptoms — was once the only solution women could turn to for things like night sweats, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness.\n\nThen came the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study in 2002, a long-term national study on preventing breast and colorectal cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, which found that HRT could increase cancer risk.\n\nPrescriptions plummeted, and stigma spiked.\n\nIn the years after, a group of doctors and researchers revisited the study and found it to be flawed because of its narrow scope. The WHI, which looked at disease risk in postmenopausal women, did not include vaginal estrogen, for example.\n\nExperts now tend to advocate for personalized treatment plans and say that cancer risk depends on the type of hormones used and the duration of treatment.\n\n\"We've learned that HRT is indeed protective of heart health, brain health, and bone health. It does not cause breast cancer, as was publicized by the WHI, but rather can proliferate an estrogen-sensitive tumor in the breast or other tissue,\" Nazzaro said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kathleen Green, an OB-GYN at Maven Clinic, \"More recent studies show that for most women, the benefits of HRT far outweigh the risks.\"\n\nStarting hormone therapy closer to the onset of menopause — typically before age 60 or within 10 years of entering menopause — can help alleviate symptoms and improve bone health.\n\nThe biggest change? Personalization. Doctors now consider a woman's age, symptoms, medical history, and time since menopause to determine the best form and dose of HRT — whether it's a pill, patch, gel, vaginal cream, or ring.\n\nAs more women demand better care, tech companies are offering to meet them where they are. At-home hormone testing tools like Mira and Proov can track users' hormone levels and turn them into personalized scores and cycle insights.\n\nAccording to Nazzaro, Mira's device tracks hormonal shifts with lab-level accuracy and \"helps women see patterns in their own cycles, understand which stage of menopause they're in, and make informed decisions about symptom management, lifestyle adjustments, or treatments.\"\n\nDr. Sophia Yen, the CEO and cofounder of Pandia Health, is a fan of Mira and told Business Insider that it's seamless to use — you simply collect your urine in a cup — and it provides \"lab-grade results,\" all from the comfort of your home.\n\nTelehealth companies such as Midi, Gennev, Pandia Health, and Winona provide virtual appointments with menopause-trained clinicians — such as board-certified OB/GYNs and doctors who are also NASM-certified menopause practitioners. Pandia Health also offers asynchronous telemedicine, where women can message doctors without face or voice contact — establishing a safe space to share their concerns.\n\nEven with the rise of personalized HRT, some women can't or prefer not to take hormones — especially breast cancer survivors. That's driving innovation in non-hormonal therapies.\n\nIn 2025, the FDA approved Lynkuet, a gel capsule from Bayer that blocks brain receptors responsible for hot flashes. In clinical trials of more than 700 women, it cut the frequency of hot flashes within a week.\n\n\"Many cannot or will not take hormones, so Lynkuet could be a wonderful option,\" Alyssa Dweck, the chief medical officer at Bonafide Health, told Business Insider.\n\nOther new options include estetrol, a natural estrogen steroid pill, which is designed to address hot flashes, vaginal atrophy, and loss of bone mass. Vaginal estrogen creams and suppositories that treat dryness, itching, and irritation can also help.\n\nAfter years of debate, the FDA recently removed the \"black box\" warning — the FDA's highest issued safety label — from estrogen-related products. The move could make women feel more comfortable using these medications, Nazzaro said.\n\n\"I've had patients who pick up their prescription for vaginal estrogen after a thorough discussion and decide not to use it specifically because of the black box warning,\" Nazzaro told Business Insider.\n\nDoctors say the shift isn't just happening among menopausal women — it's starting earlier.\n\n\"I have women in their 30s presenting to my office wanting to understand what they might anticipate when they enter perimenopause,\" Dweck said. They want to understand \"what proactive measures can be taken to avoid distressing symptoms.\"\n\nThat proactive mindset, paired with more tools and data, could redefine menopause care for the next generation.\n\n\"I feel incredibly optimistic,\" Dweck said.\n\nStaying open-minded to emerging research and aware of the risks and benefits of new therapies is crucial to navigating this phase of life, said Dweck. She suggested being proactive and educating yourself about menopause with credible sources like The Menopause Society.\n\nCertain lifestyle adjustments like exercise, nutrition, and sleep can also make a major difference and support treatments like hormone therapy, non-hormonal drugs, or clinically studied supplements, Dweck said.\n\nAnd remember — although the menopause care market offers many products that are touted as \"solutions,\" they may not have solid scientific evidence to support their claims.\n\n\"Product labels can be overwhelming, frightening, and confusing, and for this reason, a comprehensive discussion with an experienced healthcare provider about indications for use, risks, benefits, and specific use instructions is warranted,\" Dweck said.\n\nShe recommended considering personal needs based on symptoms, medical and family history, medications, and lifestyle habits. There's no one-size-fits-all approach or experience when it comes to menopause.",

    "description": "Disney faces an engagement problem as kids gravitate to YouTube. It's looking to OpenAI to help boost engagement.",
    "fullText": "Disney is losing the war for attention. Can its blockbuster OpenAI licensing deal change the momentum on the battlefield?\n\nSoon, you'll be able to use OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT and the video generator Sora, to create content featuring Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Darth Vader.\n\nCEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.\n\nIger said initially Disney would \"curate some of the videos that have been created on the Sora platform and put them onto Disney+, which we think is a great way to increase engagement with our Disney+ users, particularly the younger users.\" Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.\n\nThere's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.\n\nTime people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.\n\nData from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.\n\nDisney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.\n\nTraditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?\"\n\nDisney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.\n\nJohn Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.\n\n\"UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,\" he said. \"But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.\"\n\nDisney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.\n\nShae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.\n\n\"I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,\" she added. \"So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.\"\n\nSome in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.\n\nFor one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.\n\nSam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.\n\n\"I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,\" Tung said.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "description": "Bloated valuations and an aging bull market are two things that could hold back the S&P 500 for the next decade, forecasters say.",
    "fullText": "A dark thought is starting to circulate around Wall Street. What if, after years of stellar gains, the US stock market is basically flat for the next decade?\n\nThat feels like an unbelievable idea given the current bull run for the stock market, which is just the latest in a larger secular rally that's been going on for almost 15 years.\n\nThe gains continued to pile up on Thursday. As investors fled tech amid worries about Oracle's earnings, they pumped the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow to fresh record highs.\n\nBut the possibility of the party soon coming to an end is being floated by a growing number of forecasters, who see two main reasons the market could be held back:\n\nNow, more analysts see what could be a lost decade coming for stocks — a 10-year period where the US market sees near-zero returns or severely lags other markets around the world.\n\nIn a note this week, Bank of America said its team of equity strategists saw the S&P 500 shedding 0.1% over the next decade. Historically, that's a terrible performance, given that the S&P 500 has gained an average 10.5% a year since the 1950s.\n\nStrategists pointed to high valuations and back-to-back years of double-digit growth in the benchmark index.\n\n\"Even for next year, the math of history is tough: average returns for the S&P 500 after 3 years of >15% growth are 2.3ppt lower than the average annual return. Investors may need GDP & EPS surprises to avoid a seventh 'lost decade,'\" BofA wrote in a client note.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also said he expects the S&P 500 to remain relatively flat for the next 10 years. That projection is based on where the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 currently resides, he said on Thursday.\n\n\"The historical relationship between the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio and subsequent 10-year annualized returns shows that investors should expect to get zero in return in the S&P 500 over the coming decade,\" Sløk said.\n\nIn November, Goldman Sachs analysts said they saw the US market coming in last place for returns in the coming 10-year stretch. The S&P 500 is on track to gain around 6.5% a year for the next 10 years, the bank estimated, falling short of estimated returns in Europe, Japan, Asia, and emerging markets.\n\nThe bank said it expected earnings growth to be stronger in other markets. Valuations in the US are also high and on track to decline around 1% annually over the next decade, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"If the profitability and/or valuations of the largest companies falter, unless another cohort of 'superstars' emerges, returns for the broad market will likely be hampered as today's largest stocks fall back to earth,\" analysts wrote of their bearish scenario for the US market.",

    "title": "I Tracked My Health With Whoop, and This Is What I Liked (and What I Ignored)",
    "description": "The last six weeks have taught me that hydration is more important than I realized, and opened my eyes to how much shut-eye I actually need.",
    "fullText": "When I reviewed the Whoop 5.0 and MG (and, earlier, the Whoop 4.0), I kept it to the basics—how the strap looks, works, and charges, and what activities it can track. But that's only part of it, and today, I’m going to dive in to all the metrics Whoop reports and offer a reality check on what I've found most useful and what isn’t worth paying attention to.\n\n(I'll leave out the activity tracking features here, since I covered them in more depth in the review, but the bottom line is this: I love the way it tracks how hard your workouts are—strength workouts included—but it's not going to replace a true fitness watch for most people.)\n\nI haven't worn the Whoop band as regularly as I do the Oura ring, for which I was able to give a four-year retrospective. But to research both this article and my reviews, I’ve worn the Whoop for a couple of stints of at least a few weeks each, tracking my workouts and sleep regularly. With that said, here's a deeper dive into what it’s actually like to wear the Whoop strap long-term, using it to judge and guide your habits and performance.\n\nLet me take you through a typical day. I’m wearing the Whoop band on either my wrist or upper arm, and it’s probably been a few days since I last charged it. (I get about five days on a charge.) I made sure I had it on when I went to bed. If I look at my Whoop app first thing in the morning, it will sometimes tell me that it’s still “processing” my sleep, and there’s a button I can press to “end sleep” and get my recovery results.\n\nThe Whoop app will show you a survey called your “journal” the first time you open the app each day. I’ll talk more about the journal in a section below. Let’s say you’ve already filled out your journal, and you’re looking at the main app. From the home screen, on a typical day I might see:\n\nMy recovery at the top, color coded. Green is good, and you get that if your recovery is 66% or better. Yellow is OK (34% and up), and red is poor. Today, I have a yellow recovery, at 48%. (For the month of April, I got 19 green recoveries, 9 yellow, 0 red, and on two nights I forgot to wear the strap to bed.)\n\nSome notes about things I should pay attention to. Perhaps my HRV is lower than usual, which might be because of my hard workout yesterday.\n\nThe health monitor, which tells me whether my respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, HRV, and skin temperature are within my normal ranges.\n\nThe stress monitor, which I guess tells me how stressed I am. To be honest, I don’t find this useful.\n\nA \"daily outlook\" button I can press. This starts a conversation with Whoop Coach—more about that in a minute.\n\nToday’s timeline, showing when I slept. As I do other activities, like workouts, they’ll show up here.\n\nRecommendations for tonight’s sleep, including a recommended bedtime.\n\nAfter this, there is a scorecard for my current “plan” (more about that below), and a dashboard with the individual metrics I might care about, like heart rate variability (HRV) and a count of my steps so far today, a feature that’s still in beta.\n\nAlong the top of the screen, I can tap on my scores for Sleep, Recovery, or Strain. The Strain screen is interesting, since it gives a recommended Strain level for the day. It may suggest that I take on a “moderate” level of Strain, and set my target as 8.9 to 12.9. You get most of your Strain from exercise, and a little from everyday activity like walking around. On a morning I haven’t done any workouts or left the house yet, I may be around 2.7 Strain just from sitting around.\n\nLet’s return to that Daily Outlook button. Tap that, and you’ll be launched into a conversation with Whoop Coach, an AI chatbot. This is probably the only AI bot I converse with on the regular, because it does a decent job of explaining the app’s metrics and recommends workouts for the day.\n\nTo use one real example: on a certain day it complimented me on completing a running workout yesterday, and told me my workout schedule had been consistent, with 162 minutes in active heart rate zones so far that week. It then described a few trends in my metrics, including that my resting heart rate had improved over the past few weeks, but that my recovery that day was lower than my usual.\n\nThen comes the fun part. It makes recommendations for workouts to do today, and habits to focus on. It told me to aim for three liters of water that day (that’s a little bit more than my usual) with plenty of fruits and vegetables. And for a workout, I could meet my recommended Strain score with something that is low impact to “support recovery,” since my heart rate and HRV suggested I may need a bit of a rest.\n\nThe Whoop Coach went on to suggest three workouts to choose from, based on the kinds of activities it knows I like to do. They included a 30-minute run, mostly in zones 1 and 2, or an 80-minute weightlifting workout at a low-medium intensity. I can tap a button at the bottom of each workout that says “Commit,” and doing this will add it to my timeline for the day. I can do the workout later by just tapping that button, and it will start the activity timer for me.\n\nI love that it can recommend these workouts for me, since otherwise “get 8.9 Strain” is an inscrutable instruction. Unfortunately, the little graphic showing time in heart rate zones is all you get. I’ve asked the Whoop Coach if it could time me through those intervals, perhaps beeping when it’s time to switch from one zone to another, but it doesn’t have that functionality.\n\nIt does offer a specific workout plan that I could punch into a workout timer app of my choice. In the past, the Whoop Coach has struggled to put together interval workouts that add up to the number of minutes that are supposed to be in the workout; that seems to be improving. But the workout ideas are still pretty generic. I found that the best way to use the coach is to see what it recommends, then use that as a sort of vague guidance if I have flexibility in my training program or my real-life plans for the day. For example, if I have a hard 45-minute running workout planned today, but Whoop thinks I should do something lighter, I might see if I can swap today's run with an easy run that is scheduled for later in the week.\n\nWhoop gives you so many sleep metrics, it can be hard to know where to start. I see two major, useful features here: the report of how long you slept compared to how much sleep you needed, and the smart alarms that you can set in any of a variety of ways.\n\nOn your Sleep tab, you’ll get a score for your sleep “performance,” comparing the amount of sleep you got to the amount it calculates you needed. Today I slept more than I needed, which doesn’t match with how I felt groggily dragging myself out of bed. The timing seems right, though—I was extra tired yesterday so I both got to bed early and slept a little late.\n\nI think it’s a fool’s errand to worry about how “accurate” sleep tracking is, since no wearable is truly accurate, but most of them are good enough. But for a comparison, the total sleep time is usually similar to what Oura reports, and the sleep phases are often more-or-less in the same ballpark. Here’s one example from a day I wore both Oura and Whoop:\n\nTotal sleep matters more than the other numbers, in my book. Increase your total sleep and you’re likely to sleep better. (I have data backing this up from my long-term Oura trends—total sleep correlates closely with other metrics and scores of sleep quality.)\n\nWhoop also tracks your “sleep debt,” or how much sleep you needed but didn’t get. In one example month I had a six nights with a “high” sleep debt of 45 minutes or more. Nine times it was moderate (30 to 45 minutes), and 14 times it was 30 minutes or less.\n\nOne of Whoop’s most intriguing features is the sleep coach, which can advise you when to go to bed, and even help you decide when your alarm should go off. (It’s also one of the most hidden features. Tap on the “tonight’s sleep” card on your overview screen.)\n\nFrom this screen, called the Sleep Planner, you can choose whether you want to “reach my sleep need” (making up any sleep debt, as needed); “improve my sleep,” which will recommend times that help you to be more consistent in your sleep schedule; or “reach my weekly plan goal,” which I’ll say more about below.\n\nAnd then, there’s a second set of preferences. When you try to set an alarm, the app will ask if you’d like to wake up at an exact time, or when you’ve met your sleep goal for the night, or as soon as you’re “in the green.” That last one refers to a 66% or better recovery, which may not be ideal, but should ensure you’re not going to be dead on your feet.\n\nRealistically, I don’t use these features too often. I do have a sleep goal set in my weekly plan, but I’m not fiddling with an app every night to decide when to wake up. On the other hand, if I had a chaotic schedule, like that of a student or a pro sports player, I could definitely see making more use of this feature.\n\nThe activity and sleep tracking happen more or less automatically, and pretty much any fitness tracker or smartwatch can do those things. Where Whoop really shines, from a wellness perspective, is in helping you track all the little habits and factors that may be affecting your sleep or your athletic performance.\n\nThis is where the Journal comes in. You can fill it out at any time during the day, but it will also pop up first thing in the morning and ask you what happened yesterday. Did you eat a late meal? Did you have any alcohol? Did you hydrate well? If you don’t like these questions, you can set it up to ask you different ones. It can also pull in data from other parts of the app or from connected apps—for example, if you log your menstrual cycle in Apple Health, that can show up here as well.\n\nEach habit or factor only becomes useful if you log at least five yeses and five nos. Anything that you almost always do, or that you almost never do, isn’t going to be very helpful to track. So I’ve narrowed down my Journal questions to only include things I’ll answer differently from night to night, or things I’m trying to improve on.\n\nOne important caveat: leaving the question blank doesn’t count as a yes or a no. At first I only answered a question if I could say “yes,” and otherwise I’d leave it blank—for example, answering “yes” if I’d had alcohol that day. But when I looked at my results later, I found that with a total of seven yeses and zero nos for alcohol, Whoop couldn’t give me any reports that used that information. When I noticed this I was able to backfill the last few days’ worth of journal entries, but you can’t go back more than about a week.\n\nThat extra week’s worth of data was enough to get an answer on alcohol, though: it hurts my recovery, taking it down an average of 9% on nights I had a beer or two. Or at least that’s how Whoop represents it—these are correlations, and Whoop doesn’t actually know what’s causing what. For example, taking melatonin supposedly hurts my recovery by 4%. But is melatonin really the culprit, or do I tend to take melatonin when I’m already having trouble sleeping? You need to take these results with a big grain of salt. To Whoop’s credit, it includes a note that “this impact is significantly different than the Whoop average. Note that impacts can sometimes be affected by other correlated factors that you don’t track.”\n\nThe two things that do help my recovery, according to Whoop’s insights (which you can access from the top of the Journal screen), are sticking to a consistent bedtime—8% improvement—and being well-hydrated, a 4% improvement. The consistent bedtime was automatically filled out from Whoop data, while the hydration came from me answering a yes/no question each day.\n\nWeekly plans are a nice way to work on a small set of habits for a short time. Rather than trying to monitor everything for every outcome, you pick, say, three things you want to work on. Here are some examples that the app provides, and the habits or factors that each one tracks:\n\nBoost fitness: increase time in high intensity heart rate zones, meet a protein goal four days per week, do any strength training activity one day per week\n\nFeel better: increase daily steps, meet hydration goal four days per week, do “any recovery activity” three days per week\n\nSleep deeper: increase sleep consistency, increase sleep performance, avoid late meals\n\nAfter experimenting with some of these, I ended up creating a custom plan for myself. I chose:\n\nGet 7:30 hours of sleep on average\n\nAvoid using my phone in bed four days per week\n\nMeet my hydration goal five days per week\n\nThroughout the week I can check in on how I’m doing, and at the end of the week Whoop gives me a little report and asks if I’d like to do the same plan next week, or change it up. I find this a useful way to work on a mini goal, and it’s a lot less overwhelming than poring over huge dashboards full of all the data Whoop can collect.\n\nFor when you do want to pore over all your data, there are detailed weekly and monthly “performance assessments” that Whoop can share with you. Each of these is a PDF with graphs showing what you did over the course of the week or month, and how it compares with previous data.\n\nFor example, my monthly report for last April shows how my Strain and recovery compare with previous weeks throughout the year. I don’t wear my Whoop often enough to get any big insights from this—as I said, I only really wear it when I’m testing features or writing a review—but man, I would love this if it were available on one of the devices I do wear month in and month out. (As much as I admire the Whoop, I can only wear so many devices in addition to the ones I test for work.)\n\nMy weekly report is more narrowly focused. The most recent one starts with a statement: “Strain was optimal. Sleep could use improvement.” My Strain is also down slightly this week compared with the previous week, and my sleep consistency was poor. I like the graph that shows how my bedtimes and wake-up times line up (or don’t) with the times the app recommended for me.\n\nThe Whoop app gives you a wealth of data, and honestly I would say most of it isn’t worth paying attention to. The app has so many data points and fractal little rabbit holes you can get lost in. You could spend hours perusing reports and tweaking settings. You could spend an unlimited amount of time chatting with the Whoop Coach AI. And you don’t need to do that.\n\nWhat is useful is choosing a few things to pay attention to and letting go of the rest. Fortunately, the app gives you plenty of ways to do this. You can select a few things that matter to you in the Weekly Plan, and you can hide things from your Dashboard that you don’t need to check on every day.\n\nAs for the things I (almost) never pay attention to:\n\nDon’t overthink your sleep stages. Getting enough sleep, and consistent sleep, will cover your bases.\n\nDon’t read too much into the recovery scores; you are resilient enough to be able to handle your scheduled workout even if your sleep wasn’t perfect. The exception would be if you’re feeling truly awful—you’re sick or something—in which case, you would know because of how you feel, not because of a number on an app.\n\nRemember that the insights tell you about correlation, not causation—as in my melatonin example, where melatonin is correlated with worse sleep, possibly because I'm taking it when I expect to have worse sleep. These are not really \"insights\" at all, just data that you'll need to use your own brain (and further experimentation) to make sense of.\n\nI have found that paying too much attention to a recovery app can drive me a little crazy. Instead of waking up and not really thinking about how I feel—I’m fine, probably—I find myself wondering if the app agrees that I feel tired and sore. Or I’ll think I’m OK, but the app says my HRV is down, and now I have to think about what may have caused that. I wouldn’t recommend intensive tracking like this for a person who finds they can easily get sucked in to obsessing over numbers. But if numbers bring you joy, the Whoop app can certainly give you plenty of them.",

    "title": "The Surprising Origins of Hanukkah (and Why It Moves Around Every Year)",
    "description": "Also: When will the Festival of Lights take place in 2025?",
    "fullText": "Hanukkah (or \"Chanukah,\" if you prefer; it’s a transliteration, so there is no “correct” spelling) is an annual eight-day Jewish religious festival that usually takes place in late November or early December. In 2025, Hanukkah begins on the evening of Sunday, December 14, and continues through Monday December 22.\n\nWhile Hanukkah falls on different dates every year on the Gregorian calendar you’re probably familiar with, it begins on the same day every year on the Hebrew calendar: 25th of Kislev. The Hebrew calendar is based on the moon, and Hanukkah falls on the 25th day after the new moon that marks the beginning of the month of Kislev.\n\nHanukkah celebrates the anniversary of the beginning of the Maccabean revolt against the Seleucid Empire and the re-dedication of the Second Temple that happened in the 2nd century BCE. That’s the strict definition of the holiday. In practice, in present day America, Hanukkah is the “festival of lights,” a winter celebration usually marked by gift-giving, delicious foods, candle-lighting, and the boring game of dreidel (more on that below).\n\nReligiously, Hanukkah is a comparatively minor holiday, not nearly as significant as the Jewish High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but it is a favorite among children, particularly American children. These days, the holiday is marked in Jewish communities all over the world, but Jewish kids in the U.S. are the undisputed Hanukkah kings and queens.\n\nThere are two ways to think about the origin of the Festival of Lights. You could say Hanukkah began around 200 BCE when Greek leaders prevented Jews from practicing their religion, leading the Maccabees to rise up in defiance. Or you could say Hanukkah began in Cincinnati.\n\nBefore a couple hundred years ago, there’s no record of how anyone celebrated Hanukkah—maybe it was done, but it seems that no one made too big of a deal about it. That all changed in the mid-to-late 1800s, when a couple of Cincinnati rabbis, Isaac M. Wise and Max Lilienthal, put Hanukkah on the holiday map. They popularized, promoted, and Americanized the holiday, introducing celebrations of Hanukkah to their congregations and promoting it in national Jewish publications.\n\nWise and Lilienthal were leaders of Reform Judaism, a more modern, less orthodox form of the religion, and to some extent, the holiday they popularized reflects that set of values. It was meant to help Jewish children in America honor their heritage by presenting an exciting, relatable historical event featuring Jewish heroes. it was also meant to be Christmas-like—a family holiday that’s fun.\n\nLilienthal noted the rising popularity of Christmas celebrations in the U.S. in the 1800s, and was impressed with the way Christian churches used the secular aspects of the holiday to teach their faith, so he borrowed the gift-giving and lighthearted nature of non-religious Christmas celebrations and put a Jewish spin on ‘em. Thus modern Hanukkah was born.\n\n“We must do something, too, to enliven our children… [They] shall have a grand and glorious Chanukah festival nicer than any Christmas festival.” Lilienthal wrote in 1876.\n\nThe main event of Hanukkah among most who celebrate is the lighting of candles before dinner, one more for each successive night of the festival. When the Maccabees rebuilt the temple back in the olden times, they re-lit the menorahs—candle holders for seven candles—but they only had enough oil for the candles to burn for one night (or so the story goes). Miraculously, the lights stayed on for eight nights.\n\nTechnically, most people don’t light menorahs on Hanukkah. Menorahs have eight lights. Hanukkah candles are usually in a “hanukkiah” which holds nine: eight main candles and the helper candle that lights them all.\n\nFoodwise, you can eat whatever you like—this isn't a fasting holiday. Fried foods, particularly latkes (fried potato pancakes), are popular and delicious, especially if served with sour cream and/or apple sauce. Jelly doughnuts are another favorite. But like I said, you can eat whatever you like.\n\nMany Hanukkah-heads give gifts too—one for each night.\n\nHanukkah carols have never really caught on because golden age Jewish songwriters were busy writing “Let it Snow,” “Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,” “Silver Bells,” “White Christmas,” “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” and almost every other Christmas song that isn’t a hymn. But there's \"I Have a Little Dreidel,\" a folksong with English lyrics attributed to Samuel E. Goldfarb, but that's not explicitly about the holiday. This all leaves Adam Sandler's \"Hanukkah Song\" as the most well-known tune commemorating the Festival of Lights.\n\nSpeaking of dreidels, though...\n\nMany households break out dreidels (spinning tops with Hebrew characters on them) and play with them for a few minutes after dinner. Dreidels are marked with Nun (נ), Gimel (ג), Hey (ה), and Shin (ש), which form an acronym for \"Nes Gadol Hayah Sham\" (A great miracle happened there). Here's how the game is traditionally played: Everyone starts with the same amount of something \"valuable,\" usually chocolate coins. At the start of a round, everyone antes up, then they takes turns spinning the dreidel, following the directions of which character it lands on.\n\nנ (Nun) means “nisht” or “nothing.” Player does nothing if Nun comes up.\n\nה (Hey) means “halb” or “half.” The player gets half of the pot. (If there is an odd number of pieces, the player gets the extra.)\n\nש (Shin) means “shtel” or “put in.” The player adds a chocolate coin to the pot.\n\nג (Gimel) means “gantz” or “everything.” The player gets everything in the pot. Jackpot!\n\n(It's not a very good game: all luck; no skill.)\n\nIt’s widely believed that dreidel is the most popular Hanukkah game, but this is a lie. The most popular (and best) Hanukkah game is “guess which candle will be the last to go out,” a much more nuanced and exciting game played by everyone who has ever fired up a menorah (sorry, a hanukkiah) before dinner. Do darker candles burn faster than lighter ones? Does placement matter? How about wick length? All of this and more must be considered and discussed if you’re going to master this exciting game.\n\nYou can celebrate any holiday you want; it's a free country. Hanukkah is generally seen as a “fun” holiday, without the deep religious significance of other Jewish holidays. While I don’t speak for anyone else, none of the Jews I know take offense if non-Jews want to light some candles and watch 8 Crazy Nights to capture some of that Hanukkah magic. Some of the traditions of the holiday were partly inspired by Christmas anyway, and much of Christmas was (maybe) appropriated from pagan solstice celebrations itself, so go nuts—it’s the holidays.",

    "description": "GPT-5.2 is here, and, according to OpenAI, better than ever.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is having a hell of a day. First, the company announced a $1 billion equity investment from Disney, alongside a licensing deal that will let Sora users generate videos with characters like Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker, and Simba. Shortly after, OpenAI revealed its latest large language model: GPT-5.2.\n\nOpenAI says that this new GPT model is particularly useful for \"professional knowledge work.\" The company advertises how GPT-5.2 is better than previous models at making spreadsheets, putting together presentations, writing code, analyzing pictures, and working through multi-step projects. For this model, the company also gathered insights from tech companies: Supposedly, Notion, Box Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom all find GPT-5.2 to have \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning,\" while Databricks, Hex, and Triple Whale believe GPT-5.2 to be \"exceptional\" with both agentic data science and document analysis tasks.\n\nBut most of OpenAI's user base aren't professionals. Most of the users who will interact with GPT-5.2 are using ChatGPT, and many of those for free, at that. What can those users expect when OpenAI upgrades the free version of ChatGPT with these new models?\n\nOpenAI says that GPT-5.2 will improve ChatGPT's \"day to day\" functionality. The new model supposedly makes the chatbot more structured, reliable, and \"enjoyable to talk to,\" though I've never found the last part to be necessarily true.\n\nGPT-5.2 will impact the ChatGPT experience differently depending on which of the three models you happen to be using. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Instant is for \"everyday work and learning.\" It's apparently better for questions seeking information about certain subjects, how-to questions and walkthroughs, technical writing, and translations—maybe ChatGPT will get you to give up your Duolingo obsession.\n\nGPT-5.2 Thinking, however, is supposedly made for \"deeper work.\" OpenAI wants you using this model for coding, summarizing lengthy documents, answering queries about files you send to ChatGPT, solving math and logic problems, and decision making. Finally, there's GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI's \"smartest and most trustworthy option\" for the most complicated questions. The company says 5.2 Pro produces fewer errors and stronger performance compared to previous models.\n\nOpenAI says that this latest update improves how the models responds to distressing prompts, such as those showing signs of suicide, self-harm, or emotional dependence on the AI. As such, the company says this model has \"fewer undesirable responses\" in GPT-5.2 Instant and Thinking compared to GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking. In addition, the company is working on an \"age prediction model,\" which will automatically place content restrictions on users who the model think are under 18.\n\nThese safety improvements are important—critical, even—as we start to understand the correlations between chatbots and mental health. The company has admitted its failure in \"recognizing signs of delusion,\" as users turned to the tool for emotional support. In some cases, ChatGPT fed into delusional thinking, encouraging people's dangerous beliefs. Some families have even sued companies like OpenAI over claims that their chatbots helped or encouraged victims commit suicide.\n\nActively acknowledging improvements to user safety is undoubtedly a good thing, but I think companies like OpenAI still have a lot to reckon with—and a long way to go.\n\nOpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro will all roll out today, Thursday, Dec. 11, to paid plans. Developers can access the new models in the API today, as well.\n\nDisclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "title": "Google Will Now Let You Virtually Try on Clothes With Just a Selfie",
    "description": "Is this useful, or creepy?",
    "fullText": "The pace of AI technology is so rapid, it's tough to keep up with everything. At Google I/O back in May, Google rolled out an AI-powered shopping feature that let you virtually try on clothes you find online. All you needed to do was upload a full-length photo of yourself, and Google's AI would be to dress you up in whatever article of clothing you liked. I still can't decide whether the feature sounds useful, creepy, or a little bit of both.\n\nWhat I can say, however, is that the feature is getting a little creepier. On Thursday, Google announced an update to its virtual try on feature, that takes advantage of the company's new AI image model, Nano Banana. Now, you don't need a full-length photo of yourself: just a selfie. With solely a photo of your face, Nano Banana will generate a full-length avatar in your likeness, which you can use to virtually try on your clothes.\n\nI'm not exactly sure who this particular update is for: Maybe there are some of us out there who want to use this virtual try-on feature, but don't have a full-length photo of ourselves to share. Personally, I wouldn't really want to send Google my photo—selfie or otherwise—but I don't think I'd prefer to have Google infer what I look like from a photo of my face alone. I'd rather just send it the full photo, and give it something to actually work off of.\n\nHere's the other issue: While Google asks you to only upload images of yourself, it doesn't stop you if you upload an image of someone else. Talk about creepy: You can upload someone else's selfie and see how they look in various clothes. There is a system in place to stop you from uploading certain selfies, like celebrities, children, or otherwise \"unsafe\" items, but if the system fails, this feature could be used maliciously. I feel like Google could get around this by verifying the selfie against your Google Account, since you need to be signed in to use the feature anyway.\n\nIf you are interested in trying the feature out—and, subsequently, trying on virtual clothes with your AI-generated avatar—you can head over to Google's try on feature, sign into your Google Account, and upload your selfie. When it processes, you choose one of four avatars, each dressed in a different fit, to proceed. Once through, you can virtually try on any clothes you see in the feed.\n\nAgain, I see the potential usefulness of a feature that lets you see what you might look like in a certain piece of clothing before buying it. But, at the same time, I think I'd rather just order the item and try it on in the comfort (and privacy) of my own home.",

    "description": "The Buffalo Bills were Super Bowl favourites but must win at the in-form New England Patriots to have a chance of stopping their divisional rivals winning the AFC East.",
    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:45 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Detroit Lions v Los Angeles Rams on Sunday (from 21:00).\n\nThere are four weeks left in the NFL's regular season and I feel like every year we're saying this, but I don't think the league's ever been this contested.\n\nThere's been so many games where you cannot blink or take anything for granted. Some play-off spots won't be decided until week 18, so for so many teams, that final game will be incredibly meaningful.\n\nThe AFC East title could go down to the wire, but the Buffalo Bills will need to stop the New England Patriots' 10-game win streak when the divisional rivals meet at Foxborough this Sunday.\n\nThe Bills improved their record to 9-4 with a 39-34 win over the Bengals last Sunday, and it was just Josh Allen doing Josh Allen things again, especially in that fourth quarter. He just puts on his cape and make things happen. That's what makes the Bills so dangerous. He was last season's Most Valuable Player and he's a guy who can change the game and rally the troops around him.\n\nBuffalo had a rough spell but have won their past two. At this time of year, you've been able to have a true self-scout, so things are coming together for them, and last Sunday's win was huge. The Bills were on the edge of the AFC play-off rankings and now they've solidified themselves. If they win at the Patriots, who are 11-2, the Bills will be just one win back with three games left.\n\nNew England's schedule looks easier than Buffalo's though. The Patriots finish with Baltimore, the Jets and the Dolphins. The Bills go against the Browns, the Eagles and the Jets.\n\nThere's a high probability Buffalo won't win the AFC East for the first time in six years, and few expected New England to win the division after back-to-back four-win seasons.\n\nIn the past, there was an expectation with the Patriots because they had greatness. They had Tom Brady and had been winning for so long. Now there's straight excitement about current quarterback Drake Maye and what this team can do. They could clinch the AFC East on Sunday, which is huge for them.\n\nSometimes it's better when you're that team with no expectations, but the Patriots have Mike Vrabel as head coach. He won three Super Bowls with them as a player and he's brought in the right people. Josh McDaniels won six Super Bowls on the Patriots' coaching staff but wasn't successful as head coach of the Raiders. Vrabel pairing him as offensive coordinator with Maye has been so good though. McDaniels understands what it takes to win in the AFC East, to win in the cold and how to attack those teams.\n\nNew England had one of the easiest schedules this season, but you still have to win those games. Vrabel's been using the word 'champions' and I think all the guys are starting to believe in that championship mentality. I love how he also says 'no naps', like, you can't sleep on anybody and you've got to keep doing the right things. I think he's a great leader who's learned how to inspire from being in this situation as a player.\n\nThe Patriots were the ones that broke the Bills' undefeated start in week five and when you do that on the road, your team's going to walk away and think 'alright, we actually might have something here'. Then all these wins they've had is building more and more confidence.\n\nThe Patriots aren't outstanding in any one category, offensively or defensively, but Maye has been brilliant, especially as a second-year quarterback. He can run the ball and be a big threat with his legs, and his decision making has gotten so much better. He gets to the top of his drop and he's already kind of made his decision on where he wants to throw the ball, because he's reading the field so quickly.\n\nMaye's got the NFL's best pass completion percentage, only Matthew Stafford has a higher passer rating, and only Dak Prescott has more pass yards. Maye's thrown 23 touchdown passes versus six interceptions. In every game, he's had 200+ pass yards and that goes to show that, for the most part, he's made the right decisions. He's protecting the football, and he's using different weapons to throw to.\n\nEarly in the season, Stefon Diggs was pretty much the star of the show. That gave Maye confidence and now he's using a slew of different receivers. They were kind of identifying their roles and now they're elevating each other. Maye has also been doing it without Will Campbell on the offensive line the past few weeks.\n\nHe is very much in the MVP conversation, but Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has just been phenomenal. It's his 17th year in the league and this is probably his best season. He leads the league with 35 touchdowns, with just four interceptions.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Maye does this week against Buffalo and then Baltimore. There's the irony of playing the past two MVPs - Allen and Lamar Jackson - and some people might say that could determine whether Maye becomes this season's MVP.\n\nAllen's still breaking records and it's hard to watch that game on Sunday and not think 'wow, this guy is so different'. I mean, which other quarterback has a 40-yard touchdown run in the snow? But I don't know if they'd give him a back-to-back MVP. Last year made sense because of how he took care of the ball but this year he hasn't been as perfect.\n\nBuffalo have a rivalry with the Patriots and, after losing to them in October, I think the Bills understand the importance of Sunday's game and what it can mean to go into Foxborough and get the win. But this is going to be a challenge for their defence, for sure.\n\nWith the different offensive weapons the Patriots have through the air, I think the Bills' defence has to step up and force turnovers. You know it's going to be a Stefon Diggs game when his former team Buffalo is involved, so I think that Maye-Diggs connection is where the outcome lies.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

We are trying to coach the players. The players are really honest.\n\n\"The reality is we are aware of it and I think sometimes you can be really exposed - and that's what has happened tonight.\"\n\nIn Taylor's defence, his early tenure on Merseyside has been disrupted by injuries to key players.\n\nPlaymaker Marie Hobinger and striker Sophie Roman Haug both suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, while experienced players such as Ceri Holland and Gemma Bonner have also had spells on the sidelines.",

The consequences of a third defeat in a row, in Sunday's League Cup final against St Mirren, does not bear thinking about.\n\n\"It's not his fault that he doesn't understand,\" Hart, who left Celtic in summer 2024 after three seasons at the club, said on TNT Sports. \"I didn't walk in and just understand what it was to be Celtic.

The ability and will to improve has been excellent - but you want immediate returns.\n\n\"For the way we can go into the market for our players, it's tough. We don't have endless resources so we are trying to find players in markets where others aren't necessarily looking.\"\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen made his loan permanent for £23m after scoring 14 times last season, but the Norway striker has netted just once in the league this term.\n\nExecutive chairman Jeff Shi added: \"Maybe we sold too many players in one window. You can see the squad and compare it to last season, maybe we changed 40 or 50% of the key players.\n\n\"It's a task to rebuild a team but the Premier League is very tough. If you can't control the tempo and need a longer time to rebuild the team the games will punish you.\"",

As part of the State of Play for First Light, Gibson was officially confirmed while five other cast members were revealed.\n\nOne role that is currently unrevealed is the game's nemesis, 009. This former MI6 agent is being hunted by Bond and his allies, but the extent of 009's ambitions are unclear.\n\nIO Interactive was more forthcoming about other aspects of the game, which we included in our recap of everything we learned about 007: First Light. The publisher also unveiled multiple editions of the game, which you can find in our First Light preorder guide.\n\n007 First Light will hit PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S on March 27, 2026. You can find all of the currently announced cast members below.\n\nPatrick Gibson is making his video game debut as the voice and likeness of James Bond in 007 First Light. In the absence of a 007 actor on the big screen, he's the incumbent Bond for the moment.\n\nGibson recently had one of his biggest roles to date as young Dexter Morgan in Dexter: Original Sin. Prior to that, he had leading roles on Netflix's Shadow and Bone and The OA. One of Gibson's earliest acting credits was in Showtime's The Tudors. On the big screen, Gibson has appeared in a handful of movies including the 2019 J.R.R. Tolkien biopic, Tolkien.\n\nPriyanga Burford had a small role in the last Bond movie as a MI6 scientist in No Time To Die. She has a considerably bigger part as M in 007 First Light.\n\nBurford's credits are primarily in television, and she had leading and supporting roles in Steeltown Murders, Before We Die, Avenue 5, Industry, Housebound, and Press.\n\nThe Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead fans will surely recognize Lennie James, who portrayed Morgan Jones across both series. In First Light, James will play Bond's mentor, John Greenway.\n\nJames has also lent his voice to the Destiny games, where he portrayed Lord Shaxx. The English actor has a long list of credits across TV and film, including Blade Runner 2049, Human Target, Invincible, Archer, Jericho, and Mufasa: The Lion King.\n\nKiera Lester is a relative newcomer to the entertainment industry, with only a handful of television credits to her name. She has appeared in Sister Boniface Mysteries, Wreck, Ruby Speaking, Grace, and Death in Paradise.\n\nLester's role as Miss Moneypenny in 007 First Light will be one of her most prominent parts to date.\n\nVeteran actor Alastair Mackenzie will voice Q, the man who creates all of Bond's incredible gadgets. We don't know yet how Mackenzie's take on the character will differ from his on-screen predecessors. But unlike the last Q, Ben Whishaw, Mackenzie is considerably older than the actor playing Bond.\n\nAndor fans may recognize Mackenzie from his role as Perrin Fertha, the husband on Mon Mothma. Some of his other credits include The Crown, Dracula, Unforgotten, Outlaw King, and Backdraft 2.\n\nWho is Miss Roth? She appears to be the femme fatale Bond girl in 007 First Light. Noemie Nakai will lend her voice and likeness to Miss Roth in the game.\n\nNakai's most prominent TV role was in HBO Max's Tokyo Vice, and her other credits include Army of Thieves, Never Let Me Go, The Emperor's Cook, and Death Note: New Generation.\n\nBritish actress Gemma Chan--known for her roles in Transformers: The Last Knight, Crazy Rich Asians, and Captain Marvel--will appear in First Light as the character Selina Tan.\n\nShe's described as a \"brilliant and passionate academic with a background in psychology and game theory.\" The character, who works at MI6, played a \"critical role\" in helping James Bond earn his 00 status.\n\nThis is not Chan's first video game role, as she also portrayed Erys in Diablo IV. Chan lent her voice and likeness to 007 First Light.\n\nMusician and actor Lenny Kravitz will play the villain Bawma.",

And honestly, it might just be the perfect meme to encapsulate this whole year.\nDigital Extremes' community director Megan Everett and creative director Rebecca Ford took to the stage to talk about the free-to-play shooter-RPG Warframe.

Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today.
