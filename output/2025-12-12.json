Now they need some stops.\n\nThe third quarter is under way!\n\nWell, as we noted earlier, this is a bit surprising. Not necessarily that Gainesville would leading, but 24-0, is a way bigger margin than expected tonight. It's still within reach, but Rome has to figure out something offense really quick.\n\nGainesville tacks on a field goal. Rome has to come up with an answer quick. It's possible they're already in a hole too deep to climb out of, but if they're going to have a chance, they can't let this get any worse.\n\nIt's all Gainesville so far in Rome.

It was also the Raiders’ 35th consecutive playoff victory during Roger Harriett’s tenure as head coach.\n\nOn the flip side for Lakeland, its the second straight state championship loss after the Dreadnaughts won two in a row in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWhat was certain, however, was Lakeland and St. Thomas Aquinas Part II was much more competitive than the 2024 edition as the latter dominated the contest from start to finish. The redux was a lot closer as the Raiders were only able to muster up three DiSalvatore field goals in the first half.\n\nA reason Lakeland was able to remain in the contest was the play of quarterback Keelin Hendrix, who was making plays with his arm and legs all throughout the evening. Hendrix finished the night totaling 226 all-purpose yards.\n\nThe mtachup the last two seasons between the two perennial powers hasn’t been all too close, with St. Thomas Aquinas edging Lakeland by a combined 63-0 score.\n\nFor Florida high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Mammoth center Logan Cooley is expected to miss a minimum of eight weeks with what the team is calling a lower-body injury.\n\nGeneral manager Bill Armstrong announced Cooley’s timeline Thursday.\n\nCooley, 21, was injured Dec. 5 in Vancouver when he slid into the net, with his left leg crashing into the right post. Being out eight weeks would take him to the Olympic break in early February and could put him in line to return when the season resumes later in the month.\n\nStill the Mammoth’s leading goal scorer with 14, Cooley was one of the biggest reasons they got off to a strong start to the season and were in a playoff spot the night he got hurt. Utah has lost all three games since Cooley was sidelined.\n\nThe long-term injury also all but certainly ends Cooley’s already long-shot chances of being picked for the U.S. roster to take part in the Games in Milan.\n\nTaken with the third pick in the 2022 draft when the club was the Arizona Coyotes before moving to Salt Lake City, Cooley is one of the NHL’s rising stars and in late October signed an eight-year extension worth $80 million. The Pittsburgh native has 23 points in 29 games this season.",

At 6:52 of the period, Horvat became tangled with Ducks defenseman Drew Helleson. The 30-year-old's left foot twisted as he fell to the ice. He had trouble putting weight on his foot as he went directly to the locker room and never returned to the Islanders bench.\n\nHead coach Patrick Roy did not have an update on Horvat's condition after the game, but said he will be day-to-day.\n\nEntering Thursday's action, Horvat had a team-high 19 goals and 31 points. He had not missed a game this season and played in all 81 games the past two seasons with the Islanders.\n\nSince he was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks in the 2022-23 season, Horvat has been solid. In his first full season on the island, Horvat scored 33 goals (68 points) and followed up with a 28-goal year (57 points). He was on pace to blow past those numbers this year.\n\nBo Horvat will not return to tonight's game with a lower body injury.\n\nHere is the play where Horvat gets injured. #Isles \n\n(🎥: @RTaub_ / @IslesMSGN) https://t.co/giLXHosQ7i pic.twitter.com/olHPhG4isc\n\n— Isles Rumor (@IslesRumor) December 12, 2025",

    "title": "Hart sits in return to Philly",
    "description": "Carter Hart was a spectator as the Golden Knights went with Akira Schmid against the Flyers.",
    "fullText": "Thursday, the former Philadelphia Flyers goaltender returned to the scene of where he played for six NHL seasons before his career took a legal hiatus nearly two years ago. But his participation was limited to pregame warmups and a seat on the visitors’ bench wearing a baseball cap.\n\nNo welcome back acknowledgment. No video tribute from the Flyers. It was as persona non grata as it gets.  \n\nHe wasn’t needed as once again the Vegas Golden Knights found themselves in an overtime game and they leaned on two of their best players — Mark Stone and Jack Eichel — to get them over the top as Eichel forced a turnover, found Stone alone in front and the captain beat Dan Vladar 2:47 into OT for a 3-2 victory at Xfinity Mobile Arena.\n\n“I think we’re comfortable playing in close games,” said Stone, who scored a second-period power-play goal as well to give his team a 2-1 lead at the time. “We’ve played a lot of these this year so out’s nice that we’re winning more of them.”\n\nAs for Hart, by now, you know all the sordid details that resulted to his suspension. The 27-year-old goaltender is back in the NHL, has played three games with the Knights and he’ll likely make his next start in the relative obscurity of Columbus come Saturday.\n\nThursday was a different story. ESPN was there. So was a gaggle of Philly puck media wanting to take Hart’s temperature about his return, to ask him what he expected the reaction from the fans would be for him, about facing his former team and the usual assortment of queries a former player would be expected to receive upon his return.\n\nFrom Hart, nothing but silence on this day. The team didn’t make him available after the morning skate. Coach Bruce Cassidy said it was a decision by the coaching staff to not play Hart Thursday, adding that Hart “wants to play every game.”\n\nWell, he didn’t play this one. Akira Schmid did. And in all honesty, he probably needed to having last played six days ago in Newark where he shut out his former team, the Devils, 3-0 to start this five-game road swing through the Metropolitan Division.\n\nThe reality is the two points up for grabs Thursday was bigger than one person’s return to his former city. The Knights are still pursuing first-place Anaheim and when you look at the nine points they’ve squandered this year in losing in either overtime or a shootout, they’re in a desperate chase to make up those nine points. So that’s where Cassidy’s focus was — win the game.\n\n“We’re a good team; It wasn’t going to continue that way,” Cassidy said of the team’s OT struggles earlier this year. “Today, we forced a turnover and we make a play. Eventually it was going to turn our way.”\n\nHis decision to go with Schmid paid off. He only faced 19 shots while allowing two to get by him. But he was strong, particularly when the Knights were on the penalty kill. Vegas took three offensive zone penalties Thursday but the Flyers were unable to cash in.\n\n“He’s been playing well and he gives us a chance every night,” Cassidy said of Schmid, who picked up his 11th win of the season.\n\nThe Knights also received some offense from defenseman Zach Whitecloud, who scored his first of the year while showing some Eichel-like moves in beating Vladar in the first period, faking with his forehand, then going to his backhand for the goal.\n\n“I thought it was Jack who scored,” Cassidy said. “Then I saw the bubble and I knew it was Whitey.”\n\nWhitecloud has been wearing a full face shield after taking a puck to the face a couple of weeks ago. It obviously didn’t inhibit his vision when it came to handling the puck and finishing off a play.\n\n“It’s exciting and fun,” Whitecloud said of his being able to contribute offensively. “It’s not my job to score goals, especially that way. But anytime you can get into the offensive zone and get in the rush and get involved, it’s something I’ve prided myself on since I’ve been in this organization, and that’s to be a two-way guy.”\n\nThe Knights, who have scored first in each of the four games on the five-game trip and have picked up seven of a possible eight points so far, will try and finish it off the right way Saturday against the Blue Jackets.\n\n“I think we’ve done a good job of rolling four lines and six D and wearing teams down,” Stone said. “Our special teams have been really good. We scored on the power play, we had a big (penalty) kill late (Thursday).\n\n“It’s been a good trip already but we have a chance to make it a great one. Nine out of 10 points would be a hell of a trip.”",

    "description": "- - -INVICTA GAMES, LTD.\nPackaging Team — Official Minutes \nProject: Mastermind / New Cover Presentation\nMARTIN SMITH (Marketing Senior Vice Presi...",
    "fullText": "MARTIN SMITH (Marketing Senior Vice President): Okay. Gary’s got a new cover comp. Gary, walk us through your vision.\n\nGARY LARKIN (Design Lead): Right. Here it is. Black void. Two adults. No board. No pegs.\n\nPAM REYNOLDS (Product Development): Where are the children?\n\nLARKIN: Exactly. Also, who cares?\n\nREYNOLDS: You know this game is eight-plus, right?\n\nLARKIN: If you put a kid on the cover, you’re telling buyers it’s a kid game. If you put adults on the cover, you’re telling kids it’s a gateway to adulthood. This is basic aspirational psychology. They’ll feel like tiny professors. Or tiny villains. Both sell.\n\nSHEILA GRANT (Sales Director): Why no kitchen table?\n\nLARKIN: Because kitchen tables are for fucking Candyland. We’re selling a political mode of thinking: deduction as power. Think less “family night,” and more “I will find the hidden structure of your choices, and then I will destroy you.”\n\nREYNOLDS: Talk to me about the man. He looks… a little smug?\n\nLARKIN: Yes. Smug is the emotional tone of Mastermind. I want the buyer to feel judged by the box. Like the box is already disappointed in them. If you don’t want smug, don’t name the game Mastermind. This isn’t fucking checkers. This is a duel in a seminar room at Davos.\n\nSMITH: Yes! “Smug” can be our brand essence. The product is a controlled experiment in superiority.\n\nLARKIN: She’s the counterforce. Wittgenstein’s ghost at a cocktail party. Quiet, precise, dangerous because she doesn’t need to explain herself. She’s the one who knows the rules and knows when to break them.\n\nREYNOLDS: She also looks like she’s here to ruin his career.\n\nLARKIN: Sure. That’s part of it. Mastermind is adversarial epistemology. Two people testing the limits of what can be known. Plus, maybe they’re fucking?\n\nREYNOLDS: Do we want sexual tension on a board game cover for eight-year-olds?\n\nSMITH: We want adult tension. The tension of brains. If anyone sees sex, that’s on them. We’re not responsible for the public’s imagination. We’re responsible for moving units in Woolworths. Gary, I see what you’re going for… a Cold War posture: mutually assured… embarrassment? You probe, they conceal, you infer, they flinch. Gorgeous.\n\nREYNOLDS: Jesus. All that from colored pegs and a plastic tray?\n\nGRANT: Okay, but where’s the warmth? The fun? Where’s the invitation?\n\nLARKIN: Warmth is for Sorry! This is not a hug. This is a chess clock in a stranger’s living room telling you your parents are getting divorced. The invitation is “Are you smart enough to sit at this table?”\n\nREYNOLDS: I’m still hung up on the no kids thing. Aren’t we basically telling children they’re not the audience?\n\nSMITH: No, we’re telling them they’re not the current audience. But they could be…\n\nREYNOLDS: Fine. But can we at least flag the age range on the front so parents don’t think we’re selling them a goddamn espionage novel?\n\nSMITH: Yes. Small type. Discreet. Like a classified stamp.\n\nGRANT: Could we put a badge on it? Something like “Awarded Game of the Year.”\n\nSMITH: Yes. We need medals. We need royal crests. We need to reassure the buyer that they are purchasing status. I want the box to feel like it won a war.\n\nLARKIN: Also, note the diagonal yellow banner in the corner that says “Improved.” People love improvement—even if they don’t know what was wrong before. “Improved” says we were humble enough to evolve, but not humble enough to specify how.\n\nSMITH: Brilliant. “Improved” in a bold modern font. It’s like saying “Now with more mind.”\n\nREYNOLDS: The board isn’t in the photo.\n\nLARKIN: The board is implied. If you show the board, you limit the imagination. If you don’t show the board, anyone could be playing Mastermind at any time. In a limo. In a bunker. On a yacht while plotting the downfall of a minor principality.\n\nREYNOLDS: Or at my kitchen table? With my nephew?\n\nSMITH: Goddammit, Pam. Fuck the kitchen table. Get on board!\n\nGRANT: So the story is: Mastermind isn’t a board game, it’s a world view?\n\nLARKIN: Yes, a world view where inference leads to domination!\n\nSMITH: I want every eight-year-old to look at this and think, “Someday, I will destroy my father’s confidence with pure logic.”\n\nREYNOLDS: You guys are monsters.\n\nSMITH: We’re toy executives, Pam. Just toy executives.\n\nGRANT: All right. I’m sold. It’s smart, it’s sharp, it’s fucking terrifying. In other words, it’s finally Mastermind.\n\nLARKIN: So, we’re green-lighting this direction?\n\nSMITH: Yes. Let the box look like it could pass a doctoral defense and start a coup d’etat at the same time.",

    "fullText": "Would you trust a medical system measured by: which doctor would the average Internet user vote for?\n\nYet that malpractice is LMArena.\n\nThe AI community treats this popular online leaderboard as gospel. Researchers cite it. Companies optimize for it and set it as their North Star. But beneath the sheen of legitimacy lies a broken system that rewards superficiality over accuracy.\n\nIt's like going to the grocery store and buying tabloids, pretending they're scientific journals.\n\nHere's how LMArena is supposed to work: enter a prompt, evaluate two responses, and mark the best. What actually happens: random Internet users spend two seconds skimming, then click their favorite.\n\nThey're not reading carefully. They're not fact-checking, or even trying.\n\nThis creates a perverse reward structure. The easiest way to climb the leaderboard isn't to be smarter; it’s to hack human attention span. We’ve seen over and over again in the data, both from datasets that LMArena has released and the performance of models over time, that the easiest way to boost your ranking is by:\n\nIt doesn't matter if a model completely hallucinates. If it looks impressive – if it has the aesthetics of competence – LMSYS users will vote for it over a correct answer.\n\nWhen you optimize for engagement metrics, you get madness.\n\nEarlier this year, Meta tuned a version of Maverick to dominate the leaderboard. If you asked it “what time is it?”, you got:\n\nVoilà: bold text, emojis, and plenty of sycophancy – every trick in the LMArena playbook! – to avoid answering the question it was asked.\n\nIt wasn't just Maverick. We analyzed 500 votes from the leaderboard ourselves. We disagreed with 52% of them, and strongly disagreed with 39%.\n\nThe leaderboard optimizes for what feels right, not what is right. Here are two emblematic examples of LMArena users punishing factual accuracy:\n\nIn the world of LMArena, confidence beats accuracy and formatting beats facts.\n\nInstead of rigorous evaluators, we have people with the attention span of the average TikTok user determining which AI models shape the industry.\n\nWhy is LMArena so easy to game? The answer is structural.\n\nThe system is fully open to the Internet. LMArena is built on unpaid labor from uncontrolled volunteers. There's no incentive for those volunteers to be thoughtful. No quality control. No one gets kicked off for repeatedly failing to detect hallucinations.\n\nWhen LMArena’s leaders speak publicly, they talk about the various techniques they use to overcome the fact that their input data is low quality. They admit their workers prefer emojis and length over substance. So the LMArena system, they proudly tell us, includes a variety of corrective measures.\n\nThey're attempting alchemy: conjuring rigorous evaluation out of garbage inputs.\n\nBut you can't patch a broken foundation.\n\nWhen the entire industry optimizes for a metric that rewards “hallucination-plus-formatting” over accuracy, we get models optimized for hallucination-plus-formatting.\n\nThis isn't a minor calibration problem. It's fundamental misalignment between what we're measuring and what we want: models that are truthful, reliable, and safe.\n\nThe AI industry needs rigorous evaluation. We need leaders who prioritize accuracy over marketing. We need systems that can't be gamed by bolding more aggressively.\n\nLMArena is none of these things. And as long as we pretend it is, we're dragging the entire field backward.\n\nPeople often say they can’t avoid LMArena.\n\n\"We have to optimize for it. We have to sell our models. The leaderboard shows customers which model is best, and we have to play the game.\"\n\nBut the best products have principles they stick to.\n\nThis is the brutal choice every model builder must eventually make:\n\nThe choice is real. It’s hard. But we’ve seen some frontier labs hold the line.\n\nThey stuck to their values. They ignored the gamified rankings. And users loved their models anyway – because hype eventually dies and quality is the only metric that survives the cycle.\n\nYou are your objective function. Which path will each lab choose?",

The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages.",

But in the late 1500s and early 1600s, individual alchemists called the medicines they cooked up in their labs ‘secrets’. And thanks to a study published in Heritage Science, we now know a little bit more about the secrets of one alchemist in particular.\n\nIt turns out that Tycho Brahe, mostly known for his study of astronomy, had his own basement laboratory for mixing medicines—including some particular elements.\n\nBrahe’s famed observatory, located in his castle-like Uraniborg observatory on the island of Ven, in what is now Sweden, was dismantled following his death in 1601. But recently, a team of researchers from the University of Southern Denmark and National Museum of Denmark analyzed five shards rescued from what would have been the site’s old garden between 1988 and 1990. It’s believed those shards came from the basement alchemical laboratory.\n\nThe authors examined cross sections of the shards for 31 trace elements using mass spectrometry by converting sample molecules into charged ions. While there was plenty of the expected elements on the shards (four of which were glass and one of which was ceramic)—including nickel, copper, zin, tin, antimony, gold, mercury, and lead—there was one find that surprised the experts: tungsten.\n\n“Tungsten is very mysterious,” Kaare Lund Rasmussen, archaeometry expert at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a statement. “Tungsten had not even been described at that time, so what should we infer from its presence on a shard from Tycho Brahe’s alchemy workshop?”\n\nThat’s a question that doesn’t have a clear answer. Rasmussen said that while tungsten does occur naturally in certain minerals, and could have made its way into Brahe’s laboratory that way, there’s another plausible theory: Brahe had a secret substance to help create his medicines for Europe’s elite.\n\nNot classified as an element until the 1780s, tungsten likely first popped up in German chemistry as ‘Wolfram,’ and Brahe’s medicine were known to have German influence. “Maybe Tycho Brahe had heard about this and thus knew of tungsten’s existence,” Rasmussen speculated. “But this is not something we know or can say based on the analyses I have done. It is merely a possible theoretical explanation for why we find tungsten in the samples.”\n\n“Most intriguing are the elements found in higher concentrations than expected,” Rasmussen said, “indicating enrichment and providing insight into the substances used in Tycho Brahe’s alchemical laboratory.”\n\nThe business of creating medicines was a secret one. Brahe, like others of the day, didn’t share the makeup of prescriptions. Brahe was known for his plague medicine—a highly complicated remedy to create that could have had up to 60 ingredients, including everything from snake flesh and opium to copper, oils, and herbs. Could the resulting medicine have also included tungsten as part of the finished product?\n\n“It may seem strange that Tycho Brahe was involved in both astronomy and alchemy, but when one understands his worldview, it makes sense,” said Poul Grinder-Hansen, senior researcher and museum curator at the National Museum of Denmark, in a statement. “He believed that there were obvious connections between the heavenly bodies, early substances, and the body’s organs.”\n\nGold and mercury were often used by alchemists (including Brahe) in medicines, and it was common for alchemists to link the Earth’s elements to properties in space and the human body. And there's a whole list of those connections. Silver tied to the Moon and the brain, while gold was a link to the Sun and the heart. Jupiter and the liver were connected through tin, Venus and copper by the kidneys, Saturn and the spleen by lead, Mars and the gallbladder by iron, and Mercury and the lungs by (of course) mercury. In this thinking, gold was a common ingredient for medicines of the day, including ones Brahe took.\n\nWhere tungsten fits into the mix, however, isn’t clear. So far, it remains a secret.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "The 4% rule helps you establish a safe withdrawal rate.\n\nSuze Orman says not to follow the 4% rule because you may take out money when you don’t need it and not have money when you do.\n\nOther evidence also points to the fact following the 4% rule is a bad idea.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, there are some longstanding rules of thumb many people rely on. Unfortunately, finance expert Suze Orman has a warning about one of those rules. Orman has urged people to stop following the 4% rule, saying \"I would not be using the 4% figure on any level.\"\n\nSo, what is the 4% rule, why is Orman urging you to abandon it, and should you listen to her and stop using it as a crutch? Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe 4% rule is a simple rule designed to help people choose a safe withdrawal rate for their retirement funds. According to the rule, if you take 4% out of your retirement accounts when you first retire and then adjust that amount each year to account for inflation, your money should last at least 30 years. So, if you had a $1 million nest egg, you would take $40,000 out of your retirement plan in year one of retirement.\n\nThe rule was developed in 1994 by a financial advisor named William Bergen to help simplify the process of deciding how much money you could withdraw without risking draining your account too fast and going broke.\n\nOrman does not believe you should follow the 4% rule because she believes that this rule sets you up to take money out of an account when you may not need it, leaving you at risk if you do need it in the future.\n\n\"Maybe you were taking out 4% and 4% even though you didn't need it,\" she said. Then one day, you may need long-term care that's very expensive but you won't have enough in your retirement accounts to afford it because you took withdrawals out earlier just to follow the 4% rule, even if your spending needs were lower.\n\n\"The more you can not take out of a retirement account, the better off you are,\" Orman said.\n\nOrman is right that you should not simply follow the 4% rule, especially if you don't need the money. If you can live comfortably on 2% or 3% of your retirement nest egg, withdrawing more just because of a default rule would be a shortsighted choice as preserving your savings is usually better than spending.",

Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.\n\nIn both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.\n\nDespite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has a TV series in the works with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.\n\n“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”",

    "description": "Keeper, founded in 2022, raised $4 million in pre-seed funding. Here's the startup's current pitch deck.",
    "fullText": "Keeper, an AI matchmaking startup, thinks it can help deliver your \"soulmate\" to you. And if it can't, it'll let you know.\n\n\"We're saying we actually know who could be your soulmate or not,\" Jake Kozloski, Keeper's CEO, told Business Insider. \"We're not going to waste your time and pretend that a hundred thousand of these people could be. We'll tell you no.\"\n\nFounded in 2022, the dating platform uses layers of algorithms and AI models to match people who The startup is now disclosing for the first time, exclusively to Business Insider, that it raised a $4 million pre-seed investment in October 2024, led by Lightbank and Lakehouse Ventures. Goodwater Capital and Champion Hill Ventures participated in the round, among others.\n\nInvestors \"see AI as an inflection point in the dating app landscape\" and an opportunity to \"disrupt the incumbents,\" Kozloski said.\n\nKeeper isn't the only startup attempting to shake up the online dating market. Other AI matchmaking apps, such as Sitch and Amata, have raised millions to build next-generation dating apps. Dating app incumbents like Tinder and Bumble are also making plays with AI-powered experiences.\n\nKozloski said the company's values were another piece of its pitch that attracted some investors.\n\n\"They feel like there's a marriage crisis adjacent to the whole Elon Musk fertility crisis stuff that he talks about,\" said Kozloski, who described Keeper as being \"friendly with the pronatalist movement.\"\n\nWanting kids, though, isn't a requirement to use Keeper, Kozloski added.\n\nSince launching, Keeper has had more than 1.5 million sign-ups, and about 300,000 of those have made accounts, Kozloski said. Among that pool, there have been a \"small number\" of matches. Keeper didn't share exactly how many matches it's made, but according to its pitch deck, 10% of dates from its beta version resulted in marriage. With its funding, Keeper has been building out its matchmaking technology over the past year.\n\nKeeper is limited to heterosexual couples right now, and doesn't offer explicit options for different gender identities.\n\n\"We basically have to build a new algorithm for homosexual relationships, which we're happy to do and we will do eventually, but for now, we want to get to product market fit with our core product first,\" Kozloski said. \"Frankly, heterosexual relationships, especially for finding life partnership, seems to be a bigger market, a stronger market for us right now.\"\n\nMaking a profile on Keeper is a sit-down process. The initial form to make an account asks for the standard details of many dating apps (like your age or height), as well as academic test scores (including SATs), your career ambitions, salary, and net worth. It even encourages taking an external personality test. After you fill out the initial onboarding questionnaire, there are 13 more steps, ranging from uploading photos to sharing your philosophy on love.\n\n\"We don't let our users create their own profiles,\" Kozloski said. Keeper uses the information it gathers to curate a profile for you.\n\nKozloski said Keeper uses a non-AI algorithm first to streamline potential matches, focusing on data points like age range initially.\n\n\"We use LLMs once we have your top hundred that our other algorithms have identified,\" he said. \"The LLMs are trained on our matchmaking insights that we've learned so far, and so they can narrow down those last hundred and do the final pass of, 'OK, who actually is worth offering among these.'\"\n\nSome of the AI matchmaking comes into play when analyzing \"general attractiveness\" and users' specific attributes, like baldness or hair color, Kozloski said. The startup has also partnered with a team of researchers at Stanford, Kozloski said, who help train the LLMs (Keeper provides anonymized data to the research team).\n\nHowever, Keeper isn't fully automated, and for the time being, includes human matchmakers in the process. If there's a match, Keeper connects the two people over text message.\n\nThe startup has a complicated payment structure with a hefty price tag — but only for men.\n\nKeeper has male users sign a \"marriage bounty\" that typically costs $50,000 (if the user gets married) and has them pay $5,000 for any dates from the service (the date fees go toward the total bounty cost, Kozloski said).\n\nRead the most recent version of Keeper's pitch deck.\n\nNote: Keeper has shared an updated version of its pitch deck, which it is now sharing with investors, that includes new details since its raise in October 2024. Some details have been redacted.\n\nKeeper describes the matchmaking market as \"old school yet shockingly massive,\" per the slide.\n\n\"With the opportunity to 10x,\" the slide says. \"When technology provides perfect matches, matchmaking will be the best way to meet your partner.\"\n\n\"The AI matchmaker that will introduce you to your soulmate on the first match,\" the slides says. It also includes product imagery.\n\n\"Our v1 worked extremely well,\" the slide says.\n\nIt says that 10% of dates lead to marriage.\n\nIt says it has had 1.5 million sign-ups. \"This makes us the largest pool of any traditional matchmaker,\" the slides says. It lists competitors like Tawkify, Keeper, Ditto, Sitch, and Known Dating.\n\n\"Everyone signs up if we deliver soulmates on the first match,\" the slide says.\n\n\"The first mover quickly becomes a monopoly,\" it says.\n\nToban Wiebe: Co-Founder, Head of AI\n\nHere are the names of the researchers:\n\n\"We're raising to scale profitable human-in-the-loop matchmaking to $2M in annual revenue,\" the slide says.\n\n\"80% of young singles want to get married,\" the slide says. \"40% actually will.\" It cites data from Match Group and data scientist Allen Downey.\n\nDating apps are \"bad at creating relationships, worth billions,\" the slide says. \"Imagine the value of the first product that's great at it.\"\n\n\"Matchmakers can't scale,\" the slide says.\n\n\"LLMs and vision models enable scalable matchmaking for the first time in history,\" the slides says.\n\n\"We've built the most accurate process in the world,\" the slide says.\n\nHere are the steps the slide lays out:\n\n\"We earn more, faster, by aligning with users' incentives,\" the slide says.\n\nIts current model, which has humans involved in matchmaking, is free for women and costs men $5,000 per date. For male users, the marriage bounty costs $50,000, and the slide says that Keeper has contracted $14 million \"so far.\"\n\nKeeper outlines that in a future model, where the tech is fully automated, dates will cost $250, and the marriage bounty contract will cost $5,000.",

Her eldest son, Joe Anders, 21, wrote the screenplay.\n\nShe said that Anders had expressed concern that people may think the film, which he wrote on a screenwriting course, was picked up only because of his famous parents. But Winslet defended his talent.\"The film would've been made with or without me. The script is so, so good,\" she said.\n\nAnders' father is the acclaimed film director Sam Mendes, 60, who was married to Winslet for seven years until their split in 2010. Anders starred alongside his mom in the 2023 movie \"Lee,\" and also appeared in the Oscar-nominated war film \"1917,\" which was directed by his father.\n\nMia Threapleton, Winslet's 25-year-old daughter, is also a rising star. She had a starring role in Wes Anderson's latest film, \"The Phoenician Scheme,\" which was released in May. It comes after she played Winslet's daughter in the 2022 BAFTA award-winning TV drama \"I Am Ruth.\"\n\nThe youngest of Winslet's children, 12-year-old Bear Blaze Winslet, has yet to grace the silver screen, but has already expressed an interest.

    "description": "Ahead of her Eras Tour docuseries, Taylor Swift said that she values career longevity and admires artists who can \"keep a good thing going.\"",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift has been known to accept feedback from fans and critics, but there's one request she refuses to heed: \"Go away.\"\n\nAhead of the premiere of her Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Swift appeared on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" to discuss her recent achievements and milestones.\n\nWhen Colbert asked Swift who she could turn to for advice, she listed rock star Stevie Nicks and pop producer Max Martin as confidants.\n\n\"What I look up to the most in people is career longevity — career longevity, friendship longevity, longevity in their relationships, you know? How do you keep a good thing going?\" Swift said.\n\n\"I think there are certain corners of our society that really love that and look up to longevity,\" she continued. \"There are also corners that are like, 'Give someone else a turn! Can't you just go away so we can talk about how good you were?' And I'm like, 'I don't want to.'\"\n\nSwift has faced accusations of overexposure throughout her career, but particularly in the last few years. Her cross-continental, 149-show Eras Tour, which concluded in December 2024, garnered extensive media coverage and consistently went viral on social media. The New Yorker said Swift had achieved \"complete domination over popular culture.\"\n\nWhen Swift released \"The Tortured Poets Department\" halfway through the tour's two-year run, fans and critics alike called the album overlong and overindulgent. When it topped the Billboard 200 for 17 weeks, fans of other artists complained that Swift was sabotaging her fellow pop stars, including Billie Eilish and Charli XCX, by preventing their albums from reaching No. 1 on the chart.\n\nSwift's newest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" was met with similar reproach. In his review for The Atlantic, Spencer Kornhaber wrote, \"'Showgirl' is the sound of an overworked and overexposed entertainer reaching the mountaintop to find something worse than disappointment: burnout.\" Swift's prolificacy and sales tactics have been described as shameless and excessive.\n\nStill, Swift has refused to shrink away from the spotlight. The first two episodes of \"The End of an Era\" will be available to stream on Friday, along with an extended version of her Eras Tour concert movie, featuring a new segment with songs from \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" The remaining four episodes of the docuseries will be released in pairs over the next two weeks.\n\nDuring her interview with Colbert, Swift also joked that she prefers to think of herself as \"passionate\" and \"hyperactive,\" rather than a workaholic.\n\n\"When I take time off, it's always just like, I can't slow down the fact that I need to get up and do a lot of things today. But I can change what those things are,\" she said. \"I can figure out how to chill out, but I'm never gonna be a chill person.\"",

    "fullText": "MAGA Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump amid their high-profile divorce.\n\nThe Georgia Republican told CBS News that she is “starting to feel very sorry” for the 79-year-old, saying that his attacks on her reflect poorly on him.\n\nThe great schism began when Greene, 50, broke with him on the cost-of-living crisis, which Trump insists is a “hoax,” and the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nThe escalation saw Trump call her a “traitor,” and the one-time MAGA die-hard decided to quit Congress.\n\nDuring the CBS News interview, MTG said that Trump’s refusal to embrace the economic realities facing many Americans could cost the GOP its majority next year.\n\n“I do believe at this time that Republicans will lose the midterms, and I think that’s unfortunate,” Greene said. “I very much wanted to be part of a Republican majority in Congress that solved problems for the American people, that delivered what we promised to America.”\n\nGreene’s interview was released 24 hours after Trump sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Politico’s Dasha Burns on The Conversation podcast.\n\nAsked what he’d rate himself on the economy, Trump said, “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.” As the Daily Beast has previously reported, Americans have given a markedly different assessment.\n\nAnd so does Greene. Speaking on CBS News, she offered more advice to Trump. “The president needs to be aware that he’s a billionaire president of the United States,” she said.\n\n“You can’t gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable, and you can’t tell them that the economy is in A-plus-plus-plus. You just can’t do that, and I think it’s insulting to people’s intelligence,” she added, dropping two plusses from Trump’s grade.\n\nGreene made a similar prediction about the midterms when she announced on Nov. 21 that she intended to quit Congress in January 2026.\n\nIn a message shared on X, she said, in part, “I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.”",

    "description": "Rumblings of a $1.5 trillion valuation for SpaceX may be forcing investors to view currently public space companies as undervalued.",
    "fullText": "Talk of a colossal 2026 IPO from SpaceX is already having an impact on the market.\n\nInvestors have been asking for years if Elon Musk will ever allow SpaceX to start trading on public markets, and reports indicate next year could see its long-awaited debut at a $1.5 trillion valuation.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, Musk appeared to confirm talk of a SpaceX public offering, describing a reporter's explanation of an imminent IPO as \"accurate.\"\n\nThe fresh focus on the space industry has sparked fresh momentum for stocks in the sector. Since the SpaceX IPO chatter picked up in the last week, a handful of space companies have seen their shares soar.\n\nHere are the top-performing space stocks in the last five days:\n\n\"SpaceX's IPO acts as a 'sector validator,' proving privates can command valuations despite thin profits, encouraging investors to focus on less well known public space stocks, like Redwire and Firefly Aero, for early exposure to a projected $1 trillion space economy by 2040,\" Tony Bancroft, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds told Business Insider.\n\nPure hype may not be the only reason that these space stocks are surging, though. According to Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, the prospect of SpaceX going public at a trillion dollar valuation is likely shifting the ways in which investors view smaller companies.\n\n\"When the anchor of the entire ecosystem is valued that highly, then companies like Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile suddenly screen as structurally undervalued because they participate in the same demand cycle SpaceX is proving out,\" he noted.\n\nBoloor added that SpaceX's lofty valuation means that investors will have to start looking at the industry not as a high-risk emerging market, but as critical infrastructure that will be crucial to the US's future in multiple areas.\n\nThe consensus among finance pros seems to be that the space investing landscape has already started shifting, making small-cap space stocks an appealing play.\n\n\"If anything, the biggest impact of a SpaceX IPO is psychological,\" stated Drew Wandzilak, a principal at Alumni Ventures. \"It tells the market that this ecosystem is entering its growth phase. That is encouraging for investors like us and even more encouraging for the founders who are building the next layer of the space economy.\"",

Read more here.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut of a quarter percentage point lowered the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75% in mid-December.\n\nThis move continues to spark optimism among market participants, as valuations of most risk assets are directly tied to the risk-free rate, at least when it comes to modeling out a company's discounted future cash flows. Bond yields have also come down considerably in recent months (lower yields mean higher prices), so investors are winning across the board.\n\nBut the thing is, millions of Americans unfortunately don't participate in this market. And for those who are retired, Social Security payments are the key lifeline that puts food on the table.\n\nAccordingly, the Social Security Administration's (SSA) cost of living adjustment (COLA) each year in October is a big event that millions focus intently on. There's good reason for this, as this COLA will dictate how much a given senior's monthly check will increase for the coming year.\n\nMost seniors may already be aware that this cost of living adjustment is tied to inflation, but let's dive into whether there's any correlation to how this cut may affect next year's COLA (2027).\n\nAs many investors may be aware, the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) put forward by the Social Security Administration is aimed at helping seniors navigate rising prices across the economy. There are many factors that measure this rise, but the consumer price index (CPI) is the key factor that plays into how the SSA determines what the cost of living increase will be for an upcoming year.\n\nThe connection between the cost of living adjustment (COLA) and the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts since 2025 centers around inflation management and economic stabilization.\n\nSimply put, lower interest rates could indicate a stabilizing economy, though recent data shows inflation has been somewhat stubborn. Given that COLA adjustments are typically tied to inflation rates, investors can assess via longer-duration bond yields where inflation may come in at over the coming year or two.",

    "description": "OpenAI says its latest model, GPT 5.2, was shown to outperform industry professionals in specific tasks across 44 different occupations.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI released its anticipated update to GPT-5 on Thursday, boasting that the new AI is \"the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work.\"\n\n\"We designed GPT‑5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people; it's better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step project,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIn a benchmark test called GDPval, OpenAI said its new AI model can outperform \"industry professionals at well-specified knowledge work tasks spanning 44 occupations.\"\n\n\"GPT‑5.2 Thinking produced outputs for GDPval tasks at >11x the speed and <1% the cost of expert professionals, suggesting that when paired with human oversight, GPT‑5.2 can help with professional work,\" the company said.\n\nAnd in a note that is sure to catch the attention of bankers, OpenAI wrote that in an internal benchmark of junior investment banking analyst spreadsheet modeling tasks — \"such as putting together a three-statement model for a Fortune 500 company with proper formatting and citations, or building a leveraged buyout model for a take-private\" — the new model's score per task was \"9.3% higher than GPT‑5.1's, rising from 59.1% to 68.4%\" on average.\n\nOpenAI said that GPT-5.2 will begin rolling out today for paid ChatGPT plans. Paid users will have access to GPT-5.1 for three months under legacy models before it is sunsetted.\n\n\"We deploy GPT‑5.2 gradually to keep ChatGPT as smooth and reliable as we can,\" the company said.\n\nThe company also touted its gains in agentic coding ability.\n\n\"Even without the ability to do new things like output polished files, GPT-5.2 feels like the biggest upgrade we've had in a long time. Curious to hear what you think!\" OpenAI CEO Altman wrote on X.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo said more changes will be coming next year once OpenAI rolls out age verification across ChatGPT. She said an \"adult mode\" for the chatbot will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThe release comes just over a week after Altman declared a \"code red\" in a private message to employees, marshaling more resources to ChatGPT amid increasing competition from Google and other companies.\n\n\"Code reds are not uncommon,\" Somo said during an interview on TBPN, adding that the hosts could \"be the judge\" of the results of Altman's declaration. She said she was \"pretty proud of\" GPT-5.2's advances, even though its development pre-dated the \"code red.\"\n\nGoogle has been considered by many in tech to be gaining, if not surpassing, OpenAI in the AI race with its recent release of Gemini 3.\n\nThe announcement also occurred hours after OpenAI brokered a major deal with Disney, which secured a $1 billion investment and access to the media giant's lucrative and popular IP.\n\n\"It has been a very cool last 10 years; OpenAI has been more special to work on than I could have possibly imagined,\" Altman wrote on X on Thursday.",

    "description": "Joni Ernst and Ed Markey are split over extending deadlines to pursue fraud in restaurant relief and the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant programs.",
    "fullText": "The top Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee said Democrats are blocking a measure to give federal prosecutors more time to investigate bailouts for restaurants and the live-entertainment industry.\n\nSenator Joni Ernst said Senator Ed Markey is holding up her bill that would give investigators until at least 2031 to file charges for defrauding the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund or the $14.5 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program.\n\n\"We are not getting a lot of cooperation coming from our Ranking Member, Markey, and the Senate Democrats,\" Ernst told Business Insider. \"I'm not very optimistic that it's going to happen, and it's very, very frustrating.\"\n\nMarkey's office declined to respond to a request for comment.\n\nLess than two weeks remain for the Senate to pass the legislation, which would enable the bill to move to the president's desk and possibly be signed into law.\n\nIt's not clear whether Ernst has formally sought unanimous consent to pass the statute-of-limitations extender bill because the process can take place informally, off the Senate floor. It's possible the measure could be passed next year, though the deadline to prosecute some SVOG fraud cases could lapse as soon as April 8.\n\nBusiness Insider documented how over $200 million from the SVOG program went to celebrities who used taxpayer money for private jets, lavish parties, luxury clothes, and other questionable spending.\n\nInvestigators haven't accused any of those recipients of wrongdoing, and most of the grants discussed in BI's stories were closed out by the Small Business Administration.\n\nMike Galdo, a former prosecutor who focused on pandemic fraud, said the bill could give agents, analysts, and prosecutors more time to build cases.\n\n\"Given some of the ambiguity in the language in the SVOG statute and regulations, as well as enforcement priorities other than fraud taking center stage for this Administration, it is unclear how many additional SVOG-related enforcement matters will be brought,\" he said in an email.\n\nErnst said Democrats preferred to \"rant and rail\" against President Donald Trump. At a committee hearing for SBA matters on December 10, Markey accused Republicans of waging \"an all-out assault\" on an SBA program that sets aside billions of dollars in federal contracts for small businesses owned by women and racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nA similar bill to extend the statute of limitations for the SVOG program and the restaurant fund has already passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support.\n\nBoth Ernst and Markey have pointed fingers across the aisle for delaying their legislative priorities. Ernst yesterday sought unanimous consent to pass a bill that would have clawed back more than $65 billion in unspent COVID relief funds, a measure that was blocked by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. And Markey blamed Republicans for blocking a one-year extension of two programs that dole out billions in grants to tech-oriented small businesses.\n\nRepresentative Gil Cisneros, a Democratic congressman from California, said earlier this month that the SBA's inspector-general has 31 open Restaurant Revitalization Fund cases and six open Shuttered Venue Operators Grant cases.\n\nA spokesman for the SBA's inspector-general's office didn't respond to a request for comment about those numbers.\n\nThe two programs cut checks of up to $10 million meant to support businesses that had been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, as waves of the deadly virus and government stay-at-home orders led businesses dependent on in-person gatherings to struggle.\n\nGovernment auditors faulted the SBA over its internal controls, and the combined total of fraud and waste in those and other pandemic programs may exceed $400 billion. Prosecutions have barely scratched the surface compared to the scale of the suspected fraud, but some misspent money could also be recovered through administrative actions or civil lawsuits.",

    "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle slam Big Tech's safety failures in reaction to Australia's social media ban for children under 16.",
    "fullText": "Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, have released a powerful statement via their Archewell Foundation regarding the world’s first law implemented in Australia that bans social media for children under the age of 16. The couple, who have focused their philanthropic work on online safety and mental wellness, lauded the nation's leadership while cautioning that the measure does not fix the root cause of the crisis.\n\nThe legislation took effect on December 10, targeting platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Snapchat, and imposing potential fines of up to AUD$50 million ($49.5 million USD) on companies that fail to keep young users off their services.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess summed up their complex reaction with a strong statement: \"It shouldn't have come to this.\" They expanded on their praise, celebrating the urgency of the intervention against addiction and exploitation. “We celebrate Australia’s leadership for seeing and acting on how these technology companies are negatively impacting young people with little to no recourse or accountability, and feeble efforts from the companies to stem the flow of harms,” the statement reads.\n\nHarry and Meghan emphasized that the bold move sends a necessary signal to Silicon Valley. They view the ban as vital for protecting children at a critical developmental stage. “This bold, decisive action to protect children at a critical moment in their development sends a strong signal that a child’s mind is not a commodity to be exploited. It buys young people valuable time back in their childhoods, but it doesn’t fix the fundamental issue we all still face with social media platforms.”\n\nThe couple pointed to the devastating human cost that necessitated the government’s action. “We’ve heard from too many grieving parents. Too many families devastated by cyberbullying, feeds that radicalize kids toward self-harm, and algorithmic manipulation designed to maximize engagement at any cost.”\n\nThe statement also acknowledged the significant positive potential of social media, particularly for vulnerable youth, arguing that these platforms can be a “genuine lifeline” for LGBTQ+ young people and those suffering mental health crises. However, the omnipresent harms often overshadow the benefits.\n\nThe core of the couple's critique is that the ban is only a temporary solution. “Here’s the truth: the ban is an effective measure to stop imminent harm, but ultimately only works as a band aid that does not address tech’s broken design and exploitive business incentives, requiring us to protect young people in the first place.”\n\nThe statement concluded by calling for a \"reckoning,\" hoping this Australian ban will force tech leaders to take responsibility for platforms built with growth as their first principle, rather than safety. The message notes what the Sussexes deem to be an ethical failure: \"The companies ‘unintended consequences’ of a decade ago are now part of their money making strategy, and children have become their collateral.”\n\nNext: Prince Harry Called Oprah in a Panic to Handle Delicate ‘Problem’ at Home",

Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.\n\nTrump has been pressuring Indiana to redraw its Congressional map to eliminate any Democrats holding seats in the state. The deep red state had previously shot down the idea in its Senate, but has since revived the effort under threats from Trump. Trump previously pushed Texas to redraw it map to favor the GOP, which in turn led California to move to eliminate Republican seats.\n\n“If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country, they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats. Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.

    "title": "Menopause treatment is getting personal",
    "description": "Menopause care innovations include at-home hormone testing, virtual appointments, and new non-hormonal therapies for symptom relief.",
    "fullText": "For decades, menopause has been treated like a medical nuisance to be managed silently. Women, knowing it's taboo to talk about, have quietly dealt with symptoms like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, restless nights, brain fog, mood swings, and plummeting libido.\n\n\"We've had a two-sided problem that is being unraveled: patients who have been left to suffer and providers who have been left without education,\" Jessica Nazzaro, a board-certified OBGYN, certified menopause practitioner, and a medical advisor for at-home hormone tracking company Mira, told Business Insider. Patients now \"know they are not alone, not crazy, and can find help.\"\n\nToday, many can test their hormone levels at home, talk to menopause specialists online, and get personalized prescriptions shipped directly to their doors.\n\nThis shift marks a reimagining of how women navigate their midlife years. Once dismissed as an inevitable decline, menopause is now treated as another phase of health — one that can be supported, studied, and optimized.\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) — which restores a patient's levels of estrogen, progesterone, or both to relieve menopause symptoms — was once the only solution women could turn to for things like night sweats, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness.\n\nThen came the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study in 2002, a long-term national study on preventing breast and colorectal cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, which found that HRT could increase cancer risk.\n\nPrescriptions plummeted, and stigma spiked.\n\nIn the years after, a group of doctors and researchers revisited the study and found it to be flawed because of its narrow scope. The WHI, which looked at disease risk in postmenopausal women, did not include vaginal estrogen, for example.\n\nExperts now tend to advocate for personalized treatment plans and say that cancer risk depends on the type of hormones used and the duration of treatment.\n\n\"We've learned that HRT is indeed protective of heart health, brain health, and bone health. It does not cause breast cancer, as was publicized by the WHI, but rather can proliferate an estrogen-sensitive tumor in the breast or other tissue,\" Nazzaro said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kathleen Green, an OB-GYN at Maven Clinic, \"More recent studies show that for most women, the benefits of HRT far outweigh the risks.\"\n\nStarting hormone therapy closer to the onset of menopause — typically before age 60 or within 10 years of entering menopause — can help alleviate symptoms and improve bone health.\n\nThe biggest change? Personalization. Doctors now consider a woman's age, symptoms, medical history, and time since menopause to determine the best form and dose of HRT — whether it's a pill, patch, gel, vaginal cream, or ring.\n\nAs more women demand better care, tech companies are offering to meet them where they are. At-home hormone testing tools like Mira and Proov can track users' hormone levels and turn them into personalized scores and cycle insights.\n\nAccording to Nazzaro, Mira's device tracks hormonal shifts with lab-level accuracy and \"helps women see patterns in their own cycles, understand which stage of menopause they're in, and make informed decisions about symptom management, lifestyle adjustments, or treatments.\"\n\nDr. Sophia Yen, the CEO and cofounder of Pandia Health, is a fan of Mira and told Business Insider that it's seamless to use — you simply collect your urine in a cup — and it provides \"lab-grade results,\" all from the comfort of your home.\n\nTelehealth companies such as Midi, Gennev, Pandia Health, and Winona provide virtual appointments with menopause-trained clinicians — such as board-certified OB/GYNs and doctors who are also NASM-certified menopause practitioners. Pandia Health also offers asynchronous telemedicine, where women can message doctors without face or voice contact — establishing a safe space to share their concerns.\n\nEven with the rise of personalized HRT, some women can't or prefer not to take hormones — especially breast cancer survivors. That's driving innovation in non-hormonal therapies.\n\nIn 2025, the FDA approved Lynkuet, a gel capsule from Bayer that blocks brain receptors responsible for hot flashes. In clinical trials of more than 700 women, it cut the frequency of hot flashes within a week.\n\n\"Many cannot or will not take hormones, so Lynkuet could be a wonderful option,\" Alyssa Dweck, the chief medical officer at Bonafide Health, told Business Insider.\n\nOther new options include estetrol, a natural estrogen steroid pill, which is designed to address hot flashes, vaginal atrophy, and loss of bone mass. Vaginal estrogen creams and suppositories that treat dryness, itching, and irritation can also help.\n\nAfter years of debate, the FDA recently removed the \"black box\" warning — the FDA's highest issued safety label — from estrogen-related products. The move could make women feel more comfortable using these medications, Nazzaro said.\n\n\"I've had patients who pick up their prescription for vaginal estrogen after a thorough discussion and decide not to use it specifically because of the black box warning,\" Nazzaro told Business Insider.\n\nDoctors say the shift isn't just happening among menopausal women — it's starting earlier.\n\n\"I have women in their 30s presenting to my office wanting to understand what they might anticipate when they enter perimenopause,\" Dweck said. They want to understand \"what proactive measures can be taken to avoid distressing symptoms.\"\n\nThat proactive mindset, paired with more tools and data, could redefine menopause care for the next generation.\n\n\"I feel incredibly optimistic,\" Dweck said.\n\nStaying open-minded to emerging research and aware of the risks and benefits of new therapies is crucial to navigating this phase of life, said Dweck. She suggested being proactive and educating yourself about menopause with credible sources like The Menopause Society.\n\nCertain lifestyle adjustments like exercise, nutrition, and sleep can also make a major difference and support treatments like hormone therapy, non-hormonal drugs, or clinically studied supplements, Dweck said.\n\nAnd remember — although the menopause care market offers many products that are touted as \"solutions,\" they may not have solid scientific evidence to support their claims.\n\n\"Product labels can be overwhelming, frightening, and confusing, and for this reason, a comprehensive discussion with an experienced healthcare provider about indications for use, risks, benefits, and specific use instructions is warranted,\" Dweck said.\n\nShe recommended considering personal needs based on symptoms, medical and family history, medications, and lifestyle habits. There's no one-size-fits-all approach or experience when it comes to menopause.",

    "description": "Disney faces an engagement problem as kids gravitate to YouTube. It's looking to OpenAI to help boost engagement.",
    "fullText": "Disney is losing the war for attention. Can its blockbuster OpenAI licensing deal change the momentum on the battlefield?\n\nSoon, you'll be able to use OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT and the video generator Sora, to create content featuring Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Darth Vader.\n\nCEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.\n\nIger said initially Disney would \"curate some of the videos that have been created on the Sora platform and put them onto Disney+, which we think is a great way to increase engagement with our Disney+ users, particularly the younger users.\" Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.\n\nThere's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.\n\nTime people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.\n\nData from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.\n\nDisney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.\n\nTraditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?\"\n\nDisney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.\n\nJohn Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.\n\n\"UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,\" he said. \"But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.\"\n\nDisney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.\n\nShae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.\n\n\"I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,\" she added. \"So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.\"\n\nSome in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.\n\nFor one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.\n\nSam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.\n\n\"I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,\" Tung said.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "description": "Bloated valuations and an aging bull market are two things that could hold back the S&P 500 for the next decade, forecasters say.",
    "fullText": "A dark thought is starting to circulate around Wall Street. What if, after years of stellar gains, the US stock market is basically flat for the next decade?\n\nThat feels like an unbelievable idea given the current bull run for the stock market, which is just the latest in a larger secular rally that's been going on for almost 15 years.\n\nThe gains continued to pile up on Thursday. As investors fled tech amid worries about Oracle's earnings, they pumped the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow to fresh record highs.\n\nBut the possibility of the party soon coming to an end is being floated by a growing number of forecasters, who see two main reasons the market could be held back:\n\nNow, more analysts see what could be a lost decade coming for stocks — a 10-year period where the US market sees near-zero returns or severely lags other markets around the world.\n\nIn a note this week, Bank of America said its team of equity strategists saw the S&P 500 shedding 0.1% over the next decade. Historically, that's a terrible performance, given that the S&P 500 has gained an average 10.5% a year since the 1950s.\n\nStrategists pointed to high valuations and back-to-back years of double-digit growth in the benchmark index.\n\n\"Even for next year, the math of history is tough: average returns for the S&P 500 after 3 years of >15% growth are 2.3ppt lower than the average annual return. Investors may need GDP & EPS surprises to avoid a seventh 'lost decade,'\" BofA wrote in a client note.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also said he expects the S&P 500 to remain relatively flat for the next 10 years. That projection is based on where the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 currently resides, he said on Thursday.\n\n\"The historical relationship between the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio and subsequent 10-year annualized returns shows that investors should expect to get zero in return in the S&P 500 over the coming decade,\" Sløk said.\n\nIn November, Goldman Sachs analysts said they saw the US market coming in last place for returns in the coming 10-year stretch. The S&P 500 is on track to gain around 6.5% a year for the next 10 years, the bank estimated, falling short of estimated returns in Europe, Japan, Asia, and emerging markets.\n\nThe bank said it expected earnings growth to be stronger in other markets. Valuations in the US are also high and on track to decline around 1% annually over the next decade, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"If the profitability and/or valuations of the largest companies falter, unless another cohort of 'superstars' emerges, returns for the broad market will likely be hampered as today's largest stocks fall back to earth,\" analysts wrote of their bearish scenario for the US market.",

    "title": "I Tracked My Health With Whoop, and This Is What I Liked (and What I Ignored)",
    "description": "The last six weeks have taught me that hydration is more important than I realized, and opened my eyes to how much shut-eye I actually need.",
    "fullText": "When I reviewed the Whoop 5.0 and MG (and, earlier, the Whoop 4.0), I kept it to the basics—how the strap looks, works, and charges, and what activities it can track. But that's only part of it, and today, I’m going to dive in to all the metrics Whoop reports and offer a reality check on what I've found most useful and what isn’t worth paying attention to.\n\n(I'll leave out the activity tracking features here, since I covered them in more depth in the review, but the bottom line is this: I love the way it tracks how hard your workouts are—strength workouts included—but it's not going to replace a true fitness watch for most people.)\n\nI haven't worn the Whoop band as regularly as I do the Oura ring, for which I was able to give a four-year retrospective. But to research both this article and my reviews, I’ve worn the Whoop for a couple of stints of at least a few weeks each, tracking my workouts and sleep regularly. With that said, here's a deeper dive into what it’s actually like to wear the Whoop strap long-term, using it to judge and guide your habits and performance.\n\nLet me take you through a typical day. I’m wearing the Whoop band on either my wrist or upper arm, and it’s probably been a few days since I last charged it. (I get about five days on a charge.) I made sure I had it on when I went to bed. If I look at my Whoop app first thing in the morning, it will sometimes tell me that it’s still “processing” my sleep, and there’s a button I can press to “end sleep” and get my recovery results.\n\nThe Whoop app will show you a survey called your “journal” the first time you open the app each day. I’ll talk more about the journal in a section below. Let’s say you’ve already filled out your journal, and you’re looking at the main app. From the home screen, on a typical day I might see:\n\nMy recovery at the top, color coded. Green is good, and you get that if your recovery is 66% or better. Yellow is OK (34% and up), and red is poor. Today, I have a yellow recovery, at 48%. (For the month of April, I got 19 green recoveries, 9 yellow, 0 red, and on two nights I forgot to wear the strap to bed.)\n\nSome notes about things I should pay attention to. Perhaps my HRV is lower than usual, which might be because of my hard workout yesterday.\n\nThe health monitor, which tells me whether my respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, HRV, and skin temperature are within my normal ranges.\n\nThe stress monitor, which I guess tells me how stressed I am. To be honest, I don’t find this useful.\n\nA \"daily outlook\" button I can press. This starts a conversation with Whoop Coach—more about that in a minute.\n\nToday’s timeline, showing when I slept. As I do other activities, like workouts, they’ll show up here.\n\nRecommendations for tonight’s sleep, including a recommended bedtime.\n\nAfter this, there is a scorecard for my current “plan” (more about that below), and a dashboard with the individual metrics I might care about, like heart rate variability (HRV) and a count of my steps so far today, a feature that’s still in beta.\n\nAlong the top of the screen, I can tap on my scores for Sleep, Recovery, or Strain. The Strain screen is interesting, since it gives a recommended Strain level for the day. It may suggest that I take on a “moderate” level of Strain, and set my target as 8.9 to 12.9. You get most of your Strain from exercise, and a little from everyday activity like walking around. On a morning I haven’t done any workouts or left the house yet, I may be around 2.7 Strain just from sitting around.\n\nLet’s return to that Daily Outlook button. Tap that, and you’ll be launched into a conversation with Whoop Coach, an AI chatbot. This is probably the only AI bot I converse with on the regular, because it does a decent job of explaining the app’s metrics and recommends workouts for the day.\n\nTo use one real example: on a certain day it complimented me on completing a running workout yesterday, and told me my workout schedule had been consistent, with 162 minutes in active heart rate zones so far that week. It then described a few trends in my metrics, including that my resting heart rate had improved over the past few weeks, but that my recovery that day was lower than my usual.\n\nThen comes the fun part. It makes recommendations for workouts to do today, and habits to focus on. It told me to aim for three liters of water that day (that’s a little bit more than my usual) with plenty of fruits and vegetables. And for a workout, I could meet my recommended Strain score with something that is low impact to “support recovery,” since my heart rate and HRV suggested I may need a bit of a rest.\n\nThe Whoop Coach went on to suggest three workouts to choose from, based on the kinds of activities it knows I like to do. They included a 30-minute run, mostly in zones 1 and 2, or an 80-minute weightlifting workout at a low-medium intensity. I can tap a button at the bottom of each workout that says “Commit,” and doing this will add it to my timeline for the day. I can do the workout later by just tapping that button, and it will start the activity timer for me.\n\nI love that it can recommend these workouts for me, since otherwise “get 8.9 Strain” is an inscrutable instruction. Unfortunately, the little graphic showing time in heart rate zones is all you get. I’ve asked the Whoop Coach if it could time me through those intervals, perhaps beeping when it’s time to switch from one zone to another, but it doesn’t have that functionality.\n\nIt does offer a specific workout plan that I could punch into a workout timer app of my choice. In the past, the Whoop Coach has struggled to put together interval workouts that add up to the number of minutes that are supposed to be in the workout; that seems to be improving. But the workout ideas are still pretty generic. I found that the best way to use the coach is to see what it recommends, then use that as a sort of vague guidance if I have flexibility in my training program or my real-life plans for the day. For example, if I have a hard 45-minute running workout planned today, but Whoop thinks I should do something lighter, I might see if I can swap today's run with an easy run that is scheduled for later in the week.\n\nWhoop gives you so many sleep metrics, it can be hard to know where to start. I see two major, useful features here: the report of how long you slept compared to how much sleep you needed, and the smart alarms that you can set in any of a variety of ways.\n\nOn your Sleep tab, you’ll get a score for your sleep “performance,” comparing the amount of sleep you got to the amount it calculates you needed. Today I slept more than I needed, which doesn’t match with how I felt groggily dragging myself out of bed. The timing seems right, though—I was extra tired yesterday so I both got to bed early and slept a little late.\n\nI think it’s a fool’s errand to worry about how “accurate” sleep tracking is, since no wearable is truly accurate, but most of them are good enough. But for a comparison, the total sleep time is usually similar to what Oura reports, and the sleep phases are often more-or-less in the same ballpark. Here’s one example from a day I wore both Oura and Whoop:\n\nTotal sleep matters more than the other numbers, in my book. Increase your total sleep and you’re likely to sleep better. (I have data backing this up from my long-term Oura trends—total sleep correlates closely with other metrics and scores of sleep quality.)\n\nWhoop also tracks your “sleep debt,” or how much sleep you needed but didn’t get. In one example month I had a six nights with a “high” sleep debt of 45 minutes or more. Nine times it was moderate (30 to 45 minutes), and 14 times it was 30 minutes or less.\n\nOne of Whoop’s most intriguing features is the sleep coach, which can advise you when to go to bed, and even help you decide when your alarm should go off. (It’s also one of the most hidden features. Tap on the “tonight’s sleep” card on your overview screen.)\n\nFrom this screen, called the Sleep Planner, you can choose whether you want to “reach my sleep need” (making up any sleep debt, as needed); “improve my sleep,” which will recommend times that help you to be more consistent in your sleep schedule; or “reach my weekly plan goal,” which I’ll say more about below.\n\nAnd then, there’s a second set of preferences. When you try to set an alarm, the app will ask if you’d like to wake up at an exact time, or when you’ve met your sleep goal for the night, or as soon as you’re “in the green.” That last one refers to a 66% or better recovery, which may not be ideal, but should ensure you’re not going to be dead on your feet.\n\nRealistically, I don’t use these features too often. I do have a sleep goal set in my weekly plan, but I’m not fiddling with an app every night to decide when to wake up. On the other hand, if I had a chaotic schedule, like that of a student or a pro sports player, I could definitely see making more use of this feature.\n\nThe activity and sleep tracking happen more or less automatically, and pretty much any fitness tracker or smartwatch can do those things. Where Whoop really shines, from a wellness perspective, is in helping you track all the little habits and factors that may be affecting your sleep or your athletic performance.\n\nThis is where the Journal comes in. You can fill it out at any time during the day, but it will also pop up first thing in the morning and ask you what happened yesterday. Did you eat a late meal? Did you have any alcohol? Did you hydrate well? If you don’t like these questions, you can set it up to ask you different ones. It can also pull in data from other parts of the app or from connected apps—for example, if you log your menstrual cycle in Apple Health, that can show up here as well.\n\nEach habit or factor only becomes useful if you log at least five yeses and five nos. Anything that you almost always do, or that you almost never do, isn’t going to be very helpful to track. So I’ve narrowed down my Journal questions to only include things I’ll answer differently from night to night, or things I’m trying to improve on.\n\nOne important caveat: leaving the question blank doesn’t count as a yes or a no. At first I only answered a question if I could say “yes,” and otherwise I’d leave it blank—for example, answering “yes” if I’d had alcohol that day. But when I looked at my results later, I found that with a total of seven yeses and zero nos for alcohol, Whoop couldn’t give me any reports that used that information. When I noticed this I was able to backfill the last few days’ worth of journal entries, but you can’t go back more than about a week.\n\nThat extra week’s worth of data was enough to get an answer on alcohol, though: it hurts my recovery, taking it down an average of 9% on nights I had a beer or two. Or at least that’s how Whoop represents it—these are correlations, and Whoop doesn’t actually know what’s causing what. For example, taking melatonin supposedly hurts my recovery by 4%. But is melatonin really the culprit, or do I tend to take melatonin when I’m already having trouble sleeping? You need to take these results with a big grain of salt. To Whoop’s credit, it includes a note that “this impact is significantly different than the Whoop average. Note that impacts can sometimes be affected by other correlated factors that you don’t track.”\n\nThe two things that do help my recovery, according to Whoop’s insights (which you can access from the top of the Journal screen), are sticking to a consistent bedtime—8% improvement—and being well-hydrated, a 4% improvement. The consistent bedtime was automatically filled out from Whoop data, while the hydration came from me answering a yes/no question each day.\n\nWeekly plans are a nice way to work on a small set of habits for a short time. Rather than trying to monitor everything for every outcome, you pick, say, three things you want to work on. Here are some examples that the app provides, and the habits or factors that each one tracks:\n\nBoost fitness: increase time in high intensity heart rate zones, meet a protein goal four days per week, do any strength training activity one day per week\n\nFeel better: increase daily steps, meet hydration goal four days per week, do “any recovery activity” three days per week\n\nSleep deeper: increase sleep consistency, increase sleep performance, avoid late meals\n\nAfter experimenting with some of these, I ended up creating a custom plan for myself. I chose:\n\nGet 7:30 hours of sleep on average\n\nAvoid using my phone in bed four days per week\n\nMeet my hydration goal five days per week\n\nThroughout the week I can check in on how I’m doing, and at the end of the week Whoop gives me a little report and asks if I’d like to do the same plan next week, or change it up. I find this a useful way to work on a mini goal, and it’s a lot less overwhelming than poring over huge dashboards full of all the data Whoop can collect.\n\nFor when you do want to pore over all your data, there are detailed weekly and monthly “performance assessments” that Whoop can share with you. Each of these is a PDF with graphs showing what you did over the course of the week or month, and how it compares with previous data.\n\nFor example, my monthly report for last April shows how my Strain and recovery compare with previous weeks throughout the year. I don’t wear my Whoop often enough to get any big insights from this—as I said, I only really wear it when I’m testing features or writing a review—but man, I would love this if it were available on one of the devices I do wear month in and month out. (As much as I admire the Whoop, I can only wear so many devices in addition to the ones I test for work.)\n\nMy weekly report is more narrowly focused. The most recent one starts with a statement: “Strain was optimal. Sleep could use improvement.” My Strain is also down slightly this week compared with the previous week, and my sleep consistency was poor. I like the graph that shows how my bedtimes and wake-up times line up (or don’t) with the times the app recommended for me.\n\nThe Whoop app gives you a wealth of data, and honestly I would say most of it isn’t worth paying attention to. The app has so many data points and fractal little rabbit holes you can get lost in. You could spend hours perusing reports and tweaking settings. You could spend an unlimited amount of time chatting with the Whoop Coach AI. And you don’t need to do that.\n\nWhat is useful is choosing a few things to pay attention to and letting go of the rest. Fortunately, the app gives you plenty of ways to do this. You can select a few things that matter to you in the Weekly Plan, and you can hide things from your Dashboard that you don’t need to check on every day.\n\nAs for the things I (almost) never pay attention to:\n\nDon’t overthink your sleep stages. Getting enough sleep, and consistent sleep, will cover your bases.\n\nDon’t read too much into the recovery scores; you are resilient enough to be able to handle your scheduled workout even if your sleep wasn’t perfect. The exception would be if you’re feeling truly awful—you’re sick or something—in which case, you would know because of how you feel, not because of a number on an app.\n\nRemember that the insights tell you about correlation, not causation—as in my melatonin example, where melatonin is correlated with worse sleep, possibly because I'm taking it when I expect to have worse sleep. These are not really \"insights\" at all, just data that you'll need to use your own brain (and further experimentation) to make sense of.\n\nI have found that paying too much attention to a recovery app can drive me a little crazy. Instead of waking up and not really thinking about how I feel—I’m fine, probably—I find myself wondering if the app agrees that I feel tired and sore. Or I’ll think I’m OK, but the app says my HRV is down, and now I have to think about what may have caused that. I wouldn’t recommend intensive tracking like this for a person who finds they can easily get sucked in to obsessing over numbers. But if numbers bring you joy, the Whoop app can certainly give you plenty of them.",

    "title": "The Surprising Origins of Hanukkah (and Why It Moves Around Every Year)",
    "description": "Also: When will the Festival of Lights take place in 2025?",
    "fullText": "Hanukkah (or \"Chanukah,\" if you prefer; it’s a transliteration, so there is no “correct” spelling) is an annual eight-day Jewish religious festival that usually takes place in late November or early December. In 2025, Hanukkah begins on the evening of Sunday, December 14, and continues through Monday December 22.\n\nWhile Hanukkah falls on different dates every year on the Gregorian calendar you’re probably familiar with, it begins on the same day every year on the Hebrew calendar: 25th of Kislev. The Hebrew calendar is based on the moon, and Hanukkah falls on the 25th day after the new moon that marks the beginning of the month of Kislev.\n\nHanukkah celebrates the anniversary of the beginning of the Maccabean revolt against the Seleucid Empire and the re-dedication of the Second Temple that happened in the 2nd century BCE. That’s the strict definition of the holiday. In practice, in present day America, Hanukkah is the “festival of lights,” a winter celebration usually marked by gift-giving, delicious foods, candle-lighting, and the boring game of dreidel (more on that below).\n\nReligiously, Hanukkah is a comparatively minor holiday, not nearly as significant as the Jewish High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but it is a favorite among children, particularly American children. These days, the holiday is marked in Jewish communities all over the world, but Jewish kids in the U.S. are the undisputed Hanukkah kings and queens.\n\nThere are two ways to think about the origin of the Festival of Lights. You could say Hanukkah began around 200 BCE when Greek leaders prevented Jews from practicing their religion, leading the Maccabees to rise up in defiance. Or you could say Hanukkah began in Cincinnati.\n\nBefore a couple hundred years ago, there’s no record of how anyone celebrated Hanukkah—maybe it was done, but it seems that no one made too big of a deal about it. That all changed in the mid-to-late 1800s, when a couple of Cincinnati rabbis, Isaac M. Wise and Max Lilienthal, put Hanukkah on the holiday map. They popularized, promoted, and Americanized the holiday, introducing celebrations of Hanukkah to their congregations and promoting it in national Jewish publications.\n\nWise and Lilienthal were leaders of Reform Judaism, a more modern, less orthodox form of the religion, and to some extent, the holiday they popularized reflects that set of values. It was meant to help Jewish children in America honor their heritage by presenting an exciting, relatable historical event featuring Jewish heroes. it was also meant to be Christmas-like—a family holiday that’s fun.\n\nLilienthal noted the rising popularity of Christmas celebrations in the U.S. in the 1800s, and was impressed with the way Christian churches used the secular aspects of the holiday to teach their faith, so he borrowed the gift-giving and lighthearted nature of non-religious Christmas celebrations and put a Jewish spin on ‘em. Thus modern Hanukkah was born.\n\n“We must do something, too, to enliven our children… [They] shall have a grand and glorious Chanukah festival nicer than any Christmas festival.” Lilienthal wrote in 1876.\n\nThe main event of Hanukkah among most who celebrate is the lighting of candles before dinner, one more for each successive night of the festival. When the Maccabees rebuilt the temple back in the olden times, they re-lit the menorahs—candle holders for seven candles—but they only had enough oil for the candles to burn for one night (or so the story goes). Miraculously, the lights stayed on for eight nights.\n\nTechnically, most people don’t light menorahs on Hanukkah. Menorahs have eight lights. Hanukkah candles are usually in a “hanukkiah” which holds nine: eight main candles and the helper candle that lights them all.\n\nFoodwise, you can eat whatever you like—this isn't a fasting holiday. Fried foods, particularly latkes (fried potato pancakes), are popular and delicious, especially if served with sour cream and/or apple sauce. Jelly doughnuts are another favorite. But like I said, you can eat whatever you like.\n\nMany Hanukkah-heads give gifts too—one for each night.\n\nHanukkah carols have never really caught on because golden age Jewish songwriters were busy writing “Let it Snow,” “Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,” “Silver Bells,” “White Christmas,” “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” and almost every other Christmas song that isn’t a hymn. But there's \"I Have a Little Dreidel,\" a folksong with English lyrics attributed to Samuel E. Goldfarb, but that's not explicitly about the holiday. This all leaves Adam Sandler's \"Hanukkah Song\" as the most well-known tune commemorating the Festival of Lights.\n\nSpeaking of dreidels, though...\n\nMany households break out dreidels (spinning tops with Hebrew characters on them) and play with them for a few minutes after dinner. Dreidels are marked with Nun (נ), Gimel (ג), Hey (ה), and Shin (ש), which form an acronym for \"Nes Gadol Hayah Sham\" (A great miracle happened there). Here's how the game is traditionally played: Everyone starts with the same amount of something \"valuable,\" usually chocolate coins. At the start of a round, everyone antes up, then they takes turns spinning the dreidel, following the directions of which character it lands on.\n\nנ (Nun) means “nisht” or “nothing.” Player does nothing if Nun comes up.\n\nה (Hey) means “halb” or “half.” The player gets half of the pot. (If there is an odd number of pieces, the player gets the extra.)\n\nש (Shin) means “shtel” or “put in.” The player adds a chocolate coin to the pot.\n\nג (Gimel) means “gantz” or “everything.” The player gets everything in the pot. Jackpot!\n\n(It's not a very good game: all luck; no skill.)\n\nIt’s widely believed that dreidel is the most popular Hanukkah game, but this is a lie. The most popular (and best) Hanukkah game is “guess which candle will be the last to go out,” a much more nuanced and exciting game played by everyone who has ever fired up a menorah (sorry, a hanukkiah) before dinner. Do darker candles burn faster than lighter ones? Does placement matter? How about wick length? All of this and more must be considered and discussed if you’re going to master this exciting game.\n\nYou can celebrate any holiday you want; it's a free country. Hanukkah is generally seen as a “fun” holiday, without the deep religious significance of other Jewish holidays. While I don’t speak for anyone else, none of the Jews I know take offense if non-Jews want to light some candles and watch 8 Crazy Nights to capture some of that Hanukkah magic. Some of the traditions of the holiday were partly inspired by Christmas anyway, and much of Christmas was (maybe) appropriated from pagan solstice celebrations itself, so go nuts—it’s the holidays.",

    "description": "GPT-5.2 is here, and, according to OpenAI, better than ever.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is having a hell of a day. First, the company announced a $1 billion equity investment from Disney, alongside a licensing deal that will let Sora users generate videos with characters like Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker, and Simba. Shortly after, OpenAI revealed its latest large language model: GPT-5.2.\n\nOpenAI says that this new GPT model is particularly useful for \"professional knowledge work.\" The company advertises how GPT-5.2 is better than previous models at making spreadsheets, putting together presentations, writing code, analyzing pictures, and working through multi-step projects. For this model, the company also gathered insights from tech companies: Supposedly, Notion, Box Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom all find GPT-5.2 to have \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning,\" while Databricks, Hex, and Triple Whale believe GPT-5.2 to be \"exceptional\" with both agentic data science and document analysis tasks.\n\nBut most of OpenAI's user base aren't professionals. Most of the users who will interact with GPT-5.2 are using ChatGPT, and many of those for free, at that. What can those users expect when OpenAI upgrades the free version of ChatGPT with these new models?\n\nOpenAI says that GPT-5.2 will improve ChatGPT's \"day to day\" functionality. The new model supposedly makes the chatbot more structured, reliable, and \"enjoyable to talk to,\" though I've never found the last part to be necessarily true.\n\nGPT-5.2 will impact the ChatGPT experience differently depending on which of the three models you happen to be using. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Instant is for \"everyday work and learning.\" It's apparently better for questions seeking information about certain subjects, how-to questions and walkthroughs, technical writing, and translations—maybe ChatGPT will get you to give up your Duolingo obsession.\n\nGPT-5.2 Thinking, however, is supposedly made for \"deeper work.\" OpenAI wants you using this model for coding, summarizing lengthy documents, answering queries about files you send to ChatGPT, solving math and logic problems, and decision making. Finally, there's GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI's \"smartest and most trustworthy option\" for the most complicated questions. The company says 5.2 Pro produces fewer errors and stronger performance compared to previous models.\n\nOpenAI says that this latest update improves how the models responds to distressing prompts, such as those showing signs of suicide, self-harm, or emotional dependence on the AI. As such, the company says this model has \"fewer undesirable responses\" in GPT-5.2 Instant and Thinking compared to GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking. In addition, the company is working on an \"age prediction model,\" which will automatically place content restrictions on users who the model think are under 18.\n\nThese safety improvements are important—critical, even—as we start to understand the correlations between chatbots and mental health. The company has admitted its failure in \"recognizing signs of delusion,\" as users turned to the tool for emotional support. In some cases, ChatGPT fed into delusional thinking, encouraging people's dangerous beliefs. Some families have even sued companies like OpenAI over claims that their chatbots helped or encouraged victims commit suicide.\n\nActively acknowledging improvements to user safety is undoubtedly a good thing, but I think companies like OpenAI still have a lot to reckon with—and a long way to go.\n\nOpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro will all roll out today, Thursday, Dec. 11, to paid plans. Developers can access the new models in the API today, as well.\n\nDisclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "title": "Google Will Now Let You Virtually Try on Clothes With Just a Selfie",
    "description": "Is this useful, or creepy?",
    "fullText": "The pace of AI technology is so rapid, it's tough to keep up with everything. At Google I/O back in May, Google rolled out an AI-powered shopping feature that let you virtually try on clothes you find online. All you needed to do was upload a full-length photo of yourself, and Google's AI would be to dress you up in whatever article of clothing you liked. I still can't decide whether the feature sounds useful, creepy, or a little bit of both.\n\nWhat I can say, however, is that the feature is getting a little creepier. On Thursday, Google announced an update to its virtual try on feature, that takes advantage of the company's new AI image model, Nano Banana. Now, you don't need a full-length photo of yourself: just a selfie. With solely a photo of your face, Nano Banana will generate a full-length avatar in your likeness, which you can use to virtually try on your clothes.\n\nI'm not exactly sure who this particular update is for: Maybe there are some of us out there who want to use this virtual try-on feature, but don't have a full-length photo of ourselves to share. Personally, I wouldn't really want to send Google my photo—selfie or otherwise—but I don't think I'd prefer to have Google infer what I look like from a photo of my face alone. I'd rather just send it the full photo, and give it something to actually work off of.\n\nHere's the other issue: While Google asks you to only upload images of yourself, it doesn't stop you if you upload an image of someone else. Talk about creepy: You can upload someone else's selfie and see how they look in various clothes. There is a system in place to stop you from uploading certain selfies, like celebrities, children, or otherwise \"unsafe\" items, but if the system fails, this feature could be used maliciously. I feel like Google could get around this by verifying the selfie against your Google Account, since you need to be signed in to use the feature anyway.\n\nIf you are interested in trying the feature out—and, subsequently, trying on virtual clothes with your AI-generated avatar—you can head over to Google's try on feature, sign into your Google Account, and upload your selfie. When it processes, you choose one of four avatars, each dressed in a different fit, to proceed. Once through, you can virtually try on any clothes you see in the feed.\n\nAgain, I see the potential usefulness of a feature that lets you see what you might look like in a certain piece of clothing before buying it. But, at the same time, I think I'd rather just order the item and try it on in the comfort (and privacy) of my own home.",

    "description": "The Buffalo Bills were Super Bowl favourites but must win at the in-form New England Patriots to have a chance of stopping their divisional rivals winning the AFC East.",
    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:45 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Detroit Lions v Los Angeles Rams on Sunday (from 21:00).\n\nThere are four weeks left in the NFL's regular season and I feel like every year we're saying this, but I don't think the league's ever been this contested.\n\nThere's been so many games where you cannot blink or take anything for granted. Some play-off spots won't be decided until week 18, so for so many teams, that final game will be incredibly meaningful.\n\nThe AFC East title could go down to the wire, but the Buffalo Bills will need to stop the New England Patriots' 10-game win streak when the divisional rivals meet at Foxborough this Sunday.\n\nThe Bills improved their record to 9-4 with a 39-34 win over the Bengals last Sunday, and it was just Josh Allen doing Josh Allen things again, especially in that fourth quarter. He just puts on his cape and make things happen. That's what makes the Bills so dangerous. He was last season's Most Valuable Player and he's a guy who can change the game and rally the troops around him.\n\nBuffalo had a rough spell but have won their past two. At this time of year, you've been able to have a true self-scout, so things are coming together for them, and last Sunday's win was huge. The Bills were on the edge of the AFC play-off rankings and now they've solidified themselves. If they win at the Patriots, who are 11-2, the Bills will be just one win back with three games left.\n\nNew England's schedule looks easier than Buffalo's though. The Patriots finish with Baltimore, the Jets and the Dolphins. The Bills go against the Browns, the Eagles and the Jets.\n\nThere's a high probability Buffalo won't win the AFC East for the first time in six years, and few expected New England to win the division after back-to-back four-win seasons.\n\nIn the past, there was an expectation with the Patriots because they had greatness. They had Tom Brady and had been winning for so long. Now there's straight excitement about current quarterback Drake Maye and what this team can do. They could clinch the AFC East on Sunday, which is huge for them.\n\nSometimes it's better when you're that team with no expectations, but the Patriots have Mike Vrabel as head coach. He won three Super Bowls with them as a player and he's brought in the right people. Josh McDaniels won six Super Bowls on the Patriots' coaching staff but wasn't successful as head coach of the Raiders. Vrabel pairing him as offensive coordinator with Maye has been so good though. McDaniels understands what it takes to win in the AFC East, to win in the cold and how to attack those teams.\n\nNew England had one of the easiest schedules this season, but you still have to win those games. Vrabel's been using the word 'champions' and I think all the guys are starting to believe in that championship mentality. I love how he also says 'no naps', like, you can't sleep on anybody and you've got to keep doing the right things. I think he's a great leader who's learned how to inspire from being in this situation as a player.\n\nThe Patriots were the ones that broke the Bills' undefeated start in week five and when you do that on the road, your team's going to walk away and think 'alright, we actually might have something here'. Then all these wins they've had is building more and more confidence.\n\nThe Patriots aren't outstanding in any one category, offensively or defensively, but Maye has been brilliant, especially as a second-year quarterback. He can run the ball and be a big threat with his legs, and his decision making has gotten so much better. He gets to the top of his drop and he's already kind of made his decision on where he wants to throw the ball, because he's reading the field so quickly.\n\nMaye's got the NFL's best pass completion percentage, only Matthew Stafford has a higher passer rating, and only Dak Prescott has more pass yards. Maye's thrown 23 touchdown passes versus six interceptions. In every game, he's had 200+ pass yards and that goes to show that, for the most part, he's made the right decisions. He's protecting the football, and he's using different weapons to throw to.\n\nEarly in the season, Stefon Diggs was pretty much the star of the show. That gave Maye confidence and now he's using a slew of different receivers. They were kind of identifying their roles and now they're elevating each other. Maye has also been doing it without Will Campbell on the offensive line the past few weeks.\n\nHe is very much in the MVP conversation, but Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has just been phenomenal. It's his 17th year in the league and this is probably his best season. He leads the league with 35 touchdowns, with just four interceptions.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Maye does this week against Buffalo and then Baltimore. There's the irony of playing the past two MVPs - Allen and Lamar Jackson - and some people might say that could determine whether Maye becomes this season's MVP.\n\nAllen's still breaking records and it's hard to watch that game on Sunday and not think 'wow, this guy is so different'. I mean, which other quarterback has a 40-yard touchdown run in the snow? But I don't know if they'd give him a back-to-back MVP. Last year made sense because of how he took care of the ball but this year he hasn't been as perfect.\n\nBuffalo have a rivalry with the Patriots and, after losing to them in October, I think the Bills understand the importance of Sunday's game and what it can mean to go into Foxborough and get the win. But this is going to be a challenge for their defence, for sure.\n\nWith the different offensive weapons the Patriots have through the air, I think the Bills' defence has to step up and force turnovers. You know it's going to be a Stefon Diggs game when his former team Buffalo is involved, so I think that Maye-Diggs connection is where the outcome lies.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

We are trying to coach the players. The players are really honest.\n\n\"The reality is we are aware of it and I think sometimes you can be really exposed - and that's what has happened tonight.\"\n\nIn Taylor's defence, his early tenure on Merseyside has been disrupted by injuries to key players.\n\nPlaymaker Marie Hobinger and striker Sophie Roman Haug both suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, while experienced players such as Ceri Holland and Gemma Bonner have also had spells on the sidelines.",

The consequences of a third defeat in a row, in Sunday's League Cup final against St Mirren, does not bear thinking about.\n\n\"It's not his fault that he doesn't understand,\" Hart, who left Celtic in summer 2024 after three seasons at the club, said on TNT Sports. \"I didn't walk in and just understand what it was to be Celtic.

The ability and will to improve has been excellent - but you want immediate returns.\n\n\"For the way we can go into the market for our players, it's tough. We don't have endless resources so we are trying to find players in markets where others aren't necessarily looking.\"\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen made his loan permanent for £23m after scoring 14 times last season, but the Norway striker has netted just once in the league this term.\n\nExecutive chairman Jeff Shi added: \"Maybe we sold too many players in one window. You can see the squad and compare it to last season, maybe we changed 40 or 50% of the key players.\n\n\"It's a task to rebuild a team but the Premier League is very tough. If you can't control the tempo and need a longer time to rebuild the team the games will punish you.\"",

As part of the State of Play for First Light, Gibson was officially confirmed while five other cast members were revealed.\n\nOne role that is currently unrevealed is the game's nemesis, 009. This former MI6 agent is being hunted by Bond and his allies, but the extent of 009's ambitions are unclear.\n\nIO Interactive was more forthcoming about other aspects of the game, which we included in our recap of everything we learned about 007: First Light. The publisher also unveiled multiple editions of the game, which you can find in our First Light preorder guide.\n\n007 First Light will hit PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S on March 27, 2026. You can find all of the currently announced cast members below.\n\nPatrick Gibson is making his video game debut as the voice and likeness of James Bond in 007 First Light. In the absence of a 007 actor on the big screen, he's the incumbent Bond for the moment.\n\nGibson recently had one of his biggest roles to date as young Dexter Morgan in Dexter: Original Sin. Prior to that, he had leading roles on Netflix's Shadow and Bone and The OA. One of Gibson's earliest acting credits was in Showtime's The Tudors. On the big screen, Gibson has appeared in a handful of movies including the 2019 J.R.R. Tolkien biopic, Tolkien.\n\nPriyanga Burford had a small role in the last Bond movie as a MI6 scientist in No Time To Die. She has a considerably bigger part as M in 007 First Light.\n\nBurford's credits are primarily in television, and she had leading and supporting roles in Steeltown Murders, Before We Die, Avenue 5, Industry, Housebound, and Press.\n\nThe Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead fans will surely recognize Lennie James, who portrayed Morgan Jones across both series. In First Light, James will play Bond's mentor, John Greenway.\n\nJames has also lent his voice to the Destiny games, where he portrayed Lord Shaxx. The English actor has a long list of credits across TV and film, including Blade Runner 2049, Human Target, Invincible, Archer, Jericho, and Mufasa: The Lion King.\n\nKiera Lester is a relative newcomer to the entertainment industry, with only a handful of television credits to her name. She has appeared in Sister Boniface Mysteries, Wreck, Ruby Speaking, Grace, and Death in Paradise.\n\nLester's role as Miss Moneypenny in 007 First Light will be one of her most prominent parts to date.\n\nVeteran actor Alastair Mackenzie will voice Q, the man who creates all of Bond's incredible gadgets. We don't know yet how Mackenzie's take on the character will differ from his on-screen predecessors. But unlike the last Q, Ben Whishaw, Mackenzie is considerably older than the actor playing Bond.\n\nAndor fans may recognize Mackenzie from his role as Perrin Fertha, the husband on Mon Mothma. Some of his other credits include The Crown, Dracula, Unforgotten, Outlaw King, and Backdraft 2.\n\nWho is Miss Roth? She appears to be the femme fatale Bond girl in 007 First Light. Noemie Nakai will lend her voice and likeness to Miss Roth in the game.\n\nNakai's most prominent TV role was in HBO Max's Tokyo Vice, and her other credits include Army of Thieves, Never Let Me Go, The Emperor's Cook, and Death Note: New Generation.\n\nBritish actress Gemma Chan--known for her roles in Transformers: The Last Knight, Crazy Rich Asians, and Captain Marvel--will appear in First Light as the character Selina Tan.\n\nShe's described as a \"brilliant and passionate academic with a background in psychology and game theory.\" The character, who works at MI6, played a \"critical role\" in helping James Bond earn his 00 status.\n\nThis is not Chan's first video game role, as she also portrayed Erys in Diablo IV. Chan lent her voice and likeness to 007 First Light.\n\nMusician and actor Lenny Kravitz will play the villain Bawma.",

And honestly, it might just be the perfect meme to encapsulate this whole year.\nDigital Extremes' community director Megan Everett and creative director Rebecca Ford took to the stage to talk about the free-to-play shooter-RPG Warframe.

Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today.
