    "description": "Andrew Tackett and his brother William Tackett split their title bouts. Check out at UFC BJJ 4 results and highlights.",
    "fullText": "UFC BJJ 4 had three title bouts, two new champions, and three notable submissions.\n\nThe Tackett Brothers topped the event, but they had drastically different outcomes in their respective title bouts. Andrew Tackett successfully defended his UFC BJJ welterweight belt and continues to be the face of the promotion, but his older brother William Tacket wasn’t as lucky.\n\nWe’ll discuss the key bouts from the event, but do check here for complete results from UFC BJJ 4.\n\nHeadlining the event was another spectacular performance from Andrew Tackett. He reportedly came in with a rib injury, but he still put on a show and landed a slick submission finish to boot. After a few exchanges early, Elijah Dorsey dropped down for a heel hook, only for Tackett to hunt for a counter leg lock of his own.\n\nOne small adjustment, then his heel hook locked in deeper and Tackett was able to finish the submission and add a title defense to his growing resume.\n\nEXTENDING HIS DOMINANCE 🏆\n\nAndrew Tackett retains his welterweight belt tonight!\n\n[ #UFCBJJ4 | LIVE & FREE on YouTube ] pic.twitter.com/2XP66WJ0aH\n\n— UFC BJJ (@ufcbjj) December 12, 2025\n\nTackett said that even outside of the injury hampering his training, he didn’t drill leg locks at all as he expected more of a wrestling match and a battle for top control with Dorsey.\n\nAfter the match, Tackett called for an unlikely BJJ match with UFC fighter Michael Chandler.\n\nWhile Andrew was able to go home with the impressive victory, his brother suffered a different fate as the second title bout on UFC BJJ 4 produced a pretty sizable upset. William Tackett came in as a favorite and was looking to join his brother Andrew as a UFC BJJ champion, but Ronaldo Junior had other plans.\n\nThe Atos product pushed the pace from top position, and absolutely dominated Tackett in the last two rounds. Junior had several choke attempts from front headlock, wore him down and pretty much beat Tackett in his own game.\n\nTackett survived to the final bell, but it was Junior that went home with the dominant decision win and the inaugural UFC BJJ middleweight belt.\n\nIn the other title bout on the card, Aurelie Le Vern came into Las Vegas against a local star and UFC BJJ favorite in Raquel Canuto, and pulled off a particularly nasty submission win in hostile territory. The French grappler kept transitioning between reverse triangle and kimura attempts, before eventually finishing with a pretty brutal hammerlock that won her the inaugural UFC BJJ women’s featherweight title.\n\nCanuto tried to hold on and tough it out, but the painful submission was just locked in too deep and Le Vern forced a verbal tap to claim the inaugural belt.\n\nOutside of the three title bouts at UFC BJJ 4, it was a teenager called “The Big Slime” that arguably stole the spotlight. 19-year-old top prospect Landon Elmore was fresh of winning the EBI title and effortlessly submitting UFC fighter Bryce Mitchell, and he made his UFC BJJ debut look easy as well.\n\nMoments after the match started, Elmore quickly submitted Nate Hernandez by Aoki lock, adding yet another high-profile win in under a minute to his resume.\n\nTHE BIG SLIME 🤯\n\nLandon Elmore takes home the submission in under a minute! \n\n[ #UFCBJJ4 ] pic.twitter.com/8kJkVPycX9\n\n— UFC BJJ (@ufcbjj) December 12, 2025\n\nElmore, who trains under John Danaher and Gordon Ryan, again proved why he’s one of the top prospects to watch in jiu-jitsu.\n\nComplete UFC BJJ 4 results are below.\n\nFor the latest Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and grappling-related news click here.",

    "description": "The Buccaneers blew a key game on Thursday night.",
    "fullText": "The Buccaneers blew a key game on Thursday night. After the loss to the Falcons, quarterback Baker Mayfield accepted the blame for it.\n\n\"It falls on my shoulders,\" Mayfield told reporters following the 29-28 defeat. \"Can't turn the ball over, can't have that interception. And then, just gotta hit [Emeka Egbuka] in stride on that third down. Listen, you can say what you want about being up two scores and the defense right there, but we have to be better on offense, and it comes down to how I play. And this one's gonna haunt me. This falls on my shoulders.\"\n\nAsked whether the issue related to decision making, Mayfield was clear on what he needed to do: \"Make the throws. Make the throws.\"\n\nUp eight in the fourth quarter, Mayfield threw an interception to Falcons defensive back Dee Alford.\n\n\"It wasn't even a disguise, you know,\" Mayfield said. \"It's quarters coverage. He's playing outside leverage, which is really not what he normally does on tape. You gotta go through the reads and if it's not there, take the damn check down. And it's plain and simple. This one's, like I said, it's gotta beat me up for a little bit.\"\n\nMayfield also was asked about coach Todd Bowles's message to the team.\n\n\"He hit the nail on the head, saying and questioning does it mean anything to the guys?\" Mayfield said. \"Like, 'Does this hurt enough for you to actually make changes. To come in, do the work that you need to do, to do the things that we need to do as a team to get better, fix these things and win ball games?' And he repeated it, and it really is as simple as that. We have talent. Talent doesn't get you shit though. Doing the work and executing on game days does, and that's — we didn't do that today. Like I said, I did not do that.\"\n\nMayfield said it's not an issue with preparation but execution. He also acknowledged the possibility that it's a matter of concentration in crunch time.\n\n\"I don't know if it's losing focus late in games,\" Mayfield said. \"You know, mine was just lack of execution. But I don't know if it's losing focus late in games. I mean, I can't speak for the defense, but I can speak for the offense. I can speak for myself, and that was that was just execution on my part.\"\n\nThe end result is that the 7-7 Buccaneers are not happy.\n\n\"We're pissed off,\" Mayfield said. \"We expected to win that game. We want to win that game. Should be pissed off. And, like I said, when you're up two scores and your offense has a chance to put the game away, and you don't — obviously, people are gonna blame the defense, but it's not the defense's fault. It's our fault. It's my fault. And that's that's how I view it, and that's how I'm gonna handle it.\"\n\nThey can still get to the playoffs, if they handle their business.\n\n\"We have to win out, and we know that,\" Mayfield said. \"It's — that's as plain and simple as it is. We put ourselves in a position to have to do that. So if guys don't handle that the right way, then we have a much deeper issue. But I don't believe that we have a culture issue. We've just got to be able to translate the stuff that we prepare, we talk about, and do on a consistent basis. We've got to translate it to game day.\"\n\nThe next game day comes in nine days, when they face the Panthers for the first of two meetings in the final three weeks of the season, with a visit to Miami in between.\n\nWin them all, and tonight's outcome will become a faded memory. Fail to deliver, and the Week 15 Thursday night could be haunting a lot more people than Baker Mayfield.",

    "fullText": "According to Jeff Kassouf of ESPN, the NWSL board of governors have approved a new roster mechanism that would allow select star players to be paid above the current salary cap.\n\nBehind the scenes, it has been dubbed “High Impact Player.” This would allow teams to spend up to $1 million over the salary cap on megastar players while only incurring a small portion of that salary as a cap hit.\n\nThe NWSLPA would still need to review it due to the current collective bargaining agreement, requiring consultation due to potential salary cap changes.\n\nIt is still unclear on what qualifications a player must check off to qualify for this. However, Kassouf mentions rankings on lists like the Ballon d’Or, appearances on the NWSL Best XI, or USWNT minutes earned (recent years). It also requires commercial benchmarks as well – which has not been clarified.\n\nWith the NWSL board convening next week for their end-of-the-year meeting, could this be done in time for Trinity Rodman to re-sign and remain with Washington Spirit, or is too late?\n\nNothing is finalized yet, but it does seem very close.",

And in terms of score predictions, he is one of those who I will always go to when I want to see what people are saying about the game, because he has a pretty decent track record of calling these games spot on.\n\nWe all know the drill right now, Enzo Maresca and Chelsea are in a bit of a slump after failing to win any of their last four games in all competitions. As a result, they have dropped to 5th in the Premier League, and 13th in the Champions League.\n\nIt’s safe to say that this game against Everton now on Saturday afternoon, has become a very big game for Maresca, the players, and everyone at Chelsea. They need to win, it has to be seen as a must win now.\n\nPaul Merson worried about Chelsea on Sky Sports.\n\nWriting for Sportskeeda, Merson says:\n\n“Everton have looked good in recent weeks, apart from that shocking loss at home to Newcastle United. They went to Bournemouth and won quite comfortably – something Chelsea failed to do in their last league game. If Maresca wins this game, he can play his fringe players in the Carabao Cup quarter-final against Cardiff City on Tuesday. But if he doesn’t, he will be forced to play his strongest team in that game.\n\n“Moises Caicedo is unavailable for this match. I’m still going to back Chelsea for the win. But I must admit that I went with Chelsea mainly because I support them. This will be a tight game.\n\n“Prediction: Chelsea 2-1 Everton.”",

Any policy change would have to be approved by the NWSL Players Association.\n\nDetails about the new mechanism were not available but it would help teams sign and retain top players while still maintaining the NWSL's salary cap.\n\nThe issue has attracted attention in the past two weeks as the Washington Spirit have sought to re-sign Trinity Rodman, one of the league's biggest stars.\n\nThe Spirit and Rodman struck a multiyear deal last week that was vetoed by the league.

Rodman, who won a gold medal with the United States at the Paris Olympics, has been drawing interest from European teams that don’t have the same salary restrictions.\n\nThe NWSL’s salary cap is $3.5 million for each team for the 2026 season, although it will rise each year until it hits $5.1 million in 2030.\n\nThe union did not provide specifics about the offer to Rodman, but said the compensation structure fit within the salary cap and was calculated to include team revenue share.\n\nThe league can raise the salary cap at any time, the union has maintained.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "fullText": "Panthers’ Jaycee Horn upgraded on injury report before Saints game appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Carolina Panthers had a perfect Thursday practice, with all injured players fully participating before the Week 15 games versus the New Orleans Saints. Most notably, cornerback Jaycee Horn practiced fully for the first time since suffering a concussion during Carolina’s 20-9 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in week 12, still advancing through the NFL’s five-step protocol.\n\nAfter Wednesday’s limited practice, Horn took a major step forward in Thursday’s practice. Head coach Dave Canales stated earlier in the week that the 26-year-old is on track to return Sunday. However, he must still receive clearance from an independent neurologist before rejoining the starting lineup.\n\nThe Panthers’ latest injury report was as clean as it could get. All 53 players on the active roster were on the field Thursday, and all five players listed, including Horn, inside linebacker Claudin Cherelus (concussion), center Cade Mays (ankle), linebacker Christian Rozeboom (hip/hamstring), and safety Lathan Ransom (thumb), were full participants.\n\nHorn’s return couldn’t come at a better time for the 7–6 Panthers, who are tied with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at the top of the NFC South as the playoff push heats up. Carolina returns from its bye week after a dramatic 31–28 win over the Los Angeles Rams, a game in which the defense forced three turnovers, including a pick-six and a game-sealing fumble. Horn did not play in that matchup but has been one of the team’s most impactful defenders throughout the season.\n\nIn 12 games, Horn has produced five interceptions, the second-most in the NFC, and six pass breakups with 15 tackles. His performance has made him the leading Pro Bowl vote-getter among cornerbacks, positioning him for his second straight Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nThe fifth-year defensive back has also earned strong recognition from across the league. Before Carolina’s Week 12 matchup, San Francisco 49ers star Christian McCaffrey praised Horn’s ability, a sentiment reinforced when Horn recorded two first-half interceptions in that game before exiting with a concussion. Defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, now in his third season with the Panthers, has also acknowledged Horn’s continued development after injuries limited him to 29 missed games over his first three years.\n\nCarolina now focuses on a decisive rematch with 3–10 New Orleans, who handed them a 17–7 loss in Week 10. Horn’s return could be just what the Panthers need as they chase their first division title since 2015.",

    "description": "The Cleveland Cavaliers will be without two key players for the fifth straight game, as the team takes on the Washington Wizards on the road.",
    "fullText": "Two key Cavs players ruled out vs. Wizards, but there’s a positive update appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers will not have Jarrett Allen and Sam Merrill for Friday’s road matchup against the Washington Wizards, extending their absences and leaving the wine and gold without those two key players for the fifth straight game. Despite the team ruling them out, however, both have made progress this week.\n\nAfter Thursday’s practice, Merrill was wearing a wrap partially on his right hand while going through a workout.\n\n“Really good news,” Cavs head coach Kenny Atkinson said, glancing over at Merrill dribbling against two of his assistant coaches. “[He’s] actually shooting with his shooting hand, which is a pleasant sight to see.”\n\nBefore that, Merrill hadn’t been able to do anything with his right hand, which has been swollen and sprained since a reach-in attempt on Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo in mid-November. There is nothing structurally wrong with it, but Cleveland’s swingman hadn’t been able to catch or shoot. At least now he’s showing the ability to do one of those things.\n\nAllen only participated in half of the Cavs’ latest practice and didn’t take full-on contact. Unfortunately, that is a downgrade from Tuesday afternoon’s session where he did everything. Allen has been dealing with two separate finger injuries on each hand, with his left ring finger fractured and his right third finger strained.\n\nIn addition to Merrill and Allen, Cleveland veteran forward Larry Nance Jr. was getting shots up after practice at the near court with a wrap on his right calf.\n\nAtkinson also spoke about Max Strus’ return status, which hasn’t changed from the three-to-four months the organization initially estimated as the recovery time post-surgery.\n\n“Just kind of no update in terms of, ‘Hey, it’s gonna be faster or slower,'” Atkinson said. “Same timeline. I think he’s in a good way in terms of his recovery.”\n\nStrus is making his way back from a Jones fracture in his left foot, while Merrill and Allen are inching closer to coming back to the floor.",

    "description": "Tigres pounced on a mistake from Hugo Gonzalez, who up to that point saved Toluca from a much worse scoreline.",
    "fullText": "Tigres dominated the game as Toluca failed to make any kind of impact. They were totally lost and everything will be on the line at home on Sunday. Tigres was aggressive and will need to maintain that and a 1-0 scoreline as they head to what is known as “El Infierno” as they look for the ninth Liga MX title.\n\nEven before the game started the environment was electrifying as the fans at “El Volcan” were loud as they cheered on their team. Screams of “La U!” “La U!” “La U!” rang out for all of Nuevo Leon to hear.\n\nThe home side got all the action started within seconds as Angel Correa got a chance as he made his way towards the ball but Hugo Gonzalez got to it first. A minute later Toluca looked for their opening chance as Jesus Gallardo sent a pass into the box intended for Paulinho but the Tigres defense was able to defend the ball out before it reached the Portuguese. A few minutes later Correa was fouled outside of the box and Diego Lainez took the shot but the ball went just over the crossbar. 15 minutes later and the game was all Tigres as Toluca was unable to get comfortable the first bit of the match. Goalkeeper Hugo Sanchez had to make multiple stops in the first half to keep the clean sheet. The first stop came in the 18th minute when Jesus Garza took a shot at goal that Gonzalez had to send over the crossbar. A minute later Gonzalez had to make another save from Correa. 30 minutes later Correa was fouled outside of the box and Lainez stepped up to take the shot that Gonzalez sent up and over the bar. His defense was able to get the ball out of danger on the following corner. As the first half came to a close Toluca had attempted to make their way up the field but any attempt was broken down. The Diablos had a difficult time stringing passes together and their star forward and midfielder were nowhere to be seen. The visitors were more than happy for halftime as they had a lot to work on in the second half. In 45 minutes Toluca was unable to register any shots while Tigres had seven of them and all of their chances up top were dangerous.\n\nTo start the second half neither of the teams made any changes to their lineups. This was confusing for Toluca as they needed a change but Antonio Mohamed decided to wait. Just like the first half, Tigres opened with a bang.\n\n¡¡¡Dale, dale Angelito!!! Correa abre el marcador en la Gran Final del Futbol Mexicano. 🪽 pic.twitter.com/W9jrog0o1p\n\n— Club Tigres 🐯 (@TigresOficial) December 12, 2025\n\nHugo Gonzalez had been a hero in the first half but one mistake cost it all for them. As he attempted to restart play from the back, he sent a pass to Lainez instead of his teammate and the winger took advantage. He passed the ball to an open Correa who made his way inside the box and sent the ball into the back of the net. Gonzalez quickly went from hero to villain with one grave error. On the next play Toluca was close to equalizing as Jesus Angulo took a shot at goal as he sent the ball between Nahuel Guzman’s open legs but Garza was able to kick the ball out of danger before it crossed the line. Just like that, Tigres was saved. It wasn’t until the 57th minute that Mohamed decided to make some changes. Angulo and Bruno Mendez were subbed off for Robert Morales and Diego Barbosa. Taking out Angulo was a questionable decision as it did not make any sense. Yes, Angulo had some difficulty on the field but so did everyone else and he was the one who had their most dangerous play of the night. Mohamed can be put on the list of coaches who made mistakes in the final. By the 60th minute Toluca had yet to break through the Tigres defense. The home side was holding up well as their defense was unbreakable even though they had one moment of weakness in the beginning of the half. It wasn’t until the 71st minute when Guido Pizarro made his first change of the night. Nicolas Ibañez came on for André-Pierre Gignac who might have seen his last game at “El Volcan” as rumors have swirled of his retirement even though he has six months left in his contract.\n\nIn the 69th minute Barbosa found himself with a shot from distance that went over the crossbar after his teammates found themselves with no open angel. A few minutes later Mohamed made another change as he brought on Helinho for Paulinho hoping the Brazilian would be the spark the team desperately needed. Minutes later Toluca did have a big chance when Morales had a big chance at goal but the ball went over the crossbar after a pass from Castro. Minutes later Tigres made another change as Juan Brunetta was subbed out for Uriel Antuna. Antuna was supposed to be an impact signing for Tigres but so far he has been a bust as he had, up to that point, not had any minutes in the liguilla. 90 seconds later Tigres were dealt some bad news as Pizarro had to make an unexpected change as Angulo was subbed off for Javier Anquino as Angulo was seen limping of the field and one of the medical assistants had to help him to the bench. As the game headed into stoppage time it was evident that Toluca was frustrated with how the game had gone. Morales then made a big mistake as frustration boiled over and he kicked Joaquim Henrique in his private area. The action did not have to go to VAR as the referee saw it happen and gave Morales a direct red card. Morales will now miss the final game at home where his teammates will attempt to make a comeback to defend their title.\n\nToluca was nowhere to be seen as Tigres dominated the game. The home side did not ease their foot off the gas pedal as they had many chances to seal the deal all game long. While Hugo Gonzalez did make an expensive error, if not for him the scoreline would have been different. With a slender lead, Tigres will now travel to “El Infierno” where Toluca will do everything in their power to be crowned bicampeones while Tigres will do everything they can to make sure Gignac leaves with another trophy.",

    "description": "We're a few days out from the game now… how are your nerves? Are you confident? How are you feeling about the game? Are you looking forward to it?",
    "fullText": "I feel just how I felt about the play-off final… calm, confident, and assured.\n\nAs we’ve seen already this season, the quality of football we play with the caliber of players we possess has given the league’s top teams the runaround already.\n\nEveryone related to Sunderland AFC knows how much this game means to the club, they don’t need reminding of it, and come kick-off, I’m sure RLB will not doubt a rousing team talk supported by her rock-solid leader on the pitch, Granit Xhaka – with his experience in high intensity games, he’s sure to be a calming influence on the pitch.\n\nI said at the start I’m ’confident’. Why? Because of our current home record, the fact that we’ve evolved as a club and team, and the manager at the helm.\n\nWould I say I’m nervous? Probably not. More anxious as I just can’t wait for kick off!\n\nI’m suitably calm. Firstly, I know that this team has proven itself in so many different scenarios, whether that be the opening game of the Premier League season or more challenging away days, like Stamford Bridge.\n\nHowever, it’s more than that. I know that this team is built differently. It’s not the same walkover that we saw under the dreaded Michael Beale. The gap between the two teams isn’t as pronounced as it once was, thanks to superb recruitment and scouting from Speakman and others.\n\nI’m calm, though, because of the mentality of this team, and that’s led by one man: Granit Xhaka. We’ve already seen how he’s responded to performances that have fallen below expectations. He understands the significance of this game. As a result, the rest of the team is under no illusions either.\n\nMarry that with our home form and atmosphere that we’ve been able to generate, and you have a brilliant melting pot. We all know how important this game is. Obviously, when kick-off nears on the day, I’ll be a bit jittery, but this is Sunderland AFC, and I have full faith in this manager and in this group of players.\n\nFor me, this is a really hard one to place; I’m confident, but I’m also feverish with nerves, although I’m not entirely sure why.\n\nMy confidence is born not from any comparison I have made with Newcastle since the season began, but is entirely predicated on the back of our own ability. This is a team of warriors, of great experience and also of great ability. So far this season, we have comfortably held our own in all but one game and have regularly upset the apple cart when it comes to aspersions cast upon promoted teams.\n\nThe recent history of this side is another confidence booster, with Regis Le Bris preparing the lads perfectly for play-off success and success in the Premier League, with eye-catching performances aplenty despite not being even halfway through the season.\n\nI have total faith in the lads, the leadership, and the management in judging this game to perfection, which no doubt required, which is why my nervousness — although it cannot be helped — seems rather misplaced and in contradiction to the above statements.\n\nPerhaps the nervousness is born from the lack of control over the situation and the step into the unknown that brings on such nervousness, or perhaps it is just the desire to win, which adds another, more complicated element to this game.\n\nWhatever happens will happen, and whilst not winning feels unthinkable, if it is to be the case, it will not define our season nor what has come before it, and one would hope the only effect after the fact should be a positive one.\n\nOverall, my emotions lurch fromone extreme to the other, but the only consistency is the knowledge that every player entrusted to take to the pitch on Sunday will give their absolute all – and ultimately, so long as we give the best version of ourselves, that is enough for me.\n\nI think any fan who says they aren’t nervous is lying!\n\nIt is important on so many levels. We need to bounce back from last weekend. We were beaten by a very good City team, who beat Real Madrid in Spain this week to prove that.\n\nI thought we were well in the game until the two quick goals, and had a couple of decent chances at 2-0.\n\nWith several of the squad heading to Africa next week, we would need to pick up the momentum again, whoever we were playing. The unbeaten home record will serve us so well this season, and by God, we need to keep it going on Sunday. Three points and we can head into Christmas on good heart.\n\nNewcastle have been hit and miss, and the atmosphere will be electric. If we get on the front foot early, it could be a great afternoon to be in red and white.\n\nForget the bragging rights — we have every reason to approach the game with a view that we can win it.\n\nIt won’t stop me stressing right up to 2pm Sunday, though!",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have added Tyler Adams to their midfield shortlist as they continue their search for Premier League-proven signings.\n\nIndeed, the Bournemouth star, according to Ben Jacobs (via The United Stand), is a ‘new name’ amongst INEOS’ targets to reinforce Ruben Amorim’s ranks in the middle of the park.\n\n(Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nThere is a ‘possibility’ he departs the Vitality Stadium next year and, despite being two months away from his 27th birthday and therefore slightly older than the players United usually consider, it’s thought he might be a more ‘affordable’ option.\n\nThat’s because United’s alternative targets, such as Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba, could cost well above £100 million if they eventually depart their respective clubs.\n\nAdams has racked up 69 Premier League appearances in his career, 24 of which came during his spell with Leeds United.\n\n(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nThe United States international spent just a year at Elland Road before agreeing to join the Cherries on a five-year deal, and he has since played a vital role at the heart of the team.\n\nFrom now until the end of the campaign, he’ll be focusing on being in his best form and staying fit in the build-up to next year’s World Cup, given America is one of the three host nations and he will have the chance to impress on the biggest stage of all on home soil.\n\n“Man United like Tyler Adams’ character – he’s well-liked by his teammates, and has leadership qualities that are expected to show in the World Cup,” added Jacobs.\n\nShould United choose to wait until the summer window, it’s likely Adams’ prospective arrival would come around the time Casemiro departed – unless the veteran is offered a new short-term deal on reduced terms.\n\n‘Affordable’ PL star is a ‘new name’ on INEOS’ shortlist as he’s tipped for 2026 transfer\n\nConfirmed: Man Utd star who’s played nine games this season will miss up to a month of action over festive period\n\nEx-Sporting Director confirms 17 G/A Man Utd man almost signed for Barcelona before OT move",

    "fullText": "The revised schedule for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) is set to affect nearly every Premier League team, with the tournament set to run from December 21 until January 18.\n\nChelsea, Leeds United, Bournemouth, Newcastle United, Aston Villa, and title favourites Arsenal are the only teams that do not have any players jetting off to Morocco in a few weeks.\n\nHowever, 2025/26 surprise package Sunderland and relegation-battling Wolverhampton Wanderers are among the teams that will lose the most players to the tournament.\n\nThese players could miss up to six games in all competitions, depending on how their countries perform at AFCON 2025. Read on as we look at which teams are due to lose players this month.\n\nSunderland have taken the Premier League by storm this season, but that momentum could take a nose-dive over the festive period with the Black Cats set to lose seven players to AFCON.\n\nMorocco winger Chemsdine Talbi, Senegal midfielder Habib Diarra, Mozambique full-back Reinildo, Burkina Faso forward Bertrand Traore and DR Congo pair Arthur Masuaku and Noah Sadiki are all set to represent their countries this winter.\n\nWolves have only taken two points from 15 league games and are on course to record the worst point tally in Premier League history.\n\nHowever, the Midlands club could lose just two players to AFCON, with only Zimbabwe midfielder Tawanda Chirewa and Ivory Coast defender Emmanuel Agbadou set to jet off to Morocco.\n\nManchester United seem to have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim, but they’ll be without Cameroon forward Bryan Mbeumo, Ivory Coast winger Amad Diallo, and Morocco’s Noussair Mazraoui over the festive period.\n\nFulham has become a safe haven for Nigerian players over the past couple of years, but Marco Silva will have to get through the festive period without midfielder Alex Iwobi, defender Calvin Bassey, and winger Samuel Chukwueze.\n\nIwobi and Bassey are first-team regulars for the Cottagers, while Chukwueze’s recent form has made him more popular among the fans at the West London club.\n\nRelegation battling Burnley will lose three players to AFCON, with former England Under-21 defender Axel Tuanzebe set to feature for DR Congo at the tournament.\n\nStriker Lyle Foster and midfielder Hannibal Mejbri have also been called up by South Africa and Tunisia, respectively.\n\nNottingham Forest have been on the upswing since Sean Dyche stepped in, but they’re also set to be affected by AFCON, with two players set to leave the squad.\n\nIvory Coast duo Ibrahim Sangare and Willy Boly have been called up, but Nigerian internationals Ola Aina and Taiwo Awoniyi have been left out.\n\nEverton have raised a few eyebrows this season as they look to push for a place in Europe under David Moyes’ leadership.\n\nThey’ll have to further those ambitions without Senegalese duo Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye at least through the festive period.\n\nBrentford are poised to lose two players to AFCON.\n\nClub-record signing Dango Ouattara will be on duty with Burkina Faso, while Frank Onyeka has been named in the Nigerian squad despite playing just 88 minutes of Premier League football for the Bees so far this season.\n\nTitle-chasing Manchester City will lose Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush and Algerian defender Rayan Ait-Nouri to AFCON.\n\nFortunately for Pep Guardiola’s side, neither of those players have managed to establish themselves as first-team regulars at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nTottenham Hotspur will miss two midfielders during the AFCON tournament, with Pape Matar Sarr and Yves Bissouma set to represent Senegal and Mali, respectively.\n\nBissouma has had his issues off the pitch and is yet to play a single minute for Spurs, but that hasn’t affected his place in the national team.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo has overseen a resurgence at West Ham United that has improved their chances of avoiding relegation.\n\nHowever, he has to find a solution to his defensive line-up with starting full-backs Aaron Wan-Bissaka and El Hadji Malick Diouf set to feature for DR Congo and Senegal, respectively.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion must find a way to cope without highly sought-after midfielder Carlos Baleba, who is set to represent Cameroon at AFCON.\n\nThe 21-year-old has started nearly every game for Brighton this season.\n\nFA Cup holders Crystal Palace have a few African players on their roster, but Oliver Glasner’s side will only lose Ismaila Sarr to AFCON.\n\nNevertheless, it’ll be a huge blow considering Sarr has scored eight goals in all competitions for the Eagles this season.\n\nLiverpool fans may be happy to see the back of Mohamed Salah, who is set to join the Egyptian national team at AFCON after his blockbuster interview.\n\nHe has already been isolated from the Liverpool squad, and his future at the club could be decided in the coming weeks.",

    "fullText": "As I was growing up, a lot of songs and chants which were commonplace around Roker have since disappeared.\n\n“We hate Nottingham Forest, we hate Liverpool too (and Leicester)\nWe hate Man United, but Sunderland we love you”\n\nTo the tune of “Land of Hope and Glory”, fans could obviously insert different teams to suit.\n\nOne of our most missed tunes is “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”, sung to the Christmas carol of the same name. I don’t hear it at our place anymore, but I’ve heard it at Mags matches. It stems from the times when derbies were most often held on New Year’s Day and Easter Sunday. It goes like this:\n\n“Hark now hear the Sun’l’nd sing,\nThe Mags have ran away.\nAnd we shall fight for evermore,\nBecause of New Year’s Day”\n\nAnd the Mags transpose the names of the teams. Interestingly still singing “the Sunderland ran away” rather than “the Mackems ran away”.\n\nIt’s a bit of a myth that derbies were often played on New Year’s Day, as I can only see three instances of the fixture taking place then. Firstly in 1904, then 1980, and most recently in 1985.\n\nThis latter date was my first taste of the derby – and an away one, to boot. I had managed to get my sweaty 19-year-old hands on a ticket, and me mam organised family friends to take me there and back from Washington. As there’s never any public transport on New Year’s Day in the north-east. Imagine my dismay when I discovered these so-called friends were all Mags.\n\nWe were in dismal form running up to the game, having lost our previous five out of six games.\n\nLen Ashurst was the manager and was making a pig’s ear of the season after chairman Tom Cowie had despatched Alan Durban the previous season. The bulk of Durban’s team remained, with Chris Turner, Barry Venison, Nick Pickering, Colin West, Mark Proctor, and John Cooke all playing. Ashurst had brought in Peter Daniel, Gary Bennett, Steve Berry, and Howard Gayle the previous summer.\n\nThe atmosphere was raucous and Jackie Charlton’s Newcastle set about us right from the off. Bennett set the tone, getting booked in the first minute. It wasn’t long before Peter Beardsley opened the scoring on the quarter-hour, slipping the ball under Turner at the Leazes End.\n\nThe reception given to our two black players (Gary Bennett and Howard Gayle) was disgusting. Neither player could cope with the extreme provocation, each being sent off due to two yellow cards. The number of bananas on the pitch was astonishing to a wet-behind-the-ears woke lad like me.\n\nBeardsley completed his hat-trick on 81 minutes, with Colin West offering a consolation for the red-and-whites. It could have been worse as Turner saved a second penalty from Beardsley on 59 minutes.\n\nNeedless to say, the resulting trip back to Washy was a miserable one I will never forget.\n\nThankfully, I have had happier visits to St James’ Park since, being there to witness Tommy Sørensen save Alan Shearer’s penalty in November 2000 — but this baptism to the Tyne-Wear derby adds to my hatred of the black-and-whites and why I will never want to see them do well.",

    "fullText": "I was already in love with Sunderland by the 5th of April 2015, but after that day, I was head over heels.\n\nI remember rushing to the Stadium after playing for my football team in the morning. It was my first taste of the Wear-Tyne derby, but I was already very aware of its importance. Even if I didn’t know before, just the atmosphere in the ground would have told me that. It was different to anything I had experienced before. There was an extra layer of tension, like the stadium was humming with electricity.\n\nI remember the goal so vividly. It is burnt into my mind. It’s one of my earliest memories of Sunderland and definitely one of my favourites too. I am looking at the picture of the goal on my wall as I write this. It’s easily the best goal I’ve seen live at the Stadium of Light, intensified by the occasion.\n\nEverything about it was perfect. The timing — it being the last kick of the first half. The commentary — some of Martin Tyler’s most iconic and excellent work. The unexpectedness — how it came from nothing, just a hopeful flick from Fletcher. The brilliance of it – the technique, power and talent it takes to put a dropping ball into the top corner is hard to understand. The legacy of it – here I am, almost 11 years later, talking about how it made me fall in love with the club. I especially love how it came to be the difference at full-time. A goal like that should be a game-winner, particularly in a game like that.\n\nAs you might expect, 7-year-old me was consequently infatuated with both the club and Jermain Defoe. He was, is, and will remain one of my favourite players to play for our club. He has described it as the best goal he scored in his career, elevating it, considering his magnificent goal catalogue. Defoe even admitted that it almost made him cry. He very clearly loves the club, that game and that goal.\n\nIt is in games like this where legends are made. It is in games like this where players write their name into a club’s history. It is in games like this where a young fan in the stands falls in love with a club.",

    "description": "Fernando Mendoza has emerged as the top quarterback prospect for the first round after a Heisman-finalist season.",
    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza mock draft projection: Will Indiana QB go No. 1 overall in 2026 NFL Draft? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza wasn't expected to be the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft. Following his surprise Heisman Trophy-caliber 2025 season at Indiana, however, now he will be taken high in the first round as the first QB off the board on April 23.\n\nWhy has Mendoza shot up draft boards for his play, and what's his pro outlook?\n\nHere's a profile of the Hoosiers passer, including what teams are most likely to draft him:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Fernando Mendoza for the Heisman\n\nMendoza (6-5, 225) has the ideal size as a strong pocket passer. The Cal transfer and Miami high school product was a hit in Curt Cignetti's dynamic offense. He's developed all the physical and mental qualities to be a top-10 pick for a QB-needy team.\n\nMendoza is very accurate with his short-to-intermediate passing. He is a good decision-maker who processes the field well. When he has a clean pocket, he can make all the throws. He also hangs tough in the pocket when facing pressure and is fearless in his execution. Mendoza is an aggressive thrower, but also avoids forcing the ball into coverage. He can zip it to take shots, but also adjust to show touch on passes when needed.\n\nMendoza can scramble for yardage when the defense breaks down and his big frame can help him on quarterback sneaks, but he won't add an element of plus athleticism to a team, as he's far less comfortable throwing on the run and won't provide any designed support for the running game. He will need to learn better how to dissect more complex pressure and coverage schemes in the NFL.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nWith the Giants (Jaxson Dart) and Titans (Cam Ward) taking first-round QBs in 2025, it's pretty clear where Mendoza might be headed. Here are the five teams to watch most to draft him\n\nWith Chip Kelly gone from the offense, Pete Carroll can look for a new OC with a pocket passer in mind to replace Geno Smith. It doesn't hurt that Mendoza's Big Ten clutch style would get a stamp of approval from part-owner Tom Brady.\n\nThe Browns will learn more about Shedeur Sanders for the rest of the 2025 season to see whether the rookie fifth-rounder deserves a more extended look to start in '26. If not, Cleveland would be firm play to try again at franchise QB.\n\nMORE: Where Fernando Mendoza projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nWill the Saints see enough from Tyler Shough to make a call either way on the second-round rookie QB? If they want to go higher into the draft pool for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, Mendoza has the Dak Prescott-like pocket qualities to execute his offense well.\n\nAaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw the success of pocket-passing winning with Jared Goff (6-4, 217) in Detroit and may want to go that route to try again to strengthen the position for the long haul.\n\nThe Cardinals are heading to part ways with Kyler Murray and there might be some offensive coaching changes in store, too. Mendoza, Marvin Harrison Jr., Trey McBride and Michael Wilson would make for a good young passing game foundation.",

    "title": "On This Day (12 Dec 1995): ‘Newcastle United Have Got Their Sums Wrong’ Says Murray",
    "description": "A 29,000 capacity Stadium of Light? It was almost the case, but for our neighbours' mistakes. And Peter Reid.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his tenure as Sunderland chairman, Bob Murray always seemed to be driven – almost in equal measure – by a desire for Sunderland to do well, combined with a deep-rooted dislike of ‘them up the road’.\n\nTo be fair, that’s not too different from many Sunderland supporters, particularly those raised in halfy-half places like Consett, as Murray was.\n\nThe first few years of Murray’s chairmanship were stifled by the ongoing dispute with Barry Batey, but as the early 90s progressed, a new stadium was high on the to-do list. While many wanted to keep Sunderland at Roker Park, it was deemed an undesirable path to explore. While the ground was hemmed in by housing on three sides, the car park at the front of the Main Stand did offer scope to build something bigger – however it would have come at a significant cost, and Murray’s mind was firmly set elsewhere.\n\nThe Wembley of the North didn’t progress, but a new development at Monkwearmouth did – and it’s often forgotten that the original plans for the new ground were significantly different to what we know and love today.\n\nOn this day 30 years ago, Murray announced the original 29,000 capacity footprint for the new stadium (with provision for it to be extended to 34,000) was to be extended to an initial 40,000-plus.\n\nAnd he suggested that the decision to extend the ambition of the stadium was down to both Newcastle and Middlesbrough ‘getting it wrong’.\n\nTo the south, Middlesbrough – with a capacity of under 30,000 – were having to turn people away from their new Cellnet Stadium, while to the north, Newcastle’s redevelopment had left them with a capacity of just 36,000. And the fabled waiting list of 12,000, of course.\n\nWe have learned from Middlesbrough and Newcastle since we first submitted our plans for our new Wearmouth Stadium. Middlesbrough can only extend by a couple of thousand and Newcastle have obviously got their sums wrong. \nNewcastle have built a stadium for today, not for tomorrow. And there will be no bonds or debentures here. We want as many ordinary football fans to get into our ground as is possible.\n\nWith the extended capacity, the cost of the new stadium had risen from £12m to £14m, and the revised plans were 15 metres higher and wider than the originals, with the pitch dropped into the ground to create much of the space the additional capacity demanded. The new ground was set to be the fifth-largest in the country – only Manchester United, Leeds, Liverpool, and Everton had capacities over 40,000 at this point. Murray said the desire to capitalise on a huge population, and ensure as many supporters as possible could get access to the club, were also key motivators.\n\nWearside has the largest concentration of population between Leeds and Edinburgh, and we have been encouraged to increase our capacity if we want to compete.\n\nI would not wish to see any loyal Sunderland supporters become a casualty of success, either in terms of access to the club or affordability.\n\nWe do not want to see Wearsiders locked out of the new stadium. We must learn from the experiences of other clubs and not copy their mistakes.\n\nIn good local journalism fashion, The Journal gave Newcastle a right of reply – and while former Roker season ticket holder Sir John Hall wasn’t available for comment, a chap by the name of Mike Elrick ‘hit back!’.\n\nMr Murray is entitled to his opinion, but we aren’t going to get involved in a slanging match.\n\nThe fact is we could probably fill a 50,000 capacity stadium with planning permission, or if it was possible in engineering terms.\n\nSunderland’s on-field performances under new manager Peter Reid were surely giving Murray confidence in the new stadium project, and the input on the buzz around the place created by Reid cannot be underestimated here.\n\nIt would have been interesting to see whether the desire, or funding, for the ‘new’ new stadium would have been as great if we’d been mid-table at this point in the season, regardless of what was happening up or down the road.\n\nAs it was, we were top of the league after beating Millwall 6-0 at home, and were heading to Reading in buoyant mood as we eventually made our way to the title.\n\nGiven that, on this day in 1995, club officials were preparing the planning application for the extended capacity, and four construction companies had just been asked to tender on the construction of the new ground, it’s incredible to think that, just over 18 months later, Status Quo were flying into town to get the new place rocking…",

MacKinnon finished the night with a goal and an assist.\n\nBrock Nelson, Gavin Brindley, and Sam Malinski each contributed a goal and an assist for Colorado, while Artturi Lehkonen and Gabe Landeskog also found the back of the net.

Florida capitalized on its second shot of the night when Gregor broke into the zone off a feed from Seth Jones, accelerated down the left wing, and beat his former San Jose Sharks teammate Blackwood short side. Devon Toews and Samuel Girard were a step late closing in, and the game was tied.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe went to the box for slashing Parker Kelly into the boards, but the Avalanche failed to convert on the power play.\n\nParker Kelly gets slashed and crashes into the boards.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe will go to the box.

It was a smart penalty to take, and the Avs killed it off to the delight of the crowd.\n\nNelson restored the lead with 1:30 left in the period, cleaning up a rebound from a Cale Makar shot that bounced off Tarasov. It was Nelson’s twelfth of the season and gave Colorado a 2–1 advantage.\n\nAt 5:06 of the middle frame, Brindley scored in his return from a 10-game absence due to a lower-body injury.

The officials missed a clear tripping call on Nelson when Verhaeghe took his legs out in the dying seconds of the man advantage.\n\nFlorida was soon back in the box anyway, as Samoskevich tripped Brindley. Necas appeared to score on the ensuing power play, but the goal was overturned for offside. Colorado carried a four-goal lead into the intermission with fifty-two seconds remaining on the man advantage.\n\nVerhaeghe had a goal wiped out nearly five minutes into the period after officials ruled he deliberately kicked the puck in. The review was brief and the call stood.\n\nLandeskog made it 6–1 at 6:18, jamming in a loose puck after Josh Manson’s shot was redirected by Necas and bounced off Tarasov’s pad. Landeskog jumped on the rebound at the back door and finished the play.\n\nREBOUND SCORE!!!\n\nIt's GABE LANDESKOG\n\n6-1 Colorado#goavsgo #avs @thehockeynews\n\n— Ryan O'Hara (@OHaraSports) December 12, 2025\n\nSamoskevich scored with just under seven minutes remaining in regulation on a beautiful sequence set up by crisp passes from A.J.

    "fullText": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Rasmus Dahlin and Tage Thompson each had a goal and an assist, and the Buffalo Sabres beat the struggling Vancouver Canucks 3-2 on Thursday night.\n\nZach Benson also scored for the Sabres and Alex Lyon stopped 29 shots as Buffalo won its second straight following a three-game skid.\n\nKiefer Sherwood and Max Sasson scored for the Canucks, and Thatcher Demko made 12 saves in his return from a lower-body injury he suffered on Nov. 11. Vancouver has lost six of its last seven (1-5-1).\n\nSasson gave the Canucks a 2-1 lead 6:15 into the second, but Thompson tied it nearly 3 minutes later and Benson’s power-play goal with 5:14 to go in the period gave the Sabres the lead.\n\nVancouver fell to 1-13-0 when trailing after two periods.\n\nDahlin got the the Canucks on the scoreboard first, scoring 7 1/2 minutes into the game.\n\nSherwood tied it with 11 seconds remaining in the first to snap his 10-game goal-scoring drought with his team-high 13th of the season.\n\nThe Canucks were without star center Elias Pettersson, who missed a second straight game with an upper-body injury.\n\nThe Sabres were missing offensive powerhouse Alex Tuch due to illness. The right wing was tied with Thompson for the team lead in points (26) heading into the game. Trevor Kuntar slotted into the lineup, making his NHL debut one day after signing a one-year, two-way contract with Buffalo.\n\nSabres: At Seattle on Sunday night.\n\nCanucks: At New Jersey on Sunday to open a five-game trip.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

    "description": "TAMPA — The game was won, and the season was rescued. Until it wasn’t.",
    "fullText": "TAMPA — The game was won, and the season was rescued.\n\nMike Evans was a hero, Baker Mayfield was a gamer and Todd Bowles was a survivor.\n\nSole possession of first place once again belonged to the Bucs.\n\nIn their 50 years of football, this was not the first time the Bucs had blown a two-touchdown lead but, good gosh, Thursday night’s 29-28 loss to the Falcons certainly ranks among the most devastating collapses in franchise history.\n\nIt is absolutely accurate to say hope still remains and a division title is within reach if the Bucs win their final three games, but how do you believe in a team that doesn’t seem to believe in itself? How do you expect to beat the Panthers next week when you continually beat yourself?\n\nThis was not a comeback by Josh Allen and the Bills. It was not a last-minute miracle by Matthew Stafford and the Rams. This was a Falcons team with a 4-9 record that had lost every close game it had played, committed a ridiculous 19 penalties Thursday night and was starting a 37-year-old backup quarterback.\n\nAnd that’s the result that could cost Bowles his job.\n\nThe normally mild-mannered Bucs coach went off-script with a profane postgame news conference that still did not match the enormity of this choke. He repeatedly called the outcome inexcusable and uncharacteristically lambasted his players before acknowledging that finger-pointing was not the way to go.\n\n“It’s inexcusable. We don’t make excuses,” Bowles said. “You’ve got to f--king care enough where this s--t hurts. It’s got to f--king mean something. It’s more than a job, it’s your f--king livelihood. How well do you know your job, how well can you do your job? You can’t sugarcoat that s--t. It was in-f--king-excusable. There is no f--king answer for it.\n\n“That’s what you tell them in the locker room. Look in the f--king mirror.”\n\nWere you inclined to point fingers, you would need to use both hands to adequately explain Thursday night’s shortcomings.\n\nMayfield threw a critical interception with 8:22 remaining that led to an Atlanta touchdown that cut Tampa Bay’s lead to 28-26.\n\n• With a chance to kill the clock in the final two minutes, the offensive line self-destructed. Bucky Irving was thrown for a 4-yard loss, Mayfield threw an incompletion and then was sacked on third down.\n\n• And a defense that has steadily deteriorated this season allowed quarterback Kirk Cousins to complete back-to-back passes on third and 28 to set up a game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n• “I didn’t execute enough,” Mayfield said. “When a quarterback doesn’t execute enough in a tight game, you’re not going to win.”\n\nWhile the blame can be spread from offense to defense to special teams, Bowles will take the majority of the hits. At least as far as the average fan is concerned. It won’t matter that injuries decimated the Bucs at midseason. It won’t matter that a pass rusher was not acquired in the offseason. It won’t matter that he’s led the Bucs to three consecutive NFC South crowns.\n\nThe bottom line is the Bucs are in danger of ruining a 5-1 start to the season, and that almost always means a head coach takes the blame.\n\nA generation ago, Jon Gruden’s time in Tampa Bay ended when the Bucs lost four consecutive games in December after starting the season at 9-3.\n\nIs it possible that Bowles and the Bucs will get a reprieve by winning their final three games?\n\nPerhaps, but that seems like a tall order right now.\n\nAnd, even then, there will be pressure to win a playoff game after losing being one-and-done twice in the past three seasons.\n\n“We understand what’s happening,” Bowles said. “We know exactly what’s happening. We’ve got to execute better. If you have to execute better, you definitely have to coach better.”\n\nThe Bucs have now dropped five of their last six games, including back-to-back losses at home to the hapless Saints and Falcons.\n\nTwo months ago, Mayfield looked like an MVP candidate and Bowles seemed to justify the contract extension he got in the offseason.\n\nAnd now they are one loss away from finishing one of the most disheartening collapses ever seen.\n\nAs the man said, it’s inexcusable.\n\nJohn Romano can be reached at jromano@tampabay.com.

    "description": "Meta's lines of code, shared meals, a familiar melodies, and the All the Smoke podcast, are finding ways to bring people together by a common thread.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES –– Indelible connections often unassumingly begin. They make their marks on out hearts and psyches with the whisper of a question: What if?\n\nWhat if a link could be more than a link?\n\nWhat if sharing a favorite podcast episode felt less like a broadcast and more like an invitation?\n\nEarlier this month, Threads answered. Meta introduced features that let podcasters and their afficianados plant their flags, pinning their work to their profile with pride.\n\nThey made episode shares not just visible, but vibrant. This was the technical seed. But the true story is about the soil where it was planted.\n\nThis is about the community that formed around a restaurant called Somerville.\n\nTo cross its threshold was to slip through time. Its decoration is an homage to the loving spectral echoes of Black excellence speakeasies that defined the Harlem Renaissance. This was no mere venue; it was a vessel.\n\nWooden beams, skeletal and sincere, stretched overhead like the bare ribs of a great, welcoming beast, married to the soft glow of romantic lighting.\n\nThe air hummed with a latent energy, the quiet thrill of a secret too good to keep. Plush brown seats held bodies leaning in, not back. This was the clubhouse for a playground's elite, and on Thursday, the NBA was the conversation.\n\nOn delicate plates, the philosophy of connection was served in edible metaphors.\n\nScrumptious tuna tartare, a diminutive masterpiece, its ginger-soy dressing performing a delicate dance on the palate. A sesame ice cream cone waltzed in perfect, savory harmony with shallots and chives.\n\nTruffle-flavored popcorn bursts with umami —a complex chorus of garlic, pepper, and a unique woodsy blend—each bite a tiny explosion of crafted communion.\n\nAnd weaving through it all, the sultry, sinuous voice of Briana Washington at the piano, wrapping around ballads like \"A Lovely Day.\" This was the soundtrack of shared humanity.\n\nBecause some truths are universal. Food, music, sports—these are the ancient, unbreakable codes that bypass borders, beliefs, every arbitrary self-absorbed monument that we build.\n\nThey are the common tongue. And in this temple of that truth, Threads made its stand, not with a mere press release, but with a party.\n\nAt the center sat Connor Hayes, Head of Threads, a man whose love for basketball was the engine of this experiment. His was not a corporate passion. It was born in the upper deck of the old Boston Garden, a childhood etched with the struggles of a bad Celtics team and the singular obsession with a player like Ron Mercer.\n\n\"I've been watching…I could watch all 82 games of that team,\" Hayes said. His fan's heart still beats beneath a builder's hoodie.\n\nFor him, Threads was a chance to rebuild the digital arena as it should be: a \"second screen\" where the community's roar during a Wembanyama highlight feels electric, intimate.\n\n\"I have a ton of people that I've met through Threads who are also Celtics fans,\" Hayes shared, describing a group chat that spanned from the Philippines to Brazil. \"One person… made Joe Mazzulla magnets for everybody and mailed them to them. That's the kind of magic we're trying to create.\"\n\nHis vision is to formalize the fellowship fans have already forged. To add the flair of team loyalty, so \"you know who you're dealing with.\"\n\nTo move from hot takes to heartfelt bonds.\n\nThis event, Hayes noted, was about \"the intersection of podcasts that are growing, communities that are growing on Threads, and commentators that we think speak to us.\"\n\nAnd into this curated crucible stepped the day's hosts. Matt Barnes. Stephen Jackson. And their guest, the formidable, unfiltered Kendrick Perkins.\n\nThe podcast taping of \"All the Smoke\" became a séance.\n\nThe proverbial smoke cleared not to obscure, but to reveal.\n\nPerkins, the ESPN persona known for volcanic takes, softened into something more vulnerable, more valuable.\n\nHe spoke of the athlete's tunnel vision, a poignant regret that hung in the perfumed air.\n\n\"One of my biggest regrets as a player,\" Perkins confessed, \"we may pass people up, they may give us their business cards. We keep it moving… Now we're in this space… those business cards actually mean something.\"\n\nIt was a stunning admission of life deferred, of human connections missed in the single-minded pursuit of the game.\n\nHe dissected the alchemy of team chemistry not with cold stats, but with the warmth of memory. He shared where things went awry in Oklahoma City.\n\n\"After you won a championship, man, you think you was the reason why. Everybody in the locker room think they was the reason.\"\n\nHis analysis was layered, empathetic, and born of experience. This was the content Threads dreamed of housing: not just debate, but depth. Not just reaction, but reflection.\n\nMeta's Jocelyn Jones, from Threads, watched it fuse into her soft manifesto.\n\n\"We think that Threads can be the place,\" Jones said. \"Where's the conversation that happens around podcasts? There's not a natural place… So, like, why not there be a place for that to happen?\"\n\nSomerville was the answer. It was the \"why not.\"\n\nIt was the physical manifestation of a digital thesis: that discovery is not a fleeting feeling, that discussion is a meal, that community is a melody you feel in your bones.\n\nThe new features on the app are mere signposts. Still, this—this warmth, this whiskey-washed wisdom, the collective silence of onlookers who hung on to every word as \"Big Perk\" peeled back layers of his persona, exposing a vulnerable underbelly, was the destination.\n\nAs Meta updates their code, users of the platform will find convenants in their conversations.\n\nIn a room lit by the glow of screens and content creators, where common threads formed the smells of truffles and heritage wafted, uncommon connections.\n\nThe joy of discovery has found its home. And this, as they say, is just the opening act.",

    "fullText": "Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez has suffered his latest career setback.\n\nThe striker know as Chicharito joined the Red Devils from Mexican side Guadalajara in 2010.\n\nHe took to English football like a duck to water, scoring 20 times during his first season in which United were crowned league champions.\n\nThe Mexican would score a total of 59 goals in 157 matches for United, before leaving the club in 2015.\n\nHernandez moved to Real Madrid on loan in 2014 before spending time at Bayer Leverkusen, West Ham United and Sevilla.\n\nAfter his career in Europe ended, he played four seasons for LA Galaxy in the United States before returning to his native Mexico in 2023.\n\nNonetheless, he could not return to the goalscoring ways that defined the majority of his career, only finding the net three times in 31 matches over two seasons.\n\nTherefore, it probably comes as little surprise that the Mexican side have decided to release the now 37-year-old forward.\n\nPosting on the club’s official Instagram site they commented, “Club Deportivo Guadalajara announces that Javier Hernández Balcázar is ending his second spell as a Chivas player.”\n\nThe Mexican side went on to state, “the bond between Chicharito and the club he loves, which trained him and helped him become a legend in Mexican football, will last forever.”\n\nThe statement continued, “Javier is undoubtedly one of the greatest figures in Mexican football. With the Rebaño, he won the 2006 Apertura League title and the 2010 Bicentennial individual scoring title, before embarking on an international career that led him to success at several of Europe’s most important clubs.”\n\nThe club also thanked him for his “dedication” and “passion” during his second spell at the club.\n\nThe former United star found himself in hot water earlier this year after he made sexist comments online, which he later apologised for.\n\nHis actions resulted in a fine and criticism from the country’s president.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles unleashed a profanity-laced outburst, calling his team's blown lead \"inexcusable\" after a stunning fourth-quarter collapse.",
    "fullText": "It was safe to assume that Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles wouldn't be pleased with the way the Thursday game against the Atlanta Falcons turned out.\n\nTied for first place in December and playing a 4-9 team already out of playoff contention, Tampa Bay had a two-touchdown lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith 1:20 left, Tampa has a 92.8% win probability, according to multiple sources.\n\nA 21-yard pass from Kirk Cousins to David Sills V put Atlanta at the Tampa Bay 36, needing just a field goal to win. Eventually, Atlanta-- aided by an offsides penalty-- drove to Tampa's 25, setting up Zane Gonzalez for a game-winning field goal.\n\nSo everybody watching Bowles' postgame presser knew he'd be upset.\n\nBut even knowing that context, his words were still eye-opening —and not at all PG-rated.\n\nIt started when a reporter asked Bowles what he told his team after this type of loss.\n\n\"It's inexcusable,\" Bowles said.\n\n\"We don't make excuses. We... you gotta *expletive* care enough to where the *expletive* hurts. You gotta *expletive* care enough to where the *expletive* hurts. It's gotta *expletive* mean something to you. It's more than a job. It's your *expletive* livelihood. How well do you know your job? How well can you do your job? We can't sugarcoat that *expletive.* It's in-*expletive*-excusable, and there no *expletive* answer for it. No excuse for it, and that's what you tell them in the locker room. Look in the *expletive* mirror.\"\n\nIt may not eclipse that of former coach Jerry Burns on the list of NFL head coach press conference rants, but by 2025 standards, it was pretty competitive.\n\nSome may not have approved of Bowles' use of profanity in a professional setting such as a press conference. However, one thing most will agree with Bowles on, is that Tampa's loss was \"inexcusable.\"\n\nNot too long ago, Tampa Bay was 5-1. It came into Thursday Night Football having lost five of seven and not only needing a win to jump back into sole possession of first place, but simply to remember what winning feels like.\n\nNow, the Carolina Panthers (7-6) are in the driver's seat, with a chance to add to their new NFC South lead Sunday in New Orleans.\n\nThe good news is that Tampa has a crack at Carolina next Sunday at 1, with a chance to move into a tie for first place.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, Bowles will have more reason to use profanity.",

    "fullText": "One former Premier League star believes that Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is now under some huge pressure.\n\nIt comes off the back of a 2-1 defeat to Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday night, which followed up some other poor results as well, including a 3-1 defeat against Leeds United a week before in the Premier League.\n\nRight now, they need to bounce back, that has to be the main focus, and that can start against Everton tomorrow afternoon in their next Premier League match.\n\nFormer Arsenal star Paul Merson has predicted that Chelsea will win this game 2-1, but he is certainly not sounding too convincing about those predictions.\n\nBut Merson has also gone on to say that he now feels that Maresca and Chelsea are under huge pressure and that this game has become massive for them at the weekend after the recent slump in form.\n\nEnzo Maresca discusses his half time changes.\n\nWriting for Sportskeeda, Merson says:\n\n“This is a huge game for Enzo Maresca. If Chelsea don’t win this football match, they could be out of the top six. After beating Barcelona and producing a spirited display against Arsenal, Chelsea have failed to kick on. They have lost two out of their last three games in all competitions and are under huge pressure.\n\n“It’s not long ago that they were still within touching distance of Arsenal, but look at them now. If they lose this game, Everton will go above them in the points table. There are at least five teams who can move ahead of Chelsea, if they fail to win this weekend.\n\n“Everton have looked good in recent weeks, apart from that shocking loss at home to Newcastle United. They went to Bournemouth and won quite comfortably – something Chelsea failed to do in their last league game. If Maresca wins this game, he can play his fringe players in the Carabao Cup quarter-final against Cardiff City on Tuesday. But if he doesn’t, he will be forced to play his strongest team in that game.”",

    "fullText": "Former England striker Wayne Rooney says he received death threats when he made the move from boyhood club Everton to Manchester United.\n\nAged 18, Rooney signed for the Red Devils in a £27m deal in 2004 after turning down a club record contract offer from the Toffees.\n\nBut Rooney's move from Merseyside led to a heavy backlash from some Everton supporters.\n\n\"I got death threats,\" Rooney said on the latest episode of BBC Sport's The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"My parents' house was getting spray painted and smashed up. My girlfriend at the time, wife now, her house was getting spray painted.\n\n\"I think that's where you have to be mentally strong. The people around you have to help.\n\n\"Leaving was difficult because I went to Manchester United, and Liverpool and Manchester was a big rivalry so that made it a lot more difficult.\n\n\"But I was always of a mindset of 'I don't care'. I knew what I wanted and I knew how to get there.\n\n\"I had to stay tough in my mind. This was people from my city so it was tough but I thought 'I don't care', you have to be selfish and make these decisions.\"\n\nWhen Rooney made the move to Manchester United it was at a time with far less social media, the increase of which he feels creates a different kind of pressure on young footballers in the modern game.\n\nRooney's oldest son, Kai, is currently on the books at United and has stressed the importance of making sure he has a strong support network as he looks to make it in professional football.\n\n\"Now the difference is social media,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"When I was young, I was in the local newspapers and so everyone in Liverpool really knew me.\n\n\"Now I have it with my boy who's 16 and he's on social media. He plays for my United, he's sponsored by Puma and there's hundreds of thousands or millions of people watching them when they're that young, and I didn't have that really.\n\n\"Being a young player and going into the first team especially, you're getting judged. Rightly or wrongly, you get judged and that's where you need the people around you, people at the club or your family to keep you in a good place.\n\n\"We can all get carried away with social media as well. So it's really important that the people who are close to you have your best interest. It's the main thing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rooney also revealed that he used to exchange letters with Duncan Ferguson as a child while the Everton striker was in jail for assault.\n\nIn 1995, when Rooney was 10, Toffees striker Ferguson served a 44-day jail term for headbutting Raith Rovers defender John McStay at his previous club Rangers.\n\n\"I was a young boy who supported Everton so I used to write to him in jail, and then he'd write back,\" said Rooney.\n\n\"It was just me telling him how much I love him. [He'd say] 'thanks, it means a lot'. Obviously, when you're in jail as well you take anything.\"\n\nRooney joined Everton's academy in 1996 and made his first-team debut aged 16 in 2002 while Ferguson was still at the club.\n\n\"Because I was too young to drive as well he'd take me home from training,\" Rooney added.\n\n\"My family were all massive Evertonians, so Duncan Ferguson used to take me home to my mum's house and my dad was out the window [waving]. So that was surreal.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "AFC Champions League Match Day 6 proved to be one of mixed fortunes for K League sides, with no wins recorded in ACL Elite. It also saw FC Seoul bid farewell to Jesse Lingard who was making his final appearance for the club.\n\nIt was a winless match day for K League sides in ACL Elite. Ulsan HD suffered a 3-1 away loss to Machida Zelvia, in a match that saw former Horangi Oh Se-hun score the Japanese side's third goal. Ulsan found themselves 2-0 behind with just 21 minutes on the clock, and 3-0 down just two minutes into the second half. Um Won-sang linked up with Gustav Ludwigson for what was a consolation goal 10 minutes after the restart. Ulsan remain in the top eight, the qualification places for the knockouts, but only just, holding a one-point lead over ninth.\n\nGangwon FC picked up what will be seen as the pick of the results for K League sides in Match Day 6, earning a 2-2 draw away to Thai giants Buriram United. Mo Jae-hyun's close-range effort gave the Bears a 33rd-minute lead, only for former Daejeon and Bluewings centre back Ko Myeong-seok to level on 58 minutes. Buriram took the lead on 65 through Mueanta before Kim Dae-won rescued a point with a 74th-minute penalty. Gangwon sit outside the top eight but by just a point.\n\nIn what was Jesse Lingard's final match for FC Seoul, the former England international marked the occasion with a goal in a 1-1 draw with Melbourne City. Lingard gave Seoul the lead on 31 minutes, but Kanamori's goal on 74 minutes meant the spoils were shared. Seoul sit fifth, but only two points clear of ninth\n\nA strong and experienced Pohang Steelers squad travelled to the Philippines for the Group H closer. In a game that could be Ki Sung-yueng's last ever before retiring, a 12-minute cameo off the bench, Pohang earned a 1-0 away win courtesy of a goal from An Jae-jun 17 minutes in. After a year of injury struggles, An's match-winner at least ended 2025 on a high for him and for the Steelers who will now await the draw for the Round of 16. Tampines Rovers beat BG Pathum United 2-0 in the other Group H match, meaning that the Steelers finished as group runners-up.",

    "fullText": "Following the Bucs’ 29-28 loss to the Atlanta Falcons Thursday night, their second defeat to a team eliminated from contention in four days, coach Todd Bowles unloaded on his club with a profanity-laced assessment that questioned how much some players cared about the way they’re going about their jobs.\n\n“It’s inexcusable. We don’t make excuses,” Bowles said. “You’ve got to f--king care enough where this s--t hurts. It’s got to f--king mean something. It’s more than a job, it’s your f--king livelihood. How well do you know your job, how well can you do your job? You can’t sugarcoat that s--t. It was in-f--king-excusable. There is no f--king answer for it.\n\n“That’s what you tell them in the locker room. Look in the f--king mirror.”\n\nLeading 28-14 in the fourth quarter, the Bucs couldn’t finish the game, and now their season may be ending soon as well.\n\nThe offense had a chance to run the final 3:29 seconds off the clock but managed only one first down.\n\nThen they had the lead but not the football. The Bucs defense had the Falcons and Kurt Cousins facing third and 28 and fourth and 14.\n\nHaason Reddick even sacked Cousins and forced a fumble that he appeared to recover, but officials ruled simultaneous possession and the ball remained with the Falcons.\n\nThe veteran quarterback led Atlanta on a nine-play, 45-yard drive capped by Zane Gonzalez’s game-winning 43-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nThe defeat dropped the Bucs to 7-7 and forfeited their season-long lead in the NFC South to the Carolina Panthers (7-6), who play New Orleans on Sunday.\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield took the blame for the loss, particularly handing the ball back to Atlanta when he threw a fourth-quarter interception trying to hit Emeka Egbuka while leading by eight points.\n\n“Disappointing, obviously, but falls on my shoulders,” Mayfield said. “Can’t turn the ball over. Can’t have that interception. Got to hit Mek in stride on that third down.\n\n“Listen, you can say what you want about being up two scores and the defense right there. We have to be better on offense. It comes down to how I play. This one is going to be hard on me. It falls on my shoulders.”\n\nUnbelievably, the Bucs still have a chance to win the NFC South if they just beat the Carolina Panthers twice in the next three weeks.\n\nBut nobody felt like talking about that after dropping back-to-back games to New Orleans and Atlanta in four days.\n\nThe Bucs lost because the defense had no answers for Falcons tight end Kyle Pitts and running back Bijan Robinson.\n\nPitts had 11 catches for 166 yards and three touchdowns. Robinson rushed for 93 yards and a score and caught eight passes for 82 yards.\n\nThe Bucs lost despite Atlanta doing everything they could to give the game away. They had 19 accepted penalties for 125 yards. They fumbled three times, losing one.\n\nBut Cousins passed for 373 yards and three touchdowns and was only sacked once.\n\nThe loss spoiled terrific returns to the lineup by Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan.\n\nIt was impossible to remember just how much the Bucs missed Mike Evans — not truly, not completely — until he returned Thursday to remind us all.\n\nFifty-two days after breaking his collarbone in Detroit, the greatest offensive player in club history stepped back onto the field and lifted his team as only he can. He turned routine throws into first downs, back-shoulder throws into momentum and turned the Bucs back into themselves.\n\nEvans’ first three catches resulted in first downs. But it was his grab of a 45-yard bomb in which he leaped over defensive back Cobee Bryant that set up the Bucs’ go-ahead touchdown — a 6-yard pass to tight end Devin Culp, his first catch of the season.\n\nWhen Jacob Parish recovered a fumble by Bijan Robinson at the Atlanta 25-yard line, it was Evans who drew a pass-interference penalty to lead the Bucs to Chris Godwin’s TD and two-point conversion.\n\nEvans finished with six catches for 132 yards.\n\nThe Bucs had an eight-point and the ball near midfield when Mayfield was intercepted by Dee Alford with 8:22 remaining.\n\nCousins drove the Falcons 67 yards in 10 plays, hitting Pitts in the corner of the end zone for a 7-yard touchdown. The two-point conversion pass attempt failed.\n\nThe Bucs managed to get one first down on the ensuing drive, but Bucky Irving was dropped for a 4-yard loss on first down, and Mayfield threw incomplete to Egbuka before he was sacked on third down.\n\nIt looked as though Reddick ended the game when he sacked Cousins and forced a fumble. But officials ruled the ball belonged to the Falcons.\n\nEven so, there was no excuse for not ending the game on defense when the Falcons were faced with third and 28 and fourth-and-14. But Cousins hit David Sills for 21 yards and a first down.\n\nThat basically put the Falcons within range of Gonzalez’s game-winner.\n\nat Panthers, 1 p.m. Dec. 21 TV/radio: Fox; 97.9-FM\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "title": "LA Bowl Opponent Q&A: Boise State Broncos",
    "description": "Aiden Petterson of Mountain West Connection joins me to talk Boise State football!",
    "fullText": "Ahead of the LA Bowl on Saturday, I caught up with Aiden Petterson of Mountain West Connection, to get the skinny on the Broncos ahead of the showdown on Saturday night in SoFi Stadium!\n\nMS: This is the second full season for Spencer Danielson at the head of the Bronco football program. He capped off this season with the Broncos’ 3rd straight MWC title, and a 9-4 record. What do you like about the job that Danielson has done?\n\nAP: You have to give credit to him for retaining pivotal players that have gone on to make an impact the following season. The most obvious example being Ashton Jeanty refraining from entering the transfer portal prior to last year’s College Football Playoff appearance. Danielson has been a member of the Boise State staff in some capacity since 2017, working his way up from graduate assistant to defensive ends coach before finally earning the title of defensive coordinator in 2021. He has lived the mentality that he preaches week in and\nweek out, and despite some of his cliches becoming tiresome after underwhelming performances, he is as true as they come. I also think we have to remind ourselves that this is his first stint as a big-time college football coach and that there are going to be bumps and bruises along the way.\n\nMS: This is the Broncos’ first season without Ashton Jeanty or Dirk Koetter since 2022. Nate Potter has stepped into that OC role nicely, with the Broncos averaging 31.4 points per game on offense. What does he do differently than Koetter, and who are the major weapons on offense that Maddux Madsen has to throw to?\n\nAP: Nate Potter is growing into his own skin as a play-caller, but there have been growing pains. During the beginning portion of the season, the offense was very dependent on runs designed to operate between the tackles. However, there was very little motion to keep defenses honest, allowing them to hone in Boise State’s stable of running backs – Dylan Riley, Sire Gaines, and Malik Sherrod. Dirk Koetter was very much of the mindset that prioritized creating an offensive gameplan that centered around his players’ strengths. Potter began to branch out during October and November, but a leg injury suffered by QB Maddux Madsen forced him to go back to vanilla concepts. More than anything, this offense is much more efficient when facing third-and-medium or better. Converting long -distance situations- not so much. As for who Madsen has at his disposal on the perimeter, there isn’t one certified top dog in the receiver room. Many hoped that former five-star recruit Chris Marshall would have a breakout year, but that did not materialize. Ben Ford was having a surprise campaign, yet a season-ending injury cut his year short. The three receivers that continue to be Madsen’s favorites are slot receiver Latrell Caples (46 receptions, 547 yds, 3 TDs), Chase Penry (27 receptions, 363 yds, 1 TD), and Cameron Bates (18 receptions, 307 yds, 1 TD). However, keep an eye out for Boise State’s tight end duo that features Matt Lauter (32 receptions, 293 yds, 1 TD) and Matt Wagner (22 receptions, 239 yds, 1 TD). And there is one true freshman named Quinton Brown who has seen more action as of late and was responsible for a vital 66-yard touchdown in the Broncos’ win over Utah State.\n\nMS: Erik Chinander and Tyler Stockton coordinate the defense, which is anchored by DB Ty Benefield, who leads the team with 98 tackles. What does this defense do schematically, and who are the other playmakers that the Huskies need to watch out for?\n\nAP: The Broncos are known for planting bodies inside the box and limiting opposing rushing attacks. More often than not, they implement a four-man front while making sure to set the edge against opposing tackles. Defensive coordinator Erik Chinander loves to show pressure prior to the snap, and when he is feeling it,\nhe’ll commit to the bit. But, they will simulate said pressure and then fall back into a zone concept when defending the chains. In recent years, Boise State has been burnt downfield by opposing speedy wideouts, but according to Pro Football Focus, they have graded higher than an 80 four times in 2025 when it comes to their pass coverage. Player-wise, the defensive line is led by EDGE Jayden Virgin-Morgan (52 tackles and four sacks) and DL Braxton Fely (22 tackles and 5.5 sacks). The latter is a monster within the interior of the Broncos’ front and is an absolute run-stuffer. Moving to the secondary, DB Ty Benefield (98 tackles and two interceptions) is a hard-hitting Swiss Army Knife while the combo effort of Jeremiah Earby and A’Marion McCoy resulted in eight interceptions. However, McCoy is out for the remainder of the year due to a knee injury, paving the way for youngster Sherrod Smith to step into the limelight. Notre Dame transfer Jaden Mickey has also been a nice addition to an improved backline.\n\nMS: With this season winding down, and it being the Broncos’ last in the Mountain West, are fans excited to go to the newly reloaded PAC 12? What are the prospects like for Boise State as a member of that conference, both next year and beyond?\n\nAP: I certainly think you sense enthusiasm for the move, even if the sought-after Pac-12 invitation came via a different scenario than what it was a decade ago. Boise State has been a part of the Mountain West for nearly 15 years, and it does feel as though the relationship between them and the conference has run its course. Former commissioner Craig Thompson carved out a Boise State-specific media “sweetheart” deal that awarded the Broncos an additional $1.8 million per year, something that as time wore on, was looked at with more disdain from its fellow members. The flagship program is always going to be looked at in a unique way, but with conference realignment seemingly never ending, it felt as though this was a life raft worth taking, especially with the Gonzaga Bulldogs joining in every non-football sport. Frankly, this was a chance to join a conference full of like-minded schools that are willing to spend and be competitive year in and year out. On the football side of things, I am bullish on the Broncos’ chances to win its first Pac-12 championship in 2026. San Diego State is 9-3, Fresno State is 8-4, Utah State is 6-6, and Colorado State is 2-10. Combine that with Texas State finishing 6-6, Washington State being 6-6, and Oregon State limping to a 2-10 record, and the opportunity feels ripe for the taking. Beyond next year, the Broncos should be able to maintain their recent recruiting highs as they finished this cycle with their highest-rated class in school history, ranking 51st in the country and ahead of Arkansas, Kentucky, UCLA, Wisconsin, and California. Boise State, barring some unforeseen collapse, should consistently finish inside the top three of the conference standings, reach ten wins, and be in the conversation for a College\nFootball Playoff bid.\n\nMS: It’s score prediction time! What will the score be in another installment of Huskies v.\nBroncos, this time in the City of Angels?\n\nAP: My heart wants to take the blue and orange, but my mind says otherwise. There isn’t one specific stat or player that makes me think that Washington has a massive edge, but it is actually the lack of a recent P4 win for Boise State that makes me hesitate to take the leap of faith. The Broncos’ last win against a “big-time” school came against Florida State back in 2019 when Hank Bachmeier was a true freshman starting his first game in Tallahassee. This is the same Bachmeier that eventually transferred to Louisiana Tech before finishing his college career at Wake Forest. Since that win at Doak Campbell Stadium, the Broncos have lost to Washington (2019 Las Vegas Bowl), Oklahoma State (2021), Oregon State (2022), Washington (2023), UCLA (2023 LA Bowl), Oregon (2024), Penn State (2024 CFP Quarterfinal), and Notre Dame (2025).\n\nI need to see it to believe it.\n\nThank you Aiden, and good luck to the Broncos in this game, and in the brand new PAC 12!",

    "description": "Six different goal scorers contributed for the Avalanche.",
    "fullText": "Tonight, the Colorado Avalanche welcomed the Florida Panthers into Denver after coming home from a road trip. This was the first of two regular-season matchups between these two teams, which the Avs won by a total score of 6-2 with goals from Sam Malinski, Brock Nelson, Gavin Brindley, Nathan MacKinnon Artturi Lehkonen and Gabe Landeskog.\n\nLet’s take a look at all the action from tonight!\n\nSam Malinski was the one to get the scoring started for Colorado in this game, and he snuck the puck past Florida netminder Daniil Tarasov just over a minute into the first period. Martin Necas would find Malinski in the slot with a beautiful cross-ice feed, and Malinski was able to sneak it past the goalkeeper.\n\nMalinski squeeks one in early! pic.twitter.com/UG3tUs2jjz\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nNoah Gregor would then respond for the Panthers, as he came flying into the Avalanche zone down the wing, and managed to elevate the puck past Mackenzie Blackwood to tie the game at 1-1 before the halfway mark of the first period.\n\nwhat a beauty for his FIRST as a cat 😼 pic.twitter.com/hXsSrGP8sv\n\n— Florida Panthers (@FlaPanthers) December 12, 2025\n\nBrock Nelson would the score the go-ahead goal for Colorado just before the end of the period, and what was ultimately the game-winning goal, as he battled in front of the Avalanche net and was able to just find some space between the goalie and the post, and poke the puck past Tarasov. Colorado held a 2-1 advantage at that time.\n\nBrock battled in front 🚨 pic.twitter.com/8JSzFfqade\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nGavin Brindley would get in on the scoring action next, as Brent Burns once again turned back the clock, flew into the zone down the wing and put a shot on net, creating a big rebound for Brindley to jump on, as he was able to put it into a near empty net to go up 3-1.\n\nWould you believe us if we said Brent Burns just got an assist to someone (Brindley) who wasn't born yet when he was drafted?\n\nBecause it's true. pic.twitter.com/eE8aparvI9\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nSoon after Brindley scored, Nathan MacKinnon continued to add to his absolutely ridiculous season and gave Colorado a three-goal lead, as he let the puck fly from the point, and managed to beat Tarasov clean.\n\nIt's what the Dogg does 🐶 pic.twitter.com/gpcja7kN4v\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nGavin Brindley would get on the score sheet again on this goal, as he sprung Artturi Lehkonen for a breakaway, and when you have nothing but time and space in front of the net, that one’s pretty easy for Lehkonen, and it was suddenly 5-1. The game was pretty much over by that point but why not add a little meaningless drama with a Martin Nečas power play goal which was challenged by Florida and called back due to an offside call. The second period ended with Colorado up 5-1.\n\nLehky on the breakaway! pic.twitter.com/4KnITM5iTj\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nFlorida started off the period with an overturned goal of their own as Eetu Luostarinen had a kicked-in goal taken off the board. At this point Colorado could truly coast, but a little insurance is always nice, as Gabe Landeskog got on the board as he got to stare down an empty net, and that one is also pretty easy.\n\nLandy adds on to the lead! pic.twitter.com/cmyq1kGcYm\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 12, 2025\n\nFlorida would get a garbage-time goal as well, as AJ Greer was able to make a ridiculous pass to Mackie Samoskevich, who would put the puck into an empty net, to arrive at the final score of 6-2. Also, Nathan MacKinnon received a penalty shot late in the third period and his shot was saved by Tarasov, not that the Avalanche needed to pad their victory even more, and the game was finally over.\n\nCats get one back pic.twitter.com/DV7aY9ZGha\n\n— Florida Panthers (@FlaPanthers) December 12, 2025\n\nLet’s be honest, this game was over by the time the second period ended. Colorado got out to a really quick start in the first, and for a moment, this game looked like it might be a 3-1 win or a 4-3 overtime win after the Panthers responded and the Avs had to fight and claw a bit for the go-ahead goal. After the first period, though, Colorado just decided that the game was over, and scored accordingly, or that’s what it felt like anyway. In the third period, they were able to coast their way to another win and became the first team in the NHL to cross the 50-point threshold on the season. The one issue tonight, as it’s been for the past few games, was the power play once again. Martin Nečas dud technically score on the man advantage but Colorado officially went 0/3 on the night, Not that it rightly mattered in this game, given the final score, but the power play continued to struggle once again.\n\nNext up, the Colorado Avalanche get another shot at the Nashville Predators, as those two teams play again on Saturday at Ball Arena. Puck drop will be at 7:00 p.m. MT.",

I’m not saying he should start every game, but he probably should be getting more minutes.\n\nThis is Acheampong’s third WAGNH Man of the Match award (in six starts); only Moisés Caicedo has more. Biases aside, the kid’s got serious talent and it feels like we could do a better job of nurturing it more actively.\n\nReecey was inches away from winning this game, and being the Man of the Match. If he scores on that chance early in the second half and makes it 2-0, we probably take all three points.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Clippers entered Thursday night's game in Houston looking to snap out of their season-long struggles, but once again came up short in a game that went down to the wire.\n\nDespite strong efforts from their star players, the Clippers fell to the Houston Rockets 115-113 at the Toyota Center in a contest that had no shortage of late-game chaos.\n\nWith the loss, the Clippers dropped to 6-19 on the season and remain near the bottom of the Western Conference, while the Rockets improved to 16-6 and continue to establish themselves as one of the top teams in the West.\n\nThe game was tied at 110 with less than 30 seconds remaining when the Rockets had possession, and after a wild sequence of missed shots and offensive rebounds, Amen Thompson finally grabbed the ball and put in a layup while drawing a foul.\n\nHe knocked down the free throw to give Houston a 113-110 lead with just 17.2 seconds left on the clock.\n\nFrom there, the Clippers could never recover despite their best efforts to claw back.\n\nThe ending sequence was messy for both teams.\n\nAmen Thompson with a huge play with 17.2 sec left pic.twitter.com/cGFugIbSG4\n\n— ClutchFans (@clutchfans) December 12, 2025\n\nAfter Ivica Zubac made one of two free throws to cut the deficit to two, Jabari Smith Jr. elbowed Kris Dunn after grabbing the rebound and gave the ball back to the Clippers.\n\nThen, with a chance to tie or take the lead, Kawhi Leonard drove into the paint but was called for an offensive foul after shoving Aaron Holiday.\n\nThe Clippers challenged the call but were unsuccessful, and the Rockets held on from there.\n\nEven though the Clippers came away with the loss, there were some bright spots from their top players.\n\nZubac was a force all night long, finishing with a team-high 33 points while dominating in the paint. Leonard added 24 points as he continues to show he can still be one of the best players in the league when healthy, and James Harden chipped in 22 points in his return to Houston where he spent eight seasons.\n\nIVICA ZUBAC TONIGHT:\n\n33 POINTS\n7 REBOUNDS\n2 BLOCKS\n13/14 FG\n\n(via @realapp) pic.twitter.com/aXCTojLFs9\n\n— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) December 12, 2025\n\nThe Clippers actually led 82-80 heading into the fourth quarter after Leonard and Zubac combined to carry the offense through three quarters.\n\nHowever, the Rockets stormed back in the final period with a 10-0 run early in the fourth that gave them the momentum they needed to pull away.\n\nThe Clippers will need to regroup quickly as their struggles continue to pile up in what has been a season to forget so far.

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Catch by catch, Kyle Pitts Sr. put the mistake-prone Atlanta Falcons on his back and carried them to a thrilling comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThursday night got even better for the fifth-year pro when the former University of Florida star learned his 11-reception, 166-yard, three-touchdown performance that keyed a 29-28 win was the most productive game by an NFL tight end in nearly three decades.\n\nThe previous tight end to finish with at least 10 catches, 150 yards receiving and three TDs in a game was Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in 1996.\n\nThe 25-year-old Pitts noted he wasn't even born yet back then.\n\n“Man, I love the state of Florida,” the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Pitts said as he stepped up to the podium in the visiting interview room at Raymond James Stadium.\n\n“It means a lot,” he added about the mention of Sharpe. “It's a great person to be (compared to).”\n\nKurt Cousins targeted Pitts a team-high 12 times, leaning heavily on the young tight end with leading receiver Drake London out with a knee injury. Pitts scored on receptions of 8, 17 and 7 yards, the latter trimming what had once been a 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit to 28-26 with 3:34 remaining.\n\nHis last catch, on third-and-28 from the Atlanta 29, was for 14 yards. Cousins threw 21 yards to David Sills V on fourth-and-14 to set up Zane Gonzalez's 43-yard game-winning field goal as time expired.\n\n“It was the plan, you know, all along. Kyle is our guy,” second-year Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. “You're down a couple of your guys like Drake, some of those guys, and Kyle has really filled in that role and become the lead dog guy. He has done an awesome job.”\n\nThe Falcons (5-9) are eliminated from playoff contention, but they relished the opportunity to play spoiler against the division-rival Bucs (7-7), who are trying to win the NFC South for the fifth straight season.\n\n“It's amazing. I mean, we've been having our ups and downs through the year,” Pitts said. “Obviously, it's not fun being eliminated early, but we're resilient. ... It was just pretty fun to get that win.”\n\nThe Falcons overcame a team-record 19 penalties for 125 yards. They also withstood a wide-open Sills dropping what would have been a go-ahead TD catch in the third quarter, as well as Bijan Robinson's third-quarter fumble that led to the touchdown that put Tampa Bay up by two scores early in the fourth.\n\n“It's a steppingstone to where we want to go,” Morris said. “We talked about this, building blocks for what we've got to do. What we're talking about is next year. ... Only thing we can do right now is finish.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nJeremy Lin took the NBA world by storm midway through the 2011-12 season when he moved into the New York Knicks' starting lineup and put together an extended stretch of big-scoring games. He had gone undrafted in 2010 out of Harvard University, not exactly a high-level basketball school, and was a seemingly invisible rookie with the Golden State Warriors, but he seemingly shot himself out of a cannon with New York.\n\nIt sparked a phenomenon people referred to as \"Linsanity,\" and even after the rest of the league adjusted to him and his production regressed to a more consistent mean, a sizable amount of the hype surrounding him remained.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the rebuilding Lakers acquired Lin in a trade with the Houston Rockets. By now, he was straddling the line between a low-tier starting point guard and a very solid reserve point guard. He played one season with the Lakers and started in 30 of 74 games while averaging 11.2 points and 4.6 assists in 25.8 minutes a game.\n\nHe left L.A. following that season and would have short stints with the Charlotte Hornets, Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors before his NBA career ended. He finished with league career averages of 11.6 points on 43.3% field-goal shooting and 4.3 assists in 25.5 minutes a game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 17 — Jeremy Lin",

    "fullText": "The January transfer window is already taking shape and few names carry as much intrigue as Antoine Semenyo. An original report by Sami Mokbel of BBC Sport lays out the landscape clearly, with Liverpool firmly positioned among the clubs weighing their next move as Bournemouth brace for serious interest in their forward.\n\nSemenyo’s situation is defined by clarity. Interested clubs know the terms, “a release fee of £65m that can be activated for around the first two weeks of the month.” That certainty sharpens decision making and removes the prolonged negotiation phases that Liverpool traditionally prefer, placing pressure on timing and conviction.\n\nLiverpool’s interest is framed heavily by uncertainty around Mohamed Salah. As BBC Sport states, “the uncertainty over Mohamed Salah’s future at Anfield has cast a deeper glare on Liverpool’s interest in Semenyo.” That context matters, but it does not tell the full story.\n\nWell placed sources told BBC Sport that “a Liverpool move for Semenyo was in the offing” as early as October, long before Salah’s comments following the 3-3 draw with Leeds. This reinforces the sense that Liverpool’s recruitment planning runs independently of short term noise, even when that noise involves a generational forward.\n\nThe report adds that “Liverpool’s interest in the Ghana international pre-existed the current hullabaloo that is surrounding Salah,” while also noting the club remain “well-stocked with attacking talent.” That balance explains why interest does not automatically translate into urgency.\n\nAge and planning are also factors. “Salah is 33 and Liverpool are acutely aware that they need a plan in place for when he leaves.” From a financial standpoint, “it would be less of a strain if they signed Semenyo in the same window that Salah departs,” a scenario that remains possible given Salah’s looming Africa Cup of Nations involvement and Semenyo’s availability.\n\nManchester City’s presence adds competitive tension. BBC Sport notes that “there have been indications in recent weeks that City’s interest in Semenyo is the most solid as January approaches.” A fixed price suits City’s recent approach, avoiding bidding wars and sticking to internal valuations.\n\nSporting incentives also feature. Joining a club “in the midst of a Premier League title race with Arsenal” offers an immediate appeal, particularly when Liverpool’s season has been described as inconsistent. Arsenal and Manchester United, despite admiration, appear less likely to prioritise a move given squad balance and financial focus elsewhere.\n\nTottenham’s interest is real, and sources suggest their proposed package “could be the most personally lucrative to the player.” However, the report is clear that if Semenyo prioritises sporting success, “Liverpool or City would likely provide him with a better chance of fulfilling his ambitions.”\n\nRemaining at Bournemouth remains possible, but only if no club activates the clause. As BBC Sport concludes, the club are “effectively powerless” if that threshold is met, with delaying the inevitable “the best Bournemouth can hope for.”\n\nFrom a Liverpool supporter’s perspective, this report reads like classic Anfield pragmatism. Semenyo is admired, tracked, and understood, but not chased recklessly. That £65m clause feels significant, especially in January, and supporters will recognise that Liverpool rarely move early unless the fit is exact.\n\nSalah’s future naturally hovers over everything. Yet many supporters will agree that Liverpool planning beyond him is sensible rather than disloyal. Semenyo’s profile, physical, direct, Premier League proven, fits the league, but the price demands certainty.\n\nUltimately, this feels like Liverpool staying informed rather than being pulled into a market rush. If circumstances align, the move makes sense. If not, supporters will trust that the club’s long term vision, sharpened by recent success, will guide them towards the right call.",

    "description": "DJI wants its required audit before it's too late.",
    "fullText": "With just weeks left before DJI’s products will be banned in the United States pending a last-second security audit, as mandated by law, DJI is pulling out all the stops and imploring federal officials to take the necessary actions.\n\nIn a letter addressed to very high-ranking federal officials Kash Patel (Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), Lt. Gen. William Hartman (Acting Director of the National Security Agency), Tulsi Gabbard (Director of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence), and Pete Hegseth (Secretary of the Department of War), DJI’s Head of Global Policy, Adam Welsh, urges any relevant agency of the federal government initiate the security review of DJI Technology products, as mandated by Congress under Section 1709 of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\n“With less than one month left before the December 23, 2025 deadline, we urge you to take up this audit immediately to avoid any negative consequences to American drone users, including our public safety and law enforcement officers, and to provide them with answers about the security of DJI products,” Welsh writes.\n\nWelsh continues, stating that DJI’s position on the audit “has never wavered,” and that the company is prepared to work with the federal government, maintain complete transparency, and provide all necessary information to complete the review.\n\n“To date, these offers have gone unanswered, and public reports suggest that this audit has not yet commenced,” Welsh writes. “With time running out, we once again are calling for this audit to take place immediately to avoid the automatic addition of DJI products to the FCC’s ‘Covered List’ that would take place if the audit is not completed by December 23.”\n\nWelsh argues that if DJI’s products are added to the FCC’s “Covered List,” resulting in their ban from the American market, it would lead to widespread consumer confusion and “deprive American drone users of due process — and of answers about the safety and security of the DJI products they use every day.”\n\n“Failing to undertake the review further goes against Congressional intent for a security review to be completed,” Welsh says, before explaining that DJI is confident that its products can withstand any U.S. government scrutiny.\n\nDJI’s products have already gone under audits before, including from some U.S. government agencies like the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Idaho National Laboratory at the direction of the Department of Homeland Security. Kristi Noem, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, also received a separate, mostly identical letter from DJI.\n\nIn that letter, Welsh notes that Noem had indicated “through written communication” in September that her agency was willing to work with DJI. DJI notes that more than 80% of state and local law enforcement and emergency services in the U.S. operate drone programs that rely on DJI technology.\n\n“We stand behind the security of our technology, and with time running out, we are keen to meet with you and ensure that this Congressionally-mandated security review takes place as soon as possible. My team and I are available at any time to provide information that may be helpful and ensure that a fair and thorough audit is indeed carried out before it is too late,” Welsh concludes. “The American people, including those who use DJI drones for their jobs, for their livelihoods, or for ensuring the safety and security of our communities, deserve no less.”\n\nIf the required audit is not initiated or completed by December 23, 2025, DJI’s drones will be automatically added to the FCC’s Covered List, as required by federal law, and will therefore be banned from entering the United States. As of now, with less than three weeks left before the deadline, the situation looks dire for DJI.",

    "fullText": "One of my wife's guilty pleasures is reality TV, usually ones centred around dating - the more American, the better. By extension, I absorb some of this noise and I'm happy to admit I can sometimes get invested.\n\nAt one point, she was (let's face it, we were) watching a show called \"Are you the one?\" on MTV. I'm going to show you how this game is pretty much free money.\n\nConsider a group of equal numbers of men & women:\n\nEach contestant has exactly one perfect match of the opposite sex that is pre-determined for them, as represented by the colours. Click the \"Match\" button to pair up the contestants correctly. Crucially, they don't initially know who their perfect match is. If the group can correctly guess all the perfect matches, they win a cash prize of $1M.\n\nYou probably have the follow up question of how the perfect matches are calculated, which is a great question. In short: dunno, it's black-boxed, but let's just say \"science\"? How this is calculated isn't really the point, I could even argue that it doesn't matter so long as you get your strategy right. For what it's worth, the plot of the TV show mentions employing \"the most extensive match-making process ever seen\".\n\nLet's get into it. Here are the two ways in which contestants can learn new pieces of information throughout the game: truth booths and match ups.\n\nA truth booth is where a male & female are chosen by the contestants, and it is revealed definitively whether they're a perfect match or not. So there are two potential outcomes:\n\nIf you've found a way to stream this and want to skip straight to the good stuff, I'd fast-forward to the fallout from these. In S1E6 it took Shanley an entire episode to come to terms with Chris T & Paige being a perfect match, even though in E1 she learned she was no match with him anyway (sigh).\n\nAt the end of each episode, all contestants match up and they are informed (via dramatic lighting) how many correct matches they've got. If they've got all matches, the game is over and they win.\n\nCrucially, they don't know what the correct matches are, just how many they got in total. The only way they can definitively rule out a pairing is if they scored zero: the dreaded blackout. Though it might seem like a bad thing, a blackout can in fact be helpful in the long-term, as it gives you a definitive answer for all pairs that were matched up, it's like getting a free truth booth for each pair.\n\nMuch like a high school disco, let's put all the boys on one side and the girls on the other, and re-use the pairs from the match up example above:\n\nHere we have two correct pairs red and pink at position 1 and 5 respectively. The orange man at position 2 was paired with the purple woman from position 6, and so on.\n\nHow good is a score of two? Is that any better than if you were to randomly pair people up? Let's experiment by doing just that: click the 'shuffle' button to re-pick:\n\nYou'll notice that the average score comes out at around 1 after a while, which this line chart keeps track of.\n\nBelow is a chart capturing the frequency of each score, you'll notice it eventually converges to a specific shape.\n\nThe height of each outlined bar is the probability of scoring that number in a random pairing in a game of 6 couples. Interestingly, both these probabilities and the average score stay the same no matter how many couples we use.\n\nWhatever the selected # couples, the probability stays this same. There's tonnes of tangents we could explore that you might find interesting here1, but for our purposes we just wanted to put some data behind \"how good is a score of X\".\n\nI created a model that computes the remaining viable matchings of all couples. By 'viable', I mean that there's still a chance that it's the perfect match. Initially, as you can imagine, this is a big number. The aim of the game then becomes getting that number down to 1 as quickly as possible.\n\nEach time new information is learned, we recalculate the remaining matches. For example if we have a positive truth booth result, the remaining matches are filtered out to only those that contain these two people as a pair. Conversely, if the truth booth result was negative, then the remaining matches cannot contain any where these two are paired. Imagine a huge a game of \"Guess Who?\" where each image is a viable matching and you flip down the options that become invalid each time you learn new information. Match ups also massively help you reduce this number, however their impact is a bit more indirect and it's very difficult for a human brain to figure out the implications of the result of one.\n\nHere is a graph of the remaining viable matches in Season 1 as the season progresses. It may surprise you that in this game of 10 men and 10 women, the initial number of viable matches is almost 4 million:\n\nHovering over the dots will tell you what's responsible for that change in the remaining matches. As you can see, they gain enough information to win the game by episode 8, so why does it take them so long to get it right? As mentioned earlier, it's almost impossible for humans to keep tabs on all these potential matchings so it's very likely they just didn't know.\n\nThat being said, the graph itself isn't particularly useful, is it? After a couple of events, the line hugs the x-axis, and it's hard to see the difference between 1 and 5,773 seen in episodes 8 and 2 respectively. Let's try a log base 2 graph:\n\nThat's hopefully a lot clearer. You can see how they learn information as they go, and at which point the model 'cracks it' with the match up in episode 8. You can also clearly see that the most valuable piece of information they gained was the match up in episode 2 - with a decent early score of 4. This might be intuitive to you, but as we found earlier you've got a less than 2% chance of scoring 4 when randomly selecting.\n\nLet's plot this again along with a few more seasons2:\n\nOther than S3 and S7, the contests mathematically learn enough information to win the game with time to spare. Could they have got there sooner though? Could they have chosen better truth booths/match ups to spare us all of the extra episodes of trashy TV? Before I get into this, I need to cover some basics of information theory.\n\nWe're going to revisit the \"Guess Who?\" game now, which you can think of as a simplified version of \"Are you the one?\". Stick with me; the idea is that we can use the more straightforward game mechanics to establish an information theory based strategy that we can then apply to \"Are you the one?\". These two games are similar in that:\n\nConsider an 8x8 grid of potential answers:\n\nNow I'm a terrible artist so I thought I would be able to articulate this more clearly with shapes instead. There are 4 shapes (\n,\n,\n and\n), 2 different types (opaque or outlined), and 8 colours - this makes 64 unique combinations. The aim of the game is to guess the correct answer before your opponent guesses yours. To give yourself the best chance of winning, you need to rule out as many answers as you can, as quickly as you can. Should you then employ a strategy that splits the potential answers in half (e.g \"is it opaque?\"), or something a bit more specific (e.g \"is it an orange star?\"). The latter is high-risk, high-reward, whereas the former will almost always rule out half of the remaining answers.\n\nConsider a bit of information as reducing the problem space by half. That is, by ruling out half the remaining answers. I want to stress that the word bit is a common term in information theory, as opposed to something that might sound less exact as it's intended in this context.\n\nThe opaque question is a sure-fire way of gaining 1 bit of information. On the other hand, let's say you find out that the answer is a which allows you to flip down three quarters of the answers, that's the same as halving the problem space twice and therefore gaining two bits of information.\n\nAs you can see, different answers are more useful than others. \"Opaque?\" rules out half of the remaining answers (1 bit), whereas \"Blue?\" rules out 7/8ths of them (3 bits).\n\nGetting from 64 potential answers to 1 involves halving the problem space 6 times - 64 becomes 32, then 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1. In other words, if you're able to gain 6 bits of information, you'll know for sure what the answer is. This is supported by the fact that the sum of the information gained by asking all three above questions is 6.\n\nLet's simulate an actual game now, keeping tabs on the information gained throughout.\n\nOnce everything but remains, you'll have gained 6 bits of information and can be 100% confident in the answer. Now we know we need to get to 6 bits of information as quickly as possible, our strategy becomes picking the question that we expect to give us the most information. That is, the sum of the information we would gain if that answer were true or false, multiplied by the probability of that specific outcome. Let's work through our three questions to give the expected information for each:\n\nThis table shows the expected information for each of our 3 questions. As you can see, the more \"Hail Mary\" the question, the lower expected information. \"Blue?\" comes out at 0.54, which is almost half the amount of expected information as \"Opaque?\". Therefore, we can speculate that a decent strategy for this game would be to ask questions that split the remaining problem space in half. To support this, we can plot a graph3 for all possible probabilities between 0 and 1:\n\nThis shows that splitting the problem space in half (where the probability is 0.5), gives the highest expected information. This means that asking a very specific question like \"Blue?\" is statistically the worst thing you can do.\n\nLet's play one final game, this time I'll show you the questions ordered by most to least expected information:\n\nHow did you do? You'll notice that picking the questions at the top of the list gets you to the answer quicker, whereas the opposite is true when picking from the bottom. You'll also notice that you're never presented with a question that gives you more than 1 expected information, which is backed up by the above graph never going higher than 1.\n\nNow we've got a strategy that works well for \"Guess Who?\", we can get back to the proper game.\n\nEarlier on, I posed a (until now) rhetorical question as to the performance of the contestants on the show. In order to answer this question, we need two things:\n\nA way to measure performance: For this, we'll use the average bits gained per event. That is, each time there is a match up or truth booth, how many bits of information did they gain?\n\nA sensible benchmark: How do the contestants stack up against something that employed a strategy of randomly selecting match ups and truth booths?\n\nFor this sensible benchmark, I simulated over 100 fake seasons of \"Are you the one?\" to see how much information was gained if the match ups and truth booths were selected (almost4) arbitrarily.\n\nThe performance of the random simulated models was . Let's plot all the simulations on a graph, with trendlines for random and actual performance:\n\nSo the actual performance hits the x-axis sooner, meaning it's able to zero-in on the perfect match earlier. That's reassuring, right? Maybe love is real after all. That, or they're just performing better than someone shooting fish in a barrel. Here's the numbers behind this comparison:\n\nThe success rate is calculated as the number of seasons in which they're able to mathematically determine the perfect match before the game finishes. As you can see the success rate for the random simulation is higher than in real life. The sample of size of only 7 seasons of \"Are you the one?\" undoubtedly is too small for this to be a useful comparison.\n\nNow that we know the contestants make better decisions than randomly selecting pairings, the remaining question is exactly how much better. To show this, we'll employ our information theory strategy that we used for \"Guess Who?\" to this game.\n\nThis simulation works similarly to the random simulation, only the mechanism for selecting pairings is different. That is, the pairings that are selected for either a truth booth or a match up are the ones that are statistically likeliest to give the most information.\n\nSuppose we have calculated the expected information gained by potential truth booths like below:\n\nThe model would therefore pick and as it's the most likely to give it the most information.\n\nMatch ups work similarly, however we know that it's not a simple true or false question. Instead, we've got to calculate the information we would gain for every score between 0 and 10 (where 10 is the number of couples), for every viable matching.\n\nI ran this information theory simulation 41 times (for no other reason than I got bored waiting), and saw it perform significantly better than random simulation or real life data:\n\nThis means that, all you need is a bit of code and a can-do attitude to perform better than the \"vibes\" approach of the contestants in the show. Before you pop the champagne, we still haven't shown if this is good enough such that we get to the perfect match before we run out of time (or episodes). In a game of , the problem space is (for brevity, you can take my word for this), which is bits of information. This means you would need to gain bits of information per event minimum to ensure that you go into the final match up knowing for certain what the perfect match is.\n\nWait, isn't that a lower number than the random simulation? Doesn't that mean that someone shooting fish in a barrel could win this game? I should stress that these are averages, and in 26% of random simulations they didn't get to there in time.\n\nHopefully now you agree with me that \"Are you the one?\" is free money, albeit with a just about near-perfect success rate. I showed that even picking pairings at random will more often than not give you enough information to win the game, as well as showing how to use classic information theory practices to get you there with episodes to spare. Maybe this haemorrhaging of money is what got the show cancelled in the first place, or maybe love is real, whatever you prefer.\n\nThis post is my first foray into content like this. I wanted to scratch the itch of an interesting maths problem, with a light-hearted spin that I hope you enjoyed as much as I did making it. The techniques shown in this post are very common information theory approaches, though I was inspired to apply them based on this video on wordle by 3Blue1Brown. I very rarely watch youtube videos over 10 minutes long (maybe that's my loss), but I wholly recommend this one if you found this interesting.\n\nOther than that, in my research I came across a boardgame called Mastermind, which has been around since the 70s. This is a very similar premise - think of it as \"Guess Who?\" on hard mode.\n\nI also pitched this idea to The Pudding, and had a great experience with them nerding out about this subject. Though they didn't take my up on my idea, I left with really great and actionable feedback, and I'm looking forward to my next rejection.\n\nNext steps for me would be to see if I can make a web-based game (don't hold me to this) on this theme. I'm interested in how people would intuitively make decisions based on information gained so far so the plan would be to see if I can find a way to capture that, and ideally make it fun.\n\nFinally, the code for my OR Tools model can also be found here.",

    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nWhen a zygote begins cell division at a rapid rate, errors happen, and a new study found that base pairs near a gene’s transcription state sites (TSS) are particularly vulnerable.\n\nFinding this new source of mutation could improve modeling by accurately reflecting the baseline mutations of these vulnerable regions.\n\nThe biological process of a zygote eventually transforming into a living, breathing human is one of the true masterpieces of evolution—but the process is far from perfect. Mutations, malformities, and strange fusions can cause a variety of birth defects and other kinds of biological strangeness (such as chimerism).\n\nNow, in a new study published in the journal Nature Communications, a team of scientists (from the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain, and Harvard Medical School in Boston) has identified a “weakness” in DNA that may drive mosaic mutations—a subset of post-zygotic mutations that can create different cell lines in one person. The vulnerable region is located within the first 100 base pairs following the beginning of genes, which are known as transcription start sites (TSS).\n\n“These sequences are extremely prone to mutations and rank among the most functionally important regions in the entire human genome, together with protein-coding sequences,” Donate Weghorn, the senior author of the study from the Center for Genomic Regulation, said in a press statement. “Finding a new source of mutations, particularly those affecting the human germline, doesn't happen often.”\n\nThe authors discovered that these mosaic mutations usually took place after conception during the first stages of cell division in the embryo. This is similar to chimerism in some respects, but mosaic mutations occur from a single zygote, whereas chimerism typically involves the fusion of two fertilized eggs that create different cell lines.\n\nWhile chimera cells are typically present throughout the entire body, these mosaic mutations are not as evenly distributed, which is why they’ve remained undetected until now. In fact, a person who carries these mutations may never notice due to a lack of symptoms. However, if offspring inherit these genetic changes, they can carry over to every living cell and cause a variety of health issues and defects.\n\nTo uncover this well-hidden vulnerability, scientists relied on the Genome Aggregation Database (which gathers genomic data from a variety of human sequencing projects) and the U.K. Biobank to create a pool of some 225,000 transcription start sites. This data was then cross-referenced with eleven family studies that provided details about mosaic mutations specifically. Within these vulnerable TSS regions, researchers found mutations in the starting regions of genes impacting cancer, brain function, and abnormal limb development.\n\nLuckily, there is some good news. Rare variants of mutations (typically indicating a recent genetic change) contained a particularly strong concentration of mutations, but those changes lessened in more common variants. This suggests that natural selection slowly removed these mutations, and over generations in particular families, they eventually disappeared entirely.\n\nThis research could help improve the challenging study of mosaic mutations, which are hard to pinpoint compared to mutations present in every parent cell. It could also fine-tune genome mutation models, which might currently set the baseline mutation number at these TSS regions too low and thus alter the outcome of the model.\n\n“If a model doesn’t know this region is naturally mutation-rich, it might expect, say, 10 mutations but observe 50. If the correct baseline is 80, then 50 means fewer than expected and is a sign harmful changes are being removed by natural selection,” Weghorn said in a press statement. “You would completely miss the importance of that gene.”\n\nA zygote’s first moment of existence is one of chaos and a building pressure to grow, divide, and grow again. While cells can often repair errors that pop up, some mistakes get left behind. Now, scientists have a whole new area to analyze when trying to solve a mutation mystery.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nArchaeologists uncovered a 4,000–5,000-year-old ceremonial temple in Peru, revealing ancient walls, friezes, and a central staircase likely used for early ritual performances.\n\nThe team also found three adult skeletons and a possible offering, offering new clues about early religious practices and a little-known culture that existed before documented Andean civilizations.\n\nA second, later temple from 600–700 A.D. was also discovered, including the remains of a young child, showing how complex belief systems evolved in the region across thousands of years.\n\nArchaeologists recently found the lost ruins of a ceremonial temple—covered in sand and 4,000 to 5,000 years old—in northwestern Peru. The excavation team first discovered the walls, and subsequently unearthed a mix of features indicating that the structure was once a temple. And then came the skeletal remains of three adults tucked between walls.\n\n“We may be facing a 5,000-year-old religious site that constitutes an architectural space defined by walls built by rammed earth,” Luis Armando Muro Ynoñán, director of the Cultural Landscapes Archaeological Project of Ucupe — Valle de Zaña, said in a translated statement from the Peruvian Ministry of Culture.\n\nThe oldest portion of the site features not only the up-to-5,000-year-old walls, but also various architectural features that help define the site as a ceremonial temple. “We have what would have been a central staircase from which one would ascend to a kind of stage in the central part,” Muro Ynoñán said, noting that the stage could have hosted ritual performances in front of an audience.\n\nThe ruins include friezes with images of cats, the claws of a reptile, and a human body with the head of a bird. The designs are preserved in “fine plaster,” which has helped scientists nail down the exact age of the site and the origins of the religion. The team plans to study the chemical makeup of the pigments in the murals painted on the walls to help confirm how old the site is this fall.\n\nBut it wasn’t just architecture located in these sand dunes—there were human remains, too. According to Reuters, the excavation team located the remains of three adult bodies positioned between the walls of the temple. Nearby was also a bundle wrapped in linen that potentially served as an offering.\n\n“It was amazing,” said Muro Ynoñán, according to a statement from the Field Museum in Chicago. “This discovery tells us about the early origins of religion in Peru. We still know very little about how and under which circumstances complex belief systems emerged in the Andes, and now we have evidence about some of the earliest religious spaces that people were creating in this part of the world.”\n\nMuro Ynoñán said that the newfound temple likely contains more information about a people group that predated the known inhabitants of the region. “We don’t know what these people called themselves,” he said, “or how other people referred to them. All we know about them comes from what they created: their houses, temples, and funerary goods.”\n\nThe excavation team was invited to the site after the local government observed looting in the area. “It was so surprising that these very ancient structures were so close to the modern surface,” Muro Ynoñán said. “We think that a large temple was built into the side of the mountain, and we’ve found one section of it.”\n\nArchaeologists also found a more recent temple, dated to sometime between 600 and 700 A.D. Muro Ynoñán believes the second site comes from the Moche culture. This one also features remains—those of a young child, possibly between 5 and 6 years old—but from a more recent time.\n\n“The people here created complex religious systems and perceptions about their cosmos,” Muro Ynoñán said. “Religion was an important aspect of the emergence of political authority.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Newly released videos show six Israeli hostages celebrating Hanukkah in a tunnel in Gaza months before they were killed by Hamas in August 2024.\n\nTwo of the clips show the hostages gingerly lighting makeshift candles on a menorah made of disposable cups. The hostages – Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Ori Danino, and Alex Lobanov – say the Jewish blessings before lighting the candles in what would have been early-December 2023.\n\nIn a video that appears to be from the second night of the holiday, Sarusi smiles at the camera and says, “Now it’s the holiday of Hanukkah. Happy holiday to us and to all the people of Israel. We should celebrate every year and be happy and joyous, and with the help of this holiday’s miracles, we’ll get home with a great miracle, and return to a normal and happy life, and be happy – all of us.”\n\nThe six hostages in the videos were killed as Israeli forces drew closer to their position, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which said at the time that they were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, a short while before we reached them.”\n\nThe incident is widely considered one of the most painful moments of the war for Israelis and sparked fresh outrage at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to secure a hostage deal. Three of the six hostages were expected to be released in the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe videos, released by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum on Thursday, provide a glimpse into the life of the hostages during their captivity. All of the videos, which were first aired in full by Channel 12’s UVDA, are watermarked “From materials captured by the IDF.”\n\nThroughout the war, Hamas had released propaganda videos showing Israeli hostages pleading with the Israeli government or US President Donald Trump to secure their release. But these videos and still images, which the forum says were filmed by Hamas, show part of the hostages’ time in the tunnels under Gaza.\n\nIn two short clips, some of the hostages can be seen playing cards or chess while sitting on mats on the floor. In another, a member of Hamas sets some fruit on the floor between the group.\n\nOne video shows the hostages counting down on New Year’s Eve. As they reach zero, they stand up for a group hug as they say “Happy New Year” to each other. The hostages appear relaxed in the clip as they look into the camera and share their hopes for release.\n\n“Happy New year to everyone, all of the families, all of the people of Israel,” says Yerushalmi. “We’re very much waiting to come home.”\n\nGoldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American dual citizen, waves at the camera as he says, “We’re here, healthy, alive – they’re taking care of us, we’re ok. We want to return home.” His left arm, partially blown off in a grenade attack on October 7, 2023, is visible in the video.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the release of the videos, the forum said, “Hamas filmed these videos as propaganda, but the humanity of the beautiful six shines through this footage. The entire world must see our loved ones in these moments, their unity, strength, and humanity even in the darkest times.”",

    "fullText": "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration has not sold off his multimillion-dollar stake in the airline he led since 1999 despite a promise to do so as part of his ethics agreement, according to a Democratic senator.\n\nIn a letter to Bryan Bedford this week, Sen. Maria Cantwell said he vowed to sell all his shares in Republic Airways within 90 of his confirmation but 150 days have now passed. In Bedford's financial disclosures, he estimated that his Republic stock was worth somewhere between $6 million and $30 million.\n\nRepublic completed a merger last month with another major regional airline, Mesa Air Group. Republic's stock closed Thursday at $19.02, nearly double what it was before the deal was announced in April.\n\n“It appears you continue to retain significant equity in this conflicting asset months past the deadline set to fully divest from Republic, which constitutes a clear violation of your ethics agreement. This is unacceptable and demands a full accounting,” Cantwell said in the letter.\n\nBedford declined a request for comment, and an FAA spokesperson said he plans to respond directly to Cantwell.\n\nThe agency has been in the spotlight since January, when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. The investigation has already highlighted shortcomings at the FAA, which failed to recognize an alarming number of close calls around Reagan National Airport in the years beforehand.\n\nThen, in the spring, technical problems at the center that directs planes into New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport highlighted a fragile and outdated system relied on by air traffic controllers.\n\nAnd in the fall, a longstanding shortage of controllers led to thousands of flight cancellations and delays during the longest government shutdown ever as more controllers missed work while going without a paycheck.\n\nBedford has pledged to prioritize safety and upgrade the nation’s outdated air traffic control system. Congress approved $12.5 billion for that project, and last week the FAA picked the company that will oversee the work.",

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rains drenched Gaza’s tent camps and dropping temperatures chilled Palestinians huddling inside them Thursday as winter storm Byron descended on the war-battered territory, showing how two months of a ceasefire have failed to sufficiently address the spiraling humanitarian crisis there.\n\nFamilies found their possessions and food supplies soaked inside their tents. Children’s sandaled feet disappeared under opaque brown water that flooded the camps, running knee deep in some places. Dirt roads turned to mud. Piles of garbage and sewage cascaded like waterfalls.\n\n“We have been drowned. I don’t have clothes to wear and we have no mattresses left,” said Um Salman Abu Qenas, a displaced mother in a Khan Younis tent camp. She said that her family couldn't sleep the night before, because of the water in the tent.\n\nAid groups say not enough shelter materials are getting into Gaza during the truce. Figures recently released by Israel's military suggest it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, though Israel disputes that finding.\n\n“Cold, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments heighten the risk of illness and infection,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X. “This suffering could be prevented by unhindered humanitarian aid, including medical support and proper shelter.\"\n\nSabreen Qudeeh, also in the Khan Younis camp, in a squalid area known as Muwasi, said that her family woke up to rain leaking from their tent's ceiling and water from the street soaking their mattresses.\n\n“My little daughters were screaming,” she said.\n\nAhmad Abu Taha, also living in the camp, said there wasn't a tent that escaped the flooding. “Conditions are very bad, we have old people, displaced, and sick people inside this camp,” he said.\n\nFloods in south-central Israel trapped more than a dozen people in their cars, according to Hebrew media. Israel's rescue services, MDA, said that two young girls were slightly injured when a tree fell on their school.\n\nThe contrasting scenes with Gaza made clear how profoundly the Israel-Hamas war had damaged the territory, destroying the majority of homes. Gaza’s population of around 2 million is almost entirely displaced, and most people live in vast tent camps stretching along the coast, or set up among the shells of damaged buildings without adequate flooding infrastructure and with cesspits dug near tents as toilets.\n\nAt least three buildings in Gaza City already damaged by Israeli bombardment during the war partially collapsed under the rain, Palestinian Civil Defense said. It warned people not to stay inside damaged buildings, saying they too could fall down on top of them.\n\nThe agency also said that since the storm began, they have received more than 2,500 distress calls from people across Gaza whose tents and shelters were damaged.\n\nWith buckets and mops, Palestinians laboriously scooped water out of their tents.\n\nAliaa Bahtiti said her 8-year-old son \"was soaked overnight, and in the morning he had turned blue, sleeping on water.” Her tent floor had an inch of water on it “We cannot buy food, covers, towels, or sheets to sleep on.”\n\nBaraka Bhar was caring for her 3-month-old twins inside her tent as the rain poured outside. One of the twins has hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluids in the brain.\n\n“Our tents are worn out ... and they leak rain water,” she said. “We should not lose our children this winter.”\n\nAid groups say that Israel isn't allowing enough aid into Gaza to begin rebuilding the territory after years of war.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel agreed to comply with aid stipulations from an earlier January truce, which specified that it allow 600 trucks of aid each day into Gaza, It maintains it's doing so, but The Associated Press found that some of its own figures call that into question.\n\nThe January truce also specified that Israel let in a number of caravans and tents. No caravans have yet entered Gaza during the ceasefire, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli group advocating for Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, said on Dec. 9 it had “lately\" let 260,000 tents and tarpaulins into Gaza and more than 1,500 trucks of blankets and warm clothing.\n\nShelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, sets the number lower. It says the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations have gotten 15,590 tents into Gaza since the truce began, and other countries have sent about 48,000. Many of the tents aren't properly insulated, it says.\n\nAmjad al-Shawa, Gaza chief of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that only a fraction of the 300,000 tents needed had entered Gaza. He said that Palestinians were in dire need of warmer winter clothes and accused Israel of blocking the entry of water pumps to help clear flooded shelters..\n\n\"All international sides should take the responsibility regarding conditions in Gaza,” he said. “There is real danger for people in Gaza at all levels.”\n\nKhaled Mashaal, a Hamas leader, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Gaza needs the rehabilitation of hospitals, the entry of heavy machinery to remove rubble, and the opening of the Rafah crossing — which remains closed after Israel said last week it would shortly open.\n\nCOGAT didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims that Israel wasn’t allowing water pumps or heavy machinery into Gaza\n\nAmnesty accuses Hamas of crimes against humanity\n\nAmnesty International said in a report released Thursday that Hamas and other militant groups committed crimes against humanity in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 173-page report, Amnesty pointed to what it found to be widespread and systematic killing of civilians in the attack, as well as torture, hostage-taking and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the attack, Hamas fighters and other militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 others hostage. Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 70,300 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. Last year, Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denied.\n\nAmnesty said it conducted interviews with 70 people, including 17 survivors of the attack and family members of some of those killed. It also reviewed hundreds of open-source videos and photos from the day of the attack.\n\nContrary to Hamas claims it was targeting the military, it said, the attack was intentionally “directed against a civilian population” and met international law standards for crimes against humanity.\n\nIt said sexual assaults were also committed, though it said it could not reach a conclusion on their “scope or scale.” It interviewed one man who testified he was raped by armed men at the Nova music festival, as well as a therapist who said she provided intensive treatment to three other survivors of rape.\n\nHamas condemned the report, saying it “echoed false claims” by Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister spokesperson Oren Marmorstein derided the report in a posting on X, saying it took more than two years for Amnesty to address the attack “and even now its report falls far short of reflecting the full scope of Hamas’s horrific atrocities.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly two dozen House Republicans joined Democrats Thursday to pass a bill that would restore collective bargaining rights for hundreds of thousands of federal employees, an attempt to overturn an executive order that President Donald Trump issued earlier this year.\n\nThe measure passed 231-195 after reaching the floor through a bipartisan maneuver that bypassed GOP leadership — a so-called “discharge” tactic that is being used with growing frequency as Republicans seethe over dysfunction in the chamber. The bill still needs Senate approval to become law, but 20 Republicans sided with Democrats in a rare break from the president.\n\nThe executive order that Trump issued in March aimed to end collective bargaining for employees of agencies with national security missions across the federal government. He said he had the authority to revoke the rights under a 1978 law.\n\n“Reinstating these rights is not a concession — it is a commitment. A commitment to treat federal workers with dignity, to reinforce a resilient public service, and to honor the commitment of the men and women who show up for the American people every single day,” GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a co-sponsor of the bill, said on the floor before passage.\n\nTrump's order targeted the union rights of roughly 600,000 of the 800,000 federal workers represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, including those at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.\n\nThe union is challenging those moves in court, arguing they are illegal and retaliatory. In May, an appeals court said the administration could move forward with the executive order while the lawsuit plays out.\n\nIn a statement after Thursday's vote, the AFGE said it “extends its deep appreciation to every member of Congress who voted for the bill.” The group's president, Everett Kelley, called it a “seismic victory.”\n\nThe bill's approval was also praised by the AFL-CIO, the biggest labor federation in the U.S.\n\n“We commend the Republicans and Democrats who stood with workers and voted to reverse the single largest act of union-busting in American history,” said Liz Shuler, the group's president.\n\nThe bill reached the floor through a discharge petition led by Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine. It’s a tactic that has been used with increasingly frequency this Congress due to frustrations with GOP leadership, including in the high-profile push to force release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Any lawmakers can force a vote on legislation if their petition gains 218 signatures, a majority in the 435-member House.\n\nAll House Democrats who voted supported the measure to restore the bargaining rights. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries supported the bill, saying on the floor prior to its passage that it would help “public servants who have been targeted viciously by the Trump administration from the very beginning of his time in office.”\n\nWhile passage in the Republican-held Senate appears unlikely, the vote represented one of the chamber’s first formal rebukes of the president and the flurry of executive orders he has issued during his second term.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStill, most of the Republicans who backed the bill still held back from directly calling out the president. Speaking on the House floor before voting in favor of the bill, New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler said that “earlier this year, an executive order changed the collective bargaining status.”\n\n“Every American deserves a voice in the workplace, and that includes the people who keep our government running and open,” said Lawler.\n\nOf the 20 Republicans who backed the bill, many, including Fitzpatrick, face tough reelections next year. It comes at a time when some Republicans, following Trump's lead, have become more supportive of labor unions, long a key part of the Democratic Party's coalition.\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who switched parties in Trump's first term, was among the Republicans to support the bill, but told reporters prior to the vote that he wasn't trying to send a message to the president with his vote.\n\n“No message here at all,” said Van Drew. “This is a New Jersey message. I got to take care of my people. And I’ve always been supportive of unions.”",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Switzerland have arrested the husband of a former finalist for Miss Switzerland, alleging that he strangled her to death before dismembering her and blending her body parts.\n\nKristina Joksimovic was killed during the February of 2024, according to the BBC.\n\nPolice referred to the 38-year-old beauty queen by her initials in court documents, which further noted she was a finalist in the Miss Switzerland competition back in 2007. Swiss media has identified the husband — who is not named in the docs — as Thomas. Investigators, however, did reveal that the suspect is a 43-year-old male.\n\nThomas has been formally charged with his wife's murder as well as disturbing the peace, prosecutors announced on Thursday, December 10.\n\nThomas had previously told investigators that when he returned to their Binningen home the night of the murder, he found Joksimovic already dead. But less than a month later, the husband was changing his tune, according to police. He allegedly later told detectives he had actually killed his wife in an act of self-defense.\n\nBut forensic experts later determined Joksimovic had been beheaded Joksimovic prior to her death, and that her remains showed no signs of a struggle, contradicting her husband's account of the events.\n\nDetectives started investigating Joksimovic's death almost immediately after it happened, noting its suspicious nature, but her husband was not officially charged with the beauty queen's murder until this month, according to prosecutors.\n\nThrough an autopsy, medical examiners were able to determine the husband allegedly dismembered Joksimovic using a jigsaw and garden shears.\n\nThe reports further claim police said that the victim's womb had been \"carefully removed\" by Thomas as part of a \"deliberate mutilation or ritualized degradation of the body.\"\n\nThe husband allegedly proceeded to slice up her body parts and then used an industrial grade blender to liquefy her remains.\n\nLindsay Shiver Set to Be Released on Bail After Allegedly Plotting to Kill Estranged Husband\n\nLocal reports described the body as having been \"puréed.\" The husband also allegedly added a chemical dissolvent to help break down his wife's body.\n\nAs he cut up her remains, the husband allegedly watched videos on YouTube.\n\nJoksimovic and Thomas have two young children together.\n\nUs Weekly was unable to determine if the husband has been asked to enter pleas to the two charges filed against him. It was also unclear if he had hired an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nLocal media is reporting Joksimovic's own father found her remains, after noticing strands of blonde hair sticking out of a black bag.\n\nThe husband will remain in custody until his next court date, which has not been set yet.\n\nAccording to her Instagram profile, Joksimovic primarily worked as a modeling coach. Her page features instructional videos on mastering the catwalk as well as footage of her working with her clients on their walks.\n\nIf you or someone you love is experiencing domestic violence, you are encouraged to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799-7233 or visit thehotline.org.

An August note said that store inventory was \"very high\" as the brand tried to clear aged stock.\n\nA July Jefferies note, analysts said some of the stores they visited were missing critical stock, like the brand's yoga leggings without front seams.\n\nLululemon reported a third-quarter revenue of $2.6 billion, a 7% increase from the same period last year. Its net revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, while its international sales increased 33%, buoyed by strong sales in China.\n\nMcDonald announced in the call that he would be stepping down at the end of January. Frank, as well as the CCO, André Maestrini, will serve as interim co-CEOs until the company finds a replacement for McDonald.\n\nIts stock rose more than 10% in after-hours trading on Thursday after earnings and the announcement of McDonald's resignation. However, it's down about 50% since the start of the year.",

    "fullText": "If you're waiting for Michael Burry to tell you when the AI bubble will burst, don't hold your breath.\n\nIn Burry's new post on his Substack, the famed \"Big Short\" investor said that there \"is no way to time or predict\" the bubble pop, especially when the bubble may still have room to grow.\n\n\"Shorts are almost always short-term trades. Usually less than a year, maybe a couple years at most,\" wrote Burry. \"Not 5 years, not 10 years.\"\n\n\"I believe today the stock market is in a phase that could become a blow off top of extreme magnitude on the upside, while at any time, maybe even today or tomorrow, making a generational top,\" Burry added.\n\nIn the lengthy blog post, Burry answered reader questions on his earlier posts. He argued that there is \"supply-side gluttony,\" meaning massive data-center build-outs, GPU orders, and multibillion-dollar commitments without real end-user demand, which investors are mistaking for supply-chain activity. He attributed much of the hype to being driven by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's marketing.\n\n\"Even when it finally tops, it will not be for any specific reason,\" Burry said later in the post. \"Even if the reason is an AI buildout bubble popping, that will likely not be apparent until a year or two later.\"\n\n\"Mostly, it is prudent neither to short stocks nor to buy puts on stocks. Stocks that are obviously overvalued tend to have the most upward momentum yet have puts that are very expensive,\" Burry added.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's latest digs.\n\nIn November, Burry launched a paywalled Substack called Cassandra Unchained. After posting charts on X that show circulatory investment deals between Nvidia and other tech giants, his first post took aim at Nvidia. He called the chipmaking giant \"a Cisco\" in the AI bubble debate, referring to the internet-networking giant whose stock plunged by over 75% during the dot-com crash.\n\nNvidia released a note to Wall Street analysts in late November, pushing back against some of Burry's claims.\n\nEarlier in November, during Nvidia's Q3 earnings call, the CEO addressed concerns about the AI bubble.\n\n\"From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" Huang told investors, \"We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\"",

    "description": "Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says robotaxis are a \"trillion-dollar-plus\" business and he expects Asia to drive the wave of autonomous expansion.",
    "fullText": "Uber is preparing for a robotaxi surge, and its CEO says one market will drive it.\n\nDara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television published Friday that robotaxis are a \"trillion-dollar-plus\" opportunity and Asia is a huge growth market for the ride-hailing giant.\n\n\"I expect to be in 10-plus markets by next year. And we want those markets to be in the Asia-Pacific region as well,\" Khosrowshahi said. Uber has self-driving vehicles in the US and the Middle East.\n\nAnalysts have long touted autonomous mobility as one of the biggest bets in the transportation industry. In 2023, McKinsey estimated that if robotaxis and roboshuttles scale, the shared-mobility market could reach $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nKhosrowshahi said Japan has \"great potential\" for its robotaxi push, despite being behind in regulation.\n\n\"With an aging population, there's a real need for transportation, not just in the large cities but in the rural areas,\" he added. He also pointed to Hong Kong and Australia as potential key markets for its robotaxi services.\n\nKhosrowshahi said Uber now works with more than 20 autonomous-vehicle partners — including China's Baidu, WeRide, and Pony.ai, as well as Waymo in the US.\n\n\"We will have access to autonomous technologies in the large cities and markets that really count,\" he added.\n\nWith a market that large, Khosrowshahi said autonomous driving is unlikely to be a \"winner-take-all\" industry.\n\n\"It's an exciting technology, but there are many players getting to the finish line,\" he said.\n\n\"We just have to make sure that the players that we work with are safe and that again, we're working with the regulators in a constructive manner,\" he added.\n\nUber has been leaning hard into autonomous driving. During its third-quarter earnings call in November, Khosrowshahi said the company is already seeing signs that robotaxis can boost demand.\n\n\"The biggest scale operations that we've got are with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And what we are seeing is that those markets are growing faster than other US markets,\" he added.\n\nOther industry leaders have also been hyping the sector.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly said that robotaxis will power the company's growth. In May, Musk said in an interview with CNBC that Tesla would hit one million self-driving cars by the end of next year, a claim he also made in 2019 that did not materialize.\n\nThe path to profitability remains murky. HSBC analysts warned in July that the robotaxi market has been \"widely overestimated,\" and said it could be years before fleets make real money.\n\nEven the most advanced players are burning cash. Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" division — which includes Waymo, as well as other subsidiaries — lost $1.42 billion in the third quarter.\n\nThe cost of an autonomous driving vehicle is steep. Analysts estimate that each Waymo vehicle costs about $150,000 to produce. The high costs have squeezed some companies out of the robotaxi market, including Ford and General Motors.",

    "description": "Russia saw a surge in consumer spending after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, even as sweeping sanctions hit the economy.",
    "fullText": "After years of wartime splurging, Russian shoppers are tightening their grip on their wallets — a shift that hints at growing stress in the country's economy.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has weakened across most regions, the Central Bank of Russia said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nIn October and November, demand softened even as unemployment remained near historic lows and inflation expectations ticked higher.\n\n\"According to retailers across the country, an increasing share of products are being purchased during promotions, sales, and discounts. Household behavior has become more frugal,\" according to the central bank report.\n\nRetailers in many regions report weakening demand for big-ticket and nonessential goods, marking a clear cooling after the post-2022 consumer boom.\n\n\"More subdued consumption may indicate a gradual reduction in labor market overheating and more moderate expectations for future income dynamics,\" wrote Russia's central bank.\n\nIt's a notable shift for an economy that witnessed a boom in consumer spending after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, even amid sweeping sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThat boom was fueled by surging defense spending and intense competition for scarce workers. Wages jumped, and many households went on spending sprees.\n\nNow, that momentum appears to be fading.\n\nWage growth has slowed, and firms across multiple regions report reduced manpower demand and less urgency to hire, reflecting a cooling labor market, according to the central bank report.\n\nMany firms told the central bank they expect even more modest wage increases in 2026, suggesting that households may be bracing for leaner times.\n\nThe central bank's latest report arrives as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, and the limits of wartime economic stimulus become more apparent.\n\nOil and gas revenues — the backbone of Russia's budget — dropped 34% year-over-year in November.\n\nEven before this, analysts had warned that Russia's economy was being sustained largely by defense spending, subsidies, and emergency policy interventions.\n\nTop officials had sounded alarms. In December 2023, Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank governor, warned that the economy was at risk of overheating.\n\nLast June, the head of Russia's largest bank said the economy was \"definitely and strongly overheated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a deepening demographic crisis and ongoing competition for labor between the military and industry continue to weigh on Russia's growth prospects, both now and in the years ahead.",

    "description": "At least four provinces will be using the sales of their American liquor to fund food banks and charities.",
    "fullText": "Canada is coming up with ways to put its stockpiled American liquor to good use.\n\nSeveral provinces in the country halted imports of US booze and removed it from store shelves in March in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nNow, at least four provinces are planning to sell the remaining inventory and donate proceeds to food banks.\n\nCanada's far eastern province, Prince Edward Island, told Business Insider that its government will put its stock of American booze, which it had pulled off the shelves, back in stores starting on December 11.\n\nA representative for the province's finance department said the government anticipates profits of $600,000 Canadian dollars, or about $434,000, from the sale. The proceeds will be distributed to food banks across the island. The province says it does not intend to place any further orders for American alcohol.\n\nThe finance office of Newfoundland and Labrador told Business Insider it had made an upfront payment of $500,000 on Tuesday to 60 provincial food banks before the sales of any liquors, a move that will help more than 15,400 people. After the liquor is sold, more donations will go to the food banks for a total sum of up to $1 million.\n\nManitoba and Nova Scotia have similar plans.\n\nManitoba said it will sell its inventory through private retailers and restaurants, with the estimated $500,000 in net revenue going to food banks, holiday charities, children's organizations, and an advocacy group for First Nations.\n\nAs for Nova Scotia, the province is making a $4 million upfront payment to groups that provide food access, and the money will be recouped when the $14 million worth of liquor is eventually sold.\n\n\"We will not be ordering any more from the United States once this inventory is gone,\" the province's premier, Tim Houston, said in a statement. \"But Nova Scotians have already paid for this product.\"\n\nHe added, \"We don't want it to go to waste. That's why we're selling it and using the proceeds to help those in need.\"\n\nIn Canada, the sale of alcohol is mainly controlled by provincial governments, each of which establishes a board to oversee the matter. Only Alberta has a completely privatized alcohol retail system, while Saskatchewan has a partially privatized system.\n\nCanada mainly imports whiskey and bourbon, alongside beer and other spirits, from the US.\n\nA spokesperson for Ontario's finance ministry told Business Insider that the province had no plans to put the booze on store shelves soon.\n\n\"US alcohol will remain off shelves and is being held in storage until further notice,\" said the spokesperson. \"We are currently exploring options for the products.\"\n\nOntario did not disclose how much inventory it still has, but the province said the inventory it had pulled off the shelves in March was worth around C$80 million.\n\nA government representative from the Northwest Territories and a spokesperson of the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch both told Business Insider that they ceased US liquor imports in March, but will continue selling the stockpiled products until they are depleted.\n\nA Yukon government cabinet representative said Yukon has the same plan.\n\nHowever, the mountainous province of Alberta continues to import and sell American booze.\n\n\"In June this year, Alberta lifted restrictions on the purchase of US alcohol from American companies, signalling a renewed commitment to open and fair trade with our largest partner,\" a spokesperson of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction told Business Insider.\n\nThe matter of US booze has been fueling the trade tension between the two neighbors.\n\nThe animosity started when Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canada in March and commented that Canada should become a state of the US.\n\nDespite later walking back some of his broader tariffs and upholding a previous agreement that ensured most goods remain tariff-free, Trump's moves have drawn the ire of Canadians, who have canceled travel plans and boycotted American goods in stores.\n\nAccording to the Distilled Spirits Council, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025, falling below $10 million in export value.\n\n\"We hope both the US and Canada can address their respective concerns,\" said Chris Swonger, the CEO of the council. \"And that our products can return to Canadian retail shelves as soon as possible.\"\n\nIn March, Kentucky's bourbon makers said Canada's ban on American alcohol would hurt them.\n\nEric Gregory, the president of the Kentucky Distillers' Association, said in March that retaliatory tariffs would have \"far-reaching consequences across Kentucky, home to 95% of the world's bourbon.\"",

    "title": "What smart people are saying about Disney's licensing deal with OpenAI",
    "description": "OpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property.",
    "fullText": "It's likely just a matter of time before we see the wisened duo of Rafiki and Jiminy Cricket weilding lightsabers on the icy plains of Arendelle.\n\nThat's courtesy of artificial intelligence, of course, and a new deal between Disney and OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property. Disney will also invest $1 billion in OpenAI and will purchase ChatGPT Enterprise for its employees.\n\nIt's a major shift for Disney, which has historically been deeply protective of its intellectual property. And it's a big win for OpenAI, which is on a quest for more content to feed its AI models.\n\nFor users, the deal will enable them to recreate Disney characters on Sora, OpenAI's short-form video generation app, and to create images of Disney characters using ChatGPT.\n\nBeyond the limitless possibilities for creative content, the deal reveals a lot about Disney's strategy in the AI age and the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nFor Nick Cicero, the founder of Delmondo, a social media video analytics company that was acquired by Conviva in 2018, Disney's deal with OpenAI is less about AI and more about revenue.\n\nCicero argued in an X post on Thursday that Disney was aiming to solve two \"existential\" problems: creators using unauthorized Disney content and kids watching YouTube instead of Disney+.\n\n\"Sora gives Disney its first scalable way to pull creator-made content into its own premium ecosystem — brand-safe, trackable, legal, and ready for CTV monetization,\" he said, referring to the practice of delivering targeted advertising to internet-connected televisions.\n\n\"This move isn't about tech,\" he added. \"It's about revenue physics.\"\n\nChatbots like ChatGPT rely on data to power their outputs, and when it comes to collecting that data, AI companies are insatiable.\n\nThe drive to collect data often pits AI companies against content creators. Numerous media companies have sued OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other leading AI outfits for using their copyrighted content without permission. Other media companies, like Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, have struck deals with AI companies to license their content.\n\nPeter Csathy, a longtime media consultant and analyst, said Disney's deal with OpenAI is a \"watershed\" moment for AI and media licensing.\n\n\"Now THIS is a generative AI use that makes sense to me and I support,\" Csathy wrote on LinkedIn. \"Fully licensed characters, thereby respecting copyright and embracing partnership with the creative community (rather than theft of IP). New revenue streams for IP rights-holders. And overall delight by fans of those beloved characters.\"\n\nThere are just so many cease-and-desist letters a media lawyer can send.\n\nCarline Giegerich, a vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau who once led emerging tech at HBO, says Disney's deal with OpenAI feels like a \"can't beat 'em, join 'em\" moment.\n\n\"When I was at HBO from '05 - '09, I marveled at the sheer volume of cease and desists from the legal team when mobile video was up and coming,\" she wrote on LinkedIn. \"I thought it seemed difficult to fight against the entire internet, and it turns out it was. And AI presents a similar challenge.\"\n\nShe also said the deal presents a valuable marketing opportunity for Disney.\n\n\"Important to note that a selection of these fan-created videos will be available to stream on Disney+. What that means to me is that Disney sees this also as a marketing and content opportunity, which it is,\" she said.\n\nDisney's pivot from aggressively defending its IP at every turn to giving it over to the world's leading AI startup might be strategic for another reason.\n\nJames Miller, the head of business development at Amazon for media, entertainment, and Amazon Creators, said he suspects it's a matter of \"controlling the inevitable.\"\n\nAny IP eventually enters the public domain. In 2024, the copyright for Mickey Mouse himself — at least the sans white gloves version of the 1930s — expired, allowing anyone to use his likeness. Winnie the Pooh, Snow White, Cinderella, and a handful of other Disney characters also entered the public domain at the same time.\n\n\"By officially licensing these characters now, Disney does three things,\" Miller wrote on LinkedIn. \"1. Monetizes the AI trend rather than just fighting it in court. 2. Sets the quality standard for how their characters appear in AI video (likely drowning out lower-quality unauthorized versions). 3. Captures data on how fans want to use their IP before they lose exclusive rights.\"\n\nOne consumer expert said that Disney might have gotten the short end of the stick in this partnership.\n\n\"Looks like OpenAI used the #jedimindwarp on The Walt Disney Company, not the other way around,\" Karl Haller, an IBM partner and the leader of the firm's Consumer Center of Competency, said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nHe said he was \"more than a bit surprised\" to see that Disney is letting OpenAI license its IP for Sora and other AI tools, with some of the videos being made available to stream on Disney+.\n\n\"And what does Disney receive for this? Negative $1 billion,\" he wrote. \"Rather than receiving a heftly license fee, Disney is instead investing $1B in OpenAI and receiving warrants to buy \n\nOne entertainment lawyer pointed out that the deal comes with a lot of unanswered questions.\n\n\"This is a fairly stunning story all round with many questions,\" Simon Pullman, a partner at law firm Pryor Cashman, wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.\n\n\"Will audiences want/accept 'AI UGC' on Disney Plus,\" he wrote, referring to user-generated content. \"Will it be possible for Disney to unring the bell after three years and not extend the license? How will they protect against misuse and brand damage?\"\n\nDisney's $1 billion bet on AI is the right move for the media giant, according to Mike Walsh, the CEO of consulting firm Tomorrow.\n\n\"By partnering with OpenAI while suing Midjourney and warning Google, Disney is drawing a clear line,\" Walsh wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday. \"Remix culture isn't going away, but it will be licensed, governed, and designed on its terms.\"\n\nHe added that Disney has always survived new media eras with this strategy.\n\n\"The future of entertainment belongs to companies that shape participation instead of fighting it,\" he wrote.",

    "title": "John Aiken's journey from cricketer to MAFS expert",
    "description": "How a former first-class cricketer from New Zealand became one of television's most recognisable personalities.",
    "fullText": "It takes a lot for cricketers to be left starstruck by other cricketers.\n\nIt is the morning of the second day of the second Ashes Test. John Aiken is chatting in the courtyard of a Brisbane hotel when he is spotted by two former England spinners – Phil Tufnell and Alex Hartley.\n\nTuffers asks for a video to send to his wife and her friends. Hartley gets a selfie to put in the girls' WhatsApp group.\n\nAll standard stuff. As a relationship expert on Married at First Sight Australia (MAFS), Aiken is one of the most recognisable TV personalities in the country. If you've not seen it, the show does exactly what it says on the tin – strangers are matched then meet at the moment their wedding begins.\n\nThere are numerous versions, including in the UK, but it is the Australian brand that has a cult following across the globe.\n\nBut here's the thing. Neither Tufnell nor Hartley are aware they have just met a former first-class cricketer.\n\nAiken, a left-handed opening batter, had an 11-year career on the New Zealand domestic scene between 1990 and 2001. His Wikipedia page has the heading \"John Aiken (cricketer)\".\n\n\"I've kept in contact with a lot of the Black Caps that I played with as I was growing up,\" Aiken tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"I've stayed in touch with Mark Richardson, Chris Cairns, Chris Harris and Craig McMillan.\n\n\"What's strange now is they see me as the guy from MAFS, not so much the left-hander who played for Wellington.\"\n\nAiken is now 55. His post-cricket career has made him a household name in Australia. The day before, he was in the crowd at the Gabba and approached by a man in a \"pink Hawaiian shirt\" wanting to know about the 13th series of Married at First Sight, due to air in the new year.\n\nAlmost four decades ago, Aiken was taking his first steps in professional cricket. Born in Sydney, he moved to New Zealand at the age of 12 and made his way through the Wellington system.\n\nIn 1989, he was alongside Cairns, Harris and Adam Parore in a New Zealand Under-19s team that toured England to take on a home side including Mark Ramprakash, Dominic Cork and Darren Gough. Aiken even got to taste playing at Lord's.\n\n\"Nick Knight put us to the sword every single time we faced him,\" says Aiken.\n\nSix months later, Aiken was making his first-class debut for Wellington. He made 156 not out against Canterbury at the famous Lancaster Park in Christchurch.\n\n\"I was a bit more conservative than the likes of Ben Duckett, Michael Slater or Matthew Hayden,\" says Aiken. \"If I was playing today I'd have to change my game and be more attacking.\n\n\"The one thing that held me back was that I would over-analyse pretty much everything. I'd be up at night in front of the mirror, shadow batting, all that sort of thing.\"\n\nAiken combined his early years as a professional cricketer with studying for a master's degree in clinical and community psychology. Though he graduated at the age of 25 and psychology would eventually become his life, Aiken's first ambition was to play cricket for New Zealand.\n\nHe thinks he got \"close\", but never managed the weight of runs to earn a black cap.\n\nInstead, there were brushes with greatness in domestic cricket. New Zealand legends Martin Crowe and Stephen Fleming were team-mates at Wellington and an opponent was left-arm spinner and current Australia assistant coach Daniel Vettori. \"He landed it on a handkerchief,\" says Aiken.\n\nAiken regularly played against touring international teams and was run out in a one-day game by South Africa's Jonty Rhodes, probably the best fielder of all time.\n\n\"Any day of the week it was an easy single,\" says Aiken. \"I hit it into the gap, I said, yes, easy one. He ran me out by half the pitch.\"\n\nWhen Aiken left Wellington to join Auckland, he came up against a West Indies team including the great Brian Lara.\n\n\"We had a meeting the night before and we just said: 'Nobody say anything to Brian Lara,\" recalls Aiken. \"We greet him as Mr. Lara. We are polite. And if he gets bored, he may get out early. We all know that if you sledge him, he's likely to get 400.\n\n\"So sure enough, he walks out. 'Hello Mr Lara, how was your stay? How's it going?' It was delightful. He must have pumped our opening bowler out of the ground twice, then hit one up in the air and he was out. We all just breathed an immense sigh of collective relief.\"\n\nAnother opponent was a young wicketkeeper-batter from Otago called Brendon McCullum – now a MAFS watcher, on orders of Australian wife Elissa.\n\n\"Anyone from Otago, you've got to roll your sleeves up because they're going to come hard at you,\" says Aiken.\n\n\"He had a style where he was going to really make a name for himself right from the word go. I don't know him very well, but he doesn't seem someone who worries too much about what others have to say.\"\n\nHe registered a pair in his final first-class match, in February 2001. Aiken ended with four hundreds in 46 first-class matches, averaging just under 29. He made another ton in 39 List A matches.\n\nSeven years later, Aiken moved back to Australia and set up his own private practice \"seeing couples, singles, and minding my own business\". He had dabbled in some slots as a relationship expert in daytime TV, but it was an email he received in 2014 that would change his life.\n\nAiken was invited to audition for Married at First Sight and got the role. More than 11 years on, the show will air its 13th series in Australia in January and will follow in the UK in the spring. It is an Australian phenomenon, probably behind only children's cartoon Bluey as the current biggest TV export from this country.\n\nThe fascination of the show is not only whether two strangers can fall in love, but also the interactions of 12 different couples – usually with fiery consequences.\n\n\"It is unscripted, it is real and it is authentic, and you don't know what they're going to do,\" says Aiken.\n\nIt is Aiken's role to guide the couples and \"hold them to account\". The tongue-lashings he delivers are up there with the most entertaining parts of the show. Quite a character swerve from the opening batter who over-analysed himself in front of the mirror.\n\n\"I'm not inside my head when I'm in MAFS and doing my role,\" says Aiken. \"When I was playing cricket I was inside my head.\n\n\"Over-analysing things generally slows you down and in cricket, if you're thinking about your technique all the time, I found that it would ultimately lead you to getting out and feeling insecure about your game.\n\n\"TV is about getting there and just dealing with whatever's in front of you, call it out and just roll with it. I feel like I'm much more relaxed in the world of media than I was when I was playing cricket.\"\n\nIn terms of his two distinct careers, Aiken says the \"excitement\" of Married at First Sight has the edge over the \"anxiety\" of opening the batting, and he would not exchange his place on the MAFS couch for a coveted New Zealand black cap.\n\n\"Cricket gave me some great moments, but I wasn't able to flourish, to sit back and enjoy the ride,\" says Aiken.\n\n\"On Married at First Sight that's all that I do. MAFS is something that just has given me such joy.\n\n\"And you know what? It can work. Strangers can fall in love. This year we have some love among the chaos.\"",

We then cut to some actual gameplay of our protagonist, the elite assassin Soul, as he travels around various environments, enters various cutscenes, and engages in various battles. It's not quite a souls-like, but based on combat encounters and enemy designs, you'd think it was one. Actually, it looks like a cool mix between Where Winds Meet, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.",

    "description": "As The Game Awards 2025 came to a close, we got one more surprise: Wildlight--a team of devs led by folks who previously worked on Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends--announced its new game: Highguard. Not only that, the game will be playable in a few weeks.\nA gameplay trailer showcased that Highguard leans into Apex Legends' hero shooter formula but takes it in a different direction, opting for an objective-based raid shooter as opposed to a kill-or-be-killed battle royale. The narrative direction of the game is different too, opting for something that looks more high fantasy (like horses, magic, and pet familiars) while still maintaining that science-fiction flair when it comes to the various characters' abilities and firearms.\nOn Steam, Highguard is described as a \"PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.",

Hold on, let me explain.\nGame director Guillaume Broche took to the stage at the end of The Game Awards to accept the GOTY trophy on behalf of the team at Sandfall Interactive. While commenting that the outfit--a traditional French garb replete with a black-and-white striped shirt and a red beret--started as a joke and thanking the team, publisher Kepler Interactive, and the cast, Broche had a couple more people in mind to give special thanks to.\n\"And also, I want to extend [my] thanks to the unsung heroes of this industry,\" he said during his roughly five-minute speech.",

Dwight Lewis breaks free for a long touchdown run, and he's got 17 carries for 211 yards and 3 touchdowns tonight.\n\nAnd there's the problem with Rome having to settle for a field goal. Gainesville answers with a touchdown, and even with Rome's first points, they trail by their biggest margin, yet.\n\nRome gets on the board with a field goal. It may not sound like much, but getting into the scoring column any way possible was important. Now they need some stops.\n\nThe third quarter is under way!\n\nWell, as we noted earlier, this is a bit surprising. Not necessarily that Gainesville would leading, but 24-0, is a way bigger margin than expected tonight. It's still within reach, but Rome has to figure out something offense really quick.\n\nGainesville tacks on a field goal. Rome has to come up with an answer quick. It's possible they're already in a hole too deep to climb out of, but if they're going to have a chance, they can't let this get any worse.\n\nIt's all Gainesville so far in Rome.

    "fullText": "MIAMI, Fla.- It wasn’t exactly the way they won last season, but St. Thomas Aquinas was able to continue adding to its state record of consecutive state championships.\n\nThe Raiders got five field goals from place kicker Johnny DiSalvatore as they defeated Lakeland, 29-0, Thursday night at Pitbull Stadium for the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) Class 5A state championship.\n\nFor St. Thomas Aquinas, it’s their seventh straight state championship, which adds to the record they own within the Sunshine State. It was also the Raiders’ 35th consecutive playoff victory during Roger Harriett’s tenure as head coach.\n\nOn the flip side for Lakeland, its the second straight state championship loss after the Dreadnaughts won two in a row in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWhat was certain, however, was Lakeland and St. Thomas Aquinas Part II was much more competitive than the 2024 edition as the latter dominated the contest from start to finish. The redux was a lot closer as the Raiders were only able to muster up three DiSalvatore field goals in the first half.\n\nA reason Lakeland was able to remain in the contest was the play of quarterback Keelin Hendrix, who was making plays with his arm and legs all throughout the evening. Hendrix finished the night totaling 226 all-purpose yards.\n\nThe mtachup the last two seasons between the two perennial powers hasn’t been all too close, with St. Thomas Aquinas edging Lakeland by a combined 63-0 score.\n\nFor Florida high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

Being out eight weeks would take him to the Olympic break in early February and could put him in line to return when the season resumes later in the month.\n\nStill the Mammoth’s leading goal scorer with 14, Cooley was one of the biggest reasons they got off to a strong start to the season and were in a playoff spot the night he got hurt. Utah has lost all three games since Cooley was sidelined.\n\nThe long-term injury also all but certainly ends Cooley’s already long-shot chances of being picked for the U.S. roster to take part in the Games in Milan.\n\nTaken with the third pick in the 2022 draft when the club was the Arizona Coyotes before moving to Salt Lake City, Cooley is one of the NHL’s rising stars and in late October signed an eight-year extension worth $80 million.

At 6:52 of the period, Horvat became tangled with Ducks defenseman Drew Helleson. The 30-year-old's left foot twisted as he fell to the ice. He had trouble putting weight on his foot as he went directly to the locker room and never returned to the Islanders bench.\n\nHead coach Patrick Roy did not have an update on Horvat's condition after the game, but said he will be day-to-day.\n\nEntering Thursday's action, Horvat had a team-high 19 goals and 31 points. He had not missed a game this season and played in all 81 games the past two seasons with the Islanders.\n\nSince he was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks in the 2022-23 season, Horvat has been solid. In his first full season on the island, Horvat scored 33 goals (68 points) and followed up with a 28-goal year (57 points). He was on pace to blow past those numbers this year.\n\nBo Horvat will not return to tonight's game with a lower body injury.\n\nHere is the play where Horvat gets injured. #Isles \n\n(🎥: @RTaub_ / @IslesMSGN) https://t.co/giLXHosQ7i pic.twitter.com/olHPhG4isc\n\n— Isles Rumor (@IslesRumor) December 12, 2025",

    "description": "Carter Hart was a spectator as the Golden Knights went with Akira Schmid against the Flyers.",
    "fullText": "Thursday, the former Philadelphia Flyers goaltender returned to the scene of where he played for six NHL seasons before his career took a legal hiatus nearly two years ago. But his participation was limited to pregame warmups and a seat on the visitors’ bench wearing a baseball cap.\n\nNo welcome back acknowledgment. No video tribute from the Flyers. It was as persona non grata as it gets.  \n\nHe wasn’t needed as once again the Vegas Golden Knights found themselves in an overtime game and they leaned on two of their best players — Mark Stone and Jack Eichel — to get them over the top as Eichel forced a turnover, found Stone alone in front and the captain beat Dan Vladar 2:47 into OT for a 3-2 victory at Xfinity Mobile Arena.\n\n“I think we’re comfortable playing in close games,” said Stone, who scored a second-period power-play goal as well to give his team a 2-1 lead at the time. “We’ve played a lot of these this year so out’s nice that we’re winning more of them.”\n\nAs for Hart, by now, you know all the sordid details that resulted to his suspension. The 27-year-old goaltender is back in the NHL, has played three games with the Knights and he’ll likely make his next start in the relative obscurity of Columbus come Saturday.\n\nThursday was a different story. ESPN was there. So was a gaggle of Philly puck media wanting to take Hart’s temperature about his return, to ask him what he expected the reaction from the fans would be for him, about facing his former team and the usual assortment of queries a former player would be expected to receive upon his return.\n\nFrom Hart, nothing but silence on this day. The team didn’t make him available after the morning skate. Coach Bruce Cassidy said it was a decision by the coaching staff to not play Hart Thursday, adding that Hart “wants to play every game.”\n\nWell, he didn’t play this one. Akira Schmid did. And in all honesty, he probably needed to having last played six days ago in Newark where he shut out his former team, the Devils, 3-0 to start this five-game road swing through the Metropolitan Division.\n\nThe reality is the two points up for grabs Thursday was bigger than one person’s return to his former city. The Knights are still pursuing first-place Anaheim and when you look at the nine points they’ve squandered this year in losing in either overtime or a shootout, they’re in a desperate chase to make up those nine points. So that’s where Cassidy’s focus was — win the game.\n\n“We’re a good team; It wasn’t going to continue that way,” Cassidy said of the team’s OT struggles earlier this year. “Today, we forced a turnover and we make a play. Eventually it was going to turn our way.”\n\nHis decision to go with Schmid paid off. He only faced 19 shots while allowing two to get by him. But he was strong, particularly when the Knights were on the penalty kill. Vegas took three offensive zone penalties Thursday but the Flyers were unable to cash in.\n\n“He’s been playing well and he gives us a chance every night,” Cassidy said of Schmid, who picked up his 11th win of the season.\n\nThe Knights also received some offense from defenseman Zach Whitecloud, who scored his first of the year while showing some Eichel-like moves in beating Vladar in the first period, faking with his forehand, then going to his backhand for the goal.\n\n“I thought it was Jack who scored,” Cassidy said. “Then I saw the bubble and I knew it was Whitey.”\n\nWhitecloud has been wearing a full face shield after taking a puck to the face a couple of weeks ago. It obviously didn’t inhibit his vision when it came to handling the puck and finishing off a play.\n\n“It’s exciting and fun,” Whitecloud said of his being able to contribute offensively. “It’s not my job to score goals, especially that way. But anytime you can get into the offensive zone and get in the rush and get involved, it’s something I’ve prided myself on since I’ve been in this organization, and that’s to be a two-way guy.”\n\nThe Knights, who have scored first in each of the four games on the five-game trip and have picked up seven of a possible eight points so far, will try and finish it off the right way Saturday against the Blue Jackets.\n\n“I think we’ve done a good job of rolling four lines and six D and wearing teams down,” Stone said. “Our special teams have been really good. We scored on the power play, we had a big (penalty) kill late (Thursday).\n\n“It’s been a good trip already but we have a chance to make it a great one. Nine out of 10 points would be a hell of a trip.”",

    "fullText": "MARTIN SMITH (Marketing Senior Vice President): Okay. Gary’s got a new cover comp. Gary, walk us through your vision.\n\nGARY LARKIN (Design Lead): Right. Here it is. Black void. Two adults. No board. No pegs.\n\nPAM REYNOLDS (Product Development): Where are the children?\n\nLARKIN: Exactly. Also, who cares?\n\nREYNOLDS: You know this game is eight-plus, right?\n\nLARKIN: If you put a kid on the cover, you’re telling buyers it’s a kid game. If you put adults on the cover, you’re telling kids it’s a gateway to adulthood. This is basic aspirational psychology. They’ll feel like tiny professors. Or tiny villains. Both sell.\n\nSHEILA GRANT (Sales Director): Why no kitchen table?\n\nLARKIN: Because kitchen tables are for fucking Candyland. We’re selling a political mode of thinking: deduction as power. Think less “family night,” and more “I will find the hidden structure of your choices, and then I will destroy you.”\n\nREYNOLDS: Talk to me about the man. He looks… a little smug?\n\nLARKIN: Yes. Smug is the emotional tone of Mastermind. I want the buyer to feel judged by the box. Like the box is already disappointed in them. If you don’t want smug, don’t name the game Mastermind. This isn’t fucking checkers. This is a duel in a seminar room at Davos.\n\nSMITH: Yes! “Smug” can be our brand essence. The product is a controlled experiment in superiority.\n\nLARKIN: She’s the counterforce. Wittgenstein’s ghost at a cocktail party. Quiet, precise, dangerous because she doesn’t need to explain herself. She’s the one who knows the rules and knows when to break them.\n\nREYNOLDS: She also looks like she’s here to ruin his career.\n\nLARKIN: Sure. That’s part of it. Mastermind is adversarial epistemology. Two people testing the limits of what can be known. Plus, maybe they’re fucking?\n\nREYNOLDS: Do we want sexual tension on a board game cover for eight-year-olds?\n\nSMITH: We want adult tension. The tension of brains. If anyone sees sex, that’s on them. We’re not responsible for the public’s imagination. We’re responsible for moving units in Woolworths. Gary, I see what you’re going for… a Cold War posture: mutually assured… embarrassment? You probe, they conceal, you infer, they flinch. Gorgeous.\n\nREYNOLDS: Jesus. All that from colored pegs and a plastic tray?\n\nGRANT: Okay, but where’s the warmth? The fun? Where’s the invitation?\n\nLARKIN: Warmth is for Sorry! This is not a hug. This is a chess clock in a stranger’s living room telling you your parents are getting divorced. The invitation is “Are you smart enough to sit at this table?”\n\nREYNOLDS: I’m still hung up on the no kids thing. Aren’t we basically telling children they’re not the audience?\n\nSMITH: No, we’re telling them they’re not the current audience. But they could be…\n\nREYNOLDS: Fine. But can we at least flag the age range on the front so parents don’t think we’re selling them a goddamn espionage novel?\n\nSMITH: Yes. Small type. Discreet. Like a classified stamp.\n\nGRANT: Could we put a badge on it? Something like “Awarded Game of the Year.”\n\nSMITH: Yes. We need medals. We need royal crests. We need to reassure the buyer that they are purchasing status. I want the box to feel like it won a war.\n\nLARKIN: Also, note the diagonal yellow banner in the corner that says “Improved.” People love improvement—even if they don’t know what was wrong before. “Improved” says we were humble enough to evolve, but not humble enough to specify how.\n\nSMITH: Brilliant. “Improved” in a bold modern font. It’s like saying “Now with more mind.”\n\nREYNOLDS: The board isn’t in the photo.\n\nLARKIN: The board is implied. If you show the board, you limit the imagination. If you don’t show the board, anyone could be playing Mastermind at any time. In a limo. In a bunker. On a yacht while plotting the downfall of a minor principality.\n\nREYNOLDS: Or at my kitchen table? With my nephew?\n\nSMITH: Goddammit, Pam. Fuck the kitchen table. Get on board!\n\nGRANT: So the story is: Mastermind isn’t a board game, it’s a world view?\n\nLARKIN: Yes, a world view where inference leads to domination!\n\nSMITH: I want every eight-year-old to look at this and think, “Someday, I will destroy my father’s confidence with pure logic.”\n\nREYNOLDS: You guys are monsters.\n\nSMITH: We’re toy executives, Pam. Just toy executives.\n\nGRANT: All right. I’m sold. It’s smart, it’s sharp, it’s fucking terrifying. In other words, it’s finally Mastermind.\n\nLARKIN: So, we’re green-lighting this direction?\n\nSMITH: Yes. Let the box look like it could pass a doctoral defense and start a coup d’etat at the same time.",

    "description": "Would you trust a medical system whose only metric was “which doctor wins the Internet?” No, you'd call that malpractice. Yet that's LMArena.",
    "fullText": "Would you trust a medical system measured by: which doctor would the average Internet user vote for?\n\nYet that malpractice is LMArena.\n\nThe AI community treats this popular online leaderboard as gospel. Researchers cite it. Companies optimize for it and set it as their North Star. But beneath the sheen of legitimacy lies a broken system that rewards superficiality over accuracy.\n\nIt's like going to the grocery store and buying tabloids, pretending they're scientific journals.\n\nHere's how LMArena is supposed to work: enter a prompt, evaluate two responses, and mark the best. What actually happens: random Internet users spend two seconds skimming, then click their favorite.\n\nThey're not reading carefully. They're not fact-checking, or even trying.\n\nThis creates a perverse reward structure. The easiest way to climb the leaderboard isn't to be smarter; it’s to hack human attention span. We’ve seen over and over again in the data, both from datasets that LMArena has released and the performance of models over time, that the easiest way to boost your ranking is by:\n\nIt doesn't matter if a model completely hallucinates. If it looks impressive – if it has the aesthetics of competence – LMSYS users will vote for it over a correct answer.\n\nWhen you optimize for engagement metrics, you get madness.\n\nEarlier this year, Meta tuned a version of Maverick to dominate the leaderboard. If you asked it “what time is it?”, you got:\n\nVoilà: bold text, emojis, and plenty of sycophancy – every trick in the LMArena playbook! – to avoid answering the question it was asked.\n\nIt wasn't just Maverick. We analyzed 500 votes from the leaderboard ourselves. We disagreed with 52% of them, and strongly disagreed with 39%.\n\nThe leaderboard optimizes for what feels right, not what is right. Here are two emblematic examples of LMArena users punishing factual accuracy:\n\nIn the world of LMArena, confidence beats accuracy and formatting beats facts.\n\nInstead of rigorous evaluators, we have people with the attention span of the average TikTok user determining which AI models shape the industry.\n\nWhy is LMArena so easy to game? The answer is structural.\n\nThe system is fully open to the Internet. LMArena is built on unpaid labor from uncontrolled volunteers. There's no incentive for those volunteers to be thoughtful. No quality control. No one gets kicked off for repeatedly failing to detect hallucinations.\n\nWhen LMArena’s leaders speak publicly, they talk about the various techniques they use to overcome the fact that their input data is low quality. They admit their workers prefer emojis and length over substance. So the LMArena system, they proudly tell us, includes a variety of corrective measures.\n\nThey're attempting alchemy: conjuring rigorous evaluation out of garbage inputs.\n\nBut you can't patch a broken foundation.\n\nWhen the entire industry optimizes for a metric that rewards “hallucination-plus-formatting” over accuracy, we get models optimized for hallucination-plus-formatting.\n\nThis isn't a minor calibration problem. It's fundamental misalignment between what we're measuring and what we want: models that are truthful, reliable, and safe.\n\nThe AI industry needs rigorous evaluation. We need leaders who prioritize accuracy over marketing. We need systems that can't be gamed by bolding more aggressively.\n\nLMArena is none of these things.

    "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages.",

    "description": "Scientists analyzed artifacts from Tycho Brahe’s lab and found tungsten, an element unknown in his time, rewriting our understanding of historical alchemy.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nResearchers analyzed centuries-old shards from Tycho Brahe’s demolished observatory, revealing evidence of his secret basement alchemy lab and the metals he used to make elite medicines.\n\nThe shards showed expected elements—but also tungsten, a surprise because it wasn’t officially identified until the 1780s, raising questions about whether Brahe used it intentionally or encountered it by accident.\n\nThe finding highlights how Brahe blended astronomy and alchemy, using metals tied to planets and organs, while the true role of tungsten in his remedies remains unknown.\n\nThis story is a collaboration with Biography.com.\n\nThese days, we would call them proprietary blends. But in the late 1500s and early 1600s, individual alchemists called the medicines they cooked up in their labs ‘secrets’. And thanks to a study published in Heritage Science, we now know a little bit more about the secrets of one alchemist in particular.\n\nIt turns out that Tycho Brahe, mostly known for his study of astronomy, had his own basement laboratory for mixing medicines—including some particular elements.\n\nBrahe’s famed observatory, located in his castle-like Uraniborg observatory on the island of Ven, in what is now Sweden, was dismantled following his death in 1601. But recently, a team of researchers from the University of Southern Denmark and National Museum of Denmark analyzed five shards rescued from what would have been the site’s old garden between 1988 and 1990. It’s believed those shards came from the basement alchemical laboratory.\n\nThe authors examined cross sections of the shards for 31 trace elements using mass spectrometry by converting sample molecules into charged ions. While there was plenty of the expected elements on the shards (four of which were glass and one of which was ceramic)—including nickel, copper, zin, tin, antimony, gold, mercury, and lead—there was one find that surprised the experts: tungsten.\n\n“Tungsten is very mysterious,” Kaare Lund Rasmussen, archaeometry expert at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a statement. “Tungsten had not even been described at that time, so what should we infer from its presence on a shard from Tycho Brahe’s alchemy workshop?”\n\nThat’s a question that doesn’t have a clear answer. Rasmussen said that while tungsten does occur naturally in certain minerals, and could have made its way into Brahe’s laboratory that way, there’s another plausible theory: Brahe had a secret substance to help create his medicines for Europe’s elite.\n\nNot classified as an element until the 1780s, tungsten likely first popped up in German chemistry as ‘Wolfram,’ and Brahe’s medicine were known to have German influence. “Maybe Tycho Brahe had heard about this and thus knew of tungsten’s existence,” Rasmussen speculated. “But this is not something we know or can say based on the analyses I have done. It is merely a possible theoretical explanation for why we find tungsten in the samples.”\n\n“Most intriguing are the elements found in higher concentrations than expected,” Rasmussen said, “indicating enrichment and providing insight into the substances used in Tycho Brahe’s alchemical laboratory.”\n\nThe business of creating medicines was a secret one. Brahe, like others of the day, didn’t share the makeup of prescriptions. Brahe was known for his plague medicine—a highly complicated remedy to create that could have had up to 60 ingredients, including everything from snake flesh and opium to copper, oils, and herbs. Could the resulting medicine have also included tungsten as part of the finished product?\n\n“It may seem strange that Tycho Brahe was involved in both astronomy and alchemy, but when one understands his worldview, it makes sense,” said Poul Grinder-Hansen, senior researcher and museum curator at the National Museum of Denmark, in a statement. “He believed that there were obvious connections between the heavenly bodies, early substances, and the body’s organs.”\n\nGold and mercury were often used by alchemists (including Brahe) in medicines, and it was common for alchemists to link the Earth’s elements to properties in space and the human body. And there's a whole list of those connections. Silver tied to the Moon and the brain, while gold was a link to the Sun and the heart. Jupiter and the liver were connected through tin, Venus and copper by the kidneys, Saturn and the spleen by lead, Mars and the gallbladder by iron, and Mercury and the lungs by (of course) mercury. In this thinking, gold was a common ingredient for medicines of the day, including ones Brahe took.\n\nWhere tungsten fits into the mix, however, isn’t clear. So far, it remains a secret.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "The 4% rule helps you establish a safe withdrawal rate.\n\nSuze Orman says not to follow the 4% rule because you may take out money when you don’t need it and not have money when you do.\n\nOther evidence also points to the fact following the 4% rule is a bad idea.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, there are some longstanding rules of thumb many people rely on. Unfortunately, finance expert Suze Orman has a warning about one of those rules. Orman has urged people to stop following the 4% rule, saying \"I would not be using the 4% figure on any level.\"\n\nSo, what is the 4% rule, why is Orman urging you to abandon it, and should you listen to her and stop using it as a crutch? Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe 4% rule is a simple rule designed to help people choose a safe withdrawal rate for their retirement funds. According to the rule, if you take 4% out of your retirement accounts when you first retire and then adjust that amount each year to account for inflation, your money should last at least 30 years. So, if you had a $1 million nest egg, you would take $40,000 out of your retirement plan in year one of retirement.\n\nThe rule was developed in 1994 by a financial advisor named William Bergen to help simplify the process of deciding how much money you could withdraw without risking draining your account too fast and going broke.\n\nOrman does not believe you should follow the 4% rule because she believes that this rule sets you up to take money out of an account when you may not need it, leaving you at risk if you do need it in the future.\n\n\"Maybe you were taking out 4% and 4% even though you didn't need it,\" she said. Then one day, you may need long-term care that's very expensive but you won't have enough in your retirement accounts to afford it because you took withdrawals out earlier just to follow the 4% rule, even if your spending needs were lower.\n\n\"The more you can not take out of a retirement account, the better off you are,\" Orman said.\n\nOrman is right that you should not simply follow the 4% rule, especially if you don't need the money. If you can live comfortably on 2% or 3% of your retirement nest egg, withdrawing more just because of a default rule would be a shortsighted choice as preserving your savings is usually better than spending.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "An all-new Croft adventure, Tomb Raider Catalyst, will be released in 2027 – and a remake of the action heroine’s first adventure arrives next year\n\nAfter a long break for Lara Croft, a couple of fresh Tomb Raider adventures are on their way. They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.\n\nAnnounced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.\n\nCatalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Canadian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.\n\nTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.\n\nIn both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.\n\nDespite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has a TV series in the works with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.\n\n“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”",

    "description": "Keeper, founded in 2022, raised $4 million in pre-seed funding. Here's the startup's current pitch deck.",
    "fullText": "Keeper, an AI matchmaking startup, thinks it can help deliver your \"soulmate\" to you. And if it can't, it'll let you know.\n\n\"We're saying we actually know who could be your soulmate or not,\" Jake Kozloski, Keeper's CEO, told Business Insider. \"We're not going to waste your time and pretend that a hundred thousand of these people could be. We'll tell you no.\"\n\nFounded in 2022, the dating platform uses layers of algorithms and AI models to match people who The startup is now disclosing for the first time, exclusively to Business Insider, that it raised a $4 million pre-seed investment in October 2024, led by Lightbank and Lakehouse Ventures. Goodwater Capital and Champion Hill Ventures participated in the round, among others.\n\nInvestors \"see AI as an inflection point in the dating app landscape\" and an opportunity to \"disrupt the incumbents,\" Kozloski said.\n\nKeeper isn't the only startup attempting to shake up the online dating market. Other AI matchmaking apps, such as Sitch and Amata, have raised millions to build next-generation dating apps. Dating app incumbents like Tinder and Bumble are also making plays with AI-powered experiences.\n\nKozloski said the company's values were another piece of its pitch that attracted some investors.\n\n\"They feel like there's a marriage crisis adjacent to the whole Elon Musk fertility crisis stuff that he talks about,\" said Kozloski, who described Keeper as being \"friendly with the pronatalist movement.\"\n\nWanting kids, though, isn't a requirement to use Keeper, Kozloski added.\n\nSince launching, Keeper has had more than 1.5 million sign-ups, and about 300,000 of those have made accounts, Kozloski said. Among that pool, there have been a \"small number\" of matches. Keeper didn't share exactly how many matches it's made, but according to its pitch deck, 10% of dates from its beta version resulted in marriage. With its funding, Keeper has been building out its matchmaking technology over the past year.\n\nKeeper is limited to heterosexual couples right now, and doesn't offer explicit options for different gender identities.\n\n\"We basically have to build a new algorithm for homosexual relationships, which we're happy to do and we will do eventually, but for now, we want to get to product market fit with our core product first,\" Kozloski said. \"Frankly, heterosexual relationships, especially for finding life partnership, seems to be a bigger market, a stronger market for us right now.\"\n\nMaking a profile on Keeper is a sit-down process. The initial form to make an account asks for the standard details of many dating apps (like your age or height), as well as academic test scores (including SATs), your career ambitions, salary, and net worth. It even encourages taking an external personality test. After you fill out the initial onboarding questionnaire, there are 13 more steps, ranging from uploading photos to sharing your philosophy on love.\n\n\"We don't let our users create their own profiles,\" Kozloski said. Keeper uses the information it gathers to curate a profile for you.\n\nKozloski said Keeper uses a non-AI algorithm first to streamline potential matches, focusing on data points like age range initially.\n\n\"We use LLMs once we have your top hundred that our other algorithms have identified,\" he said. \"The LLMs are trained on our matchmaking insights that we've learned so far, and so they can narrow down those last hundred and do the final pass of, 'OK, who actually is worth offering among these.'\"\n\nSome of the AI matchmaking comes into play when analyzing \"general attractiveness\" and users' specific attributes, like baldness or hair color, Kozloski said. The startup has also partnered with a team of researchers at Stanford, Kozloski said, who help train the LLMs (Keeper provides anonymized data to the research team).\n\nHowever, Keeper isn't fully automated, and for the time being, includes human matchmakers in the process. If there's a match, Keeper connects the two people over text message.\n\nThe startup has a complicated payment structure with a hefty price tag — but only for men.\n\nKeeper has male users sign a \"marriage bounty\" that typically costs $50,000 (if the user gets married) and has them pay $5,000 for any dates from the service (the date fees go toward the total bounty cost, Kozloski said).\n\nRead the most recent version of Keeper's pitch deck.\n\nNote: Keeper has shared an updated version of its pitch deck, which it is now sharing with investors, that includes new details since its raise in October 2024. Some details have been redacted.\n\nKeeper describes the matchmaking market as \"old school yet shockingly massive,\" per the slide.\n\n\"With the opportunity to 10x,\" the slide says. \"When technology provides perfect matches, matchmaking will be the best way to meet your partner.\"\n\n\"The AI matchmaker that will introduce you to your soulmate on the first match,\" the slides says. It also includes product imagery.\n\n\"Our v1 worked extremely well,\" the slide says.\n\nIt says that 10% of dates lead to marriage.\n\nIt says it has had 1.5 million sign-ups. \"This makes us the largest pool of any traditional matchmaker,\" the slides says. It lists competitors like Tawkify, Keeper, Ditto, Sitch, and Known Dating.\n\n\"Everyone signs up if we deliver soulmates on the first match,\" the slide says.\n\n\"The first mover quickly becomes a monopoly,\" it says.\n\nToban Wiebe: Co-Founder, Head of AI\n\nHere are the names of the researchers:\n\n\"We're raising to scale profitable human-in-the-loop matchmaking to $2M in annual revenue,\" the slide says.\n\n\"80% of young singles want to get married,\" the slide says. \"40% actually will.\" It cites data from Match Group and data scientist Allen Downey.\n\nDating apps are \"bad at creating relationships, worth billions,\" the slide says. \"Imagine the value of the first product that's great at it.\"\n\n\"Matchmakers can't scale,\" the slide says.\n\n\"LLMs and vision models enable scalable matchmaking for the first time in history,\" the slides says.\n\n\"We've built the most accurate process in the world,\" the slide says.\n\nHere are the steps the slide lays out:\n\n\"We earn more, faster, by aligning with users' incentives,\" the slide says.\n\nIts current model, which has humans involved in matchmaking, is free for women and costs men $5,000 per date. For male users, the marriage bounty costs $50,000, and the slide says that Keeper has contracted $14 million \"so far.\"\n\nKeeper outlines that in a future model, where the tech is fully automated, dates will cost $250, and the marriage bounty contract will cost $5,000.",

Her eldest son, Joe Anders, 21, wrote the screenplay.\n\nShe said that Anders had expressed concern that people may think the film, which he wrote on a screenwriting course, was picked up only because of his famous parents. But Winslet defended his talent.\"The film would've been made with or without me. The script is so, so good,\" she said.\n\nAnders' father is the acclaimed film director Sam Mendes, 60, who was married to Winslet for seven years until their split in 2010. Anders starred alongside his mom in the 2023 movie \"Lee,\" and also appeared in the Oscar-nominated war film \"1917,\" which was directed by his father.\n\nMia Threapleton, Winslet's 25-year-old daughter, is also a rising star. She had a starring role in Wes Anderson's latest film, \"The Phoenician Scheme,\" which was released in May. It comes after she played Winslet's daughter in the 2022 BAFTA award-winning TV drama \"I Am Ruth.\"\n\nThe youngest of Winslet's children, 12-year-old Bear Blaze Winslet, has yet to grace the silver screen, but has already expressed an interest.

    "fullText": "Taylor Swift has been known to accept feedback from fans and critics, but there's one request she refuses to heed: \"Go away.\"\n\nAhead of the premiere of her Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" Swift appeared on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" to discuss her recent achievements and milestones.\n\nWhen Colbert asked Swift who she could turn to for advice, she listed rock star Stevie Nicks and pop producer Max Martin as confidants.\n\n\"What I look up to the most in people is career longevity — career longevity, friendship longevity, longevity in their relationships, you know? How do you keep a good thing going?\" Swift said.\n\n\"I think there are certain corners of our society that really love that and look up to longevity,\" she continued. \"There are also corners that are like, 'Give someone else a turn! Can't you just go away so we can talk about how good you were?' And I'm like, 'I don't want to.'\"\n\nSwift has faced accusations of overexposure throughout her career, but particularly in the last few years. Her cross-continental, 149-show Eras Tour, which concluded in December 2024, garnered extensive media coverage and consistently went viral on social media. The New Yorker said Swift had achieved \"complete domination over popular culture.\"\n\nWhen Swift released \"The Tortured Poets Department\" halfway through the tour's two-year run, fans and critics alike called the album overlong and overindulgent. When it topped the Billboard 200 for 17 weeks, fans of other artists complained that Swift was sabotaging her fellow pop stars, including Billie Eilish and Charli XCX, by preventing their albums from reaching No. 1 on the chart.\n\nSwift's newest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" was met with similar reproach. In his review for The Atlantic, Spencer Kornhaber wrote, \"'Showgirl' is the sound of an overworked and overexposed entertainer reaching the mountaintop to find something worse than disappointment: burnout.\" Swift's prolificacy and sales tactics have been described as shameless and excessive.\n\nStill, Swift has refused to shrink away from the spotlight. The first two episodes of \"The End of an Era\" will be available to stream on Friday, along with an extended version of her Eras Tour concert movie, featuring a new segment with songs from \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" The remaining four episodes of the docuseries will be released in pairs over the next two weeks.\n\nDuring her interview with Colbert, Swift also joked that she prefers to think of herself as \"passionate\" and \"hyperactive,\" rather than a workaholic.\n\n\"When I take time off, it's always just like, I can't slow down the fact that I need to get up and do a lot of things today. But I can change what those things are,\" she said. \"I can figure out how to chill out, but I'm never gonna be a chill person.\"",

    "fullText": "MAGA Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump amid their high-profile divorce.\n\nThe Georgia Republican told CBS News that she is “starting to feel very sorry” for the 79-year-old, saying that his attacks on her reflect poorly on him.\n\nThe great schism began when Greene, 50, broke with him on the cost-of-living crisis, which Trump insists is a “hoax,” and the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nThe escalation saw Trump call her a “traitor,” and the one-time MAGA die-hard decided to quit Congress.\n\nDuring the CBS News interview, MTG said that Trump’s refusal to embrace the economic realities facing many Americans could cost the GOP its majority next year.\n\n“I do believe at this time that Republicans will lose the midterms, and I think that’s unfortunate,” Greene said. “I very much wanted to be part of a Republican majority in Congress that solved problems for the American people, that delivered what we promised to America.”\n\nGreene’s interview was released 24 hours after Trump sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Politico’s Dasha Burns on The Conversation podcast.\n\nAsked what he’d rate himself on the economy, Trump said, “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.” As the Daily Beast has previously reported, Americans have given a markedly different assessment.\n\nAnd so does Greene. Speaking on CBS News, she offered more advice to Trump. “The president needs to be aware that he’s a billionaire president of the United States,” she said.\n\n“You can’t gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable, and you can’t tell them that the economy is in A-plus-plus-plus. You just can’t do that, and I think it’s insulting to people’s intelligence,” she added, dropping two plusses from Trump’s grade.\n\nGreene made a similar prediction about the midterms when she announced on Nov. 21 that she intended to quit Congress in January 2026.\n\nIn a message shared on X, she said, in part, “I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.”",

    "fullText": "Talk of a colossal 2026 IPO from SpaceX is already having an impact on the market.\n\nInvestors have been asking for years if Elon Musk will ever allow SpaceX to start trading on public markets, and reports indicate next year could see its long-awaited debut at a $1.5 trillion valuation.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, Musk appeared to confirm talk of a SpaceX public offering, describing a reporter's explanation of an imminent IPO as \"accurate.\"\n\nThe fresh focus on the space industry has sparked fresh momentum for stocks in the sector. Since the SpaceX IPO chatter picked up in the last week, a handful of space companies have seen their shares soar.\n\nHere are the top-performing space stocks in the last five days:\n\n\"SpaceX's IPO acts as a 'sector validator,' proving privates can command valuations despite thin profits, encouraging investors to focus on less well known public space stocks, like Redwire and Firefly Aero, for early exposure to a projected $1 trillion space economy by 2040,\" Tony Bancroft, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds told Business Insider.\n\nPure hype may not be the only reason that these space stocks are surging, though. According to Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, the prospect of SpaceX going public at a trillion dollar valuation is likely shifting the ways in which investors view smaller companies.\n\n\"When the anchor of the entire ecosystem is valued that highly, then companies like Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile suddenly screen as structurally undervalued because they participate in the same demand cycle SpaceX is proving out,\" he noted.\n\nBoloor added that SpaceX's lofty valuation means that investors will have to start looking at the industry not as a high-risk emerging market, but as critical infrastructure that will be crucial to the US's future in multiple areas.\n\nThe consensus among finance pros seems to be that the space investing landscape has already started shifting, making small-cap space stocks an appealing play.\n\n\"If anything, the biggest impact of a SpaceX IPO is psychological,\" stated Drew Wandzilak, a principal at Alumni Ventures. \"It tells the market that this ecosystem is entering its growth phase. That is encouraging for investors like us and even more encouraging for the founders who are building the next layer of the space economy.\"",

    "description": "The U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut of a quarter percentage point lowered the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75% in mid-December.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 COLA was announced at 2.8% in October 2025.\n\nFed projections suggest a potential 2027 COLA in the 2.3% to 2.6% range if CPI tracks slightly above PCE.\n\nRetirees relying on interest income from CDs and savings accounts have seen earnings decline after recent rate cuts.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut of a quarter percentage point lowered the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75% in mid-December.\n\nThis move continues to spark optimism among market participants, as valuations of most risk assets are directly tied to the risk-free rate, at least when it comes to modeling out a company's discounted future cash flows. Bond yields have also come down considerably in recent months (lower yields mean higher prices), so investors are winning across the board.\n\nBut the thing is, millions of Americans unfortunately don't participate in this market. And for those who are retired, Social Security payments are the key lifeline that puts food on the table.\n\nAccordingly, the Social Security Administration's (SSA) cost of living adjustment (COLA) each year in October is a big event that millions focus intently on. There's good reason for this, as this COLA will dictate how much a given senior's monthly check will increase for the coming year.\n\nMost seniors may already be aware that this cost of living adjustment is tied to inflation, but let's dive into whether there's any correlation to how this cut may affect next year's COLA (2027).\n\nAs many investors may be aware, the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) put forward by the Social Security Administration is aimed at helping seniors navigate rising prices across the economy. There are many factors that measure this rise, but the consumer price index (CPI) is the key factor that plays into how the SSA determines what the cost of living increase will be for an upcoming year.\n\nThe connection between the cost of living adjustment (COLA) and the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts since 2025 centers around inflation management and economic stabilization.\n\nSimply put, lower interest rates could indicate a stabilizing economy, though recent data shows inflation has been somewhat stubborn. Given that COLA adjustments are typically tied to inflation rates, investors can assess via longer-duration bond yields where inflation may come in at over the coming year or two.",

    "description": "OpenAI says its latest model, GPT 5.2, was shown to outperform industry professionals in specific tasks across 44 different occupations.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI released its anticipated update to GPT-5 on Thursday, boasting that the new AI is \"the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work.\"\n\n\"We designed GPT‑5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people; it's better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step project,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIn a benchmark test called GDPval, OpenAI said its new AI model can outperform \"industry professionals at well-specified knowledge work tasks spanning 44 occupations.\"\n\n\"GPT‑5.2 Thinking produced outputs for GDPval tasks at >11x the speed and <1% the cost of expert professionals, suggesting that when paired with human oversight, GPT‑5.2 can help with professional work,\" the company said.\n\nAnd in a note that is sure to catch the attention of bankers, OpenAI wrote that in an internal benchmark of junior investment banking analyst spreadsheet modeling tasks — \"such as putting together a three-statement model for a Fortune 500 company with proper formatting and citations, or building a leveraged buyout model for a take-private\" — the new model's score per task was \"9.3% higher than GPT‑5.1's, rising from 59.1% to 68.4%\" on average.\n\nOpenAI said that GPT-5.2 will begin rolling out today for paid ChatGPT plans. Paid users will have access to GPT-5.1 for three months under legacy models before it is sunsetted.\n\n\"We deploy GPT‑5.2 gradually to keep ChatGPT as smooth and reliable as we can,\" the company said.\n\nThe company also touted its gains in agentic coding ability.\n\n\"Even without the ability to do new things like output polished files, GPT-5.2 feels like the biggest upgrade we've had in a long time. Curious to hear what you think!\" OpenAI CEO Altman wrote on X.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo said more changes will be coming next year once OpenAI rolls out age verification across ChatGPT. She said an \"adult mode\" for the chatbot will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThe release comes just over a week after Altman declared a \"code red\" in a private message to employees, marshaling more resources to ChatGPT amid increasing competition from Google and other companies.\n\n\"Code reds are not uncommon,\" Somo said during an interview on TBPN, adding that the hosts could \"be the judge\" of the results of Altman's declaration. She said she was \"pretty proud of\" GPT-5.2's advances, even though its development pre-dated the \"code red.\"\n\nGoogle has been considered by many in tech to be gaining, if not surpassing, OpenAI in the AI race with its recent release of Gemini 3.\n\nThe announcement also occurred hours after OpenAI brokered a major deal with Disney, which secured a $1 billion investment and access to the media giant's lucrative and popular IP.\n\n\"It has been a very cool last 10 years; OpenAI has been more special to work on than I could have possibly imagined,\" Altman wrote on X on Thursday.",

    "description": "Joni Ernst and Ed Markey are split over extending deadlines to pursue fraud in restaurant relief and the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant programs.",
    "fullText": "The top Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee said Democrats are blocking a measure to give federal prosecutors more time to investigate bailouts for restaurants and the live-entertainment industry.\n\nSenator Joni Ernst said Senator Ed Markey is holding up her bill that would give investigators until at least 2031 to file charges for defrauding the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund or the $14.5 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program.\n\n\"We are not getting a lot of cooperation coming from our Ranking Member, Markey, and the Senate Democrats,\" Ernst told Business Insider. \"I'm not very optimistic that it's going to happen, and it's very, very frustrating.\"\n\nMarkey's office declined to respond to a request for comment.\n\nLess than two weeks remain for the Senate to pass the legislation, which would enable the bill to move to the president's desk and possibly be signed into law.\n\nIt's not clear whether Ernst has formally sought unanimous consent to pass the statute-of-limitations extender bill because the process can take place informally, off the Senate floor. It's possible the measure could be passed next year, though the deadline to prosecute some SVOG fraud cases could lapse as soon as April 8.\n\nBusiness Insider documented how over $200 million from the SVOG program went to celebrities who used taxpayer money for private jets, lavish parties, luxury clothes, and other questionable spending.\n\nInvestigators haven't accused any of those recipients of wrongdoing, and most of the grants discussed in BI's stories were closed out by the Small Business Administration.\n\nMike Galdo, a former prosecutor who focused on pandemic fraud, said the bill could give agents, analysts, and prosecutors more time to build cases.\n\n\"Given some of the ambiguity in the language in the SVOG statute and regulations, as well as enforcement priorities other than fraud taking center stage for this Administration, it is unclear how many additional SVOG-related enforcement matters will be brought,\" he said in an email.\n\nErnst said Democrats preferred to \"rant and rail\" against President Donald Trump. At a committee hearing for SBA matters on December 10, Markey accused Republicans of waging \"an all-out assault\" on an SBA program that sets aside billions of dollars in federal contracts for small businesses owned by women and racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nA similar bill to extend the statute of limitations for the SVOG program and the restaurant fund has already passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support.\n\nBoth Ernst and Markey have pointed fingers across the aisle for delaying their legislative priorities. Ernst yesterday sought unanimous consent to pass a bill that would have clawed back more than $65 billion in unspent COVID relief funds, a measure that was blocked by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. And Markey blamed Republicans for blocking a one-year extension of two programs that dole out billions in grants to tech-oriented small businesses.\n\nRepresentative Gil Cisneros, a Democratic congressman from California, said earlier this month that the SBA's inspector-general has 31 open Restaurant Revitalization Fund cases and six open Shuttered Venue Operators Grant cases.\n\nA spokesman for the SBA's inspector-general's office didn't respond to a request for comment about those numbers.\n\nThe two programs cut checks of up to $10 million meant to support businesses that had been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, as waves of the deadly virus and government stay-at-home orders led businesses dependent on in-person gatherings to struggle.\n\nGovernment auditors faulted the SBA over its internal controls, and the combined total of fraud and waste in those and other pandemic programs may exceed $400 billion. Prosecutions have barely scratched the surface compared to the scale of the suspected fraud, but some misspent money could also be recovered through administrative actions or civil lawsuits.",

    "fullText": "Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, have released a powerful statement via their Archewell Foundation regarding the world’s first law implemented in Australia that bans social media for children under the age of 16. The couple, who have focused their philanthropic work on online safety and mental wellness, lauded the nation's leadership while cautioning that the measure does not fix the root cause of the crisis.\n\nThe legislation took effect on December 10, targeting platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Snapchat, and imposing potential fines of up to AUD$50 million ($49.5 million USD) on companies that fail to keep young users off their services.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess summed up their complex reaction with a strong statement: \"It shouldn't have come to this.\" They expanded on their praise, celebrating the urgency of the intervention against addiction and exploitation. “We celebrate Australia’s leadership for seeing and acting on how these technology companies are negatively impacting young people with little to no recourse or accountability, and feeble efforts from the companies to stem the flow of harms,” the statement reads.\n\nHarry and Meghan emphasized that the bold move sends a necessary signal to Silicon Valley. They view the ban as vital for protecting children at a critical developmental stage. “This bold, decisive action to protect children at a critical moment in their development sends a strong signal that a child’s mind is not a commodity to be exploited. It buys young people valuable time back in their childhoods, but it doesn’t fix the fundamental issue we all still face with social media platforms.”\n\nThe couple pointed to the devastating human cost that necessitated the government’s action. “We’ve heard from too many grieving parents. Too many families devastated by cyberbullying, feeds that radicalize kids toward self-harm, and algorithmic manipulation designed to maximize engagement at any cost.”\n\nThe statement also acknowledged the significant positive potential of social media, particularly for vulnerable youth, arguing that these platforms can be a “genuine lifeline” for LGBTQ+ young people and those suffering mental health crises. However, the omnipresent harms often overshadow the benefits.\n\nThe core of the couple's critique is that the ban is only a temporary solution. “Here’s the truth: the ban is an effective measure to stop imminent harm, but ultimately only works as a band aid that does not address tech’s broken design and exploitive business incentives, requiring us to protect young people in the first place.”\n\nThe statement concluded by calling for a \"reckoning,\" hoping this Australian ban will force tech leaders to take responsibility for platforms built with growth as their first principle, rather than safety. The message notes what the Sussexes deem to be an ethical failure: \"The companies ‘unintended consequences’ of a decade ago are now part of their money making strategy, and children have become their collateral.”\n\nNext: Prince Harry Called Oprah in a Panic to Handle Delicate ‘Problem’ at Home",

    "fullText": "The GOP-aligned Heritage Foundation think tank sparked a wave of condemnation on Thursday after it posted a threat from President Donald Trump to defund Indiana if the state doesn’t pass his gerrymander.\n\n“President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state,” wrote Heritage Action on X, adding:\n\nRoads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.\n\nTrump has been pressuring Indiana to redraw its Congressional map to eliminate any Democrats holding seats in the state. The deep red state had previously shot down the idea in its Senate, but has since revived the effort under threats from Trump. Trump previously pushed Texas to redraw it map to favor the GOP, which in turn led California to move to eliminate Republican seats.\n\n“If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country, they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats. Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again. One of my favorite States, Indiana, will be the only State in the Union to turn the Republican Party down!” wrote Trump in a lengthy post on Wednesday.\n\nRod Bray is a state senator in Indiana opposed to redistricting, which is extremely rare mid-decade and usually only done after a census.\n\nPundits and observers, including many well-known conservatives, expressed their shock at Heritage’s threat:\n\nSetting new precedents for the next Democratic Administration. https://t.co/GMQpxLlvNo\n\n— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) December 11, 2025\n\nThe president and one of the most influential conservative groups in the country are threatening to deprive all Indiana residents of paved roads, guard bases, and major projects if they don't pass an extremely gerrymandered map to deprive voters of choice.

    "title": "Menopause treatment is getting personal",
    "description": "Menopause care innovations include at-home hormone testing, virtual appointments, and new non-hormonal therapies for symptom relief.",
    "fullText": "For decades, menopause has been treated like a medical nuisance to be managed silently. Women, knowing it's taboo to talk about, have quietly dealt with symptoms like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, restless nights, brain fog, mood swings, and plummeting libido.\n\n\"We've had a two-sided problem that is being unraveled: patients who have been left to suffer and providers who have been left without education,\" Jessica Nazzaro, a board-certified OBGYN, certified menopause practitioner, and a medical advisor for at-home hormone tracking company Mira, told Business Insider. Patients now \"know they are not alone, not crazy, and can find help.\"\n\nToday, many can test their hormone levels at home, talk to menopause specialists online, and get personalized prescriptions shipped directly to their doors.\n\nThis shift marks a reimagining of how women navigate their midlife years. Once dismissed as an inevitable decline, menopause is now treated as another phase of health — one that can be supported, studied, and optimized.\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) — which restores a patient's levels of estrogen, progesterone, or both to relieve menopause symptoms — was once the only solution women could turn to for things like night sweats, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness.\n\nThen came the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study in 2002, a long-term national study on preventing breast and colorectal cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, which found that HRT could increase cancer risk.\n\nPrescriptions plummeted, and stigma spiked.\n\nIn the years after, a group of doctors and researchers revisited the study and found it to be flawed because of its narrow scope. The WHI, which looked at disease risk in postmenopausal women, did not include vaginal estrogen, for example.\n\nExperts now tend to advocate for personalized treatment plans and say that cancer risk depends on the type of hormones used and the duration of treatment.\n\n\"We've learned that HRT is indeed protective of heart health, brain health, and bone health. It does not cause breast cancer, as was publicized by the WHI, but rather can proliferate an estrogen-sensitive tumor in the breast or other tissue,\" Nazzaro said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kathleen Green, an OB-GYN at Maven Clinic, \"More recent studies show that for most women, the benefits of HRT far outweigh the risks.\"\n\nStarting hormone therapy closer to the onset of menopause — typically before age 60 or within 10 years of entering menopause — can help alleviate symptoms and improve bone health.\n\nThe biggest change? Personalization. Doctors now consider a woman's age, symptoms, medical history, and time since menopause to determine the best form and dose of HRT — whether it's a pill, patch, gel, vaginal cream, or ring.\n\nAs more women demand better care, tech companies are offering to meet them where they are. At-home hormone testing tools like Mira and Proov can track users' hormone levels and turn them into personalized scores and cycle insights.\n\nAccording to Nazzaro, Mira's device tracks hormonal shifts with lab-level accuracy and \"helps women see patterns in their own cycles, understand which stage of menopause they're in, and make informed decisions about symptom management, lifestyle adjustments, or treatments.\"\n\nDr. Sophia Yen, the CEO and cofounder of Pandia Health, is a fan of Mira and told Business Insider that it's seamless to use — you simply collect your urine in a cup — and it provides \"lab-grade results,\" all from the comfort of your home.\n\nTelehealth companies such as Midi, Gennev, Pandia Health, and Winona provide virtual appointments with menopause-trained clinicians — such as board-certified OB/GYNs and doctors who are also NASM-certified menopause practitioners. Pandia Health also offers asynchronous telemedicine, where women can message doctors without face or voice contact — establishing a safe space to share their concerns.\n\nEven with the rise of personalized HRT, some women can't or prefer not to take hormones — especially breast cancer survivors. That's driving innovation in non-hormonal therapies.\n\nIn 2025, the FDA approved Lynkuet, a gel capsule from Bayer that blocks brain receptors responsible for hot flashes. In clinical trials of more than 700 women, it cut the frequency of hot flashes within a week.\n\n\"Many cannot or will not take hormones, so Lynkuet could be a wonderful option,\" Alyssa Dweck, the chief medical officer at Bonafide Health, told Business Insider.\n\nOther new options include estetrol, a natural estrogen steroid pill, which is designed to address hot flashes, vaginal atrophy, and loss of bone mass. Vaginal estrogen creams and suppositories that treat dryness, itching, and irritation can also help.\n\nAfter years of debate, the FDA recently removed the \"black box\" warning — the FDA's highest issued safety label — from estrogen-related products. The move could make women feel more comfortable using these medications, Nazzaro said.\n\n\"I've had patients who pick up their prescription for vaginal estrogen after a thorough discussion and decide not to use it specifically because of the black box warning,\" Nazzaro told Business Insider.\n\nDoctors say the shift isn't just happening among menopausal women — it's starting earlier.\n\n\"I have women in their 30s presenting to my office wanting to understand what they might anticipate when they enter perimenopause,\" Dweck said. They want to understand \"what proactive measures can be taken to avoid distressing symptoms.\"\n\nThat proactive mindset, paired with more tools and data, could redefine menopause care for the next generation.\n\n\"I feel incredibly optimistic,\" Dweck said.\n\nStaying open-minded to emerging research and aware of the risks and benefits of new therapies is crucial to navigating this phase of life, said Dweck. She suggested being proactive and educating yourself about menopause with credible sources like The Menopause Society.\n\nCertain lifestyle adjustments like exercise, nutrition, and sleep can also make a major difference and support treatments like hormone therapy, non-hormonal drugs, or clinically studied supplements, Dweck said.\n\nAnd remember — although the menopause care market offers many products that are touted as \"solutions,\" they may not have solid scientific evidence to support their claims.\n\n\"Product labels can be overwhelming, frightening, and confusing, and for this reason, a comprehensive discussion with an experienced healthcare provider about indications for use, risks, benefits, and specific use instructions is warranted,\" Dweck said.\n\nShe recommended considering personal needs based on symptoms, medical and family history, medications, and lifestyle habits. There's no one-size-fits-all approach or experience when it comes to menopause.",

    "description": "Disney faces an engagement problem as kids gravitate to YouTube. It's looking to OpenAI to help boost engagement.",
    "fullText": "Disney is losing the war for attention. Can its blockbuster OpenAI licensing deal change the momentum on the battlefield?\n\nSoon, you'll be able to use OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT and the video generator Sora, to create content featuring Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Darth Vader.\n\nCEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.\n\nIger said initially Disney would \"curate some of the videos that have been created on the Sora platform and put them onto Disney+, which we think is a great way to increase engagement with our Disney+ users, particularly the younger users.\" Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.\n\nThere's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.\n\nTime people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.\n\nData from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.\n\nDisney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.\n\nTraditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?\"\n\nDisney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.\n\nJohn Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.\n\n\"UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,\" he said. \"But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.\"\n\nDisney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.\n\nShae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.\n\n\"I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,\" she added. \"So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.\"\n\nSome in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.\n\nFor one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.\n\nSam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.\n\n\"I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,\" Tung said.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "description": "Bloated valuations and an aging bull market are two things that could hold back the S&P 500 for the next decade, forecasters say.",
    "fullText": "A dark thought is starting to circulate around Wall Street. What if, after years of stellar gains, the US stock market is basically flat for the next decade?\n\nThat feels like an unbelievable idea given the current bull run for the stock market, which is just the latest in a larger secular rally that's been going on for almost 15 years.\n\nThe gains continued to pile up on Thursday. As investors fled tech amid worries about Oracle's earnings, they pumped the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow to fresh record highs.\n\nBut the possibility of the party soon coming to an end is being floated by a growing number of forecasters, who see two main reasons the market could be held back:\n\nNow, more analysts see what could be a lost decade coming for stocks — a 10-year period where the US market sees near-zero returns or severely lags other markets around the world.\n\nIn a note this week, Bank of America said its team of equity strategists saw the S&P 500 shedding 0.1% over the next decade. Historically, that's a terrible performance, given that the S&P 500 has gained an average 10.5% a year since the 1950s.\n\nStrategists pointed to high valuations and back-to-back years of double-digit growth in the benchmark index.\n\n\"Even for next year, the math of history is tough: average returns for the S&P 500 after 3 years of >15% growth are 2.3ppt lower than the average annual return. Investors may need GDP & EPS surprises to avoid a seventh 'lost decade,'\" BofA wrote in a client note.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also said he expects the S&P 500 to remain relatively flat for the next 10 years. That projection is based on where the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 currently resides, he said on Thursday.\n\n\"The historical relationship between the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio and subsequent 10-year annualized returns shows that investors should expect to get zero in return in the S&P 500 over the coming decade,\" Sløk said.\n\nIn November, Goldman Sachs analysts said they saw the US market coming in last place for returns in the coming 10-year stretch. The S&P 500 is on track to gain around 6.5% a year for the next 10 years, the bank estimated, falling short of estimated returns in Europe, Japan, Asia, and emerging markets.\n\nThe bank said it expected earnings growth to be stronger in other markets. Valuations in the US are also high and on track to decline around 1% annually over the next decade, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"If the profitability and/or valuations of the largest companies falter, unless another cohort of 'superstars' emerges, returns for the broad market will likely be hampered as today's largest stocks fall back to earth,\" analysts wrote of their bearish scenario for the US market.",

    "title": "I Tracked My Health With Whoop, and This Is What I Liked (and What I Ignored)",
    "description": "The last six weeks have taught me that hydration is more important than I realized, and opened my eyes to how much shut-eye I actually need.",
    "fullText": "When I reviewed the Whoop 5.0 and MG (and, earlier, the Whoop 4.0), I kept it to the basics—how the strap looks, works, and charges, and what activities it can track. But that's only part of it, and today, I’m going to dive in to all the metrics Whoop reports and offer a reality check on what I've found most useful and what isn’t worth paying attention to.\n\n(I'll leave out the activity tracking features here, since I covered them in more depth in the review, but the bottom line is this: I love the way it tracks how hard your workouts are—strength workouts included—but it's not going to replace a true fitness watch for most people.)\n\nI haven't worn the Whoop band as regularly as I do the Oura ring, for which I was able to give a four-year retrospective. But to research both this article and my reviews, I’ve worn the Whoop for a couple of stints of at least a few weeks each, tracking my workouts and sleep regularly. With that said, here's a deeper dive into what it’s actually like to wear the Whoop strap long-term, using it to judge and guide your habits and performance.\n\nLet me take you through a typical day. I’m wearing the Whoop band on either my wrist or upper arm, and it’s probably been a few days since I last charged it. (I get about five days on a charge.) I made sure I had it on when I went to bed. If I look at my Whoop app first thing in the morning, it will sometimes tell me that it’s still “processing” my sleep, and there’s a button I can press to “end sleep” and get my recovery results.\n\nThe Whoop app will show you a survey called your “journal” the first time you open the app each day. I’ll talk more about the journal in a section below. Let’s say you’ve already filled out your journal, and you’re looking at the main app. From the home screen, on a typical day I might see:\n\nMy recovery at the top, color coded. Green is good, and you get that if your recovery is 66% or better. Yellow is OK (34% and up), and red is poor. Today, I have a yellow recovery, at 48%. (For the month of April, I got 19 green recoveries, 9 yellow, 0 red, and on two nights I forgot to wear the strap to bed.)\n\nSome notes about things I should pay attention to. Perhaps my HRV is lower than usual, which might be because of my hard workout yesterday.\n\nThe health monitor, which tells me whether my respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, HRV, and skin temperature are within my normal ranges.\n\nThe stress monitor, which I guess tells me how stressed I am. To be honest, I don’t find this useful.\n\nA \"daily outlook\" button I can press. This starts a conversation with Whoop Coach—more about that in a minute.\n\nToday’s timeline, showing when I slept. As I do other activities, like workouts, they’ll show up here.\n\nRecommendations for tonight’s sleep, including a recommended bedtime.\n\nAfter this, there is a scorecard for my current “plan” (more about that below), and a dashboard with the individual metrics I might care about, like heart rate variability (HRV) and a count of my steps so far today, a feature that’s still in beta.\n\nAlong the top of the screen, I can tap on my scores for Sleep, Recovery, or Strain. The Strain screen is interesting, since it gives a recommended Strain level for the day. It may suggest that I take on a “moderate” level of Strain, and set my target as 8.9 to 12.9. You get most of your Strain from exercise, and a little from everyday activity like walking around. On a morning I haven’t done any workouts or left the house yet, I may be around 2.7 Strain just from sitting around.\n\nLet’s return to that Daily Outlook button. Tap that, and you’ll be launched into a conversation with Whoop Coach, an AI chatbot. This is probably the only AI bot I converse with on the regular, because it does a decent job of explaining the app’s metrics and recommends workouts for the day.\n\nTo use one real example: on a certain day it complimented me on completing a running workout yesterday, and told me my workout schedule had been consistent, with 162 minutes in active heart rate zones so far that week. It then described a few trends in my metrics, including that my resting heart rate had improved over the past few weeks, but that my recovery that day was lower than my usual.\n\nThen comes the fun part. It makes recommendations for workouts to do today, and habits to focus on. It told me to aim for three liters of water that day (that’s a little bit more than my usual) with plenty of fruits and vegetables. And for a workout, I could meet my recommended Strain score with something that is low impact to “support recovery,” since my heart rate and HRV suggested I may need a bit of a rest.\n\nThe Whoop Coach went on to suggest three workouts to choose from, based on the kinds of activities it knows I like to do. They included a 30-minute run, mostly in zones 1 and 2, or an 80-minute weightlifting workout at a low-medium intensity. I can tap a button at the bottom of each workout that says “Commit,” and doing this will add it to my timeline for the day. I can do the workout later by just tapping that button, and it will start the activity timer for me.\n\nI love that it can recommend these workouts for me, since otherwise “get 8.9 Strain” is an inscrutable instruction. Unfortunately, the little graphic showing time in heart rate zones is all you get. I’ve asked the Whoop Coach if it could time me through those intervals, perhaps beeping when it’s time to switch from one zone to another, but it doesn’t have that functionality.\n\nIt does offer a specific workout plan that I could punch into a workout timer app of my choice. In the past, the Whoop Coach has struggled to put together interval workouts that add up to the number of minutes that are supposed to be in the workout; that seems to be improving. But the workout ideas are still pretty generic. I found that the best way to use the coach is to see what it recommends, then use that as a sort of vague guidance if I have flexibility in my training program or my real-life plans for the day. For example, if I have a hard 45-minute running workout planned today, but Whoop thinks I should do something lighter, I might see if I can swap today's run with an easy run that is scheduled for later in the week.\n\nWhoop gives you so many sleep metrics, it can be hard to know where to start. I see two major, useful features here: the report of how long you slept compared to how much sleep you needed, and the smart alarms that you can set in any of a variety of ways.\n\nOn your Sleep tab, you’ll get a score for your sleep “performance,” comparing the amount of sleep you got to the amount it calculates you needed. Today I slept more than I needed, which doesn’t match with how I felt groggily dragging myself out of bed. The timing seems right, though—I was extra tired yesterday so I both got to bed early and slept a little late.\n\nI think it’s a fool’s errand to worry about how “accurate” sleep tracking is, since no wearable is truly accurate, but most of them are good enough. But for a comparison, the total sleep time is usually similar to what Oura reports, and the sleep phases are often more-or-less in the same ballpark. Here’s one example from a day I wore both Oura and Whoop:\n\nTotal sleep matters more than the other numbers, in my book. Increase your total sleep and you’re likely to sleep better. (I have data backing this up from my long-term Oura trends—total sleep correlates closely with other metrics and scores of sleep quality.)\n\nWhoop also tracks your “sleep debt,” or how much sleep you needed but didn’t get. In one example month I had a six nights with a “high” sleep debt of 45 minutes or more. Nine times it was moderate (30 to 45 minutes), and 14 times it was 30 minutes or less.\n\nOne of Whoop’s most intriguing features is the sleep coach, which can advise you when to go to bed, and even help you decide when your alarm should go off. (It’s also one of the most hidden features. Tap on the “tonight’s sleep” card on your overview screen.)\n\nFrom this screen, called the Sleep Planner, you can choose whether you want to “reach my sleep need” (making up any sleep debt, as needed); “improve my sleep,” which will recommend times that help you to be more consistent in your sleep schedule; or “reach my weekly plan goal,” which I’ll say more about below.\n\nAnd then, there’s a second set of preferences. When you try to set an alarm, the app will ask if you’d like to wake up at an exact time, or when you’ve met your sleep goal for the night, or as soon as you’re “in the green.” That last one refers to a 66% or better recovery, which may not be ideal, but should ensure you’re not going to be dead on your feet.\n\nRealistically, I don’t use these features too often. I do have a sleep goal set in my weekly plan, but I’m not fiddling with an app every night to decide when to wake up. On the other hand, if I had a chaotic schedule, like that of a student or a pro sports player, I could definitely see making more use of this feature.\n\nThe activity and sleep tracking happen more or less automatically, and pretty much any fitness tracker or smartwatch can do those things. Where Whoop really shines, from a wellness perspective, is in helping you track all the little habits and factors that may be affecting your sleep or your athletic performance.\n\nThis is where the Journal comes in. You can fill it out at any time during the day, but it will also pop up first thing in the morning and ask you what happened yesterday. Did you eat a late meal? Did you have any alcohol? Did you hydrate well? If you don’t like these questions, you can set it up to ask you different ones. It can also pull in data from other parts of the app or from connected apps—for example, if you log your menstrual cycle in Apple Health, that can show up here as well.\n\nEach habit or factor only becomes useful if you log at least five yeses and five nos. Anything that you almost always do, or that you almost never do, isn’t going to be very helpful to track. So I’ve narrowed down my Journal questions to only include things I’ll answer differently from night to night, or things I’m trying to improve on.\n\nOne important caveat: leaving the question blank doesn’t count as a yes or a no. At first I only answered a question if I could say “yes,” and otherwise I’d leave it blank—for example, answering “yes” if I’d had alcohol that day. But when I looked at my results later, I found that with a total of seven yeses and zero nos for alcohol, Whoop couldn’t give me any reports that used that information. When I noticed this I was able to backfill the last few days’ worth of journal entries, but you can’t go back more than about a week.\n\nThat extra week’s worth of data was enough to get an answer on alcohol, though: it hurts my recovery, taking it down an average of 9% on nights I had a beer or two. Or at least that’s how Whoop represents it—these are correlations, and Whoop doesn’t actually know what’s causing what. For example, taking melatonin supposedly hurts my recovery by 4%. But is melatonin really the culprit, or do I tend to take melatonin when I’m already having trouble sleeping? You need to take these results with a big grain of salt. To Whoop’s credit, it includes a note that “this impact is significantly different than the Whoop average. Note that impacts can sometimes be affected by other correlated factors that you don’t track.”\n\nThe two things that do help my recovery, according to Whoop’s insights (which you can access from the top of the Journal screen), are sticking to a consistent bedtime—8% improvement—and being well-hydrated, a 4% improvement. The consistent bedtime was automatically filled out from Whoop data, while the hydration came from me answering a yes/no question each day.\n\nWeekly plans are a nice way to work on a small set of habits for a short time. Rather than trying to monitor everything for every outcome, you pick, say, three things you want to work on. Here are some examples that the app provides, and the habits or factors that each one tracks:\n\nBoost fitness: increase time in high intensity heart rate zones, meet a protein goal four days per week, do any strength training activity one day per week\n\nFeel better: increase daily steps, meet hydration goal four days per week, do “any recovery activity” three days per week\n\nSleep deeper: increase sleep consistency, increase sleep performance, avoid late meals\n\nAfter experimenting with some of these, I ended up creating a custom plan for myself. I chose:\n\nGet 7:30 hours of sleep on average\n\nAvoid using my phone in bed four days per week\n\nMeet my hydration goal five days per week\n\nThroughout the week I can check in on how I’m doing, and at the end of the week Whoop gives me a little report and asks if I’d like to do the same plan next week, or change it up. I find this a useful way to work on a mini goal, and it’s a lot less overwhelming than poring over huge dashboards full of all the data Whoop can collect.\n\nFor when you do want to pore over all your data, there are detailed weekly and monthly “performance assessments” that Whoop can share with you. Each of these is a PDF with graphs showing what you did over the course of the week or month, and how it compares with previous data.\n\nFor example, my monthly report for last April shows how my Strain and recovery compare with previous weeks throughout the year. I don’t wear my Whoop often enough to get any big insights from this—as I said, I only really wear it when I’m testing features or writing a review—but man, I would love this if it were available on one of the devices I do wear month in and month out. (As much as I admire the Whoop, I can only wear so many devices in addition to the ones I test for work.)\n\nMy weekly report is more narrowly focused. The most recent one starts with a statement: “Strain was optimal. Sleep could use improvement.” My Strain is also down slightly this week compared with the previous week, and my sleep consistency was poor. I like the graph that shows how my bedtimes and wake-up times line up (or don’t) with the times the app recommended for me.\n\nThe Whoop app gives you a wealth of data, and honestly I would say most of it isn’t worth paying attention to. The app has so many data points and fractal little rabbit holes you can get lost in. You could spend hours perusing reports and tweaking settings. You could spend an unlimited amount of time chatting with the Whoop Coach AI. And you don’t need to do that.\n\nWhat is useful is choosing a few things to pay attention to and letting go of the rest. Fortunately, the app gives you plenty of ways to do this. You can select a few things that matter to you in the Weekly Plan, and you can hide things from your Dashboard that you don’t need to check on every day.\n\nAs for the things I (almost) never pay attention to:\n\nDon’t overthink your sleep stages. Getting enough sleep, and consistent sleep, will cover your bases.\n\nDon’t read too much into the recovery scores; you are resilient enough to be able to handle your scheduled workout even if your sleep wasn’t perfect. The exception would be if you’re feeling truly awful—you’re sick or something—in which case, you would know because of how you feel, not because of a number on an app.\n\nRemember that the insights tell you about correlation, not causation—as in my melatonin example, where melatonin is correlated with worse sleep, possibly because I'm taking it when I expect to have worse sleep. These are not really \"insights\" at all, just data that you'll need to use your own brain (and further experimentation) to make sense of.\n\nI have found that paying too much attention to a recovery app can drive me a little crazy. Instead of waking up and not really thinking about how I feel—I’m fine, probably—I find myself wondering if the app agrees that I feel tired and sore. Or I’ll think I’m OK, but the app says my HRV is down, and now I have to think about what may have caused that. I wouldn’t recommend intensive tracking like this for a person who finds they can easily get sucked in to obsessing over numbers. But if numbers bring you joy, the Whoop app can certainly give you plenty of them.",

    "title": "The Surprising Origins of Hanukkah (and Why It Moves Around Every Year)",
    "description": "Also: When will the Festival of Lights take place in 2025?",
    "fullText": "Hanukkah (or \"Chanukah,\" if you prefer; it’s a transliteration, so there is no “correct” spelling) is an annual eight-day Jewish religious festival that usually takes place in late November or early December. In 2025, Hanukkah begins on the evening of Sunday, December 14, and continues through Monday December 22.\n\nWhile Hanukkah falls on different dates every year on the Gregorian calendar you’re probably familiar with, it begins on the same day every year on the Hebrew calendar: 25th of Kislev. The Hebrew calendar is based on the moon, and Hanukkah falls on the 25th day after the new moon that marks the beginning of the month of Kislev.\n\nHanukkah celebrates the anniversary of the beginning of the Maccabean revolt against the Seleucid Empire and the re-dedication of the Second Temple that happened in the 2nd century BCE. That’s the strict definition of the holiday. In practice, in present day America, Hanukkah is the “festival of lights,” a winter celebration usually marked by gift-giving, delicious foods, candle-lighting, and the boring game of dreidel (more on that below).\n\nReligiously, Hanukkah is a comparatively minor holiday, not nearly as significant as the Jewish High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but it is a favorite among children, particularly American children. These days, the holiday is marked in Jewish communities all over the world, but Jewish kids in the U.S. are the undisputed Hanukkah kings and queens.\n\nThere are two ways to think about the origin of the Festival of Lights. You could say Hanukkah began around 200 BCE when Greek leaders prevented Jews from practicing their religion, leading the Maccabees to rise up in defiance. Or you could say Hanukkah began in Cincinnati.\n\nBefore a couple hundred years ago, there’s no record of how anyone celebrated Hanukkah—maybe it was done, but it seems that no one made too big of a deal about it. That all changed in the mid-to-late 1800s, when a couple of Cincinnati rabbis, Isaac M. Wise and Max Lilienthal, put Hanukkah on the holiday map. They popularized, promoted, and Americanized the holiday, introducing celebrations of Hanukkah to their congregations and promoting it in national Jewish publications.\n\nWise and Lilienthal were leaders of Reform Judaism, a more modern, less orthodox form of the religion, and to some extent, the holiday they popularized reflects that set of values. It was meant to help Jewish children in America honor their heritage by presenting an exciting, relatable historical event featuring Jewish heroes. it was also meant to be Christmas-like—a family holiday that’s fun.\n\nLilienthal noted the rising popularity of Christmas celebrations in the U.S. in the 1800s, and was impressed with the way Christian churches used the secular aspects of the holiday to teach their faith, so he borrowed the gift-giving and lighthearted nature of non-religious Christmas celebrations and put a Jewish spin on ‘em. Thus modern Hanukkah was born.\n\n“We must do something, too, to enliven our children… [They] shall have a grand and glorious Chanukah festival nicer than any Christmas festival.” Lilienthal wrote in 1876.\n\nThe main event of Hanukkah among most who celebrate is the lighting of candles before dinner, one more for each successive night of the festival. When the Maccabees rebuilt the temple back in the olden times, they re-lit the menorahs—candle holders for seven candles—but they only had enough oil for the candles to burn for one night (or so the story goes). Miraculously, the lights stayed on for eight nights.\n\nTechnically, most people don’t light menorahs on Hanukkah. Menorahs have eight lights. Hanukkah candles are usually in a “hanukkiah” which holds nine: eight main candles and the helper candle that lights them all.\n\nFoodwise, you can eat whatever you like—this isn't a fasting holiday. Fried foods, particularly latkes (fried potato pancakes), are popular and delicious, especially if served with sour cream and/or apple sauce. Jelly doughnuts are another favorite. But like I said, you can eat whatever you like.\n\nMany Hanukkah-heads give gifts too—one for each night.\n\nHanukkah carols have never really caught on because golden age Jewish songwriters were busy writing “Let it Snow,” “Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,” “Silver Bells,” “White Christmas,” “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” and almost every other Christmas song that isn’t a hymn. But there's \"I Have a Little Dreidel,\" a folksong with English lyrics attributed to Samuel E. Goldfarb, but that's not explicitly about the holiday. This all leaves Adam Sandler's \"Hanukkah Song\" as the most well-known tune commemorating the Festival of Lights.\n\nSpeaking of dreidels, though...\n\nMany households break out dreidels (spinning tops with Hebrew characters on them) and play with them for a few minutes after dinner. Dreidels are marked with Nun (נ), Gimel (ג), Hey (ה), and Shin (ש), which form an acronym for \"Nes Gadol Hayah Sham\" (A great miracle happened there). Here's how the game is traditionally played: Everyone starts with the same amount of something \"valuable,\" usually chocolate coins. At the start of a round, everyone antes up, then they takes turns spinning the dreidel, following the directions of which character it lands on.\n\nנ (Nun) means “nisht” or “nothing.” Player does nothing if Nun comes up.\n\nה (Hey) means “halb” or “half.” The player gets half of the pot. (If there is an odd number of pieces, the player gets the extra.)\n\nש (Shin) means “shtel” or “put in.” The player adds a chocolate coin to the pot.\n\nג (Gimel) means “gantz” or “everything.” The player gets everything in the pot. Jackpot!\n\n(It's not a very good game: all luck; no skill.)\n\nIt’s widely believed that dreidel is the most popular Hanukkah game, but this is a lie. The most popular (and best) Hanukkah game is “guess which candle will be the last to go out,” a much more nuanced and exciting game played by everyone who has ever fired up a menorah (sorry, a hanukkiah) before dinner. Do darker candles burn faster than lighter ones? Does placement matter? How about wick length? All of this and more must be considered and discussed if you’re going to master this exciting game.\n\nYou can celebrate any holiday you want; it's a free country. Hanukkah is generally seen as a “fun” holiday, without the deep religious significance of other Jewish holidays. While I don’t speak for anyone else, none of the Jews I know take offense if non-Jews want to light some candles and watch 8 Crazy Nights to capture some of that Hanukkah magic. Some of the traditions of the holiday were partly inspired by Christmas anyway, and much of Christmas was (maybe) appropriated from pagan solstice celebrations itself, so go nuts—it’s the holidays.",

    "description": "GPT-5.2 is here, and, according to OpenAI, better than ever.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is having a hell of a day. First, the company announced a $1 billion equity investment from Disney, alongside a licensing deal that will let Sora users generate videos with characters like Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker, and Simba. Shortly after, OpenAI revealed its latest large language model: GPT-5.2.\n\nOpenAI says that this new GPT model is particularly useful for \"professional knowledge work.\" The company advertises how GPT-5.2 is better than previous models at making spreadsheets, putting together presentations, writing code, analyzing pictures, and working through multi-step projects. For this model, the company also gathered insights from tech companies: Supposedly, Notion, Box Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom all find GPT-5.2 to have \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning,\" while Databricks, Hex, and Triple Whale believe GPT-5.2 to be \"exceptional\" with both agentic data science and document analysis tasks.\n\nBut most of OpenAI's user base aren't professionals. Most of the users who will interact with GPT-5.2 are using ChatGPT, and many of those for free, at that. What can those users expect when OpenAI upgrades the free version of ChatGPT with these new models?\n\nOpenAI says that GPT-5.2 will improve ChatGPT's \"day to day\" functionality. The new model supposedly makes the chatbot more structured, reliable, and \"enjoyable to talk to,\" though I've never found the last part to be necessarily true.\n\nGPT-5.2 will impact the ChatGPT experience differently depending on which of the three models you happen to be using. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Instant is for \"everyday work and learning.\" It's apparently better for questions seeking information about certain subjects, how-to questions and walkthroughs, technical writing, and translations—maybe ChatGPT will get you to give up your Duolingo obsession.\n\nGPT-5.2 Thinking, however, is supposedly made for \"deeper work.\" OpenAI wants you using this model for coding, summarizing lengthy documents, answering queries about files you send to ChatGPT, solving math and logic problems, and decision making. Finally, there's GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI's \"smartest and most trustworthy option\" for the most complicated questions. The company says 5.2 Pro produces fewer errors and stronger performance compared to previous models.\n\nOpenAI says that this latest update improves how the models responds to distressing prompts, such as those showing signs of suicide, self-harm, or emotional dependence on the AI. As such, the company says this model has \"fewer undesirable responses\" in GPT-5.2 Instant and Thinking compared to GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking. In addition, the company is working on an \"age prediction model,\" which will automatically place content restrictions on users who the model think are under 18.\n\nThese safety improvements are important—critical, even—as we start to understand the correlations between chatbots and mental health. The company has admitted its failure in \"recognizing signs of delusion,\" as users turned to the tool for emotional support. In some cases, ChatGPT fed into delusional thinking, encouraging people's dangerous beliefs. Some families have even sued companies like OpenAI over claims that their chatbots helped or encouraged victims commit suicide.\n\nActively acknowledging improvements to user safety is undoubtedly a good thing, but I think companies like OpenAI still have a lot to reckon with—and a long way to go.\n\nOpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro will all roll out today, Thursday, Dec. 11, to paid plans. Developers can access the new models in the API today, as well.\n\nDisclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "title": "Google Will Now Let You Virtually Try on Clothes With Just a Selfie",
    "description": "Is this useful, or creepy?",
    "fullText": "The pace of AI technology is so rapid, it's tough to keep up with everything. At Google I/O back in May, Google rolled out an AI-powered shopping feature that let you virtually try on clothes you find online. All you needed to do was upload a full-length photo of yourself, and Google's AI would be to dress you up in whatever article of clothing you liked. I still can't decide whether the feature sounds useful, creepy, or a little bit of both.\n\nWhat I can say, however, is that the feature is getting a little creepier. On Thursday, Google announced an update to its virtual try on feature, that takes advantage of the company's new AI image model, Nano Banana. Now, you don't need a full-length photo of yourself: just a selfie. With solely a photo of your face, Nano Banana will generate a full-length avatar in your likeness, which you can use to virtually try on your clothes.\n\nI'm not exactly sure who this particular update is for: Maybe there are some of us out there who want to use this virtual try-on feature, but don't have a full-length photo of ourselves to share. Personally, I wouldn't really want to send Google my photo—selfie or otherwise—but I don't think I'd prefer to have Google infer what I look like from a photo of my face alone. I'd rather just send it the full photo, and give it something to actually work off of.\n\nHere's the other issue: While Google asks you to only upload images of yourself, it doesn't stop you if you upload an image of someone else. Talk about creepy: You can upload someone else's selfie and see how they look in various clothes. There is a system in place to stop you from uploading certain selfies, like celebrities, children, or otherwise \"unsafe\" items, but if the system fails, this feature could be used maliciously. I feel like Google could get around this by verifying the selfie against your Google Account, since you need to be signed in to use the feature anyway.\n\nIf you are interested in trying the feature out—and, subsequently, trying on virtual clothes with your AI-generated avatar—you can head over to Google's try on feature, sign into your Google Account, and upload your selfie. When it processes, you choose one of four avatars, each dressed in a different fit, to proceed. Once through, you can virtually try on any clothes you see in the feed.\n\nAgain, I see the potential usefulness of a feature that lets you see what you might look like in a certain piece of clothing before buying it. But, at the same time, I think I'd rather just order the item and try it on in the comfort (and privacy) of my own home.",

    "description": "The Buffalo Bills were Super Bowl favourites but must win at the in-form New England Patriots to have a chance of stopping their divisional rivals winning the AFC East.",
    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:45 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Detroit Lions v Los Angeles Rams on Sunday (from 21:00).\n\nThere are four weeks left in the NFL's regular season and I feel like every year we're saying this, but I don't think the league's ever been this contested.\n\nThere's been so many games where you cannot blink or take anything for granted. Some play-off spots won't be decided until week 18, so for so many teams, that final game will be incredibly meaningful.\n\nThe AFC East title could go down to the wire, but the Buffalo Bills will need to stop the New England Patriots' 10-game win streak when the divisional rivals meet at Foxborough this Sunday.\n\nThe Bills improved their record to 9-4 with a 39-34 win over the Bengals last Sunday, and it was just Josh Allen doing Josh Allen things again, especially in that fourth quarter. He just puts on his cape and make things happen. That's what makes the Bills so dangerous. He was last season's Most Valuable Player and he's a guy who can change the game and rally the troops around him.\n\nBuffalo had a rough spell but have won their past two. At this time of year, you've been able to have a true self-scout, so things are coming together for them, and last Sunday's win was huge. The Bills were on the edge of the AFC play-off rankings and now they've solidified themselves. If they win at the Patriots, who are 11-2, the Bills will be just one win back with three games left.\n\nNew England's schedule looks easier than Buffalo's though. The Patriots finish with Baltimore, the Jets and the Dolphins. The Bills go against the Browns, the Eagles and the Jets.\n\nThere's a high probability Buffalo won't win the AFC East for the first time in six years, and few expected New England to win the division after back-to-back four-win seasons.\n\nIn the past, there was an expectation with the Patriots because they had greatness. They had Tom Brady and had been winning for so long. Now there's straight excitement about current quarterback Drake Maye and what this team can do. They could clinch the AFC East on Sunday, which is huge for them.\n\nSometimes it's better when you're that team with no expectations, but the Patriots have Mike Vrabel as head coach. He won three Super Bowls with them as a player and he's brought in the right people. Josh McDaniels won six Super Bowls on the Patriots' coaching staff but wasn't successful as head coach of the Raiders. Vrabel pairing him as offensive coordinator with Maye has been so good though. McDaniels understands what it takes to win in the AFC East, to win in the cold and how to attack those teams.\n\nNew England had one of the easiest schedules this season, but you still have to win those games. Vrabel's been using the word 'champions' and I think all the guys are starting to believe in that championship mentality. I love how he also says 'no naps', like, you can't sleep on anybody and you've got to keep doing the right things. I think he's a great leader who's learned how to inspire from being in this situation as a player.\n\nThe Patriots were the ones that broke the Bills' undefeated start in week five and when you do that on the road, your team's going to walk away and think 'alright, we actually might have something here'. Then all these wins they've had is building more and more confidence.\n\nThe Patriots aren't outstanding in any one category, offensively or defensively, but Maye has been brilliant, especially as a second-year quarterback. He can run the ball and be a big threat with his legs, and his decision making has gotten so much better. He gets to the top of his drop and he's already kind of made his decision on where he wants to throw the ball, because he's reading the field so quickly.\n\nMaye's got the NFL's best pass completion percentage, only Matthew Stafford has a higher passer rating, and only Dak Prescott has more pass yards. Maye's thrown 23 touchdown passes versus six interceptions. In every game, he's had 200+ pass yards and that goes to show that, for the most part, he's made the right decisions. He's protecting the football, and he's using different weapons to throw to.\n\nEarly in the season, Stefon Diggs was pretty much the star of the show. That gave Maye confidence and now he's using a slew of different receivers. They were kind of identifying their roles and now they're elevating each other. Maye has also been doing it without Will Campbell on the offensive line the past few weeks.\n\nHe is very much in the MVP conversation, but Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has just been phenomenal. It's his 17th year in the league and this is probably his best season. He leads the league with 35 touchdowns, with just four interceptions.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Maye does this week against Buffalo and then Baltimore. There's the irony of playing the past two MVPs - Allen and Lamar Jackson - and some people might say that could determine whether Maye becomes this season's MVP.\n\nAllen's still breaking records and it's hard to watch that game on Sunday and not think 'wow, this guy is so different'. I mean, which other quarterback has a 40-yard touchdown run in the snow? But I don't know if they'd give him a back-to-back MVP. Last year made sense because of how he took care of the ball but this year he hasn't been as perfect.\n\nBuffalo have a rivalry with the Patriots and, after losing to them in October, I think the Bills understand the importance of Sunday's game and what it can mean to go into Foxborough and get the win. But this is going to be a challenge for their defence, for sure.\n\nWith the different offensive weapons the Patriots have through the air, I think the Bills' defence has to step up and force turnovers. You know it's going to be a Stefon Diggs game when his former team Buffalo is involved, so I think that Maye-Diggs connection is where the outcome lies.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

I need help.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City manager Taylor took over in August, replacing interim boss Amber Whiteley who had guided the team to a seventh-place finish in the WSL last season.\n\nHowever, Taylor has won just three matches in his five months in charge, all against WSL 2-level opposition in the Women's League Cup.\n\n\"I think there's no doubt that we have regressed as a team for sure, more than is expected of a club like Liverpool,\" Taylor added.\n\n\"We have given it everything. We are trying to coach the players. The players are really honest.\n\n\"The reality is we are aware of it and I think sometimes you can be really exposed - and that's what has happened tonight.\"\n\nIn Taylor's defence, his early tenure on Merseyside has been disrupted by injuries to key players.\n\nPlaymaker Marie Hobinger and striker Sophie Roman Haug both suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, while experienced players such as Ceri Holland and Gemma Bonner have also had spells on the sidelines.",

    "fullText": "Wolves got their transfer business \"wrong\" in the summer, says technical director Matt Jackson - while under-fire executive chairman Jeff Shi insists he can empathise with protesting fans.\n\nRob Edwards' side are bottom of the Premier League with just two points and have not won in the top flight since April, while their current eight-game losing run has equalled a club record set in 1981-82.\n\nIt comes after a summer in which Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were sold to Manchester United and Manchester City for a combined £92.5m, and captain Nelson Semedo left on a free transfer.\n\nDuring that time, Wolves signed six players - Fer Lopez, Jhon Arias, Tolu Arokodare, David Moller Wolfe, Jackson Tchatchoua and Ladislav Krejci - without Premier League experience.\n\n\"The players who were brought in were brought in for the right reasons, but when you have a return of two points at this stage you have to say it's wrong because whatever starting XI we have put out has not been good enough,\" said Jackson, who also said Wolves will not give up on Premier League survival.\n\n\"We have a great belief in those players developing. The ability and will to improve has been excellent - but you want immediate returns.\n\n\"For the way we can go into the market for our players, it's tough. We don't have endless resources so we are trying to find players in markets where others aren't necessarily looking.\"\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen made his loan permanent for £23m after scoring 14 times last season, but the Norway striker has netted just once in the league this term.\n\nExecutive chairman Jeff Shi added: \"Maybe we sold too many players in one window. You can see the squad and compare it to last season, maybe we changed 40 or 50% of the key players.\n\n\"It's a task to rebuild a team but the Premier League is very tough. If you can't control the tempo and need a longer time to rebuild the team the games will punish you.\"",

As part of the State of Play for First Light, Gibson was officially confirmed while five other cast members were revealed.\n\nOne role that is currently unrevealed is the game's nemesis, 009. This former MI6 agent is being hunted by Bond and his allies, but the extent of 009's ambitions are unclear.\n\nIO Interactive was more forthcoming about other aspects of the game, which we included in our recap of everything we learned about 007: First Light. The publisher also unveiled multiple editions of the game, which you can find in our First Light preorder guide.\n\n007 First Light will hit PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S on March 27, 2026. You can find all of the currently announced cast members below.\n\nPatrick Gibson is making his video game debut as the voice and likeness of James Bond in 007 First Light. In the absence of a 007 actor on the big screen, he's the incumbent Bond for the moment.\n\nGibson recently had one of his biggest roles to date as young Dexter Morgan in Dexter: Original Sin. Prior to that, he had leading roles on Netflix's Shadow and Bone and The OA. One of Gibson's earliest acting credits was in Showtime's The Tudors. On the big screen, Gibson has appeared in a handful of movies including the 2019 J.R.R. Tolkien biopic, Tolkien.\n\nPriyanga Burford had a small role in the last Bond movie as a MI6 scientist in No Time To Die. She has a considerably bigger part as M in 007 First Light.\n\nBurford's credits are primarily in television, and she had leading and supporting roles in Steeltown Murders, Before We Die, Avenue 5, Industry, Housebound, and Press.\n\nThe Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead fans will surely recognize Lennie James, who portrayed Morgan Jones across both series. In First Light, James will play Bond's mentor, John Greenway.\n\nJames has also lent his voice to the Destiny games, where he portrayed Lord Shaxx. The English actor has a long list of credits across TV and film, including Blade Runner 2049, Human Target, Invincible, Archer, Jericho, and Mufasa: The Lion King.\n\nKiera Lester is a relative newcomer to the entertainment industry, with only a handful of television credits to her name. She has appeared in Sister Boniface Mysteries, Wreck, Ruby Speaking, Grace, and Death in Paradise.\n\nLester's role as Miss Moneypenny in 007 First Light will be one of her most prominent parts to date.\n\nVeteran actor Alastair Mackenzie will voice Q, the man who creates all of Bond's incredible gadgets. We don't know yet how Mackenzie's take on the character will differ from his on-screen predecessors. But unlike the last Q, Ben Whishaw, Mackenzie is considerably older than the actor playing Bond.\n\nAndor fans may recognize Mackenzie from his role as Perrin Fertha, the husband on Mon Mothma. Some of his other credits include The Crown, Dracula, Unforgotten, Outlaw King, and Backdraft 2.\n\nWho is Miss Roth? She appears to be the femme fatale Bond girl in 007 First Light. Noemie Nakai will lend her voice and likeness to Miss Roth in the game.\n\nNakai's most prominent TV role was in HBO Max's Tokyo Vice, and her other credits include Army of Thieves, Never Let Me Go, The Emperor's Cook, and Death Note: New Generation.\n\nBritish actress Gemma Chan--known for her roles in Transformers: The Last Knight, Crazy Rich Asians, and Captain Marvel--will appear in First Light as the character Selina Tan.\n\nShe's described as a \"brilliant and passionate academic with a background in psychology and game theory.\" The character, who works at MI6, played a \"critical role\" in helping James Bond earn his 00 status.\n\nThis is not Chan's first video game role, as she also portrayed Erys in Diablo IV. Chan lent her voice and likeness to 007 First Light.\n\nMusician and actor Lenny Kravitz will play the villain Bawma.",

    "fullText": "Over the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",
