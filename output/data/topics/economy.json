    "fullText": "Silicon Valley is sending a clear message about how staff should perform, and how it wants to pay them.\n\nInstead of obsessing over punishing the bottom of the stack, Big Tech is increasingly choosing to shower rewards on the top:\n\nWhat's especially notable is how this is being driven by AI, according to Zuhayeer Musa, cofounder of Silicon Valley compensation data cruncher Levels.fyi.\n\nAs AI tools get more powerful, the value of high-leverage individuals is rising. The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds. And Silicon Valley is increasingly willing to pay for it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The CEO of a digital economy think tank said relying on identical AI tools can erode competitive edge and weaken firms' independence.",
    "fullText": "As companies rush to adopt AI to boost productivity and cut costs, they may be setting themselves up for a new problem: losing what makes them different.\n\nMehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, said widespread reliance on the same AI tools risks flattening competitive advantage across industries, because firms increasingly rely on identical systems to think, write, and decide for them.\n\nParyavi said that as AI tools become cheaper, more powerful, and more widely deployed, companies risk outsourcing the very thinking that once differentiated them.\n\nWhile AI can boost efficiency in the short term, he said, relying on shared models and standardized systems could leave businesses competing on cost and speed alone — eroding originality, strategic depth, and long-term advantage.\n\n\"If you and your competitor are all using the same service, you have no edge over each other,\" Paryavi told Business Insider.\n\n\"Their AI and your AI against each other — I don't know who's going to win.\"\n\nAs generative AI becomes embedded across workplaces, Paryavi warned that the biggest risk isn't automation — it's uniformity.\n\nWhen companies rely on the same large language models trained on the same data, decision-making, writing, and problem-solving can start to converge, shrinking the space for creative divergence.\n\nThat concern echoes warnings from researchers and academics who say AI can produce polished output at scale, but also flips human thinking by delivering fluent answers before understanding, creating an illusion of expertise that weakens judgment and depth.\n\nWhen everyone relies on the same models trained on the same data, Paryavi said, creative divergence shrinks.\n\n\"The beauty of our world is that we have different choices because we think differently,\" he said. \"That's where innovation comes from.\"\n\nIt's not just a question of companies all thinking the same — Paryavi warned that treating AI as a shortcut to efficiency can quietly hollow out human judgment, expertise, and control, leaving businesses faster in the short term but more fragile over time.\n\nOver time, Paryavi said, that shift can erode internal expertise and decision-making capacity.\n\n\"What they don't think about is that initially it might sound more efficient and more productive and cheaper,\" he said. \"But this is going to be very expensive down the line.\"\n\nOne risk, Paryavi said, is dependency. As firms replace employees with AI subscriptions, they become increasingly reliant on external vendors to function effectively.\n\nParyavi compared the AI boom to the early 2000s rush to cloud computing, when many companies initially adopted third-party infrastructure but later repatriated workloads in-house as costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in became concerns — a trend commonly referred to in tech as cloud repatriation.\n\nThe same dynamic could play out with AI, Paryavi said — except with even higher stakes. As companies downsize human teams, they also lose institutional knowledge and the ability to operate without automation, he said.\n\n\"You've killed all your chances of ever becoming independent as an organization,\" he said. \"You've fired your manpower. You've made them no good.\"\n\nAI, he said, is not inherently harmful. In fields such as medicine, scientific research, and disaster prediction, it can significantly accelerate progress.\n\nBut without clear guardrails, companies risk trading long-term resilience for short-term speed.\n\n\"It's a very powerful tool,\" Paryavi said, comparing AI to an atomic bomb. \"If that [an atomic bomb] can eliminate an entire population physically, this [AI] can eliminate humanity cognitively.\"",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic.\n\nHarsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran’s ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country’s theocracy.\n\nThere have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the death toll, at 2,797. The number continues to rise.\n\nIran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.”\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran.\n\nKhatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump’s soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.”\n\n“They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. “Americans and Zionists should not expect peace.”\n\nHis fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nPeskov said “the situation in the region is quite tense, and the president is continuing his efforts to help de-escalate it.”\n\nRussia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month.\n\nExiled Iranian royal calls for fight to continue\n\nDays after Trump pledged “help is on its way” for the protesters, both the demonstrations and the prospect of imminent U.S. retaliation appeared to have receded. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had raised concerns with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nYet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance.\n\n“I believe the president is a man of his word,\" Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that \"regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“\n\nDespite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall.\n\nIran and the U.S. traded angry accusations Thursday at a session of the United Nations Security Council, with U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz saying that Trump “has made it clear that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter.”\n\nGholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., blasted the U.S. for what he said was American “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”\n\nIran authorities list protest damage\n\nKhatami, the hard-line cleric, also provided the first overall statistics on damage from the protests, claiming 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other holy places had sustained damage. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government.\n\nHe said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulance, 71 fire department vehicles and another 50 emergency vehicles also sustained damage.\n\nEven as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAmid the continuing internet shutdown, some Iranians crossed borders to communicate with the outside world. At a border crossing in Turkey’s eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout.\n\n“I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns.\n\nAlso crossing the border were some Turkish citizens escaping the unrest in Iran.\n\nMehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey.\n\nAlthough he did not venture into the streets, Önder said he heard heavy gunfire.\n\n“I understand guns, because I served in the military in the southeast of Turkey,” he said. “The guns they were firing were not simple weapons. They were machine-guns.”\n\nIn a sign of the conflict’s potential to spill over borders, a Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s crackdown on protests.\n\nA representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran.\n\nThe death toll of at least 2,797, provided by the Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.\n\nThe agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. Iran's government has not provided casualty figures.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press journalist Serra Yedikardes contributed to this story from Kapikoy Border Crossing, Turkey.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s second term has been eventful. You wouldn’t know it from his approval numbers.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from January found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s performance as president. That’s virtually unchanged from March 2025, shortly after he took office for the second time.\n\nThe new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research does show subtle signs of vulnerability for the Republican president. Trump hasn’t convinced Americans that the economy is in good shape, and many question whether he has the right priorities when he’s increasingly focused on foreign intervention. His approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has also slipped since he took office.\n\nHere’s how Americans’ views of Trump have — and haven’t — changed over the past year, according to AP-NORC polling.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 Americans consistently approved of Trump's performance\n\nCall it a gift or a curse — for all his unpredictability, Trump's approval numbers just don't change very much.\n\nThis was largely the case during his first term in office, too. Early in his first term, 42% of Americans approved of how he was handling the presidency. There were some ups and downs over the ensuing years, but he left office with almost the same approval.\n\nThat level of consistency on presidential approval numbers could be the new normal for U.S. politics — or it could be unique to Trump. Gallup polling since the 1950s shows that presidential approval ratings have grown less variable over time. But President Joe Biden had a slightly different experience. Biden, a Democrat, entered the White House with higher approval numbers than Trump has ever received, but those fell rapidly during his first two years in office, then stayed low for the remainder of his term.\n\nMost Americans have held a critical view of Trump throughout his time in office, and Americans are twice as likely to say he's focused on the wrong priorities than the right ones. About half of U.S. adults say he’s mostly focusing on the wrong priorities one year into his second term, and approximately 2 in 10 say he’s mostly focused on the right priorities. Another 2 in 10, roughly, say it’s been about an even mix, and 14% say they don't have an opinion.\n\nThe economy has haunted Trump in his first year back in the White House, despite his insistence that “the Trump economic boom has officially begun.”\n\nJust 37% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling the economy. That’s up slightly from 31% in December — which marked a low point for Trump — but Trump started out with low approval on this issue, which doesn’t give him a lot of room for error.\n\nThe economy is a new problem for Trump. His approval rating on this issue in his first term fluctuated, but it was typically higher. Close to half of Americans approved of Trump’s economic approach for much of his first White House stint, and he’s struggled to adjust to this as a weak point. Americans care a lot more about costs than they did in Trump’s first term, and, like Biden, he’s persistently asserted that the U.S. economy is not a problem while the vast majority describe it as “poor.”\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults say Trump has done more to hurt the cost of living in his second term, while only about 2 in 10 say he’s done more to help. About one-quarter say he hasn't made an impact.\n\nViews of Trump’s handling of immigration have declined\n\nWhen Trump entered office, immigration was among his strongest issues. It’s since faded, a troubling sign for Trump, who campaigned on both economic prosperity and crackdowns to illegal immigration.\n\nJust 38% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, down from 49% in March. The poll was conducted Jan. 8-11, shortly after the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.\n\nBut there are signs that Americans still give Trump some leeway on immigration issues. About half of U.S. adults say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, which is unchanged since April, despite an immigration crackdown that spread to cities across the U.S. in the second half of the year.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, say Trump has helped immigration and border security “a lot” or “a little” in his second term. This is an area where Democrats are more willing to give Trump some credit. About 2 in 10 Democrats say Trump has helped on this issue, higher than the share of Democrats who say he's helped on costs or job creation.\n\nAs Trump turns to foreign policy, most Americans disapprove of his approach\n\nTrump has focused his attention more on foreign policy in his second term, and polling shows most Americans disapprove of his approach.\n\nBut much like Trump's overall approval, views of his handling of foreign policy have changed little in his second term, despite wide-ranging actions including his push to control Greenland and the recent military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of foreign policy, and most Americans, 56%, say Trump has “gone too far” in using the U.S. military to intervene in other countries.\n\nTrump’s continued focus on global issues could be a liability given its sharp contrast with the “America First” platform he ran on and Americans’ growing concern with costs at home. But it could also be hard to shift views on the issue — even if Trump takes more dramatic action in the coming months.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,203 adults was conducted Jan. 8-11 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

    "fullText": "Citi's top executives warned that President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates could have dire consequences.\n\n\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly,\" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a call with reporters ahead of the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"At the end of the day, I think an interest rate cap would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most, and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy.\"\n\nMason said multiple times that he did not want to speculate on the impact of the potential cap, given the limited available information. He said that Citi would work with the Trump administration to address the \"important issue\" of affordability.\n\nReporters asked Mason about the cap multiple times, and he repeatedly said it would likely not help customers most in need, as is Trump's stated intention. He said later in the call that, again, it would have a \"very negative impact on the economy.\"\n\nOn the bank's earnings call, CEO Jane Fraser said that \"a rate cap is not something that we can support\" when asked about the news that Bilt Rewards is releasing three cards with interest rates capped at 10%, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\"To be clear, the impact to us and other banks would just be dwarfed by the severe impact on access to credit and on consumer spending across the country. These things just don't work out as intended,\" Fraser continued.\n\nMuch like Mason did on an earlier call, Fraser acknowledged the importance of affordability and said she's keen to collaborate with the administration.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump said he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates. He argued that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. A cap would have to be approved by Congress, and similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nOther bank leaders, including JPMorgan's CFO, Jeremy Barnum, have warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; however, others in the financial sector have applauded the plan.\n\nCiti's profits fell 13% in the fourth quarter, to $2.47 billion, brought down partly by the sale of its operations in Russia, the bank said in an earnings report.\n\nThe bank saw an 84% surge in financial advisory fees in the fourth quarter. The investment banking unit has been reenergized under its new head, JPMorgan veteran Viswas Raghavan. Investment banking revenues increased by 38%, the bank said, and investment banking fees rose 35%.\n\nCiti said that its \"Transformation\" — a years-long effort to modernize the bank and cut costs— is more than 80% complete, as stated in its earnings presentation. Fraser's attempted turnaround has included layoffs, new hires, and multibillion-dollar investments.",

    "title": "Goldman Sachs breaks down what the doomsayers get wrong about the US economy in 8 charts",
    "description": "Investors gripped with concern over the US economy can relax. Goldman Sachs explains why common worries, including frothy valuations, are overblown.",
    "fullText": "American investors are worried.\n\nThey've been worried for a while now: that a recession is coming, that stock valuations are overheated, and that AI spending is the only thing keeping the economy (and markets) afloat.\n\nAnd if you're in the wealth management business, like Goldman Sachs, it's your job to listen to these concerns. To nod solemnly and empathize as your millionaire clients lay bare their greatest fears. And then it's your job to tell them that, actually, things aren't so bad, and despite all the apparent chaos out there, it would be quite unwise to cash out your chips in the US stock market.\n\nGoldman Sachs' wealth management unit did just that Monday, sending out a report to clients saying that the outlook for the US economy and stock market is bright — and that most of the concerns keeping investors awake at night are overblown.\n\n\"Clients — and also some colleagues — are now asking whether it is time to reduce exposure to US equities in favor of other developed and emerging markets,\" the firm's Investment Strategy Group wrote in its 2026 outlook report. But it concludes that many of the perceived risks dominating conversations these days — from tariffs to government dysfunction to market concentration — are overstated, and that the most significant risk for equities, a US recession, is unlikely.\n\nThe group puts the probability of a recession at 25%, down from last year's estimate of around 35%. Instead, Goldman's base-case projection calls for continued economic expansion and robust earnings growth for the S&P 500.\n\n\"We wanted to emphasize that in spite of all the headlines that you read about 'Is America on the decline?' et cetera, we want to make a very strong stand and say, 'No, that is not the case,'\" Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer of the Investment Strategy Group, said in a media appearance for the report's release.\n\nThe US remains the preeminent destination for investors around the world, Mossavar-Rahmani said — and a \"surprising\" number of popular narratives miss what's actually driving growth and returns.\n\n\"We want to dispel a couple of myths,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nHere are some of the other takeaways from Goldman's Investment Strategy Group, and what they're telling wealthy clients to do with their money in 2026.\n\nGoldman's team argues that \"US preeminence\" is evident across multiple measures, including economic wealth, labor productivity, deep capital markets, and natural resources — advantages they say are difficult for other major economies to match.\n\nThey also point to US leadership in key innovation areas, including semiconductors, biotechnology, and AI, as well as the scale and liquidity of US equity and bond markets.\n\nDespite political turmoil and tariff uncertainty, Goldman says the US remains a magnet for global capital.\n\n\"When people say, 'Oh, money's flowing out of the US.' It actually isn't. We had one month when that was the case,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nThat month of outflows came last April, in the aftermath of Trump's Liberation Day tariff plan announcement. Since then, foreign investors have flooded back into the US.\n\nOne argument for US economic fragility is that the boom in AI-adjacent tech spending — including data centers, chips, and power infrastructure — is propping up GDP.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has a more dour global economic outlook, estimated the US would have been in a recession in the first half of last year if not for AI investments. A report from Deutsche Bank shows they're not alone in that sentiment.\n\nBut Goldman says that view is off base, and that people underestimate how much consumption contributes to GDP. The bank's investment strategy group estimates all tech-related spending accounted for 0.5% of the 2.1% GDP growth in 2025, and Goldman's chief economist says AI capital expenditures accounted for just 0.1%.\n\nThe estimate, which \"includes everything related to AI, including data centers,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said, is \"probably a little bit on the high side because they're trying to include all the power generation as well, all the utility infrastructure that has benefits elsewhere other than just AI.\"\n\nThis dovetails with the myth that the US stock market is dependent on AI and the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), according to Mossavar-Rahmani.\n\n\"It's just not correct that AI has driven everything in the US, including all earnings and including S&P 500 returns,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nWhile no one disputes the incredible performance of these tech titans, Goldman contends that the rest of the S&P 500 receives short shrift and that earnings growth and returns remain respectable even after stripping out the contributions from the Magnificent Seven.\n\n\"This idea that it would be a poor economy, a weak economy, no earnings, no returns is again, just another falsehood,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit record highs last year, and investors often worry that new highs mean a painful drop is imminent. In reality, history shows that the market usually continues to post robust gains after hitting an all-time high, Goldman notes.\n\nWhile Goldman acknowledges valuations are elevated, it doesn't see an overheated market reminiscent of past market bubbles. It expects the S&P 500 to continue its rise in 2026, with a base-case estimate of a 7% total return and 10% earnings growth.\n\nGoldman's \"good\" scenario assumes a 17% return; its \"bad\" scenario assumes a 15% decline in a recession. (The team assigns a higher probability to upside than downside.)\n\n\"We do think that there are some good fundamental reasons why valuations have increased over time that are not just because of speculative excesses,\" said Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation within Goldman's investment strategy group.\n\nIn the run-up to the Dot Com bust at the turn of the century, for example, valuations and investor exuberance were divorced from earnings reality, which isn't the case today.\n\nYes, the S&P 500 is highly concentrated, Goldman says, but today's tech companies have enormous profit margins justifying their stock valuations, not just hype.\n\nGoldman isn't worried about a bubble in US equities. Where its investment strategists do see cause for concern is bitcoin.\n\n\"We do think bitcoin is a bubble,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said, noting that explosive price behavior in the cryptocurrency usually precedes a steep drawdown.\n\n\"We are even more convinced than we were in 2021 that bitcoin has no real value, that it is a speculative and trading asset and that only questionable practices support its current price,\" the 2026 outlook report says.\n\nAnother area of concern is gold, which is at unsustainable price levels unless central banks — especially the Chinese government and households — continue to buy it to prop it up, Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\n\"We do not recommend clients use gold or bitcoin as a hedge in their portfolios,\" the report says.\n\nThere are also \"pockets of euphoria\" in generative AI, with some public and private companies carrying bubble-like valuations, according to Goldman's outlook, which calls out the circular financing, easy credit, and questionable economics, coupled with soaring expectations.\n\n\"Some AI company founders and CEOs of the major companies involved with AI have raised expectations to an unrealistic level about what AI will deliver in the near future in terms of both revenues for the AI companies and productivity gains for enterprises leveraging AI,\" the report says.",

    "fullText": "CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil landed an interview with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and one of the unusual moments came when the president talked of what would have happened if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election.\n\nThe president was claiming Harris would have continued what he called a “mess” of an economy under Joe Biden.\n\nTony Dokoupil’s First Week As ‘CBS Evening News’ Anchor Down Year Over Year; ‘World News Tonight’ Tops Viewers, ‘Nightly News’ Wins 25-54 Demo\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nNew 'CBS Evening News' Anchor Tony Dokoupil To Interview Donald Trump\n\n“You wouldn’t have a job right now, if she got in. You probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump told Dokoupil during the interview, conducted on the floor of a Ford plant in Detroit.\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nThen the president appeared to refer to David Ellison, who became CEO of Paramount last year after his Skydance bought the CBS parent company. Ellison’s father, Larry, is a longtime supporter of the president’s.\n\n“Your boss is an amazing guy,” Trump said. “Might be bust. Okay. Might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn’t have this job. You wouldn’t have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they are paying you.”\n\nDokoupil later said that “I do think I’d have this job even if the other guy won.”\n\n“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump responded.\n\nThe Evening News ran the entirety of the interview, Dokoupil said, and it lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the conversation Trump talked about taking “very strong action” against Iran if the regime hangs protesters amid the unrest that has spread throughout the country. The president, though, was not specific about what that meant. At other points, Dokoupil let some of Trump’s claims go unchallenged, including that he “ended eight wars.” That has been challenged as hyperbole from the AP and other fact-checking sites.\n\nTrump also claimed that “there’s no inflation,” and later said that he had them “down to a level that they haven’t seen in about nine years.” In fact, consumer prices rose about 2.7% in December, according to the Department of Labor, and inflation was below 2% during points of Trump’s first term. The CBS Evening News anchor noted that “when I travel the country and I go all over the place and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don’t feel it.”\n\n“I’ve only been here for 11 months, okay,” Trump responded, before saying that he “inherited a mess” and that “we have now the hottest country in the world.”\n\nThe most revelatory part of the interview may have been when Dokoupil questioned Trump about the shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.\n\nDokoupil noted that he spoke to Good’s father, who is “a big supporter of yours.”\n\n“He’s heartbroken because his daughter is dead. He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist. What do you want to say to her father right now?”\n\nTrump answered, “Well, I want to say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side, as you say. He might be on my side.”\n\nDokoupil said, “He’s on your side.”\n\nTrump replied, “And I think that’s great … and I would bet you that she under normal circumstances was a very solid, wonderful person, but pretty tough.” He then went on to defend ICE and blast Joe Biden, before going back to the video of Good’s killing, and acknowledging that the videos are open to interpretation. Soon after the killing, the Department of Homeland Security quickly said that Good was trying to strike the ICE officer with her vehicle.\n\n“When you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways, I guess,” Trump said. “But when you look at the way that was, that car was pulled away. There are a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "title": "Trump’s Slash-and-Burn Economy Is Devastating Black Women",
    "description": "Kali...",
    "fullText": "His administration is hitting them with “discriminate harm.”\n\nElections have consequences—and they are, unfailingly, most profoundly visited upon Black women. Donald Trump’s reelection has had the consequence of Black women being pushed out of their workplaces at astonishing rates. Between February and July of last year, Black women lost 319,000 jobs in both the private and public sectors, driven largely by mass layoffs in education, healthcare, and housing. During that same period, white women gained 142,000 jobs, Hispanic women 176,000 jobs, and white men—wait for it!—picked up 365,000 jobs. In February, Black women’s unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent, but that figure had soared to 6.7 percent by August. In September, the most recent snapshot available because of the shutdown, yet another 0.8 percent of Black women lost their jobs—while just 0.2 percent of white women suffered the same fate that month. All in all, according to the gender economist Katica Roy, roughly 600,000 Black women have been “economically sidelined” since February—which was, not coincidentally, this president’s first full month in office.\n\nThis has failed to set off alarm bells in a country that has never cared much about the well-being of Black women. Perhaps that’s why concerned policymakers and economists so often take such pains to emphasize that Black women’s economic distress is a bellwether for everyone else—to underline that their fates, and even their humanity, are connected to the nation’s in the hopes that the country might finally care. And it’s not just that racism and sexism make Black women the first to be let go when the economy stalls—it’s also that Black women power the economy in ways this country often refuses to acknowledge. Nearly 70 percent of Black mothers are the breadwinners in their homes, though they’re paid just 34, 44, or 52 cents of every dollar paid to Asian, white, or Black breadwinner dads, respectively. So when they lose jobs en masse, families are left financially vulnerable and local economies are weakened. Nationally, the cost has already surpassed $37 billion in lost GDP.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous to suggest that Black women are merely hit the hardest during economic slumps when, in fact, they’ve been targeted for harm by a right wing that is openly committed to undoing their progress. This country has—again—chosen to meet gender and racial advancement with aggressive rollbacks, including dismantling institutions that have provided Black women with financial security and career advancement. It’s not a coincidence that the first move of the Trump administration, in partnership with Elon Musk’s DOGE, was to vilify and hollow out the civil service—long an engine of Black middle-class stability—where Black women make up 12 percent of staffers, double their portion of the overall workforce. A National Women’s Law Center study found that women and people of color made up the majority of the workforce in the agencies that sustained the deepest cuts. The Department of Education, with a workforce of 28 percent Black women, lost 46 percent of its staff. The Department of Justice and the Department of Energy, both of which are about 70 percent white? Cut by just 1 percent and 13 percent, respectively, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nThe Trump administration has also made a show of pushing out high-profile Black women leaders, including Carla Hayden at the Library of Congress, Gwynne Wilcox at the National Labor Relations Board, and the ongoing effort to oust Lisa Cook at the Federal Reserve. Peggy Carr has described her abrupt dismissal after 35 years of climbing the ranks at the Department of Education as a “tragedy” both personal and professional. “It was like I was being taken out like the trash,” Carr told The New York Times of being escorted out of the building by a security guard, “the only difference is I was being taken out the front door rather than the back door.”\n\nThose public-sector layoffs have been accompanied by attacks on private-sector diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or DEI. NPR reports that roles in DEI plummeted from 20,000 in 2023 to 17,500 in April 2025. Companies too numerous to name have hastily retreated from DEI efforts they had boasted about earlier, and not because they are mandated to, since Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders cannot overturn civil-rights laws or dictate the hiring practices of private businesses. A New York Times investigation found that the number of S&P 500 companies that include DEI language in their financial filings is down 60 percent since 2024. And for the first time since 2017, the majority of new directors hired at S&P 500 companies this year were white men.\n\nBlack women have long worked at rates higher than other American women, including as recently as 2024. But even in the best of times, intertwined sexism and anti-Black racism, or misogynoir, consign them to the most precarious jobs in the least recession-proof sectors. Across industries, they are paid less than white men with the same—and even, in some comparisons, lower—levels of education; are least likely of all women to be promoted; and leave college burdened with the most student-loan debt. Now Trump has launched what Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) rightly calls a campaign of “discriminate harm” against them. History vividly illustrates what the consequences will be. After economic downturns in the early 1980s, the Great Recession of the aughts, and the Covid pandemic, Black women were the last to recover financially. But this time, the Trump administration has scrubbed race-based employment data from government websites—preemptively erasing evidence of the harms it’s inflicting.\n\nWhen Black women voted against this regime, they were fighting for their lives at the ballot box, knowing they’d be the first to bear the brunt of its damages—and fully aware they wouldn’t be the last. It was, of course, not enough to stop a country unwilling to heed their warnings. So once again we’re trapped, forced to inhale the noxious fumes no one else notices are poisoning us all.",

    "fullText": "How well do you remember your high school econ class?\n\nIt's an important topic for high school students across the country who are learning about the economy in which they will work, invest, and start businesses.\n\nAdditionally, since 2022, 12 states have implemented requirements for high schools to teach financial literacy, with some also incorporating the fundamentals of free-market capitalism.\n\nNearly a dozen high school teachers told Business Insider that they've noticed their students are increasingly engaged in lessons on capitalism — and are skeptical toward the model. That's largely because they're more aware of economic conditions, such as the persistent wealth gap. In recent years, Americans of all ages' positive views about capitalism have declined, according to a range of surveys. The shift is particularly pronounced among younger generations and Democrats.\n\nRegardless of their views on it, said David Ring, a 12th-grade economics teacher in Texas, capitalism is the dominant economic system in the US, and to teach it effectively, it's helpful to start with the basics.\n\n\"There's no purely free-market driven large-scale economy out there, just as there's no purely communist driven large-scale economy out there,\" Ring said.\n\nHere's a lightly edited version of a quiz Ring gives his students on capitalism.

    "fullText": "Dr. Mehmet Oz made the case that improving Americans’ health through better diets could transform both the nation's economy and healthcare spending.\n\nOz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, connected the dots between improved public health and workforce participation during a White House press conference this week. If Americans could stay healthy enough to work just one additional year beyond the current average retirement age of 61, it would “increase the overall GDP of our nation by trillions of dollars,” he said.\n\n“We will reduce healthcare expenses,” Oz said. “At the same time, we jazz up the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars created by the productivity of American workers.”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nOz praised the Trump administration's updated dietary guidelines, which encourage Americans to prioritize whole foods, proteins and healthy fats while reducing ultraprocessed food and added sugar.\n\n“The best way to reduce drug spend in America is to not need the drugs in the first place,” he said. He said that new guidelines could cut demand for expensive medications like GLP-1 drugs and autoimmune treatments by helping prevent chronic diseases from developing. “You can’t be a wealthy nation without being a healthy nation,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services showing that roughly 30% of Medicare spending, about $300 billion a year, is directly tied to obesity. “If we were to affect obesity by 10%, which is an incredibly conservative and justifiable assumption… just that alone is $30 billion of reduction of expenses for Medicare,” he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform Before the Raise Ends 1/19\n\nOz highlighted the importance of reaching children early, saying that 53% of U.S. children are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Programs teaching families how to implement the new dietary guidelines, he said, “will dramatically change the natural history of how children are able to participate in life.”\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the press conference that reducing healthcare costs requires upfront investments in education and access to healthy food. “The idea that a cheap meal made of processed food is cheap is an illusion, because you’re paying for it on the back end,” he said. “You’re paying for it with diabetes, with obesity, with illness.”",

    "description": "Quartermast Advisors estimated a 17.4% YoY increase in creator economy M&A activity last year. Here's what it's watching for in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Is the creator economy in the midst of a comeback era?\n\nAnother year of increased M&A deal volume is a signal that the sector is in good health, according to James Creech, who advises creator economy companies via his M&A advisory firm, Quartermast Advisors.\n\nWhile the industry — like many categories across tech and media — saw an unprecedented boom in attention and cash flow in 2021, Creech said the space battled through a \"winter\" through 2022 and 2023.\n\n\"We started to see these signs of recovery in 2024, and then all of a sudden last year was like: 'We're back, baby,'\" Creech told Business Insider. \"More investment, more M&A activity, larger deals, very high-profile transactions, public companies.\"\n\nQuartermast estimated that 2025 saw a 17.4% year-over-year increase in M&A activity with a total of 81 deals.\n\nHere are a few of the biggest ticket deals from 2025, according to Quartermast:\n\nThe first week of January 2026 already brought new deal announcements, such as ad agency PMG acquiring influencer-marketing agency Digital Voices, and media company Global acquiring sports YouTube channel The Overlap.\n\nMeanwhile, creator economy startups — particularly social commerce and AI companies — closed out 2025 raising billions in venture capital, with at least 13 startups raising more than $50 million.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of which companies are driving M&A in the creator economy, Quartermast analyzed the companies that have historically been the most active buyers.\n\nThe biggest takeaway is a caveat: While many of these companies were historically very active, some have scaled back their M&A strategies or even faded away (in the case of Fullscreen).\n\nHere are seven companies that have been active buyers in the creator economy over time, according to Quartermast's analysis:\n\nLooking ahead at 2026, Creech said agencies and holding companies, such as Publicis and Omnicom (which recently completed its $9 billion merger with IPG), will continue to seek out strategic acquisitions and are the most likely buyers.\n\nCreech includes Humanz, an Israeli influencer marketing company, in this category. Humanz announced in late 2025 that it raised $15 million in venture funding to fuel an M&A spree.\n\nTalent agencies and management firms will also see more consolidation, Creech said. Creech predicts that the talent sector, followed by marketing technology platforms, will be the most active categories for M&A in 2026 after agencies and holding companies.\n\nPrivate equity is expected to continue having a stake in the space, too, as firms \"become increasingly comfortable with the creator economy as an asset class,\" Creech said. For instance, PE firm Silver Lake has played a major role in TikTok's ownership shake-up.\n\nCompanies building tools for creators' businesses, such as Patreon and Kajabi, could also be at the center of some deals, he added.\n\nFinally, Creech expects non-creator-economy companies, such as traditional media companies or even food companies like Wonder, to continue making bets in the space.\n\n\"That's a sign that the creator economy is entering a new age of maturity and growth,\" Creech said.",

    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said late Sunday that the central bank had received grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice. He described the move as a part of a broader effort to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nProminent economists and business leaders are reacting as the news hit markets at the start of the trading week. They weighed in on how the DOJ move affects the Fed's independence, a question also raised by Sen. Thom Tillis. On Sunday, the Republican said he would oppose nominees for the Fed.\n\n\"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\n\nHere's what leaders in economics and business are saying:\n\nProminent economist Mohamed El-Erian called for Powell's resignation months ago to protect the Fed's independence amid the feud with Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, El-Erian wrote on X that the inquiry into Powell is damaging for the US central bank.\n\n\"For those of us who value the operational autonomy of central banks, the risk is that this situation could expose deeper issues — further undermining the credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile,\" wrote El-Erian, who is a former co-chief investment officer at Pimco.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman raised concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"Question to all those who said Trump would be better for the economy: is attacking the Fed's independence what you had in mind?\" wrote the prominent Democratic donor on X.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, attributed the gold price surge to fresh record highs on Sunday evening to the investigation into Powell.\n\n\"I am not a fan of Powell, but I agree with him on Trump's motivation,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\nIn April, Schiff said Trump's next Fed Chair pick would be a \"loyal soldier.\"\n\nMichael A. Gayed, a renowned investment manager, said direct action against a sitting Fed Chair is \"without modern precedent,\" in an edition of his Lead-Lag substack report published on Sunday evening.\n\nThe inquiry into Powell raises questions about whether the long-standing boundaries between fiscal power, prosecutorial authority, and monetary independence are beginning to blur, Gayed said. The concern was less about any single case and more about the future precedent it may establish.\n\n\"Should investors conclude that future Fed officials could face legal consequences for policy decisions that conflict with political priorities, the incentive structure governing monetary policy could change,\" said Gayed.\n\nThat shift could increase inflation risk premiums and weaken confidence in long-duration financial assets tied to stable policy expectations, he added.",

    "fullText": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina has repaid the funds it drew from a $20 billion credit line with the Trump administration, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Friday, in a crucial step for Argentine President Javier Milei to restore confidence in his chronically distressed economy.\n\nIn addition to making payments to bondholders, Milei’s radical libertarian administration had “quickly and fully repaid its limited draw,” Bessent said, without specifying the amount.\n\nThe Treasury’s latest report on the status of the credit line said that Argentina’s central bank had traded pesos for $2.5 billion through the swap as of the end of October.\n\nThe Argentine Central Bank confirmed Bessent's announcement.\n\nThe contentious and largely unprecedented U.S. rescue provided dollar liquidity to the Trump administration's cash-strapped ideological ally and halted a market rout in Argentina ahead of crucial midterm elections last October.\n\nMilei’s libertarian party won a major victory in the vote, cementing support for his harsh austerity program and quelling investor concerns about the crisis-stricken country's ability to repay debts. In another sign of the revived optimism around Milei's reforms, his government issued a dollar bond for the first time in eight years last month, presaging a return to international bond markets.\n\nThanks to Argentina’s deposit, Bessent said, the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund tapped for the bailout holds no more Argentine pesos.\n\nHe praised the payment as a landmark that justified the Treasury’s bailout of Argentina, which raised doubts about the consistency of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy and drew backlash in the U.S. for putting taxpayer funds at risk. Experts have also criticized the opaque and apparently unconditional nature of the loan.\n\n“Stabilizing a strong American ally – and making tens of millions in profit for Americans – is an America First homerun deal,” Bessent wrote. “Setting the course for Latin America, a strong and stable Argentina that helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in our clear best interest.”\n\nLuis Caputo, Argentina’s economy minister thanked the Trump administration “for the trust in our economic policy.”\n\n“It is an excellent reality for our country to have been able to build this geopolitical alliance and to know that we have the explicit support of the most important country in the world,” he said.\n\nBut Argentina is not out of the woods.\n\nIts foreign exchange reserves still run perilously low. The country is set to come under further strain in the coming months from repayments on previous International Monetary Fund loans and other private debt.",

    "description": "Guggenheim Brothers Media and Abu Dhabi's EIH formed a fund for media, entertainment, and creator economy investments.",
    "fullText": "A new $50 million fund is targeting media, entertainment, and creator economy startups, tapping into Hollywood networks and the UAE's growing appetite for cultural investment.\n\nUS investment firm Guggenheim Brothers Media is launching the fund with backing from Abu Dhabi-based Ethmar International Holding.\n\nThe firm is led by Dillon Lawson-Johnston and Criswell Fiordalis, who are looking to write checks of $2 million to $5 million, targeting 10 to 15 companies. They plan to seek other investors as well and hope to grow the fund to as much as $75 million.\n\nThe pair brings extensive entertainment and cultural ties. Lawson-Johnston is the great-great-grandson of Solomon R. Guggenheim, founder of New York City's famed Guggenheim Museum, and has experience from UTA, Sugar23, Untitled Entertainment, and Anonymous Content. Fiordalis has had roles at Lionsgate, MRC, Hello Sunshine, and Webtoon. The two had previously invested in Stapleview, a comedy platform, and The Lighthouse, Whalar Group's campus for creators.\n\nEIH is an investment holding company that's led by a prominent member of a UAE ruling family. The UAE, like other Gulf nations, has been pouring money into US media and entertainment as it tries to diversify away from oil. One UAE government project, Creators HQ, aims to get 10,000 creators to relocate to the country. Lawson-Johnston's family is set to open the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi in 2026.\n\n\"We're investing in creativity and culture, and we're looking to leverage this amazing museum that's being built,\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nHe and Fiordalis want to deploy the fund mainly in the US, where the creator economy is more mature. The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimated that advertisers would spend $37 billion with creators in 2025, a sum that it says is growing four times faster than overall media spending.\n\nHere are four trends the new fund is betting on:\n\nInvestors tend to shy away from backing individual creators because of the risk of overdependence on a single person, also called \"key man risk.\" That's why some big names like Steven Bartlett and Alex Cooper are building networks of complementary creators (and attracting millions of dollars in the process).\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in creators who are looking beyond themselves when building talent-related businesses.\n\nThey'll also look at companies that develop creators through talent management or other services. One example is their earlier investment in Stapleview, which manages social media-born comedians and produces with them.\n\nTraditional media companies have a lot of intellectual property that they want to give new life to in digital media. It's why Disney did a deal that'll open its vault of famous characters to OpenAI.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston, both of whom have spent time at legacy media companies, envision a mutually beneficial way for creators and Hollywood to collaborate in this area and aim to facilitate this process.\n\n\"If you're SpongeBob SquarePants, what do you do other than taking SpongeBob and slapping it on YouTube and saying, 'Oh, we now have a digital presence?'\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nBrands are clamoring to get their message out using creators, leveraging influencers' built-in distribution and popularity among younger consumers. The IAB found in November that brands were most eager to work with mid-tier creators — those with between 50,000 and 500,000 followers — because of their ability to drive sales and awareness.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston see an opportunity to back platforms that connect such influencers with brands using a mix of people and technology. They pointed to the platform Kyra, which raised $15 million in 2022, as one they admire.\n\n\"There's a lot of, not top creators, but downstream creators that have way more engagement and can drive a lot more value to said brand,\" Fiordalis said.\n\nAs more brands shift their budgets to creators, they face increasing pressure to prove that their spending has paid off. Brands have gone from just caring about a creator's follower count to looking at other ways to prove efficacy.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in companies trying to standardize how creators are measured.\n\n\"Who's standardizing the definition of value across these platforms and across pieces of content?\" Fiordalis said. \"I think the industry is getting to a point where it needs that.\"",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Wednesday that he will visit China next week to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping as Canada looks to reduce its reliance on the United States, which has threatened its economy and sovereignty.\n\nIt is the first visit to China by a Canadian prime minister in more than eight years. Xi invited Carney to China when they met during an Asia-Pacific summit in October. The visit comes as the two countries move to restore stronger ties after years of tensions.\n\n“We’re forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner, to one that is stronger and more resilient to global shock,” Carney said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nCarney will travel to China from Jan. 13 to 17. He will also attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from Jan. 19 to 21.\n\nTrump has been threatening Canada’s economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be “the 51st state.”\n\nThe attempt at rapprochement with China comes as Carney looks to double Canada’s non-U.S. exports in the next decade and as the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico is up for review this year. More than 75% percent of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.\n\nChina is Canada's second largest trading partner.\n\nRelations between China and Canada took a nosedive in late 2018 after Canadian authorities arrested a senior executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei as a part of its extradition agreement with the United States. China then arrested two Canadian citizens in retaliation.\n\nMore recently, relations have been shaken by Canada’s decision to levy a 100% tariff on electric vehicles, batteries and other goods from China in 2024. Canada made the move in tandem with the U.S.\n\nCanadian canola producers, seafood exporters and pork farmers are dealing with steep Chinese tariffs in retaliation.\n\nChina has offered to remove its import taxes on some Canadian products if Canada drops the EV tariff.",

    "fullText": "The narrative from the AI labs is dazzling: build AGI, unlock astonishing productivity, and watch GDP surge. It’s a compelling story, especially if you’re the one building or investing in the new thought machines. But it skips the part that makes an economy an economy: circulation.\n\nAn economy is not simply production. It is production matched to demand, and demand requires broadly distributed purchasing power. When we forget that, we rediscover an old truth the hard way: You can’t build a prosperous society that leaves most people on the sidelines.\n\nIn The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, the visionary poet and painter William Blake (writing during the first Industrial Revolution) put the circulatory logic perfectly: “The Prolific would cease to be prolific unless the Devourer as a sea received the excess of his delights.” In other words: Output has to be consumed. The system has to flow.\n\nToday, many AGI narratives assume that the “prolific” can keep producing and the broad mass of customers (“the devourer”) somehow continue to buy, even as more and more human labor is displaced and labor income and bargaining power collapses. That’s not a future of abundance. It’s a recipe for a kind of congestive heart failure for the economy: Profits and capabilities accumulate in what should be the circulatory pump, while the rest of the body is starved.\n\nSo if we want an AI economy that makes society richer, we need to ask not just “How smart will the models get?” and “How rich will AI developers, their investors, and their immediate customers get?” but “How will the value circulate in the real economy of goods and services?” Not “What can we automate?” but “What new infrastructure and institutions are needed to turn capability into widely shared prosperity?”\n\nTwo versions of the future are often discussed as if they are separate. They’re not.\n\nI’m excited by the discovery potential of AI. It may help us solve problems that have defied us for decades: energy abundance, new materials, cures for diseases. As Nick Hanauer and Eric Beinhocker put it so well, “Prosperity is the accumulation of solutions to human problems.” That AI can grow the store of solutions to human problems is a wonderful dream, and it should be our goal to make it come true.\n\nBut discovery alone is not the same thing as economic value, and it certainly isn’t the same thing as widely shared prosperity. Between discovery and economic value lies a long, failure-prone pipeline: productization, validation, regulation, manufacturing, distribution, training, and maintenance. The valley of death is not a metaphor; it is a bureaucratic, technical, and financial landscape where many promising advances go to die. And from that valley of death, the path follows either an ascent to the broad uplands of shared prosperity, or a shortcut to a dead-end peak of wealth concentration.\n\nIf AI accelerates discovery but doesn’t accelerate diffusion, we get headlines and paper wealth, but broad-based growth takes much longer to arrive. We get a taller peak, not a wider plateau.\n\nThe distribution question begins with choke points. Who owns the discovery engines? Who controls access to compute, data, and the models themselves? Who captures the IP? Who has the channels to bring new capabilities to market? To what extent do incumbents and the moats they have built restrict innovation? Do government regulatory processes also speed up, or do they keep AI adoption at a glacial pace? Do those at the choke points use their market shaping power wisely? If those choke points are tight, the discovery economy becomes a kind of discovery feudalism: The breakthroughs happen, but the spillovers are limited, adoption is slow, and the returns concentrate.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the tools and standards of diffusion are broadly available, if interoperability is real, if licensing is designed for many routes to market, if regulatory processes can also be sped up with AI, then the discovery economy can become what we want it to be: a generalized engine of progress. There’s a huge amount of work to be done here.\n\nMany of the questions are economic. If discovery becomes cheap, does the rest of the pipeline get cheaper, or does it get more expensive to compensate for other lost revenue? The happy dream is that a cancer vaccine becomes available at the marginal cost of production. The unhappy reality may be that the drug manufacturers conclude “We have to price this high to make up for our losses from the existing drugs that people no longer need to buy.” Even in an age of cheap discovery, it is possible that some vaccines will still cost millions of dollars per dose and only be available to people who can afford them.\n\nThe other story is labor replacement. We are told that AI will substitute for a great deal of intellectual work, much as machines replaced animal labor and much of human manual labor. Businesses become more efficient. Margins rise. Output increases. Prices fall and spending power increases for those who are still employed.\n\nBut who are the customers when a large number of humans are suddenly no longer gainfully employed?\n\nThis is not a rhetorical question. It is the central macroeconomic constraint that much of Silicon Valley prefers not to model. You can’t replace wages with cheap inference and expect the consumer economy to hum along unchanged. If the wage share falls fast enough, the economy may become less stable. Social conflict rises. Politics turns punitive. Investment in long-term complements collapses. And the whole system starts behaving like a fragile rent-extraction machine rather than a durable engine of prosperity.\n\nIn a 2012 Harvard Business Review article, Michael Schrage asked a powerful strategic question: “Who do you want your customers to become?” As he put it, the answer to that question is the true foundation of great companies. “Successful companies have a ‘vision of the customer future’ that matters every bit as much as their vision of their products.”\n\nIn the early days of mass production, Henry Ford reportedly understood that if you want mass markets, you need mass purchasing power. He paid higher wages and reduced working hours, helping to invent what we now call the weekend, and with it, the leisure economy. The productivity dividend was distributed in ways that created new customers.\n\nFord’s innovation had consequences beyond the factory gate. Mass adoption of cars required a vast extension of infrastructure: roads, traffic rules, hotels, parking, gas stations, repair shops, and the entire social reorganization of distance. The technology mattered, but the complements made it an economy.\n\nSteven Johnson tells a related story in his book Wonderland. The preindustrial European desire for Indian calico and chintz helped catalyze modern shopping environments and global trade networks. But there’s even more to that story. When it became cheaper to make cloth, fashion, taste, and the democratization of status display became a larger part of the economy. The point is not “consumerism is good.” The point is that economies grow because desires and capabilities change as the result of innovations, infrastructure, and institutions that allow the benefits to spread. New forms of production require new systems of distribution, experience, and exchange.\n\nAI is at that inflection point now. We may be building the engines of extraordinary productivity, but we are not yet building the social machinery that will make that productivity broadly usable and broadly beneficial. We are just hoping that they somehow evolve.\n\nThis failure of insight and imagination is the Achilles’ heel of today’s AI giants. They imagine themselves as contestants in a race to be the next dominant platform, with the majority of the benefits going to whoever has the smartest model, the most users, and the most developers. This is not unlike the vision of Marc Andreessen’s Netscape in the early days of the web. Netscape sought to replace Microsoft Windows as the platform for users and developers, using the internet moment to become the next monopoly gatekeeper. Instead, victory went to those who embraced the web’s architecture of participation.\n\nNow, it is true that 30 years later, we are in a world where companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have indeed become gatekeepers, extracting huge economic rents via their control over human attention. But it didn’t start that way. Amazon and Google in particular rose to prominence because they solved the circulation problem. Amazon’s flywheel, in which more users draw in more suppliers with more and cheaper products, which in turn brings in more users, in a virtuous circle, is a great example of an economic circulation strategy. Not only did Amazon drive enormous consumer value, they created a whole new set of suppliers.\n\nSo too, Google’s original search engine strategy was also deeply rooted in the circulation of value. As Larry Page put it in 2004, “The portal strategy tries to own all of the information….We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible.” The company’s algorithms for both search and ad relevance were a real advance in market coordination and shared value creation. Economists like Hal Varian were brought in to design advertising models that were better not only for Google but for its customers. Google grew along with the web economy it helped to create, not at its expense. Yes, that changed over time, but let’s not forget how important Google’s support for a circulatory economy was to its initial success.\n\nGoogle also provides a really good example of mechanism design to solve problems with rights holders that have economic lessons for today. When music companies sent takedown notices to YouTube for user-generated content that made unauthorized use of their IP, YouTube instead asked, “How about we help you monetize it instead?” In the process it created a new market.\n\nThe extent to which Amazon and Google seem to have forgotten these lessons is a sign of their decline, not something to be emulated. It provides an opportunity for those (including Google and Amazon, if they recommit to their roots!) who are building the next generation of technology platforms. Build a flywheel, enable a circulatory economy. AI should not be enshittified from the beginning, prioritizing value capture over broadly based value creation.\n\nAn important lesson from the internet technology revolution of the 1990s and early 2000s is that decentralized architectures are more innovative and more competitive than those that are centralized. Decentralization creates value; centralization captures it. The PC decentralized the computer industry, ending IBM’s chokehold on competition during the mainframe era. The new software industry exploded. Over the next few decades, as it became dominant, Microsoft recentralized the industry by monopolizing operating systems and office applications in the way that IBM had monopolized computer hardware. The personal computer software industry began to stagnate, until open source software and the open protocols of the internet undermined Microsoft’s centralized control over the industry and ushered in a new era of innovation.\n\nThe tragedy began again, as those who had once flourished as internet innovators in turn began to prioritize control, raising moats and extracting rents rather than continuing to innovate, leading to today’s internet oligopoly. This, of course, is what allowed the current AI revolution to happen as it did. Google invented the transformer architecture, and then published it freely, but did not itself fully explore the possibilities because it was protecting an existing business model. So it was left to OpenAI to invent the future.\n\nHowever, the AI revolution has a significant difference from the early internet. The U.S.’s current set up of large, closed models, enormous data centers for model training, and a highly concentrated cloud market has echoes of central planning, in which a small cadre of deep pocketed investors choose the winners at the outset rather than discovering them through a period of intense market competition and finding product-market fit (which involves finding products and services that users not only want but are willing to pay for at less than the cost of production!).\n\nMarket competition is important to ensuring that the economy is not reliant on a handful of firms reinvesting their profits into production. When this becomes the case, circulation can get cut off. Profits stop being reinvested and instead become hoarded, trapped within the sphere of financial circulation, from dividends to share buybacks to more dividends and less and less to investment in fixed or human capital.\n\nIf we are to realize the full potential of AI to reinvigorate and reinvent the economy, we need to embrace decentralized architectures. This might involve the triumph of lower-cost open weight models that commoditize and decentralize inference, and it also certainly entails protocols and technical infrastructure that can reduce the inherent concentrating tendencies of economies of scale and other technological moats that make concentration a more efficient mode of production.\n\nCentralization is an advantage in a mature economy; it is a disadvantage when you are trying to invent the future. Premature centralization is a mistake.\n\nIf AI labs wish to be architects of a prosperous future, they must work as hard on inventing the new economy’s circulatory system as they do on improving model capabilities. They need to measure success by diffusion, not just capability. They have to treat the labor transition as a core problem to be solved, not just studied. They have to be willing to win in the marketplace, not through artificial moats. That means committing to open interfaces, portability, and interoperability. General-purpose capabilities should not become a private toll road.\n\nCompanies adopting AI face their own challenges. Simply using AI to slash costs and turbocharge profits is a kind of failure. The productivity dividend should show up for employees not as a pink slip but as some combination of higher pay, reduced hours, profit-sharing, and investment in retraining. They must use the opportunity to reinvent themselves by creating new kinds of value that people will be eager to pay for, not just trying to preserve what they have.\n\nGovernments and society as a whole need to invest in the complements that will shape the new AI economy. Diffusion will be limited by the fragility of our energy grid, by bottlenecks in the supply of rare earths, but also by sclerotic approval processes for new construction or the approval of new innovations.\n\nGovernments must also develop scenarios for a future in which taxes on labor might provide a much smaller part of their income. Solutions are not obvious, and transitions will be hard, but if we face a future where capital appreciation is abundant and labor income is scarce, perhaps it’s time to consider reducing taxes on labor and increasing those on capital gains.\n\nOver the next few months, we intend to convene a series of conversations and to publish a series of more detailed action plans in each of these areas. Let me know if you think you have ideas to contribute.\n\nWe can build an AI economy that concentrates value, hollows out demand, and forces society into a reactive cycle of backlash and repair. Or we can build an AI economy that circulates, where discoveries diffuse, where productivity dividends translate into purchasing power and time, and where the complements are built fast enough that society becomes broadly more capable.\n\nAI labs like to say they are building intelligence. They are making good progress. But if they want to build prosperity, they also need to discover the flywheel for the AI economy.\n\nThe prolific needs the devourer. Not as a villain, not as an obstacle, but as the sea that receives the excess, and returns it, transformed, as the next wave of demand, innovation, and shared flourishing.",

    "title": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio says gold's rapid rally is a warning for markets and the economy",
    "description": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgwater Associates, says the blistering rally in gold last year is a reflection of precarious macro developments.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio spent 2025 expressing fear and urging caution, and he's remaining cautious as the US economy enters a new year.\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates sounded alarms throughout 2025 over what he sees as a budding global debt crisis and the waning value of fiat currency.\n\nThe surge in gold last year—the biggest gain for the metal since 1979—contains a warning for investors, specifically as it relates to the depreciating value of fiat money, Dalio said in a post on Monday.\n\nA potent cocktail of central bank buying, geopolitical worries, and appetite from individuals pushed gold to records all year, but Dalio argues that the gold rally is mainly a result of fiat money losing real value. In his view, that was the biggest story in markets in 2025.\n\n\"The best major investment of the year was long gold (returning 65% in dollar terms), which outperformed the S&P index (which returned 18% in dollars) by 47%,\" he said. \"Or, said differently, the S&P fell by 28% in gold-money terms.\"\n\nDalio urged investors to consider a few key factors when evaluating the forces that drove markets in 2025. Specifically, he highlighted that examining investment through calculations made in a depreciating currency can be misleading, as it can make returns appear stronger than they actually were.\n\nFrom Dalio's perspective, the stock market's 2025 performance varied greatly based on the measuring stick.\n\n\"When one's own currency goes down, it makes it look like the things measured in it went up,\" he said. \"In this case, the S&P returned 18% for a dollar-based investor, 17% for a yen-based investor, 13% for a renminbi-based investor, only 4% for a euro-based investor, only 3% for a Swiss franc-based investor, and, for a gold-based investor, it returned -28%.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has touted the economic benefits of a weakening US dollar, attempting to frame it as beneficial for US exports. But economic think tanks such as the Cato Institute have argued against this perspective, claiming that it ignores negative spillover effects for US consumers.\n\nDalio seems to share that mindset, noting that a weaker currency tends to lower the cost of a nation's exported goods for international buyers while increasing the price of domestic imports.\n\n\"When one's currency goes down, it reduces one's wealth and one's buying power, it makes one's goods and services cheaper in others' currencies, and it makes others' goods and services more expensive in one's own currency.\"\n\nIn his view, rising gold prices reflect a weakening economy and a national currency that is decreasing in value. For that reason, Dalio sees the continued strength of the so-called debasement trade as a warning for the US.\n\nThe stock market's big bull run in recent years might also be making it easier for investors to disregard other warning signals flashing in the economy. Dalio emphasized that the gold rally is a reason to reassess the macro picture and take a more cautious position.\n\nThe billionaire investor added that stocks and gold benefited from monetary policy easing in 2025, but as both assets are no longer cheap, they're at risk of a pullback if conditions shift again.\n\n\"Whether or not you are currency hedged matters a lot,\" Dalio said. \"You should always be hedged to your least-risk currency mix and make tactical moves from there if you think you are capable of making them well.\"",

    "description": "The push for tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a \"significant increase\" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.\n\nThe Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.\n\nA share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\n\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\n\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\n\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\n\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\n\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\n\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\n\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — As uncertainty simmers in Venezuela, interim President Delcy Rodríguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicolás Maduro, captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation, and offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration in what could be a seismic shift in relations between the adversary governments.\n\nRodríguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela’s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, and the leader was backed by Venezuela’s military.\n\nRodríguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and politician has had a lengthy career representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. It's been unclear if the leader would warm up to the Trump administration or follow the same adversarial line as her predecessor.\n\nHer rise to become interim leader of the South American country came as a surprise on Saturday morning, when Trump announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in communication with Rodríguez and that the Venezuelan leader was “gracious” and would work with the American government. Rubio said Rodríguez was someone the administration could work with, unlike Maduro.\n\nBut in a televised address, Rodríguez gave no indication that she would cooperate with Trump, referring to his government as “extremists\" and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela's rightful leader.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” Rodríguez said, surrounded by high-ranking civilian officials and military leaders.\n\nTrump warned on Sunday, if Rodríguez didn't fall in line, “she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” He added that he wanted her to provide “total access,” from oil facilities to basic infrastructure like roads, so they can be rebuilt.\n\nTrump’s comments also followed Rubio having asserted in TV interviews on Sunday that he didn’t see Rodríguez and her government as “legitimate” because he said the country never held free and fair elections.\n\nOn Sunday, in statements posted to her Instagram, she took a major shift in tone in a conciliatory message where she said she hoped to build “respectful relations” with Trump.\n\n“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” she wrote.\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, the interim president and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping of American business owner William Niehous in 1976, and later died in police custody.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S., though the interim president did face U.S. sanctions during Trump's first term for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nRodríguez held a number of lower-level positions under Chávez's government, but gained prominence working under Maduro to the point of being seen as his successor. She served the economic minister, foreign affairs minister, petroleum minister and others help stabilize Venezuela's endemically crisis-stricken economy after years of rampant inflation and turmoil.\n\nRodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. The interim president also presided over an assembly promoted by Maduro in response to street protests in 2017 meant to neutralize the opposition-majority legislature.\n\nShe enjoys a close relationship with the military, which has long acted as the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, said Ronal Rodríguez, a spokesperson for the Venezuela Observatory of Rosario University in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n“She has a very particular relationship with power,” he said. “She has developed very strong ties with elements of the armed forces and has managed to establish lines of dialogue with them, largely on a transactional basis.”\n\nIt's unclear how long Rodríguez will hold power, or how closely she will work with the Trump administration.\n\nGeoff Ramsey, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute, said Rodríguez's initially firm tone with the Trump administration may have been an attempt to “save face.” Others have noted that Maduro's capture required some level of collaboration within the Venezuelan government.\n\n“She can’t exactly expect to score points with her revolutionary peers if she presents herself as a patsy for U.S. interests,\" Ramsey said.\n\nVenezuela’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. Reasons listed include death, resignation, removal from office or “abandonment” of duties as declared by the National Assembly.\n\nThat electoral timeline was rigorously followed when Maduro’s predecessor, Chavez, died of cancer in 2013. However, the loyalist Supreme Court, in its decision Saturday, cited another provision of the charter in declaring Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, there is no election requirement. Instead, the vice president, an unelected position, takes over for up to 90 days — a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nIn handing temporary power to Rodríguez, the Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day time limit, leading some to speculate she could try to remain in power even longer as she seeks to unite the disparate factions of the ruling socialist party while shielding it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.\n\n—— Janetsky reported from Mexico City and Debre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    "fullText": "Rosen, who led Sega from the 1960s into the 90s and who died on Christmas Day, was a hugely important figure in the history of arcade and home gaming\n\nIt is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "description": "Trump is having the government buy stakes directly in companies — and it's going to change the way we all do business and reshape the economy.",
    "fullText": "This is the first story in Business Insider's new series \"The Future of Capitalism.\" The series looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding, and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth.\n\nTo believe in American capitalism has long meant believing in a mostly laissez-faire approach from the government — it sets the rules of the game, but it doesn't have a piece on the board. Markets pick winners and losers, not Washington. The strong thrive, the weak fail. That consensus has been eroding for years, and finally, the dam has broken: The US government has become a shareholder in nearly a dozen companies over the past several months, and the list is growing. It's moved the economy into a much more interventionist — and unfamiliar — territory. The machine is still turning, but more hands are tinkering with the gears, including, most importantly, the president's.\n\nThe federal government has been on an equity stake shopping spree during the first year of Trump's second term. The US took a nearly 10% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion in August, a move aimed at bolstering the country's semiconductor industry. It has invested in several critical minerals firms, including MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals, as well as in Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company. In June, the administration acquired a \"golden share\" in US Steel in exchange for approving Japanese company Nippon Steel's acquisition of the company — it gives the government veto-like power over decisions such as shifting jobs outside the US and shuttering plants. (And as for recent developments in Venezuela, the president clearly is waving a heavy hand toward the US oil industry and potential investment there. How that situation plays remains to be seen.)\n\nThese types of moves are not abnormal outside the United States. China's version of capitalism is hyper-state-led. Many governments, including those of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, make direct investments in some domestic firms. The US has gotten extra involved in private industry in the past, but it's generally been in times of distress, such as during the 2008 crisis, when it took stakes in certain financial institutions and automakers in order to prevent a broader economic meltdown.\n\nThis time, it's different: The government is meddling when there's no apparent urgent need, and it's picking companies in what some observers say is a scattershot manner. The sectors make sense, but the criteria for selecting companies are rather unclear, as is the role the government will play in its investments.\n\n\"With industrial policy, the devil's in the details of so much, and this is where the details are really obscured, and where they are defined, they're kind of ad hoc,\" says Nathan Lane, an assistant professor of economic development at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nA novel vision of American state capitalism is emerging right before our eyes. It's a world where the White House puts its thumb on the scale, whether in injecting funds into a firm, weighing in on mergers, or implementing legally questionable tariffs at the drop of a hat. Many critics have expressed concerns about the risks arising from the Trump administration's actions — the potential for politically biased decision-making, the appearance of crony capitalism, and possible market distortions. In the grand scheme of things, these maneuvers may be financially minor, but they're structurally major developments. Regardless of the drawbacks, it's indicative of where we're headed. There may be no going back.\n\n\"The use of these tools generally only goes in one direction, and so the Trump administration, for better or worse, has introduced a new group of tools into the economic statecraft toolkit,\" says Aaron Bartnick, a former White House economic security official under the Biden administration and a current fellow at Columbia University. \"Whatever administration comes next, whether Republican or Democrat, will find it very tempting to continue to use them.\"\n\nThis hasn't all happened out of nowhere — the US has, for a decade, been increasingly comfortable with industrial policy, meaning the government taking a more active role in steering the economy. Trump 1.0 implemented several protectionist policies, including imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, engaging in a trade war with China, and renegotiating the NAFTA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Rather than rolling everything back, Biden left in place many of Trump's tariffs, and his administration pushed in a state-nudged economic direction with the CHIPS Act, which was meant to support the US semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, put tax credits and funds toward sectors such as electric vehicles and solar energy. And even prior to Trump and Biden, the government hasn't completely steered clear of steering the economy when needed. See: The New Deal and the aforementioned response to the financial crisis.\n\nStill, overall, the US has largely taken a hands-off approach to the economy over the last 40 years and been critical of countries that don't.\n\n\"The United States has spent decades tsk-tsking the rest of the world about state-owned enterprises and industrial policy and state capitalism,\" says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. On the Trump administration's current about-face, \"the hypocrisy is pretty big,\" he says.\n\nThe latest turn is a significant step further. Instead of deploying a more typical playbook — grants, loans, tariffs, etc. — that can be seen as at least somewhat neutral in its application, the White House is now picking and choosing companies to get involved in. In broad strokes, one can see what they're getting at here. The companies on Trump's investment list are in important sectors where the US lags behind, and they fit into the president's overall theory of the case on the economy: it's better to have and make stuff here. Take Intel: The Trump administration wants to make sure the US is not reliant on semiconductor companies such as TSMC, which is based in Taiwan, since the island is vulnerable to China. It's a similar story with critical minerals companies, which mine, process, or refine materials crucial for a range of products, from smartphones to defense technology. Even some progressives see these as worthwhile endeavors. Sen. Bernie Sanders is into the Intel deal, telling Reuters in August that \"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment.\"\n\nWhat some critics find head-scratching is why specific companies are being chosen. Why Intel in particular, and even more peculiarly, why a startup helmed by Intel's former CEO? On a macro level, the end goal may be the same as more typical industrial policy — supporting certain sectors — but it's being performed on a micro level. Trump has also been critical of policies with the same end in mind. Back in March, he told Congress to \"get rid of\" the CHIPS Act.\n\n\"It is fair to say that Intel has been underperforming, but I don't know of anyone who feels that if Intel continued to underperform, there was a risk of taking the entire technology sector down,\" Bartnick says. \"We haven't seen a rationale for how these particular companies were selected, how these particular industries were selected, how the valuations were reached.\"\n\nThe Trump administration may have determined that the US can't win its existential battle with China and protect its economic priorities with the regular tools in the toolbox. William Henagan, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says those instruments have proven effective in the past because of the size of America's economy and the critical role the US dollar plays in global finance. The fact that the White House thinks throwing around our national weight is not enough to achieve their desired outcomes is an eyebrow-raising sign.\n\n\"We've basically been able to use restrictive enforcement tools to achieve international policy outcomes that we were interested in,\" Henagan says. \"Those are no longer sufficient.\"\n\nA White House official tells me there's \"very much\" a logic to what the administration is doing in taking equity stakes in strategic industries and sectors. \"The point with the equity stakes is that it's a tool that other countries have used with various degrees of success, but we're not indiscriminately trying to take equity stakes in everyone, in anything. We see it as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" they say. Losing Intel, for example, would be an \"asymmetric blow\" to America's national and economic security.\n\nThe equity stakes are a \"rounding error\" compared with the trillions of dollars of GDP being affected by \"what are very unequivocally free-market or pro-capitalist policymaking\" activities, the official says, pointing to tax cuts and deregulation, among other moves. But they are an acknowledgment that the White House feels the free market has fallen short in shoring up these critical sectors.\n\nWhile the motivation for taking stakes in companies may be clear-ish, the execution is not, nor are the potential consequences.\n\n\"We know very little about the other rights that are associated with these deals,\" Bartnick says.\n\nIt's hard to predict exactly how the government will wield its equity-derived power. How will these stakes dilute the rights of existing shareholders? And what happens if the US government's interests don't align with those of other stockholders? Will the company feel compelled to follow through on what the government says, regardless? How exactly will the terms of these deals work? And even if the government doesn't use the hard power of its vote shares, it can use soft power to keep companies it's invested in from stepping out of line.\n\nThe federal government's Intel investment will be passive, meaning it gets no board representation or other governance rights, and it's agreed to vote with the company's board of directors — with limited exceptions. As part of the MP Materials agreement, the company isn't allowed to nominate any board members who are not US citizens without the Department of Defense's consent. However, the government will generally vote with the company's board, with exceptions.\n\nThe way American capitalism is generally supposed to work is that money flows to companies that are doing the best job of utilizing it. The whole idea is that market capital allocation is designed to separate the wheat from the chaff. These stakes may distort that — the government is choosing which specific firms it wants to come out ahead.\n\nWhat's more, if the federal government is going about throwing around money, rather than businesses focusing on making the best products and services possible, they may turn their attention to currying favor with the president. Whether or not this is crony capitalism or merely appears to be doesn't really matter. If executives make the calculation that it's much better to be on Trump's good side than his bad side, they may fall in line preemptively. The competition isn't for customers, market share, or innovation — it's for the president's affection.\n\nThe Trump administration doesn't want to be in the business of running private companies from the Oval Office, the White House official tells me, but the point is for the government to have some sway. \"Obviously, the intent wasn't for us to take an equity stake in Intel and then they just close down their Ohio foundry and ship it off to Taiwan,\" the official says. The hope is there's an \"overlap\" between what's best for companies and best for American economic national security.\n\nScott Kennedy, a senior advisor in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells me that in an economy as vast and varied as America's, Washington's power is relatively limited, and this activity could be just a \"minor nuisance\" to industry. \"On the other hand, if there are more cases, then it will begin to affect the decision-making of businesses and will increasingly orient them to think about how they should do business in a way that benefits the current administration as opposed to what benefits their company or the US national interest,\" he says. \"And I think that that could have a distorting effect eventually.\"\n\n\"It's better if tech CEOs spend less time in DC and more time coming up with new products,\" says Owen Zidar, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\nNearly every analyst, economist, and academic I spoke to for this story agreed that Trump's version of American state capitalism is more a reflection of where the US is going than where it has been. It's not the same as what China's doing, and it's not socialism, but it's an unconventional step further down the road that the US has been on for a while.\n\nOn issues such as antitrust enforcement, industrial policy, and tariffs, factions within both the Republican and Democratic parties are leaning more towards interventionism. Trump is being more obvious with his actions and intentions — there's a reason Tim Cook is showing up in the Oval Office with a gold plaque. This is a situation where there's likely no backtracking. Other countries are reacting to America's inward turn as well — it's why Canada is shoring up its domestic economy, and Europe is taking a corporatist turn.\n\n\"It changes the political equilibrium in a way that other countries pursue similar policies. And we get away from the brand of capitalism that we were doing before,\" Lane says.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to look beyond the previous consensus. Capitalism is increasingly unpopular in America, especially among young people, for a reason. For many Americans, the system isn't working. Instead, it's breeding inequality, shipping jobs overseas, and making the overall economy more precarious. During the pandemic, the public got a front-row seat to the fragility of our supply chains and the risks associated with the just-in-time, globally distributed setup. Political leaders and policymakers aren't wrong to wonder if the state shouldn't take a heavier hand in shoring up important industries, supporting vital companies, and making investments where the private market might blanch at the risks.\n\nThe White House has indicated that more equity investments are likely on the horizon, but the criteria for who it will pick are a black box. \"We should entirely leave it up to the market to do whatever it wants\" is not a great approach to the economy. Neither is, \"Who gets a leg up depends on how the president's feeling today.\" It's odd for Trump to seize the means of production a little bit.\n\n\"We've had this sort of ideological view that's now breaking down a bit because we've realized that what we've been doing isn't good enough, isn't adequate enough,\" says Robert Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech and science policy think tank. \"I wish there was a sort of unified field theory for this in the Trump administration, but I don't think so.\"\n\nWhile the motives are understandable, the mechanics are anything but. It's unclear how the US will exit these investments, or, once it does, how much money it will actually make. However, in the context of the enormous federal budget, the return will be minimal. It pushes the global economy into new territory, and it's hard to know whether it's one the US will always like.\n\n\"We have spent decades, under both Democrats and even more so under Republicans, criticizing certainly China and Russia, but also Italy, Germany, and the UK on their use of these tools,\" Bartnick says. \"And if the US starts to go down that path as well, it will give not just our adversaries, but also our allies, even greater license to do the same.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Financial firms are planning trips to Venezuela to scout out new investment opportunities. Bill Ackman praised the move as \"good for America.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds.\n\nHere's what they've been saying:\n\nMyers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the \"centerpiece\" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow \"faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment.\"\n\nMyers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nBremmer, founder of the political risk research and consulting firm, Eurasia Group, in a post on LinkedIn, wrote that the \"US presumption is next Venezuelan leaders will now do what the Americans want because they've just seen the 'or else.'\"\n\nAccompanying the post was a photo of a drawing of a horse. The hindquarters of the horse were drawn in intricate detail, and labeled \"SOF operation to capture Maduro,\" referencing the special operations forces mission that was executed early Saturday. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned \"plans for future of Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly call it a plan,\" Bremmer added.\n\nIn a separate post, he wrote: \"The law of the jungle is dangerous. What applies to your enemies one day can apply to you the next. Make no mistake where the world is heading here.\"\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that \"The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.\"\n\nGao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in \"the brave new world of international law.\"\n\n\"Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,\" he continued. \"It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.\"\n\nThe Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, \"no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.\"\n\n\"What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?\" Warren wrote. \"The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.\"\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was \"heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.\"\n\nIn another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption \"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.\"\n\nMusk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening protests in Iran sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy are putting new pressure on its theocracy.\n\nTehran is still reeling from a 12-day war launched by Israel in June that saw the United States bomb nuclear sites in Iran. Economic pressure, intensified in September by the return of United Nations sanctions on the country over its atomic program, has put Iran's rial currency into a free fall, now trading at some 1.4 million to $1.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” — a coalition of countries and militant groups backed by Tehran — has been decimated in the years since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.\n\nA new threat by U.S. President Donald Trump warning Iran that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the U.S. “will come to their rescue\" has taken on new meaning after American troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran.\n\nHere's what to know about the protests and the challenges facing Iran's government.\n\nHow widespread the protests are\n\nDemonstrations have reached over 170 locations in 25 of Iran’s 31 provinces, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported early Sunday. The death toll had reached at least 15 killed, it added, with more than 580 arrests. The group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.\n\nUnderstanding the scale of the protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in general in Iran also face limits on reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country, as well as the threat of harassment or arrest by authorities.\n\nBut the protests do not appear to be stopping, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday said “rioters must be put in their place.”\n\nThe collapse of the rial has led to a widening economic crisis in Iran. Prices are up on meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table. The nation has been struggling with an annual inflation rate of some 40%.\n\nIn December, Iran introduced a new pricing tier for its nationally subsidized gasoline, raising the price of some of the world’s cheapest gas and further pressuring the population. Tehran may seek steeper price increases in the future, as the government now will review prices every three months.\n\nThe protests began first with merchants in Tehran before spreading. While initially focused on economic issues, the demonstrations soon saw protesters chanting anti-government statements as well. Anger has been simmering over the years, particularly after the 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody that triggered nationwide demonstrations.\n\nIran's “Axis of Resistance,\" which grew in prominence in the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, is reeling.\n\nIsrael has crushed Hamas in the devastating war in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group in Lebanon, has seen its top leadership killed by Israel and has been struggling since. A lightning offensive in December 2024 overthrew Iran’s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, President Bashar Assad, after years of war there. Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels also have been pounded by Israeli and U.S. airstrikes.\n\nChina meanwhile has remained a major buyer of Iranian crude oil, but hasn't provided overt military support. Neither has Russia, which has relied on Iranian drones in its war on Ukraine.\n\nThe West worries about Iran’s nuclear program\n\nIran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials have increasingly threatened to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels prior to the U.S. attack in June, making it the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.\n\nTehran also increasingly cut back its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, as tensions increased over its nuclear program in recent years. The IAEA's director-general has warned Iran could build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”\n\nIran recently said it was no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. But there's been no significant talks in the months since the June war.\n\nWhy relations between Iran and the US are so tense\n\nIran decades ago was one of the United States’ top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule.\n\nBut in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. Then came the Islamic Revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which created Iran’s theocratic government.\n\nLater that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed.\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the U.S. backed Saddam Hussein. During that conflict, the U.S. launched a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea as part of the so-called “Tanker War,” and later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the U.S. military said it mistook for a warplane.\n\nIran and the U.S. have seesawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, and relations peaked with the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw Iran greatly limit its program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, sparking tensions in the Mideast that intensified after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",

    "description": "The US is once again teetering into an economy where high earners keep things afloat, and lower earners see cooling prospects.",
    "fullText": "The post-pandemic era marked by growing wages and opportunities for lower-income Americans has flipped around.\n\nThe K-shaped economy is back, and it could mean more trouble in 2026.\n\nFor higher earners, economic outcomes and opportunities are chugging along, albeit perhaps a bit muted than during the boom labor market of a few years ago. For those at the bottom, in lower-earning positions that are traditionally more sensitive to downturns, things are looking worse.\n\nIt might also spell rocky times ahead for an economy that's largely being propped up by the spending and opportunities of those at the top.\n\nThe return to a K-shaped economy has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve and its voting members. In minutes from the December Fed meeting, a majority of participants \"mentioned evidence of stronger spending growth for higher-income households,\" while lower-earning households were becoming \"increasingly price sensitive\" and adjusting their spending in response to price increases for essentials.\n\nAt a December press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he's not sure how long this can last. \"Most of the consumption does happen by people who have more means,\" Powell said. \"I think the top third accounts for way more than a third of the consumption, for example. So, it's a good question how sustainable that is.\"\n\nThe \"K\" has been slowly shaping up over the last couple of years, and has accelerated in the last few months: A Bank of America Institute report showed that the growth in credit and debit card spending among lower-income and higher-income households split into a K shape around this past spring, with higher-income households experiencing spending growth near 3% year-over-year in late 2025, compared to less than 1% growth for the lower-income households.\n\n\"While the 'K shape' continues, it will likely, in our view, gather additional focus in 2026,\" the authors wrote.\n\nOn the income side, those at the bottom are doing worse than those at the top. The Atlanta Fed wage growth tracker showed that growth for the highest quartile of the wage distribution surpassed that of the lowest quartile in October 2024 and has remained consistently higher since then. Wage growth for the lowest quartile skyrocketed back in 2022, reaching the highest point on record in the fall after the gap between the two quartiles widened to the highest point in July.\n\n\"People who are putting a lot more of their income toward essential expenses are feeling burdened by that at a much greater capacity than people who have much higher incomes at the same time, unlike during that post-pandemic environment,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, said.\n\nAnd while wages are trending higher for the upper quartile, it doesn't necessarily mean blockbuster gains — part of the precarity of the K as inflation remains stubborn. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, said cooler income growth has pushed many upper-median and below households to lean on savings and credit.\n\n\"A K-shaped consumer spending outlook is simply not sustainable in the long-run — eventually income pulls spending,\" Daco said in written commentary.\n\nTo be sure, some economists and analysts don't think the K-shaped economy ever really left. \"We've been in a K-shaped economy for the better part of two decades,\" Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist of RSM, said, pointing to the 2008 financial crisis as one factor kick-starting the uneven outcomes. Now, Brusuelas said, economic inequality has \"clearly deepened.\"\n\n\"There was a brief period of narrowing early in the post-pandemic era when fiscal policy was put in place to provide a substitute for lost wages and mitigate the post-recession transition of the pandemic,\" he said.\n\nAnna Paulson, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said higher-income households have been able to \"spend freely,\" benefiting from the ongoing robust stock market. The wealthiest 1% of Americans hold nearly half of the country's corporate equities and mutual funds, data from the Federal Reserve's Distributional Financial Accounts showed.\n\n\"So, while headline growth is shaping up to be pretty decent this year, the base of support looks different — with a lot of concentration at the top,\" Paulson said.\n\nIn Brusuelas's view, the US economy is largely locked into that K-shape and would need serious policy changes to shift it, and he doesn't see that as likely happening in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" Brusuelas said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"\n\nHow is the economy affecting you?

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening demonstrations sparked by Iran's ailing economy spread Thursday into the Islamic Republic's rural provinces, with at least seven people being killed in the first fatalities reported among security forces and protesters, authorities said.\n\nThe deaths may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran’s theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded elsewhere. The fatalities, two on Wednesday and five on Thursday, occurred in four cities, largely home to Iran’s Lur ethnic group.\n\nThe protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the demonstrations have yet to be countrywide and have not been as intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.\n\nThe most-intense violence appeared to strike Azna, a city in Iran's Lorestan province, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, online videos purported to show objects in the street ablaze and gunfire echoing as people shouted: “Shameless! Shameless!”\n\nThe semiofficial Fars news agency reported three people had been killed. Other media, including pro-reform outlets, cited Fars for the report while state-run media did not fully acknowledge the violence there or elsewhere. It wasn't clear why there wasn't more reporting over the unrest, but journalists had faced arrest over their reporting in 2022.\n\nIn Lordegan, a city in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, online videos showed demonstrators gathered on a street, with the sound of gunfire in the background. The footage matched known features of Lordegan, some 470 kilometers (290 miles) south of Tehran.\n\nFars, citing an anonymous official, said two people had been killed during the protests Thursday.\n\nThe Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said two people had been killed there, identifying the dead as demonstrators. It also shared a still image of what appeared to be an Iranian police officer, wearing body armor and wielding a shotgun.\n\nIn 2019, the area around Lordegan saw widespread protests and demonstrators reportedly damaged government buildings after a report said people there had been infected with HIV by contaminated needles used at a local health care clinic.\n\nIn Fuladshahr in Iran's Isfahan province, state media reported on the death of a man there Thursday that activist groups attributed to the police opening fire on demonstrators.\n\n'Protests due to economic pressures'\n\nA separate demonstration Wednesday night reportedly led to the 21-year-old volunteer in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Basij force.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member’s death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, which is believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Lorestan province.\n\nThe Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,” he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.\n\n“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,\" Pourali said. \"The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”\n\nThe protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, over 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Tehran. Local prosecutor Kazem Nazari said 20 people had been arrested after the protests and that calm had returned to the city, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.\n\nIran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters. However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.\n\nMeanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.\n\nIran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.\n\nThe protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well. The country's leaders are still reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country in June. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the war.\n\nIran has said it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. However, those talks have yet to happen as U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned Tehran against reconstituting its atomic program.",

    "description": "I'm keeping track of Trump's economy right here. Every month. Enjoy!",
    "fullText": "(AKA the unemployment rate, cost of eggs, gas prices, inflation, the Dow Jones, whether citizens received a stimulus check, and Trump's overall approval rating.)\n\nIt wasn't exactly convincing, considering Americans are facing massive insurance hikes in 2026 because Trump and his party recently chose to allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire in two weeks. Likewise, our pockets are shrinking as the cost of food and living bloat.\n\nNote: Data on inflation is released a few weeks after each month has ended, so our reports will look at the previous month's numbers.\n\nGetting data on the unemployment rate between September and November has been plagued and vague due to the government shutdown this year. September's numbers were late. October's rate was altogether canceled, and November appears to have come in at 4.6% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor someone who brags about a booming economy, the steady increase in Americans searching for work sure doesn't bode well for the president's claims.\n\nAh, the price of eggs. Another cursed number.\n\nFood indexes are also released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and so we won't be getting an October number. I can, however, report that eggs officially dropped under the $3 mark, and you can find a grade A dozen for around $2.86 on average in November.\n\nShifting from a positive to a negative, the cost of beef is still skyrocketing, and I continue to find that giving up red meat this year was one of the best financial decisions I've made.\n\nIf you're looking for a pound of beef, prices jumped to $6.50 on average in November.\n\n(And yes, the government shutdown is still acting as the Ghost of Christmas past, and we will not be getting an October average here either.)\n\nGas is going down, though! I'm sure y'all will flood the comment section with local prices wayyyyy higher than the national average, and wish you saw numbers as low as this, but according to the Energy Information Administration, a gallon of gasoline cost around $3.179 last month.\n\nInflation dropped to its lowest point in months, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2.7% figure has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"For the inflation report, many economists were caught off guard by the way the B.L.S. handled the distortions, which is part of why they are casting so much doubt on the numbers published today.\"\n\nThe above is fancy speak to say that the government shutdown caused \"distortions\" in the data surrounding inflation, and so it may or may not paint a prettier picture than reality.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones neither rose nor fell in November, according to Stat Muse. So, there's that.\n\nWe're approaching a full year under Trump's second presidency, and there's still no stimulus check in sight for struggling Americans.

    "fullText": "Hollywood remains the world's entertainment nexus, but many next-gen creators have decided they don't need a Los Angeles address to make it big.\n\nMiami, Las Vegas, and Seattle all attract more top Instagram influencers per capita than LA, according to new research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm.\n\nThe top two by total creator count were LA (over 12,000) and New York (nearly 11,000), followed by Miami (about 6,000).\n\nOther major creator communities have formed in established film markets, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, which have emerged due to their lower cost of living and production tax incentives. But other top creator cities — Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia — lie outside those secondary film markets.\n\nThe ability to create content for social platforms from anywhere means creators can build a livelihood from just about anywhere. Talent managers say that, apart from when they want a creator to attend an in-person event, brands rarely request a city-specific creator when seeking a partner.\n\n\"You do have people in LA and New York making the lion's share of the dollars. But now they're increasing everywhere else,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. \"Eventually, there will be a hot influencer in Idaho.\"\n\nLooking at cities by concentration of creators, Miami comes in No. 1, outranking LA and NYC.\n\nSome creators are drawn to places that already have a robust creative community, like Nashville or Las Vegas. Others want to be near fashion and retail, which fuels a lot of the creator economy. LTK, a major e-commerce platform that connects influencers to shoppers, is based in Dallas, as was Neiman Marcus for a long time. Dude Perfect, a superstar creator group known for sports-focused stunt videos, is based in nearby Frisco. Miami, where Alix Earle gained social media fame and often appears, experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes.\n\nCreators also move to be near family and for a lower cost of living. It makes sense for people building a brand based on themselves to work in areas that reflect their identity. The biggest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. MrBeast, chose his hometown of Greenville, NC, as his base.\n\nDude Perfect has recently embarked on a major expansion in Texas. CEO Andrew Yaffe said there's no need to be in LA with access to top brands and talent there.\n\n\"We'll be here as far in the future as we can see,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"There's no shortage of opportunity for us here.\"\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.",

    "description": "ETH Zurich researchers have developed a process that can be used on site to render environmental toxins such as DDT and lindane harmless and convert them into valuable chemicals – a breakthrough for the remediation of contaminated sites and a sustainable circular economy.",
    "fullText": "Persistent organic pollutants such as DDT and lindane still pollute the environment and affect humans decades after their use.\n\nETH researchers have developed a new electrochemical process that completely dehalogenates these long-lived toxins and converts them into valuable industrial chemicals.\n\nThe method uses cheap equipment, prevents side reactions and could be used on contaminated landfills, soils or sludge.\n\nMobile systems could be used on site in the future – an important step towards the remediation of contaminated sites and the creation of a sustainable circular economy.\n\nThey were once considered miracle workers – insecticides such as lindane or DDT were produced and used millions of times during the 20th century. But what was hailed as progress led to a global environmental catastrophe: persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are so chemically stable that they remain in soil, water and organisms for decades. They accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals and thus enter the human food chain. Many of these substances were banned long ago, but their traces can still be found today – even in human blood.\n\nHow to remediate such contaminated sites, be they soils, bodies of water or landfills, is one of the major unresolved questions of environmental protection. How can highly stable poisons be rendered harmless without creating new problems? Researchers at ETH Zurich, led by Bill Morandi, Professor of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, have now found a promising approach. Using an innovative electrochemical method, they are not only able to break down these long-lived pollutants but also to convert them into valuable raw materials for the chemical industry.\n\nA key distinction between this and previous work is that the carbon skeleton of the pollutants is recycled and made reusable, while the halide component is sequestered as a harmless inorganic salt. “The previous methods were also energetically inefficient,” says Patrick Domke, a doctoral student in Morandi’s group. He explains: “The processes were expensive and still led to outcomes that were harmful to the environment.”\n\nTogether with electrochemistry specialist Alberto Garrido-Castro, a former postdoc in this group, Domke developed a process that renders the pollutants in question completely harmless. During this project, the two researchers were able to draw on the many years of experience of ETH professor Morandi, who has been working on the transformation of such compounds for years. “The key advance of this new technology is the use of alternating current to sequester the problematic halogen atoms as innocuous salts such as NaCl (table salt), while still generating valuable hydrocarbons,” says Morandi.\n\nElectrolysis enables almost complete dehalogenation of pollutants under mild, environmentally friendly and cost-effective conditions. It cleaves the stable carbon-halogen bonds, leaving behind only harmless salts such as table salt and useful hydrocarbons such as benzene, diphenylethane or cyclododecatriene. These are actually sought-after intermediates in the chemical industry, for example, for plastics, varnishes, coatings and pharmaceutical applications. In this way, the technology not only contributes to the remediation of contaminated sites but also to the sustainable circular economy.\n\n“What makes our process so special from a technical point of view is that we supply electricity using alternating current, similar to the electrical waveform delivered to households. It is one of the most cost-effective resources in chemistry,” explains Garrido-Castro. “Alternating current protects the electrodes from wear, which is why we can reuse them for many subsequent electrolysis cycles. In addition, the alternating current suppresses unwanted side reactions and the formation of poisonous chlorine gas, allowing the pollutant’s halogen atoms to be fully converted to inorganic salts.” The reactor used by the researchers consists of an undivided electrolysis cell in which dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used as a solvent – itself a by-product of the pulp process in paper production.\n\nThe process can be applied not only to pure substances but also to mixtures from contaminated soils. Soil or sludge can therefore be treated without pre-treatment or further separation processes. A prototype of the reactor has already been successfully tested on classic environmental toxins such as lindane and DDT. “Our system is mobile and can be assembled on site. This eliminates the need to transport these hazardous substances,” explains Domke.\n\nOn 27 November 2025 at ETH Zurich @ Open-i, ETH Zurich will award the Spark Award for the best invention of the year for the 14th time. The criteria for this award are originality, patent strength and market potential.\n\nSpark Award ceremony, Industry Day @ Open-i, Thursday, 27 November 2025, 1.30 p.m., Zurich Convention Center.

    "description": "FaZe Clan's influencer exodus exposes a key risk for creator-economy companies that rely directly on talent to make money.",
    "fullText": "The creator economy gives, and it can also take — suddenly. That's one lesson behind the abrupt exodus of talent from the esports and marketing company FaZe Clan last week.\n\nBuilding a business led by an influencer or celebrity can make you a boatload of money. Just ask the teams behind Kim Kardashian's Skims or George Clooney's Casamigos tequila, which both crossed $1 billion in value.\n\nBut starting a company where the product you're selling is the influencer — such that you make money primarily from their social-media reach, content, or ability to do brand deals — can be risky.\n\nIf a YouTuber or TikTok creator loses popularity due to a scandal or a sudden algorithm change, the revenue dries up. If they become burned out from posting or simply decide they no longer want to work with an intermediary company, then poof!\n\nThat's the situation FaZe Clan appears to have found itself in this week after all six creators its website listed as its talent roster announced they were leaving the company in separate posts on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nCompany investor Matt Kalish, who cofounded DraftKings, told Bloomberg that the current financial structure of FaZe Clan is \"unsustainable\" and he had offered talent the option to go independent or sign deals with his company, HardScope, which they declined.\n\nFaZe Clan acknowledged the departures in its own post on X, writing that \"this era of FaZe\" had \"come to a close.\" With its most famous talent gone and their millions of followers in tow, the company is leaning into its esports business that makes money from league participation, player transfer fees, and IP licensing.\n\nFounded in 2010, FaZe Clan started as a group of friends who enjoyed making gaming videos. The group amassed millions of fans and began making revenue through brand deals. FaZe Clan went public in 2022, sharing in investor filings that it pulled in tens of millions of dollars in revenue from brand sponsorships and other advertising tied to its content. Other business lines, such as consumer products or esports, represented a smaller piece of the pie.\n\nFaZe Clan, when it was still reporting its revenue sources as a public company in 2022 and 2023, relied heavily on brand deals and YouTube ads to make money.\n\nFaZe Clan's stock plummeted in value during its first year trading on the Nasdaq. After cutting about 20% of its staff in early 2023, the company sold itself to gaming and marketing firm GameSquare in March 2024. GameSquare later sold FaZe Clan's media business in multiple transactions to Kalish and others, while retaining the esports business.\n\nThe sudden departure of FaZe's creators — and its struggle in recent years — highlights a key risk that should keep any creator-economy CEO up at night. Being overly reliant on specific creators or revenue sources can be a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe solution: diversify, diversify, diversify.\n\nFaZe Clan, GameSquare, and HardScope did not respond to requests for comment.",

Not because you don't make enough money, not because the economy is rigged against you, not because you didn't get lucky. You're broke because you keep buying stupid things that are keeping you poor.\"\n\nFrom the first line, O'Leary makes it clear—building wealth doesn't start with more income.

That shiny new car in your driveway.\n\n\"Buying a new car is one of the dumbest financial decisions you can make,\" O'Leary said. A car drops 20% to 30% in value the second you drive it off the lot, he explained, turning thousands of dollars into dust—for nothing but \"that new car smell.\" And leasing? \"Leasing is the absolute worst,\" he said. \"You're renting a depreciating asset… You gave the dealership thousands of dollars for the privilege of borrowing their car.\"\n\nHis advice is brutal but simple: \"Buy a three-year-old certified pre-owned car. Let somebody else take the depreciation hit. That's what rich people do.\"\n\nO'Leary isn't just coming for your car. He's coming for your kitchen—or more accurately, the one you refuse to use. \"People tell me they don't have money to invest. And then I watch them spend $15 on a salad for lunch,\" he said. That's not a splurge. It's financial self-sabotage.\n\nThe average American spends nearly $4,000 a year eating out, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. O'Leary runs the math: investing that same $3,500 annually for 30 years at 10% could become more than $600,000. \"You're trading half a million dollars in retirement wealth for convenience and fancy meals you'll forget about in 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nPack your lunch.

That's not living well. That's being financially irresponsible.\"",

    "description": "AI in the workplace may boost speed and efficiency, but risks eroding confidence and critical thinking, the CEO of a digital economy think tank said.",
    "fullText": "AI appears to be making workers faster, more efficient, and more productive on paper.\n\nHowever, according to Mehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, which advises companies and governments on building the data centers that power AI, it may also be quietly eroding workers' confidence in their job skills.\n\nParyavi told Buisness Insider that excessive and poorly designed AI use in workplaces is driving what he called a \"quiet cognitive erosion\" and \"down-skilling.\"\n\n\"There used to be a notion called 'thinking outside the box,'\" he said. \"That notion will soon cease to exist when everyone draws on all their creativity, analytics, and innovation from a single box called AI.\"\n\nParyavi believes the most immediate casualty of heavy AI reliance is self-belief.\n\n\"If you come to believe that AI writes better than you and thinks smarter than you, you will lose your own confidence in yourself,\" he said.\n\nParyavi said the loss of confidence compounds quickly as workers begin deferring writing, analysis, and judgment to AI systems, gradually relying less on the skills they have built through years of reading, writing, learning, and observation.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you realize you are not good enough without this new tool, and day by day, you rely less on yourself and more on AI,\" he said.\n\nResearch is beginning to reflect that pattern. A new report from the Work AI Institute, produced with researchers from universities including Notre Dame, Harvard, and UC Santa Barbara, found that AI is turning ordinary office workers into people who feel smarter and more productive while their underlying skills slowly erode.\n\nRebecca Hinds, head of the Work AI Institute, told Business Insider that AI creates an illusion of expertise, which is especially risky for early-career employees who still need to establish their foundations.\n\nMuch of the problem, Paryavi said, lies in how leaders define productivity.\n\nAI's biggest promise is speed — faster reports, faster launches, faster analysis. But faster doesn't always mean better, Paryavi said.\n\nWhile AI can generate professional-sounding output, Paryavi said it often lacks the depth that comes from years of hands-on expertise.\n\nThat loss of depth is already visible, according to Anastasia Berg, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has said that workers who rely heavily on AI risk rapid skill atrophy, especially junior employees who never fully learn how to think through problems independently.\n\nParyavi isn't opposed to AI. He said the risk comes from indiscriminate use.\n\nCompanies should tailor AI access by job function, he said, rather than rolling it out universally. Some roles may benefit heavily from AI support, while others should rely primarily on human judgment.\n\nHe also discussed the importance of human involvement at both ends of the workflow — leading creative thinking at the beginning and quality-checking AI output at the end.\n\n\"What's critical to note is that you, the human you, must quality check AI, not the other way around,\" he said.\n\nAI may not eliminate jobs outright. But without deliberate limits, Paryavi said, it could quietly erode the confidence and thinking skills that careers are built on.\n\n\"How much technology do we really need, and how far are we willing to push the envelope? How much is enough?\" he said.",

    "description": "Japan's aging workforce, labor shortages, and government policies show how the country has adapted as 30% of its population is over 65.",
    "fullText": "While traversing the narrow, winding roads outside the Japanese town of Fujikawaguchiko, I stopped by a farm with a view of Mount Fuji, where a few locals were picking fruit. Most were older, and one was walking with a cane as she bent down to put berries into a bag.\n\nAt an udon shop, drivers and construction workers — some of whom looked to be in their 60s — were slurping noodles. The server said she knew people who have owned nearby restaurants and shops for decades.\n\nAfter settling back at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, I noticed that the older workers I had encountered in the city worked as crossing guards, cleaners, gift shop owners, taxi drivers, or wholesale workers. Only a handful of the older Tokyoites I observed were wearing the white-collar uniform of suits and ties.\n\nWhen I visited Japan in early December, I had just finished the capstone story of my 80 Over 80 series, the most in-depth look at America's older workers that I know of in modern press or academia. In the months prior, I interviewed nearly 200 Americans working past 80 in dozens of professions. I discovered that nearly 550,000 Americans in this demographic work, according to Census data, and the number is expected to continue increasing as the US workforce ages and the cost of living rises. In interviews, dozens of American researchers said government benefits fall short for millions of older Americans each year, adding that the US could look to countries like Japan for inspiration.\n\nJapan, like many of its neighbors, has experienced rapid aging over the last few decades. Nearly 30% of Japan's population is 65 and older, the highest of any country, according to government data. About one in four in this demographic works, meaning that about one in seven Japanese workers is 65 and older.\n\nComparatively, this demographic comprises about 18% of the US population, and roughly one in five works. The US has not aged as rapidly as East Asia, although increased longevity and lower birth rates have propelled aging enough that by 2030, the Census Bureau projects there will be more Americans 65 and older than under 18.\n\nJapan has adapted in many ways to its hyper-aging population. Its government has actively supported older worker employment, especially among older women. Seven researchers studying aging workforces in Japan and South Korea told Business Insider that keeping older workers employed at higher levels has helped both countries mitigate economic disaster and severe labor shortages.\n\nThe Japanese case is much different from the US, though, some researchers said. While the US will continue to experience lower growth rates, the workforce is unlikely to decline as much due to aging, assuming that comparatively higher fertility rates and immigration levels hold steady or rise. The desire to hire younger people is often stronger in the US than in Japan, though the US also has a younger population. The US also lacks a comprehensive healthcare system like Japan's, with worse general health metrics.\n\nResearchers agreed Japan still has a long way to go in supporting its aging workers and preparing mid-career workers for a stable retirement. For the US, Japan may offer a different glimpse into what an older workforce can look like.\n\nJapan is often the first country many think about when discussing aging. It boasts the world's highest number of centenarians per capita and advocates for active lifestyles, healthier diets, and reliable healthcare.\n\nMany older Japanese people work in manufacturing and retail, with an increasing number in service roles, construction, and medical-related services. America's oldest workers also frequently worked in these professions, particularly construction and education, according to Business Insider's analysis of Census Bureau data.\n\nJapan has mandated that companies provide more employment opportunities for workers aged 65 and above through its Act on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons. Legislation has encouraged companies to offer work opportunities until the age of 70, while former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida committed one trillion yen over five years for reskilling efforts.\n\nJapan also has Silver Human Resource Centers, which provide part-time work and skills training for older people, as well as the government's Lifetime Employment Support Office.\n\nThe World Economic Forum notes that 80% of Japanese workers hope to continue working in some capacity after retirement. Some companies have implemented policies that enable workers to extend their retirement age and offer promotions and salary increases beyond 60. Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides employers with subsidies if they can convert older contract workers to permanent jobs.\n\nJacob Funk Kierkegaard, a nonresident senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued in a paper from April that Japan has alleviated many potentially disastrous economic outcomes of hyper-aging. Kierkegaard told Business Insider that despite Japan's unique socioeconomic and aging circumstances, the country may be a model for its neighbors, as it raised female employment levels, expanded immigration pathways, and became more integrated with foreign economies.\n\n\"In many ways, the Japanese labor market was always much more receptive to the idea of employing workers at high ages because they tend to be healthy and motivated and do the type of service-sector jobs that you could do at a high age,\" Kierkegaard said.\n\nJapan isn't without its challenges, though.\n\n\"Even if Japan has done better than any other country, it doesn't mean that older workers in Japan have the same labor force participation or earnings potential as does prime-age workers,\" Kierkegaard said.\n\nMany older Japanese workers are employed in low-wage jobs, as many companies remain reluctant to hire older workers for higher-paid positions. Much like in the US, many Japanese companies assume older workers require more training and costs. Japan's hierarchical workplace structure also means it's often harder for an older worker to climb the ranks.\n\nPopulation aging contributes to critical labor shortages, according to Haruki Seitani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund and coauthor of a working paper on aging and AI in Japan. His research found that as Japan's labor force ages, productivity growth at work falls.\n\nMany older Japanese workers earn money out of necessity, said Yasuo Takao, a political scientist at Curtin University in Australia. Government survey data shows that over half of older Japanese workers were predominantly motivated by money, compared to under 16% who worked to feel fulfilled.\n\nJapan has struggled to expand employment among its older population, he said. Many companies are incentivized to \"retire\" their older workers, then rehire them at lower pay, which Takao said discourages them from \"remaining fully engaged.\"\n\n\"Japan's wage structure is harsh for older workers because it is built on an aging seniority system that inflates wages in mid-career and then resets them sharply at retirement age to control labour costs,\" Takao said.\n\nTakao said that older Japanese work at rising rates because labor shortages sometimes force firms to retain workers. Each year, more people leave the workforce than enter, and the working-age population has declined by over 10 million since 1995. Projections put the labor shortage at upwards of 6.4 million by 2030, and many companies have opted to automate tasks or give employees more work instead of hiring older workers.\n\nPension reforms have also made work more imperative for some older workers. Japan has a two-tier mandatory public pension system that relies on contributions, which is \"highly sensitive to population aging,\" Takao said.\n\nOlder Japanese workers tend to put in fewer hours compared to their younger peers, although this may be partly due to cuts in pension benefits that apply if they exceed a specific threshold.\n\n\"If Japan can transition from quantity-driven senior employment to quality-driven, skill-aligned senior employment, it stands to gain a powerful long-term demographic dividend: higher productivity, lower fiscal strain, stronger innovation capacity and a healthier, more engaged older population,\" Takao said. \"In this sense, treating older workers as a source of economic strength, not a cost to be managed, may be one of Japan's most important growth strategies in the decades ahead.\"\n\nJapan's approach to managing its aging workforce — and its shortcomings — can offer some valuable insights into what the US can do.\n\nTakao said the US can avoid the \"Japan trap\" of older workers needing to work by acting earlier to expand phased-retirement opportunities and protect older workers' earnings. Takao added that the US should invest earlier in training and job redesign so that older workers can secure jobs that match their skill sets.\n\nAbout 40% of female Japanese workers of all ages hold part-time jobs, compared to about a quarter of US female workers, and this rate increases with age. The US can learn from this discrepancy by providing more assistance to women who want to hold steady employment during their parenting and caregiving years.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Japan may be a cautionary tale. Japan has a relatively low exposure to AI, as determined by usage rate, compared to the US and China. Seitani said that AI could help aging-related labor shortages in occupations like transportation services, construction, and clerical work. Long-term, this could mean older workers may be less pressured to stay on the job or may have more flexible hours.\n\nAdditionally, the research suggests limited mobility between jobs with high and low AI exposure among Japanese occupations. The US can do more to promote technological education for older workers to improve their work outcomes.\n\nKierkegaard said many countries may have to adjust their lower retirement ages and more robust safety nets as they age, so older residents aren't as reliant on the social safety net, which might crumble if the demand exceeds the available resources.\n\n\"Ultimately, Japan's experience shows that aging societies require more than labor-supply fixes. They demand a broader redesign of pensions, work norms, care systems and urban infrastructure,\" Takao said. \"The United States still has time to adapt, but the window for proactive reform is narrowing.\"",

    "fullText": "Bankruptcies aren't just rising — they're suddenly everywhere.\n\nFrom billion-dollar giants to mom-and-pop shops to everyday individuals, bankruptcies are piling up across the US this year, with large corporate bankruptcies already hitting their highest level in 15 years.\n\nThe surge in bankruptcies highlights the growing financial pressures facing consumers and companies as costs climb amid a tougher borrowing environment.\n\n\"Rising costs, tighter credit conditions, and ongoing geopolitical volatility continue to exert pressure on households and businesses already facing financial strain,\" Amy Quackenboss, the executive director at the American Bankruptcy Institute, said earlier this month.\n\nUnlike past downturns, this wave of bankruptcies appears to be hitting nearly every corner of the economy. It's sweeping across a range of sectors in what one veteran bankruptcy attorney described as a strikingly \"unusual\" pattern.\n\nTypically, corporate failures tend to be \"industry sticky,\" meaning they cluster within the same sectors, Robert Stark, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick and chair of its bankruptcy and corporate restructuring practice group, recently told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2022, for example, he said there was the \"big crypto winter\" culminating in a string of cryptocurrency firm bankruptcies, including Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.\n\n\"That was a sticky event — a lot in the industry kind of went through bankruptcy at the same time,\" Stark said. \"What we have now, which is the thing that I find kind of interesting, is I don't see as much stickiness as I'm used to seeing.\"\n\n\"Bankruptcies seem to be kind of all over the place,\" added Stark, who represents creditor groups in the 2025 bankruptcies of auto parts company First Brands and fintech startup Linqto, as well as the equity committee in the Chapter 11 case of genetic testing company 23andMe.\n\nStark said that he can't pinpoint a clear cause for the \"broad smattering of industries\" now in bankruptcy, but he called it \"unusual\" in his 30 years of experience and \"shockingly so.\"\n\nMajor corporate bankruptcies this year have included hospitality company Sonder, Spirit Airlines, Del Monte Foods, retailer Claire's, and CVS Health subsidiary Omnicare. Each, in court filings, listed more than $1 billion in liabilities, placing them among the largest bankruptcies of 2025.\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, which tracks public and private companies of a certain size, bankruptcy filings climbed to 717 through November, topping last year's tally of 687.\n\nEven without December figures, 2025 has already logged the highest annual count for large corporate bankruptcies since 2010, when filings totaled 828, according to S&P Global.\n\nData from the intelligence firm shows that the industrials sector was the most distressed through November, with 110 companies filing for bankruptcy. The consumer discretionary sector followed with 85 bankruptcy filings, and healthcare was next up with 46 firms filing.\n\nThe spike in bankruptcies extends well beyond the corporate sphere, with an increasing number of small businesses also filing for bankruptcy, data shows.\n\nSmall businesses carrying $3,024,725 or less in secured and unsecured debt have the option to file for bankruptcy under Subchapter V of Chapter 11, which offers a more streamlined reorganization process.\n\nData from Epiq Bankruptcy Analytics shows Subchapter V filings, made by small firms and individuals, at more than 2,300 year-to-date through mid-December — a nearly 10% increase from the same period last year.\n\nIn November alone, Subchapter V bankruptcy filings totaled 223 — a 23% bump from the previous year, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, which cited data from Epiq.\n\nIn addition to big and small businesses, individual bankruptcies have also increased amid rising costs.\n\nIndividual bankruptcy filings saw an 8% jump to 40,973 in November 2025, up from the 37,814 filings in November 2024, the data cited by ABI shows.\n\nLast month, there were 25,329 individual filings for Chapter 7, known as \"clean slate\" or liquidation bankruptcy, up 11% from the 22,871 filings recorded in November 2024.\n\nIndividual filings for Chapter 13, also called a \"wage earner's plan\" to repay all or part of someone's debts, accounted for 15,558 in November 2025, a 5% jump over the 14,865 filings in November last year, according to the data cited by ABI.\n\n\"For debt-burdened families and companies, bankruptcy remains a critical pathway to restore stability and rebuild toward a stronger financial future,\" Quackenboss, the ABI executive director, said.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China passed a revised law that for the first time formally regulates unmanned aircraft, a move set to reshape the country's ​fast-growing drone and low-altitude economy sectors, according to state media on Saturday.\n\nThe Standing ‌Committee of the National People's Congress approved the changes under the Civil Aviation Law on December 27, adding provision ‌on airworthiness certification for drones that plugs a key regulatory gap.\n\nThe overhaul comes as China's low-altitude economy - a national strategic initiative focusing on commercial activities below 3,000 meters - is forecast to grow to more than 2 trillion yuan ($280 billion) by 2030, from a 1.5 trillion yuan ⁠in 2025, according to estimates from ‌the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC).\n\nUnder the new rules, effective on July 1 next year, all entities ‍involved in the design, production, import, maintenance and operation of drones must obtain airworthiness certification.\n\nDrone manufacturers will be required to assign a unique product identification code to each unit, in accordance with relevant ​national regulations.\n\nChina has implemented \"interim regulations\" for unmanned aircraft starting from 2024, which stipulate that ‌civil unmanned aircraft must be registered under real names. The regulations also specify that micro, light, and small civil unmanned aircraft do not require airworthiness certification, while medium and large ones must apply to CAAC for airworthiness certification.\n\nAs China's drone market has rapidly expanded, oversight has lagged. In recent years, several cities have reported flight delays caused by illegal drone ⁠operations, prompting fines and other penalties.\n\nThe tighter requirements will ​affect manufacturers such as DJI, the world's largest ​consumer drone maker, and EHang, which produces passenger drones.\n\nDrone logistics have become an important driver of China's low-altitude economy, with 2.7 million packages containing everything ‍from hamburger lunches to ⁠life-saving medicine delivered throughout 2024, according to transport ministry data.\n\nE-commerce and food delivery leaders like JD.com and Meituan have long talked about investing in drone logistics to ⁠improve supply chain efficiency.\n\nJD Logistics has tested drone delivery networks in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, and has said ‌drones can reduce shipping times for rural customers by up to 70%.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Sophie Yu, Casey HallEditing by Shri Navaratnam)",

    "title": "The Economy Avoided a Recession in 2025",
    "description": "A feared recession didn’t materialize, but unemployment rose, wage growth slowed and affordability challenges are mounting.",
    "fullText": "After a chaotic year filled with trade wars, market gyrations and the longest government shutdown in history, the U.S. economy has, once again, proved more resilient than many forecasters feared.\n\nBut “resilient” isn’t quite the same thing as “good.”\n\nMany Americans are entering 2026 worried about their jobs, stressed about their finances and unconvinced that things will improve in the new year.\n\nThe flow of official economic data resumed last week after a prolonged delay caused by the government shutdown. The reports were muddled by technical quirks related to the shutdown, but on balance they suggested the economy remained stuck in the same uneasy limbo it was in before the data blackout began.\n\nJob growth was decent in November, but unemployment rose. Retail sales were solid, but wage growth slowed. Inflation cooled, but remains elevated.\n\nThat mixed picture is far better than the dire forecasts of last spring, when many economists warned that President Trump’s tariffs would lead to runaway inflation, a recession — or both.\n\nInstead, data this week is expected to show that gross domestic product, which measures overall economic output, grew at a robust pace in the third quarter. Full-year data, when it becomes available early next year, is likely to show that output, adjusted for inflation, grew at about a 1.5 percent pace in 2025, a downshift from 2024 but far from a recession.\n\nA gradual deterioration, though, is still a deterioration. In surveys, Americans overwhelmingly say they are struggling with the cost of living and do not believe the economy is working for them — an impression borne out by data showing that consumer spending is being driven by a relative handful of rich households.\n\nMr. Trump tried to shift that narrative in a combative — and often misleading — prime-time speech last week in which he blamed his predecessor for economic problems and promised that a “Golden Age” was just around the corner.\n\nMany forecasters do expect a rosier backdrop next year. But the problem for Mr. Trump is that few of the larger economic problems that pushed voters away from the incumbent party in 2024 have improved, and some have gotten worse.\n\nTariffs haven’t caused a spike in inflation, but they have pushed up prices for some consumer products. Homeownership remains out of reach for many Americans. Child care is still broadly unaffordable, electricity bills are rising and health care premiums are set to rise for millions of families when insurance subsidies expire at the end of the year.\n\n“When individual Americans think about the economy, they are thinking about: ‘Can I afford the things I need and want? Do I have economic opportunities?’” said Heather Boushey, who served as an economic adviser to President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nWhen the answer to those questions is “no,” she said, it is hard to convince people that the economy is strong — a lesson she and her Biden administration colleagues learned the hard way.\n\n“You can’t tell people what their reality is,” Ms. Boushey said.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s claim that he “inherited a mess,” the economy when he returned to office was strong by most measures. Unemployment was low. Wages were rising. Inflation, though higher than normal, had fallen significantly from its peak in 2022.\n\nThe frenetic early months of the Trump administration threatened to derail that progress. The president’s on-again, off-again tariff threats, combined with Elon Musk’s efforts to eliminate programs and cut the federal work force, led to steep drops in consumer confidence and wild swings in the stock market.\n\nThen on April 2, Mr. Trump announced tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. Markets plunged, and economists warned of a recession or “stagflation,” the dreaded combination of high inflation and weak growth last seen in the United States in the 1970s.\n\nThe worst predictions never came to pass, partly because Mr. Trump reversed course, rolling back some tariffs and delaying others. That gave companies an opportunity to build up inventories and re-engineer supply chains. Companies also proved more reluctant to pass price increases on to consumers than many economists initially expected, perhaps because they doubted that customers would be willing or able to stomach the extra cost.\n\nThe U.S. economy also turned out to have unexpected sources of strength that helped offset the drag from the trade war. A surge in construction of data centers for artificial intelligence models helped prop up business investment, while a rising stock market — also tied primarily to optimism around A.I. — encouraged consumer spending.\n\n“If it weren’t for the A.I. spending boom, we would be in a different place,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank.\n\nBut the benefits have not been evenly distributed. Wealthy households have reaped most of the stock market gains, even as the softening labor market has led to slower wage growth, particularly for the lowest earners. As a result, consumer spending has become bifurcated, with high-income households spending and lower-income households increasingly falling behind on financial obligations. Car repossessions and other signs of financial stress have picked up this year.\n\n“Yes, there are people who are doing great, but I don’t think there’s this sense that the tide is really coming in and lifting all the boats,” said Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank.\n\nFor some groups, the cooling labor market has turned downright icy. Recent college graduates are having the hardest time finding jobs since the aftermath of the Great Recession more than a decade ago. The unemployment rate for Black workers jumped to 8.3 percent in November, up from 6.1 percent at the end of last year and double the rate for white workers.\n\n“That’s a level that would be considered an economic crisis if they were happening to Americans overall,” said Jessica Fulton, a senior fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank focused on issues affecting Black Americans.\n\nCuts to the federal government have hit Black workers disproportionately, Ms. Fulton noted. But she warned that the problems affecting Black families today — a weakening labor market, cuts to federal safety net programs, rising electricity prices that are partly a result of the rapid growth of A.I. data centers — may soon be felt more widely.\n\n“People are being squeezed from all sides,” Ms. Fulton said. “We’re seeing that from Black workers now, which I think could foreshadow the same thing for everyone else.”\n\nDespite such concerns, many forecasters expect growth to pick back up next year, and for the labor market to improve rather than deteriorate further.\n\nThey point to several potential sources of strength. The tax cuts that Congress passed this year should lead to larger refunds for many Americans, which should provide a lift to consumers early in the year. The law also included provisions to encourage companies to invest.\n\nLower interest rates — the result of a series of cuts the Federal Reserve made this fall — should also help businesses and consumers. Policymakers are weighing whether to deliver more reductions in the coming year.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest lift could come from reduced uncertainty after a uniquely tumultuous year in which businesses and investors contended with seismic changes related to tariffs, immigration restrictions and government regulation.\n\n“2025 was hampered by all the policy-related uncertainty,” said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, a bank. “The policy landscape is going to allow businesses to re-engage, and when they do that, I think you’ll see a pickup in investment.”\n\nPolicymakers are similarly optimistic. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with CNBC on Friday that he was “feeling actually pretty good” about the economy.\n\n“We got through 2025,” he said. “This has been an uncertain year. A lot has happened, and the economy has come through this.”\n\nBut that rosy outlook could be upended if the A.I. boom fades and takes the stock market along with it, or if the calmer year many hope for from Mr. Trump does not come to fruition, either because of new tariffs or other policy changes.\n\nEven without a new shock to the system, there is a risk that the steady deterioration could continue. Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup, forecasts that sluggish monthly jobs growth and more muted wage gains will finally start to weigh on consumer spending next year. Higher unemployment will offset the benefits of larger tax refunds and other tailwinds, she predicts.\n\n“If the labor market is really weakening, then those other things almost don’t matter,” Ms. Clark said.",

    "description": "President Trump’s trade policy, inflation and climbing stock prices shaped business and the economy this year.",
    "fullText": "In recent years, macroeconomic tides have ebbed and flowed, but one thing has remained unchanged: Americans’ dim views of the economy.\n\nIn 2023, pundits warned of the “vibecession.” In 2024, concerns about the economy and inflation were top of mind for voters in the presidential race.\n\nThis year, economic pessimism has persisted, as President Trump’s sweeping economic proposals, from his wide-ranging tariffs to his plan to remake the Federal Reserve, have raised uncertainty to new highs. And the economic data is sending mixed, and muddled, signals.\n\nHere are 14 charts that illustrate how uncertainty has unfolded in the economy and markets over the last year, and how it might affect the next.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade war has been one of the biggest sources of economic uncertainty this year. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly cited tariffs as a way to spur American manufacturing, create new jobs and lower U.S. trade deficits.\n\nNearly every country has seen import duties rise.\n\nThe tariffs have made progress toward some of the administration’s stated goals: They have brought the trade deficit down, as exports grew more than imports.\n\nAnd they have made money: Tariff revenues are now at record highs.\n\nBut there is another kind of deficit on investors’ minds: the federal budget deficit. Tariff revenues remain a small share of total government revenues.\n\nHere’s another way in which the effects of tariffs are showing up: higher prices for goods.\n\nConsumer prices started to accelerate in June, and the prices of products most exposed to tariffs notched some of the highest gains.\n\nAnd in recent months, prices for goods continued to rise, contributing more to inflation.\n\nInflation unexpectedly slowed to 2.7 percent in November, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week. But economists have advised taking this data with a grain of salt, because of disruptions in the bureau’s data collection efforts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether tariffs will cause just a temporary increase in prices or if they will feed into more persistent inflation.\n\nAt this month’s DealBook Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against the notion that tariffs had contributed to inflation, saying that they had caused a “one-time price adjustment,” not a “generalized price increase.”\n\nThe chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, has also said that the Fed expected tariffs to cause a “one-time shift in the price level.” But he has stressed that the increase could be drawn out over several quarters. And at a news conference after last week’s Fed meeting he acknowledged the risk of tariff inflation becoming “more and more persistent.”\n\nIn the first full jobs report since the federal shutdown, the B.L.S. reported that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent last month, a four-year high. Wage growth slowed to its lowest level since 2021. As with inflation, the shutdown affected the data collection for these measures, and the agency said ahead of the release that its estimates of the unemployment rate and other measures would be subject to more uncertainty than usual.\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThere was a silver lining: Employers added 64,000 jobs in November, driven largely by gains in the health care sector. But that only partly offset a decline in October.\n\nThe federal government shed 168,000 jobs in October and November, as workers who accepted the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offer came off the payroll.\n\nAnd the jobs numbers do not reflect a big downward revision that is expected early next year.\n\n(Revisions to jobs figures are commonplace, but they dominated headlines earlier this year when downward adjustments led Trump to fire the commissioner of the B.L.S., Erika McEntarfer, claiming, without evidence, that the data was “rigged.”)\n\nThe lowest-paid workers have felt the strain of the cooling labor market the most. As the economy started to recover from the pandemic, demand for labor far outstripped supply in the lowest-paid industries, such as leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, that is no longer the case, and hourly wages are rising most slowly for the lowest earners.\n\nLast year, voters consistently told pollsters that they trusted Donald Trump over Joe Biden and later, Kamala Harris, to do a better job on the economy.\n\nNow, Trump is the one feeling the pressure, as views of his handling of the economy have soured since the summer.\n\nThe risks posed by inflation and a softening labor market have also put the Fed in a tough position. Last week, the central bank decided to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a third meeting in a row. But the decision was highly contentious, with three of 12 policymakers voting against it.\n\nPowell said he could have made the case either way for the Fed to cut interest rates or pause reductions, given the competing risks to unemployment and inflation.\n\n“You’ve got one tool,” he said. “You can’t do two things at once.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has made no secret of his desire for lower rates. Next year, he will select a new Fed chair.\n\nAfter a dip earlier this year, most notably amid the chaotic “Liberation Day” tariff rollout, the stock market has, on the whole, kept on going up. The S&P 500 reached a record high just last week, for the 37th time this year.\n\nArguably, company earnings, and their expectations for earnings are the most important factor driving the market movements.\n\nIn fact, earnings expectations have moved in tandem with the S&P 500 price index over the course of this year (again, with the exception of the early months of the year).\n\nOf course, the S&P 500 is driven in large part by big tech companies, which are intertwined with the A.I. boom.\n\nThat has been cause for concern for some investors, who see a parallel between this moment and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But unlike companies leading the stock rally during the dot-com bubble, the public companies with the steepest valuation gains today are earning more as the market goes up.\n\nThe outlook for earnings continues to be bullish in 2026, though there could be weak links in the A.I. chain.\n\nThe crypto boom that Trump’s re-election ushered in is on pause for now.\n\nAfter surging for most of the year, the price of Bitcoin and Ether, along with dozens of other coins, started to plummet on Oct. 10, following Trump’s announcement that he would impose a new tariff on China.\n\n(The stock market on that day also saw the biggest one-day plunge since April, though it has since rebounded and hit a record high.)\n\nFor some, the crypto sell-off has underscored the fact that crypto remains a volatile investment, even as it has entered a new level of mainstream acceptance. Amid a high-stakes lobbying campaign by the crypto industry, Trump ended a regulatory crackdown on crypto and signed legislation outlining the first federal rules for stablecoins, digital tokens tied to assets like the U.S. dollar.\n\nOthers worry that a crypto crash could bleed over to the wider market.\n\nAmid all this uncertainty, people might be looking to pop culture as a form of escape. They haven’t necessarily been finding it at the movies, if ticket sales are any indication.\n\nSummer is a crucial season for Hollywood, accounting for the lion’s share of annual box office revenue. This year, fantasies, science-fiction sequels and superhero flicks were on offer. But moviegoers, for the most part, didn’t bite: It was the worst summer for domestic ticket sales since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the pandemic years.\n\nThe fall was filled with star-studded flicks, but none of them constituted box office hits.\n\nCan the holiday season help Hollywood make a comeback? “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good” have gotten it off to a good start.\n\nBut broader concerns abound. Warner Bros. Discovery has struck a deal with Netflix for the Warner Bros. studio and its sibling streaming service, HBO Max, while it has fended off, for the time being, a hostile takeover offer from Paramount.\n\nRegardless of how it all ends, it feels like a moment of loss for cinephiles. Corporate consolidation, after all, is not likely to bode well for the future of the Silver Screen.",

    "description": "From live shopping startup Whatnot to AI music platform Suno, meet the creator economy startups that raised massive deals in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The creator economy is riding an AI-fueled high.\n\nIn 2025, eight startups building artificial intelligence tools to automate the content creation process each announced at least $50 million in funding — a combined $1.2 billion — from venture capital and private equity investors.\n\nSynthesia, a generative AI video startup based in London, confirmed its $180 million funding round in January, while ElevenLabs, a text-to-voice startup, closed a $180 million Series C round. Other AI startups, like Moonvalley, Krea, and Higgsfield, also announced sizable investments this year.\n\nWhile AI is dominating investor interest, the topic still carries friction within the creator economy. Some of these AI startups, which offer features such as human-like avatars, run the risk of posing a threat to content creators themselves. Influencer marketing, still the primary financial engine of the creator economy, has yet to reach a consensus on how and when AI should be utilized.\n\nTop creators aren't sitting by idly for AI to take over. YouTuber MrBeast and his team initially sought to raise $200 million earlier this year at a $5 billion valuation, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The MrBeast team declined to comment on the fundraise.\n\nIt's not just AI that's attracting giant checks from VCs.\n\nSocial commerce startups building live shopping and affiliate marketing platforms are also raking in funding. Whatnot, a platform where people sell on stream in categories like fashion and collectibles, such as Pokémon Cards or Labubus, raised a total of $490 million across two later-stage rounds this year. The social shopping platform was most recently valued at $11.5 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, ShopMy, an affiliate marketing platform, continues to gain market share in the influencer marketing space. The startup raised a total of $147.5 million in funding this year.\n\nUS social commerce sales are expected to cross $100 billion next year, according to estimates from EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. The category is gaining steam in the US, fueled in part by the growth of TikTok Shop.\n\nThis year's fundraising blitz for creator AI and social commerce startups follows similar buzz for the categories in 2024 when investors threw money at startups like Captions, Flip, and OpusClip. Several startups in those business areas, including ElevenLabs and ShopMy, raised money two years in a row.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 2025 fundraising data from PitchBook and other industry sources to highlight the biggest creator industry investment rounds from the year. We're highlighting 13 startups that raised $50 million or more in 2025; combined, their funding crossed $1.9 billion. We focused on companies whose products significantly impact the businesses and content creation processes of creators and their partners.\n\nHere are 13 creator economy startups that raised some of the largest rounds in 2025, in alphabetical order:",

It's because Japan offers a different and more comforting take on what a modern society can be. You touch on this at the end, but let me go into a little more detail.\n\nConsider that Japan missed many major consumer-facing tech trends of the 21st century -- it failed to lead in the social media, freemium gaming, alogrithmic curation, or AI spaces. In many ways, it feels like a place time stopped. Yet it doesn't feel backwards. Quite the contrary: it feels in many ways a sane, calm alternative to the West, and America in particular, where \"disruption\" might as well be on the dollar bill at this point. I write about this at more length here: https://blog.pureinventionbook.com/p/super-galapagos\n\nGreat article. One more thing for me personally -- Japan is also extremely affordable, especially for the quality of goods or services received. This is of course major function of the depreciation of the Japanese yen, but it still has the effect of making Japan accessible to a huge swathe of the global population in a way that New York, London etc is not (especially in terms of the quality of amenities received -- just compare a $300/night hotel in New York with a hotel half the price in Tokyo)",

    "fullText": "Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has overturned decades of U.S. trade policy — building a wall of tariffs around what used to be a wide open economy.\n\nHis double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country have disrupted global commerce and strained the budgets of consumers and businesses worldwide. They have also raised tens of billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury.\n\nTrump has argued that his steep new import taxes are necessary to bring back wealth that was “stolen” from the U.S. He says they will narrow America's decades-old trade deficit and bring manufacturing back to the country. But upending the global supply chain has proven costly for households facing rising prices. The taxes are paid by importers who typically attempt to pass along the higher costs to their customers. That includes businesses and ultimately, U.S. households.\n\nAnd the erratic way the president rolled out his tariffs — announcing them, then suspending or altering them before conjuring up new ones — made 2025 one of the most turbulent economic years in recent memory.\n\nHere's a look at the impact of Trump's tariffs over the last year, in four charts.\n\nA key number for the overall impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers and businesses is the “effective” tariff rate — which, unlike headline figures imposed by Trump for specific trade actions, provides an average based on the actual imports coming into the country.\n\nIn 2025, per data from the Yale Budget Lab, the effective U.S. tariff rate peaked in April. But it's still far higher than the average seen at the start of the year. Before finalizing shifts in consumption, November's effective tariff rate was nearly 17% — seven times greater than January's average and the highest seen since 1935.\n\nTariff revenue vs America's trade deficit\n\nAmong selling points to justify his tariffs, Trump has repeatedly said they would reduce America's longstanding trade deficit and bring revenue into the Treasury.\n\nTrump's higher tariffs are certainly raising money. They've raked in more than $236 billion this year through November — much more than in years past. But they still account for just a fraction of the federal government's total revenue. And they haven't raised nearly enough to justify the president's claim that tariff revenue could replace federal income taxes — or allow for windfall dividend checks for Americans.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit, meanwhile, has fallen significantly since the start of the year. The trade gap peaked to a monthly record of $136.4 billion in March, as consumers and businesses hurried to import foreign products before Trump could impose his tariffs on them. The trade gap narrowed to $52.8 billion in September, the latest month for which data is available. But the year-to-date deficit was still running 17% ahead of January-September 2024.",

The big AI investors were larger companies, including those that have led white-collar job cuts. In some cases, their profits have skyrocketed, and \"do more with less\" has been the mantra of the year.\n\n\"Firms are doing more with fewer workers,\" Swonk wrote. \"Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels \n\nEconomists are still grappling with how the US ended up in this rare scenario. This year, although overall layoffs have crept up, they remain relatively low. Corporate America and Big Tech were the exceptions, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla announcing big cuts.\n\nBusiness Insider has heard from dozens of white-collar job seekers who said that finding a new role has felt \"impossible,\" and those with jobs have, in many cases, held onto them for dear life.\n\nIn addition to a tough job market, consumers had no income growth last quarter. However, spending held strong — despite tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. A large percentage of this spending uptick was in healthcare and medical services, as costs for hospital and nursing services climbed. This year marks the most Americans have spent on healthcare services since 2022, when the Omicron wave of COVID-19 spread.\n\nThis suggests that, despite strong spending by affluent households, much of this rise in consumer spending wasn't necessarily powered by confidence. In fact, consumer sentiment levels are among the lowest they have ever been, and many Americans have been cautious about spending because of tariff uncertainty.\n\nThe tough job market isn't helping. Unemployment is at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Total job growth has stayed slow.\n\nDozens of job seekers across generations told Business Insider this year that they were frustrated about suspected ageism, cumbersome hiring processes, competition with hundreds of others for a single role, and the suspected role of AI in screening out their applications. Some told reporters they've applied for thousands of roles with no interviews, while others said it took well over a year to get a single offer, often at a lower pay than their previous job.\n\nIn his 2026 wish list for the business world, Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco asked for \"ROI for AI.\"\n\n\"I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects,\" he wrote, referring to the eye-popping AI spending from Big Tech — and their plans for even more next year.\n\nIf that does come, the jobless boom may only grow. Companies want to use AI to boost productivity without hiring more people, which would only exacerbate a sluggish job market.\n\nAlthough it's difficult to determine if this year's investments in AI have yielded results, the GDP's spike to 4.3% in the third quarter is an encouraging sign overall. The largest growth since the third quarter of 2023 prompted President Donald Trump to say that the \"Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead.\"\n\nStill, many Americans may worry about what this means for their jobs. Some companies have cited the need to be efficient in an AI-driven future as justification for layoffs. The US already operates with fewer jobs than it had pre-COVID, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has recently said that the grim jobs data may be overstating this year's deflated gains.",

Several startups raised at least $10 million in new funding last year, such as AI startup Captions or newsletter platform Beehiiv.\n\nHere are 17 creator-economy startups that raised more than $10 million in 2024\n\nAI is continuing to fuel investor interest in the creator economy in 2025, too. For instance, Hedra, a generative AI startup used by some creators to make viral content, announced a $32 million Series A led by A16z in May.\n\nCreators themselves, like Emma Chamberlain and MrBeast, are also raising venture capital for their businesses.\n\nSee the leaked pitch deck Chamberlain Coffee used\n\nSo, how do creator-economy startups land those investments? Often, it starts with a pitch deck.\n\nLumanu, a creator-focused financial startup, uses a simple pitch deck that's more of a \"conversation guider,\" its cofounder and CEO, Tony Tran, told Business Insider.\n\n\"My pitch is always why, what, how, and why now?\" Tran said. (Read the full pitch deck here.)\n\nSkye, a career-coaching startup, had different pitch decks depending on the type of investor or fund they pitched to.\n\n\"I had two different versions, depending on the fund,\" said Jessica Wolf, Skye's CEO and one of its cofounders. \"If I knew a fund was more into pre-seed, all about the founder, I had one deck. But if I knew that they were a numbers person, I would use another one.\"\n\nEvery startup has a different approach.\n\nSome, such as Throne, even ditch the pitch deck altogether and opt for an email or Notion document.\n\nRead the email template creator-economy startup Throne used to secure its seed investment.\n\nWe talked with founders who've pitched their startups to investors about their process.

The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

    "title": "Copper prices are soaring. Here's what that often signals for the economy.",
    "description": "Copper prices have rallied over 35% so far this year amid supply shortages, surging global demand, and tariff uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMetals have had a record year with recent surges in gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) prices, but there’s a third metal hitting its own record highs. Copper prices have rallied by more than 35% this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2009, driven higher by rising tech demand, supply constraints, and tariff uncertainty.\n\nGlobal copper (HG=F) prices officially surpassed $12,000 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday for the first time ever and continued to march higher on Wednesday.\n\nEach type of metal reacts slightly differently to economic conditions, and copper is no exception. However, unlike gold and silver, copper isn’t so directly influenced by investor sentiment or economic expectations. Its price movements can typically be attributed to physical growth and expansion.\n\nCopper is often viewed as a barometer for the economy. It plays a central role in power grids, construction, industrial machinery, and more. When there’s a demand for those types of goods or services, it’s typically a good sign that the economy has a clean bill of health — giving copper its nickname: Doctor Copper.\n\nRising copper prices often signal strong industrial demand and a rapidly growing economy, while falling prices may indicate an economic slowdown, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Copper is “a major beneficiary of investments in grid and power infrastructure globally, as AI and defence heighten the need for robust and secure energy networks,” wrote Goldman Sachs Research analyst Eoin Dinsmore in a note.\n\nGold is seen as more of a “safe-haven” asset and a hedge against inflation. Silver straddles the line between gold and copper and has both investment and industrial purposes. Copper, however, is predominantly industrial. It’s not typically purchased to be stored like gold or silver but meant to be used, which is why it’s usually the strongest indicator, of the three metals, that the economy is moving in the right direction.\n\nThere are a few key reasons that copper is experiencing a surge right now. Major copper-producing regions such as Chile and Indonesia have faced supply challenges and environmental disasters that have contributed to a global copper shortage and a tighter market.\n\n“After essentially flat mine supply growth expected this year, our 2026 mine supply growth estimates have fallen to only around +1.4%, or about 500 kmt lower than our estimates at the beginning of the year,” said Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, in a statement.\n\nA dip in supply isn’t the only factor that’s pushing prices higher. In July, the Trump administration issued tariffs on several categories of copper imports, putting additional pressure on the market. At the same time, heavy investment in the AI sector is significantly boosting demand because of its reliance on copper for data centers.\n\nOne source estimates that hyperscale AI data centers can use up to 50,000 tons of copper per facility.\n\nAs far as where prices are headed, JPMorgan Global Research expects copper prices to reach $12,500 a ton in the second quarter of 2026, ultimately averaging around $12,075 a ton for the full year.\n\nWhile researchers are optimistic that copper prices will continue on an upward trend, experts say the long-term implications of recent price surges remain uncertain.\n\n“The intersection of tariffs and copper prices in July 2025 highlights the complex dynamics of global trade and commodity markets,” said David Koch, CFP and director of portfolio management at Halbert Hargrove. “While the immediate effect has been a sharp rise in copper prices, the long-term consequences will depend on how markets, governments, and industries adapt to this new trade environment.”\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nGold and silver prices have been on a tear, with silver prices increasing by more than 100% year to date.

    "description": "Morgan Stanley's top economist wrote this week that as long as prices can remain elevated, companies might be able to avoid having to slash headcount.",
    "fullText": "The job market is brutal right now, and there's growing concern that 2026 could see more layoffs. However, Morgan Stanley says that many companies may be able to avoid having to slash head count.\n\nThe bank's chief US economist, Michael T. Gapen, and his team wrote on Tuesday that the US economy may be able to avoid widespread layoffs in 2026 but only if companies continue hiking prices, after already raising them throughout 2025.\n\nRising layoffs and sticky inflation were two of the big macro themes that defined 2025. According to Gapen and his team, companies opted to decrease hiring and reduce staffing to avoid raising prices earlier in the year as tariff pressures kicked in.\n\nNow, Morgan Stanley says that this may be the key to avoiding widespread layoffs in the coming year.\n\n\"We think the majority of the tariff pass-through to final consumer prices will have been completed at that point, assuming the administration does not push tariff policy further,\" Gapen said. \"On net, our outlook assumes inflation firms, profitability is largely restored, and the economy avoids layoffs.\"\n\nThe economist added that his team doesn't expect the Trump administration to implement new tariffs as the 2026 midterm elections approach. Yet, the analysts also emphasize that they don't think companies are done raising prices.\n\nThe bank maintains its baseline view that the existing tariffs will push core inflation to 3% early in 2026, with signs already being seen in the cost of consumer goods.\n\n\"Monthly rates of consumer price inflation in June through September have come with observable increases in components of CPI and PCE that have high direct exposure to tariffs,\" Gapen wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley's analysis also found that companies have started to recoup some of the money they lost in early 2025 after being impacted by tariffs. That's a promising development, particularly as the bank predicts that many firms can raise prices while still maintaining the bulk of their customer base.\n\nHowever, the thesis that higher prices can help prevent layoffs in 2026 only applies so long as customers continue to stomach higher costs.\n\nConsumers have a limit to how much more they'll pay for goods, particularly as economic uncertainty remains high. It is unclear just how high prices can go before shoppers balk.\n\n\"If firms found they could not push output prices higher on account of consumer resistance and loss of market share, then we think they would turn to reducing labor costs further, triggering layoffs,\" Morgan Stanley added.",

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "description": "Economist Mark Zandi isn't convinced the big Q3 GDP report means the economy is set to soar from here, and thinks the data could be revised lower.",
    "fullText": "The third-quarter GDP report was a blowout, but don't expect that to change Mark Zandi's mind about how the economy is faring.\n\nAfter a long delay due to the government shutdown, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the latest economic growth data, and it was a lot more upbeat than economists were predicting.\n\nAccording to the Q3 report, the US economy is estimated to have expanded at a 4.3% growth rate during the three-month period, driven by robust consumer and federal spending.\n\nYet, Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, tells Business Insider that he's still harboring reservations about how things are going under the surface.\n\nZandi has been ringing the alarm on the economy all year, recently stating that he saw the US on the edge of a recession.\n\nThe most recent GDP report doesn't seem to have restored his confidence that better days are ahead.\n\n\"Despite the big gain in real GDP growth in the quarter, underlying real GDP growth — abstracting from the quarterly vagaries of the data — is closer to 2%,\" he told Business Insider. \"OK, but not great, and not strong enough to create enough jobs, as unemployment is steadily moving higher.\"\n\nZandi was predicting a 3.8% increase in real GDP growth, higher than most economists' estimates of 3.3%. As such, he isn't surprised by the numbers, although he also speculated that the big upside surprise may have been driven by technical quirks as opposed to actual momentum.\n\n\"The biggest difference with my forecast is the more substantial narrowing of the trade deficit, but this is due to the swings caused by the tariffs. Government spending was also stronger, but this is likely due to a measurement issue,\" he said.\n\nZandi believes that the government shutdown also increases the risk of revision for the Q3 report, with growth potentially being revised downward in the coming months.\n\n\"I can't explicitly connect the dots from the government shutdown, its impact on the government data, and on the GDP estimate,\" Zandi said, \"But it wouldn't be surprising if this data is ultimately revised to a significant degree.\"",

    "description": "Real GDP rose at an annualized rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, beating the 3.3% forecast and driven by strong consumer spending.",
    "fullText": "The US economy defied expectations in the third quarter of a year marked by uncertainty.\n\nUS real gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, exceeding the 3.3% expected and more than the 3.8% growth in the second quarter.\n\n\"The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, and government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in investment,\" the Bureau of Economic Analysis said.\n\nHeather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote on X that \"AI investment wasn't a big factor\" in the third quarter and instead consumption is a \"key driver,\" particularly due to spending from wealthier Americans.\n\nReal personal consumer spending rose 3.5% in the third quarter, more than the 2.5% rise in the second quarter. Imports again fell, but not by as much as in the second quarter, declining 4.7% in the third quarter and falling 29.3% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, exports rose 8.8% in the third quarter, after a 1.8% drop in the previous one.\n\nThe report was a surprise on the upside because the economy in 2025 has faced some headwinds. The effects of tariff announcements were reflected in imports, particularly in the first quarter, when real GDP declined. The fourth-quarter estimates may also be affected by the recent record-long government shutdown. The Congressional Budget Office said in late October that the shutdown likely lowered real GDP while it was ongoing and that growth \"will be temporarily higher than it would have been otherwise\" as the economy rebounds post-shutdown.\n\nThe new Bureau of Economic Analysis report follows other recent data releases that show a mixed view of the US economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently published inflation and labor market reports that showed unemployment at its highest rate since September 2021 and inflation unexpectedly cooling.\n\nMark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst, said in an email that Americans will have to wait until next year to get more clarity on the economy's performance. He added that there will also be some benefits for Americans from what President Donald Trump called his \"one big beautiful\" bill, including federal income tax refunds.\n\n\"The good news is that the outlook for growth is improving as we enter 2026, as noted also recently by the Federal Reserve,\" he said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a December press conference that the \"baseline would be solid growth next year\" due to factors like AI and consumer spending.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish an updated GDP estimate for the third quarter on January 22.\n\n\"A key question for consumers, who power the U.S. economy, is whether the job market stabilizes or even improves modestly in the months ahead,\" Hamrick said. \"If not, their resilience and the resilience of the economy will be put to the test.\"",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "description": "Tuesday's flurry of delayed data releases could fill in gaps in Wall Street's picture of the economy.",
    "fullText": "US stocks tipped higher on Tuesday after fresh data showed surprisingly strong growth in the US economy over the summer, leading investors to trim bets on near-term interest-rate cuts.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.4%, with the benchmark index vying for a fresh record close. The blue-chip benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.2%. The turn higher came after the major gauges on Monday notched their third win in a row.\n\nGold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam through Tuesday morning, adding to a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades. At the same time, copper (HG=F) crested a fresh record above $12,000 per ton.\n\nTuesday brought a last gasp of data ahead of the Christmas holiday. Wall Street got a first look at third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter. That was much higher than the 3.3% expected, a potential sign of continued economic resilience. The shutdown-delayed report also found that consumer spending remained strong over the summer.\n\nAfter the release, traders pared bets on a rate cut in January. Markets now price in over 85% odds of the Federal Reserve standing pat, up from 80% a day ago and 75% last week. That said, a plurality of wagers remain on two cuts by the end of next year.\n\nBut Tuesday morning's read on December consumer confidence from the Conference Board showed the measure declining for a fifth consecutive month, as consumers' poor economic vibes persist.\n\nWall Street stocks have rallied back in recent days, after last week's data — including a surprise drop in inflation and lukewarm look at labor market — left bets on 2026 interest-rate cuts mostly intact.\n\nOn the corporate front, Novo Nordisk's (NVO) US-listed stock jumped in premarket after the Danish drugmaker got official US approval to market its Wegovy weight-loss pill.\n\nLooking ahead, US stock markets will wrap up trading early on Wednesday and be closed all day Thursday for the Christmas holiday.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that he sees room to revise the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target and move to a range-based system instead.\n\nSpeaking on the \"All-In Podcast\" on Monday, Bessent said, “Once we are back to [2%] — which I think will be in sight — then we can have a discussion: Is it much smarter to have a range?”\n\nThe US inflation target, set in 2012 at 2%, constitutes one-half of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, driven by maintaining a long-term stable inflation mark.\n\n10-year Treasurys (^TNX) ticked up by roughly 0.2% through the first half of Tuesday, while the Intercontinental Exchange's US Dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) moved down by the same amount.\n\nBessent's comments come after a delayed release of the November Consumer Price Index showed that prices increased by 2.7% over the year prior, compared to consensus estimates of 3.1%. So-called core\" CPI — which strips out the more volatile food and energy categories — rose by 2.6% against economist estimates of 3%.\n\nShares in US mining companies with copper (HG=F) operations are rising after the metal crested $12,000 per ton for the first time ever on Tuesday morning, setting an all-time high as President Trump's tariff policies and a string of mine accidents have roiled supply chains.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia was taken nearly completely offline earlier in the year after a deadly mudslide that left several workers dead, traded up by 1.4% in the first minutes after the opening bell. Fellow mining giants BHP Group (BHP) and Teck Resources (TECK) gained 0.4% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nShares in Southern Copper (SCCO), one of the US's major copper operators, moved in the opposite direction, falling by roughly 0.4%.\n\nThe year has been strong for metals across the board. Prices on copper itself are up more than 37% year to date, while hot-rolled coil steel (HRC=F) and aluminum (ALI=F) have climbed by 32% and 17%, respectively, according to data from Trading Economics.\n\nWhile geopolitics have played a role, Trump's tariff regime has also sent copper and other metals prices soaring, dragging mining stocks along with it.\n\nWhen Trump announced plans in July to impose tariffs on copper, traders rushed to move physical copper stores out of warehouses overseas and back into the US to avoid these duties, which sent prices soaring. When the administration clarified that these tariffs would not apply to raw copper ore, prices came back down.\n\nUnder current policy, semi-finished products and copper-intensive goods, such as wiring or tubes, are covered under an identical 50% tariff, although raw copper ores are excluded. Imports of both steel and aluminum are currently subject to a 50% tariff.\n\nUS consumers remained pessimistic about the current state of the economy at the start of December, according to data from the Conference Board.\n\nThe Conference Board's consumer confidence reading dropped 3.8 points to 89.1 in December from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9, marking the fifth month in a row that consumer confidence weakened.\n\nConsumers' views on current business conditions were negative for the first time since September 2024, the report said. Survey respondents cited ongoing concerns, such as inflation, tariffs, and politics, although other topics, including immigration, war, and personal finance, also became more salient.\n\nAt the same time, consumers' expectations for inflation 12 months from now retreated after increasing in November. Consumers also had the most positive view of where stock prices are headed a year from now since January.\n\nOverall, households reported feeling mildly negative about their family's current financial situation, but turned slightly more optimistic about future conditions. Many reported putting off big-ticket purchases, as Americans reported spending more on necessities and cheap thrills than on expensive discretionary items.\n\nCloud software maker ServiceNow (NOW) has reached an agreement to acquire the cybersecurity company Armis in a $7.75 billion deal, the company announced Tuesday morning.\n\nThe transaction, an all-cash deal that ServiceNow said it will finance with both cash on hand and debt, will be ServiceNow's largest acquisition to date, according to Bloomberg. Shares in ServiceNow fell by roughly 2.6% after the announcement.\n\nThe acquisition is intended to broaden ServiceNow's cybersecurity offerings in its cloud products, the company said in its press release. Armis' security offerings will allow enterprise customers in industries with \"cyber-physical\" assets, such as healthcare and manufacturing, to get a more real-time assessment of potential threats, ServiceNow said.\n\n\"In the agentic AI era, intelligent trust and governance that span any cloud, any asset, any AI system, and any device are non-negotiable if companies want to scale AI for the long-term,\" ServiceNow president, COO, and chief product officer Amit Zavery said.\n\n\"Together with Armis, we will deliver an industry-defining strategic cybersecurity shield for real-time, end-to-end proactive protection across all technology estates.\"\n\nUS stocks opened Tuesday's trading on unstable footing after GDP data showed stronger-than-expected growth in the US economy through the summer, leading investors to pull back from bets on near-term cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by roughly 0.2% in the most volatile move of the morning, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by less than 0.1% each following the third win in a row for US stocks to start the week.\n\nCopper (HG=F) set a fresh record on Tuesday morning, crossing $12,000 per ton for the first time, while gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam, adding onto a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades.\n\nBefore the opening bell on Tuesday, investors got a reading on third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter, above the expected 3.3% growth. Predictions of a rate cut at the January Federal Reserve meeting fell in the aftermath, with traders pricing in only a 13% chance.\n\nUS gross domestic product (GDP) unexpectedly accelerated in the third quarter, coming in at an annualized pace of 4.3%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Tuesday.\n\nEconomists had expected the initial reading of annualized growth to slow to a 3% pace from last quarter's 3.8% reading, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe reading showed resilience in consumer spending and exports, though investments decreased, the BEA said. Imports, which are subtracted from the calculation of GDP, also declined.\n\nEconomists have noted that the economy has looked increasingly K-shaped, with higher-income households propping up spending while lower-income households become more financially stressed.\n\nThe advance GDP reading was originally scheduled to be released on Oct. 30, with a second estimate scheduled for Nov. 26, but the data was delayed due to the government shutdown.\n\nTom Hale, the CEO of Oura, which makes the popular health tracking ring, doesn't think a new hardware device from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) will make the Apple (AAPL) iPhone obsolete, he told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. Hale said it would have a long way to go to drive mass appeal.\n\n\"We've all had [Amazon] Alexa devices in our lives, and they're fascinating, ... but it's also kind of latent in the sort of bandwidth for information,\" Hale said in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast. \"I'm fascinated by conversations that you have with OpenAI or any of the models like Gemini. ...

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "description": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.",
    "fullText": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.\n\nSpeaking to Xi across a vast display of orchids in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, the Russian president claimed their ties were “at an unprecedentedly high level”.\n\nCertainly on the surface it appears China’s alliance with Russia has only grown stronger since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nNowhere has this been more evident than when looking at trade between the two countries, which has boomed ever since the West slapped Putin with massive sanctions.\n\nLast year, the value of trade between Russia and China hit a record $245bn (£182bn), fuelled by Xi becoming the world’s largest buyer of Putin’s oil and gas. Overall, China also became Russia’s biggest supplier of goods.\n\nHowever, closer ties with China have come at a cost.\n\nIn particular, Russian businesses have grown increasingly frustrated at a flood of cheap Chinese goods.\n\nVladimir Milov, who worked in the Russian government from 1997 to 2002 before becoming a vocal Putin critic, says the economic alliance is backfiring badly for Russia.\n\n“It is deeply disadvantageous,” he says. “China is taking advantage because it knows that Russia has nowhere to go.”\n\nSuch warnings could signal that the economic ties between the two countries are beginning to fray.\n\nWhile mutual trade hit a record high in 2024, it has fallen by nearly a tenth so far this year.\n\nOne key area of tension is cars.\n\nAfter Western manufacturers cut ties with Russia in 2022, Chinese competitors duly stepped in.\n\nIn the two years to 2024, Chinese car exports to Russia have increased sevenfold, prompting a growing number of complaints from domestic manufacturers.\n\nMaxim Sokolov, the chief executive of Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ, has accused the Chinese of “unprecedented dumping”, which he said in December has crossed “all imaginable boundaries”.\n\nSales of his company’s signature Lada car have plunged, pushing the company to slash production by nearly half and move to a four-day work week at the end of September.\n\nRussia’s largest truck manufacturer, Kamaz, also trimmed its working week in August after demand for its vehicles plunged by 60pc. At the time it blamed “excessive” imports.\n\nTo alleviate some of the criticism, the Kremlin has responded by significantly raising import fees on vehicles.\n\nSince October 2024, Russia has more than doubled the “recycling fee” that it charges on imported cars.\n\nThis charge, which is supposedly to cover the future disposal of the vehicle but functions largely as a tariff, was 667,000 roubles (£6,275) per vehicle as of January this year.\n\nThis led to Chinese car exports to Russia halving in the first six months of 2025.\n\nIn July, Russian regulators also banned truck imports from a fleet of major Chinese brands – Dongfeng, Foton, FAW and Sitrak – which they branded a “direct threat” to public safety.\n\n“These trade-related tensions will start to occur more and more as the market gets saturated with Chinese goods and uncompetitive Russian industries are not able to make their sales,” says John Kennedy, a research leader at Rand.\n\nThere are signs that Russia’s steel sector is also hurting.\n\nAndrey Gartung, chief executive of the Chelyabinsk Forging and Press Plant, warned last year: “Russian enterprises competing with Chinese ones are holding on by the skin of their teeth.”\n\nNot one to shy away, China has hit back with trade restrictions of its own.\n\nMost notably, Xi reintroduced tariffs on Russian coal in January 2024, two years after the restrictions were first lifted.\n\nThis has already hit exports to China, with Milov claiming that the levies are adding to what is the worst crisis for Russia’s coal industry since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe sector’s revenues are expected to plummet by 12pc this year alone.\n\nElsewhere, China has so far refused to lift a longstanding ban on imports of Russia’s largest agricultural exports – winter wheat and barley. Instead, it buys from Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\n\nWhat China does import from Russia, it gets incredibly cheaply because it has a monopoly as one of Russia’s only buyers, says Milov.\n\nRussia’s biggest exports to China are oil and gas, which combined make up two thirds of its trade.\n\nIgor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive, said that between January 2022 and June 2024, China’s savings from purchasing Russian oil compared to Middle Eastern exports amounted to as much as $18bn.\n\n“Taking the sanctions away, Russia is what Beijing would want every trading partner to look like,” says Gregor Sebastian, of Rhodium’s China Corporate Advisory team.\n\n“China is importing raw materials that it produces into manufactured goods that it can then resell at much higher profit margins back to Russia. That is the main bulk of the relationship.”\n\nHowever, more than anything, Russia wants new technology and investment from China. And it is not getting it.\n\nThe average annual flow of Chinese investment into Russia has plummeted from an average of $1.2bn from 2011 to $400m, says Milov.\n\nIn 2022, China dropped Russia from its Belt and Road financing programme, while in July, China’s commerce ministry “strongly advised” carmakers against investing in Russia.\n\nMany major projects that were previously announced with Chinese backing have now been scrapped or are on hold.\n\nRussia quietly disappeared from what was supposed to be a joint development of a long-haul aircraft with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.\n\nWork had already begun on the project, initially called the CR929, which stood for “China Russia”. However, the R has now been dropped, with the aircraft renamed as the C929.\n\nPlans for Chinese CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles to build a high-speed rail line between Moscow and Kazan in south-west Russia have also been paused.\n\nSeparately, there has been no progress on the development of the Tianjin oil refinery, a joint venture between Rosneft and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which was approved in 2014.\n\nAfter the meeting between Putin and Xi in September, Gazprom announced that the two countries had signed a deal to build a “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline to China.\n\nBut while this would no doubt prove to be a huge victory for Russia, China has yet to confirm the project.\n\nThis may be a sign that, for all the pomp and ceremony, the countries’ authoritarian alliance may be weaker than it appears.\n\n“Despite all these hugs and kisses at summits, China and Russia are very much far apart,” says Milov.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "description": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.\n\nHe ended up explaining how his wife organizes her lingerie drawer.\n\n“I think she steams them,” he offered at one point, hoping to underscore the violation Melania Trump felt when, in his telling, FBI agents rummaged through the pristine undergarments — “sometimes referred to as panties” — during their 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn the realm of Trump tangents, it wasn’t the wildest, or angriest, or most bizarre.\n\nYet as the president hopes to refocus the nation’s attention on his economic record ahead of next year’s critical midterm elections, it was another reminder that his own focus often remains somewhat adrift.\n\nTrump did periodically discuss the economy in his 90-minute speech, which he called a “quick little stop” in Rocky Mount on the way to Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. He trumpeted a report this week that showed inflation unexpectedly cooling. He recounted an announcement he made earlier in the day on lowering some drug prices. He framed an uptick in the unemployment rate as a success since he’d fired so many government workers.\n\nSupporters behind him held signs reading “Lower Prices” and “Bigger Paychecks.” But even the visual cues couldn’t keep the president from veering well off-piste — often to the delight of his crowd.\n\nAs he was explaining the negotiations that went into the drug pricing scheme, attendees listened politely, if quietly, as he assumed a French accent to mimic President Emmanuel Macron during their pharmaceutical negotiations.\n\nThe audience really came alive when he reminisced about his opponent from nearly a decade ago.\n\n“I don’t know, beating Hillary was fun,” he said to roars. “Remember, she was a nasty person. I was going to use a B word. I said, ‘my wife would not be happy.’”\n\nThere are plenty of Trump advisers who would prefer the president focus more on the here-and-now, or — even better — the what’s-to-come. As he loses his political edge on the economy, many of his allies worry he’s lost touch with voter concerns and anxieties that propelled him into office in the first place.\n\nFriday’s rally was the latest in a roadshow of sorts that White House advisers have planned for Trump to hone his message on bringing down prices. He also delivered a primetime address to the nation this week meant to drive the message.\n\nMuch of his argument rests on having inherited what he says was an economic disaster from Joe Biden, though inflation was at 3% when he took office and is now only slightly lower. (And economists cautioned that last month’s inflation dip had a lot to do with shutdown-related distortions of economic data.)\n\nYet as is so often the case, the intended content of Trump’s speech was a target that didn’t always find an arrow.\n\nAs he hit the hour mark, his grievance list grew, encompassing the news media and Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the onetime loyalist who has dramatically broken with him and whom Trump now calls “Marjorie Traitor Brown.”\n\nHis aside about Melania’s unmentionables came amid a diatribe over the investigations that plagued him during his time out of office. He mused about awarding himself a massive sum in connection with complaints he filed against the Justice Department.\n\n“I am suing and I’m the one that’s supposed to settle. So maybe I’ll give myself $1 billion and give it all to charity,” he said.\n\nTrump found ample distractions in the crowd, including a group of glamorous women from the western part of the state who volunteer at his events. When he spotted a hat he liked, he explained how he could gauge its value.\n\n“I want gold thread, not mustard color. You know?” he said. “When you have a mustard-colored thread, don’t accept it.”\n\nRecalling the times he came to purchase furniture in North Carolina as a hotelier, he explained the exacting nature of the task.\n\n“The arm of a chair was very important to me. I said, ‘I like that chair, but this arm has to be a different shape,’” he said. He kept going: “I’m a very aesthetic person, believe me, except with women, I don’t care what a woman looks like. I used to say beautiful. Now I don’t care.”\n\nHe spent several minutes discussing his physical health amid questions about his stamina after appearing to doze off during multiple on-camera events recently. He pointed to the string of cognitive tests he claims to have aced. And he pledged to alert the nation should he find himself in decline.\n\n“When that time comes, I will let you know about it. In fact, you’ll probably find out about it just by watching,” he said. “But that time is not now, because I feel the same that I felt for 50 years.”\n\nIt was, in the end, the same type of speech Trump has been delivering now for more than 10 years, the “weave” in which he takes great pride. It has less to do with a calculated political message than free-association of whatever’s on his mind — which is often the people or entities he thinks have done him wrong.\n\nIf some of his fixations cause heartburn among his allies, though, Trump has a different view.\n\n“I think I’m probably very neurotic,” he said in Rocky Mount. “I always say controlled neuroses is good. Being neurotic, no good. But if it’s controlled, that’s okay. It gives you some energy.”",

    "description": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.",
    "fullText": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.\n\nYesterday’s CPI report, showing inflation of 2.7 percent — well below the expected 3.1 percent — was bad political news for Democrats. Since “Liberation Day” in April, when President Trump rolled out tariffs aimed at resetting global trade in favor of U.S. companies, the left and their media allies have warned voters that the White House’s actions would clobber our economy and set inflation soaring.\n\nIt hasn’t happened. The tariffs have only modestly boosted prices. Instead, the Trump agenda of higher energy production, lower budget deficits and lighter regulation has brought inflation down. While inflation averaged 5 percent annually under former President Joe Biden, and in four years jumped by nearly 22 percent, as of November it is rising at 2.7 percent.\n\nWould you remind me again who created the “affordability crisis?”\n\nAs inflation continues to recede from the lofty 9 percent level recorded under Biden, voters may realize just how much damage was done by Joe’s budget-busting big government spending.\n\nAnother narrative that is under fire is that Trump-backed AI is a gift to billionaires but is going to destroy U.S. employment, much like the trade pacts of the 1990s that sent jobs overseas. But two new studies counter that claim. As it turns out, AI is actually creating jobs for Americans.\n\nIn its year-end note to investors, investment firm Vanguard writes that AI is not responsible for slowing job growth. They point to data showing that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nAccompanying graphs show hiring in AI-affected occupations growing at 1.7 percent during the two years mid-2023 to mid-2025, compared to only 1.0 percent pre-COVID, and compared to 0.8 percent for other kinds of jobs. Similarly, real wage growth for AI-involved hires is advancing at 3.8 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for other occupations.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest that “current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities.”",

    "description": "Bank of America was among the first to flag a \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy, defined by robust growth and above-target inflation.",
    "fullText": "The US economy will keep burning hot in 2026, extending a yearslong run of dodging a recession.\n\nThat's a view that is increasingly being woven into consensus forecasts on Wall Street, where top researchers have generally brushed off the risks of a near-term recession and are anticipating another year of stable economic growth and hot inflation.\n\nBank of America dubbed this the \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy back in September, and others have since adopted the phrase.\n\nIn its year-ahead economic outlook, BofA said it believes growth will remain strong and inflation will stay above target next year, pointing to tailwinds such as the Fed's rate cuts, AI investment, more supportive trade policy, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n\"Tariff cuts, tax cuts, rate cuts…'run-it-hot' US policy, implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail,'\" a team of analysts led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a separate client note this fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists also unveiled their \"run it hot\" investment thesis heading into 2026, pointing to the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and the central bank's recent announcement that it would begin reserve management purchases.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it also saw economic growth remaining robust in 2026, thanks to the Fed cutting rates in a non-recessionary macro environment.\n\n\"Despite stagnant job growth, we expect policy rate cuts to limit labour market weakness and help extend the economic cycle further,\" Goldman said, though it noted that valuations in the stock market are already \"hot.\"\n\nHere's how the forecasters think investors should position themselves in a \"run it hot\" market.\n\nCommodities are the top run-it-hot trade heading into next year, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note in December.\n\nOil and energy are also favorable investments under the run-it-hot regime, they added.\n\n\"Trump runs it hot, oil bounces post Russia-Ukraine fix, China keeps yuan cheap, soon all the commodity charts will look like gold,\" strategists wrote. \"We say long commodities the best 'run it hot' trade in '26, and long despised oil/energy without question the best 'run-it-hot' contrarian trade.\"\n\nCyclical assets — which, by definition, tend to do well when the economy is expanding — are likely to benefit from the macro picture next year, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank pointed to areas like housing and consumer-facing sides of the market, which include consumer discretionary and retail stocks.\n\n\"After a patch of worry in November, cyclical assets—including cyclical equities and copper—have been rallying again. But even after these recent moves, we think our more optimistic growth views are not fully reflected in markets,\" the bank wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks consumer discretionary goods investments fall into the \"run it hot\" investing playbook. The bank noted that firms generally have higher pricing power today, which should boost revenue growth.\n\nThat dynamic is already playing out in the discretionary goods sector, strategists said. The rate for top-line earnings beats in the sector for the third quarter clocked in at 6%, above the 2% rate for the overall S&P 500, per Morgan Stanley's analysis.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also look attractive, with earnings and pricing power in the sector poised to accelerate heading into next year, Morgan Stanley added.\n\n\"On the earnings front, the two most important aspects of our constructive call are the return of (1) positive operating leverage and (2) pricing power. This combination is especially impactful for the small cap earnings recovery we foresee into 2026,\" the bank's strategists added.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have also issued bullish calls on small-cap stocks heading into 2026, largely because valuations in the sector are more attractive than in areas such as mega-cap tech stocks.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters) - China on Thursday split off a Belgium-sized island with an economy comparable to a mid-sized country from the mainland for customs processing, part of a bid to join a major trans-Pacific trade deal and establish ​a new Hong Kong-style commercial hub.\n\nOfficials hope that turning the southern province of Hainan into a duty-free zone will spur foreign investment, ‌with goods that achieve at least 30% local value add able to move on into the world's second-largest economy tariff-free. Foreign firms will also be able to operate in service ‌sectors that are restricted on the mainland.\n\nChina is also seeking to boost its free-trade credentials to convince members of one of the world's largest free-trade deals, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), that it can meet the bloc's high standards for trade and investment openness through pilot projects such as the Hainan Free Trade Port.\n\n\"China aims to build the Hainan Free Trade Port into an important gateway that leads the country's opening-up into a new era,\" ⁠an editorial by the state news agency Xinhua said.\n\n\"It ‌is also expected to provide a huge boost for free trade that has been impacted by rising protectionism and unilateralism in recent years,\" the article added, in a veiled swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have pushed ‍policymakers to diversify China's $19 trillion economy from the world's top consumer market and take steps to further consolidate the manufacturing juggernaut's role in global supply chains.\n\nChina's leaders have made reversing a drop in investment a priority for next year, seeking to shift the economy from its current reliance on stimulus toward a dual focus on ​consumption and investment to stabilise growth in the near-term, while officials evaluate undertaking painful structural reforms needed to rebalance the economy long-term.\n\nForeign direct ‌investment into China fell 10.4% year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2025, official data shows.\n\nIf liberalisation succeeds in Hainan, economists say policymakers may feel emboldened to expose more of China's economy to market forces.\n\n\"The benchmark is something similar to Hong Kong,\" said Ran Guo, director for Consumer Economy at the China-Britain Business Council, who has been tracking the plan's developments for the past five years.\n\n\"In addition to boosting Hainan's tourism sector, the plan should also encourage more foreign investment and manufacturing,\" she added.",

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",
