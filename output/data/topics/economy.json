    "description": "Russia saw a surge in consumer spending after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, even as sweeping sanctions hit the economy.",
    "fullText": "After years of wartime splurging, Russian shoppers are tightening their grip on their wallets — a shift that hints at growing stress in the country's economy.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has weakened across most regions, the Central Bank of Russia said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nIn October and November, demand softened even as unemployment remained near historic lows and inflation expectations ticked higher.\n\n\"According to retailers across the country, an increasing share of products are being purchased during promotions, sales, and discounts. Household behavior has become more frugal,\" according to the central bank report.\n\nRetailers in many regions report weakening demand for big-ticket and nonessential goods, marking a clear cooling after the post-2022 consumer boom.\n\n\"More subdued consumption may indicate a gradual reduction in labor market overheating and more moderate expectations for future income dynamics,\" wrote Russia's central bank.\n\nIt's a notable shift for an economy that witnessed a boom in consumer spending after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, even amid sweeping sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThat boom was fueled by surging defense spending and intense competition for scarce workers. Wages jumped, and many households went on spending sprees.\n\nNow, that momentum appears to be fading.\n\nWage growth has slowed, and firms across multiple regions report reduced manpower demand and less urgency to hire, reflecting a cooling labor market, according to the central bank report.\n\nMany firms told the central bank they expect even more modest wage increases in 2026, suggesting that households may be bracing for leaner times.\n\nThe central bank's latest report arrives as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, and the limits of wartime economic stimulus become more apparent.\n\nOil and gas revenues — the backbone of Russia's budget — dropped 34% year-over-year in November.\n\nEven before this, analysts had warned that Russia's economy was being sustained largely by defense spending, subsidies, and emergency policy interventions.\n\nTop officials had sounded alarms. In December 2023, Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank governor, warned that the economy was at risk of overheating.\n\nLast June, the head of Russia's largest bank said the economy was \"definitely and strongly overheated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a deepening demographic crisis and ongoing competition for labor between the military and industry continue to weigh on Russia's growth prospects, both now and in the years ahead.",

    "title": "Morgan Stanley flags 4 reasons the economy is about to boom — and 3 areas of the market for investors to cash in",
    "description": "There are plenty of ominous signals out there that suggest we're late in the economic cycle. But Morgan Stanley says the worst is already behind us.",
    "fullText": "There are some ominous signals out there that suggest we're in the late stages of the economic cycle, but Morgan Stanley says investors should tune out the noise and brace for more growth ahead.\n\nADP private payrolls were negative in November. Challenger data shows layoffs at the highest levels in two decades. The unemployment rate is on the rise.\n\nBut as Morgan Stanley's equity research department sees things, the worst is already behind us.\n\nAndrew Pauker, a US equity strategist at the bank, laid out four reasons the economy — and therefore corporate earnings and the stock market — are in an \"early cycle\" environment.\n\nFirst, there has been a significant rebound in earnings revisions.\n\n\"Earnings revisions breadth for the S&P 500 troughed at negative 25% in April, it's now around positive 15%,\" Pauker told Business Insider. \"We typically only see these types of rebounds in early cycle environments. This is a clear sign to us that business confidence is improving.\"\n\nSecond, wage growth has slowed, giving profit margins room to expand. Here's the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker, showing a three-month moving average of wage growth at 4.1% year-over year. That's down from 6.7% in July 2022. Typically, this kind of decline happens during recessionary periods, Pauken said.\n\nThird, Pauker said consumer demand appears poised to accelerate. One signal for this is that companies are starting to exhibit higher pricing power, meaning they can increase prices without significantly impacting demand.\n\nAnd fourth, the Fed is cutting rates, a move intended to stimulate economic activity. After the Fed's December rate cut, Pauker and his team expect two cuts in 2026. He said the labor market will continue to show enough moderate weakness to continue to spur these cuts, but not enough weakness to throw the economy into a recessionary spiral.\n\nThe bank expects the S&P 500 to rise 14% in 2026, to 7,800, and Pauker also listed a few specific areas of the market he expects to outperform.\n\nPauker's highest conviction — and most out of consensus — call is \"overweight\" on consumer discretionary stocks after having rated them \"underweight\" for the last four years. The sector is historically cyclical, performing well during economic recoveries. It includes stocks that benefit from consumers spending on non-necessities — you might think of apparel companies like Nike or hotel firms like Marriott.\n\nSecond, and hand-in-hand with this call, is Pauker's expectations for small-caps to do well. Small-caps tend to be cyclical and benefit from falling interest rates, which they're more sensitive to than larger companies. Their margins should also get a boost from falling wage growth, Pauker said.\n\nHe pointed to rising earnings growth for the median stock in the Russell 2000, an index that tracks small-caps.\n\nThird, Pauker is bullish on the financials sector.\n\n\"The Senior Loan Officer Survey indicates that C&I loan growth is likely to improve next year, so that should benefit the banks,\" Pauker said. \"On top of that, earnings revisions, valuation and positioning are attractive for Financials.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley joins banks like HSBC, Bank of America, and JPMorgan in calling for the outperformance of cyclical stocks.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to these three areas of the market through funds like the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR), the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), and the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF).",

    "description": "The latest JOLTS report shows hiring stuck at 3.2% and quits falling again as the Fed prepares to cut rates.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zandi is worried that the labor market no longer has a buffer.\n\nSo many Americans are “already living on the financial edge,” the chief economist for Moody’s Analytics told Fortune. If they start to pull back, that’s “fodder for a recession.”\n\nThe stark assessment comes as hiring has stalled, unemployment is rising—especially for the most vulnerable workers—and layoff announcements are piling up. To Zandi, the next stage is already visible: “If we actually do see layoffs pick up,” he told Fortune, “then it certainly would be a jobs recession.”\n\nZandi reached that assessment before the government released its long-delayed JOLTS report Tuesday, but the official numbers largely confirm the pullback he has been tracking through private data. Since the summer, job openings have risen by only a few hundred thousand and remain far below the highs seen in the frenzy of the pandemic. Layoffs upticked slightly, while quit rates fell, a sign that workers are increasingly hesitant to leave their current positions. Hiring, meanwhile, has held at 3.2%, a level consistent with employers who are not actively slashing staff but are no longer expanding their workforces either: a “low hire, low fire” market.\n\nIf the cooling in the official data looks slow, the private indicators tell a sharper story. ADP’s November report found that private employers cut 32,000 jobs, the steepest decline in more than two years. Nearly all of those losses came from small businesses, which eliminated 120,000 positions. Larger employers moved in the opposite direction and kept hiring.\n\nFor Zandi, the pattern is not random. He sees it as the continuation of a break that appeared earlier in the year, when the administration escalated reciprocal tariffs.\n\n“If you look at when job growth really came to a standstill, it is back soon after Liberation Day,” he said.\n\nBecause these firms often lack the financial cushions that larger corporations can draw upon, payroll becomes the most immediate and often the only mechanism through which they can respond to rising input costs. The result, Zandi argues, is a labor market in which the earliest fractures appear among precisely the kinds of employers most sensitive to policy and price shifts. Those fractures then begin to ripple outward, first through hiring freezes and only later, if conditions worsen, through broader layoffs.\n\nSo for Zandi, if ADP offers a snapshot of the present, the data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas hints at what may lie ahead. Employers have announced 1.1 million layoffs this year, a figure surpassed only during the pandemic shock of 2020 and the depths of the Great Recession. These announcements are global, and not all will materialize as U.S. cuts, Zandi advised, yet he considers their scale meaningful because they reflect decisions made months in advance of actual separations.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump is touring swing states to defend his tariffs and sell the message that the economy is booming.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is standing by his tariffs, at least in theory.\n\nUnder the banner \"Lower Prices, Bigger Paychecks,\" Trump kicked off the first of a series of speeches to promote his economic message in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, as polls indicate the country is increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\n\"They always have a hoax,\" Trump told the crowd, referring to criticism from Democrats that his policies drove up prices. \"The new word is 'affordability.'\"\n\n\"Democrats are like, 'prices are too high.' Yeah, they're too high because they cause them to be too high,\" Trump added. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nLater, he said, \"I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"\n\nTrump, during the 90-minute speech, also reiterated that his favorite word is \"tariff\" and credited his policies for bringing in \"hundreds of billions of dollars,\" presumably for the government in tariff revenue.\n\n\"You can give up certain products,\" Trump said at one point. \"You could give up pencils. Because under the China policy, you know, every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two, you know. They don't need that many.\"\n\nDespite standing by his tariff policies, Trump has, in reality, rolled back many of his earlier tariffs, especially ones enacted on April 2.\n\nTariffs are still higher than they have been in many decades, but the original 25% tariff on every import from Mexico and Canada was walked back to exclude all items covered in the USMCA trade agreement, which includes most imports from the two neighbors. Tariffs on imports from China, once more than 100%, have been reduced to a baseline tariff of 10%, which applies to all other countries.\n\nOn top of that, in an attempt to address the price of groceries, Trump also modified and removed tariffs on a range of food products in November, such as beef, coffee, bananas, and tomatoes.\n\nOf the remaining tariffs, evidence points to an impact on the price of consumer goods.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments, and our model-based regressions confirm that these effects are statistically and economically significant.\"\n\n\"At the same time, the pass-through remains partial; only a portion of the model-predicted effect has materialized so far,\" the report added. \"This could reflect delays in price adjustments, competitive pressure limiting firms' ability to raise prices, or expectations that the tariffs may prove temporary.\"\n\nTrump's speech comes as consumer sentiment remains low. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped by a score of 50 in June 2022.\n\nEarlier on Monday, in an interview with Politico, Trump said that he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nSome Democrats have centered their pre-2026 midterm messaging on affordability, and several have explicitly blamed rising costs on Trump's tariff and trade policies. Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, with whom Trump had a meeting, also won while running primarily on making the city more affordable.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "A recent statewide ranking named the Austin-area suburb Leander as the No. 5 best city in Texas to move to for 2025, and other Austin neighbors made the list as well.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by a customer review and news platform called ConsumerAffairs, evaluated the 50 most populated Texas cities across five categories: affordability, safety, economy, health care and education, in addition to overall quality of life, to determine which cities were best to move to. Each city earned a score out of 100 possible points.\n\nLeander stood out, the analysis said, for its safety ranking — No. 1 statewide — and it also secured the No. 2 spot for its booming economy.\n\nHowever, the city’s rankings were more modest in other areas. The report ranked Leader No. 12 for health care and education, No. 32 for affordability and No. 40 for quality of life.\n\n“Leander’s origin dates back to the 1880s, when a rail line was constructed to connect Austin to Abilene,” the report said. “Nowhere among Texas’ largest cities is violent crime less common, and over the past five years, no metro area has experienced faster job growth.”\n\nThe suburb, which has a population of around 78,000, was also ranked as one of the top ten places to live by U.S. News and World Reports for 2025-2026.\n\nThe top four cities on the ConsumerAffairs list were all in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, followed by Leander and then Round Rock at No. 9.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "Influencer marketing has grown into a $24 billion industry, but trust in influencers is declining as consumers increasingly perceive many as inauthentic. Authenticity is not a fixed trait; it is co-created through interactions among influencers, brands, followers, and agencies, and hinges on five key dimensions: expertise, connectedness, integrity, originality, and transparency. When these dimensions are misaligned—such as when brands prioritize reach over relevance or influencers conceal financial motives—authenticity breaks down and trust erodes. However, when brands and influencers intentionally manage these tensions, influencer marketing can move beyond transactional exchanges to foster genuine, transformational relationships, making authenticity a vital currency in today’s creator economy.",

Yet CMOs face a paradox: Influencer marketing is booming, but trust is eroding. One study shows that while 88% of consumers say authenticity matters, nearly half believe most influencers are fake. Over a third think influencers misrepresent themselves and the products they endorse. The result is an increasingly broken influencer ecosystem: Consumers feel misled, influencers struggle to stay true to themselves, and managers don’t fully grasp how authenticity is built.",
