    "fullText": "Apparent collapse of Nvidia–OpenAI tie-up raises questions about circular funding and who will bear the cost of AI’s expansion\n\nDid the circular AI economy just wobble? Last week it was reported that a much-discussed $100bn deal – announced last September – between Nvidia and OpenAI might not be happening at all.\n\nThis was a circular arrangement through which the chipmaker would supply the ChatGPT developer with huge sums of money that would largely go towards the purchase of its own chips.\n\nIt is this type of deal that has alarmed some market watchers, who detect a whiff of the 1999-2000 dotcom bubble in these transactions.\n\nNow it seems that Nvidia was not as solid on this investment as had been widely believed, according to the Wall Street Journal. Negotiations had not progressed, with Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, privately emphasising that the deal was “non-binding” and “not finalised”. Huang appeared to confirm this in Taipei on Saturday, telling reporters that Nvidia would make a “huge” investment into OpenAI’s next funding round, but “nothing like” $100bn.\n\nA report from Reuters soon suggested that the feeling was mutual: OpenAI was “unsatisfied” with Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, it said, and seeking alternatives. Nvidia’s stock has taken a 10% hit so far this week, a flurry of headlines have ensued and both companies have stepped into damage control.\n\n“We love working with Nvidia and they make the best AI chips in the world,” wrote Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, on X. “We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time.”\n\nEven Oracle appears to be shaken: the software company, which is counting on a $300bn cloud computing deal with OpenAI, said it still expects the startup to be good for its commitment even if it does not receive the full amount from Nvidia. In total, OpenAI has committed to compute deals – the infrastructure for building and powering its AI tools – worth more than $1tn.\n\n“The Nvidia-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI,” Oracle posted on X. “We remain highly confident in OpenAI’s ability to raise funds and meet its commitments.”\n\nThat a $100bn deal between two of the most crucial players in AI appears to have evaporated over a weekend is unsettling. But there are solid business reasons behind the apparent shake-up, said Alvin Nguyen, analyst at research firm Forrester.\n\nOpenAI’s ambitious growth trajectory means it will be difficult for the company to stick with a single vendor, especially as it plans new, computationally demanding AI models, he said. “They need chips. They need as many as possible.”\n\nAs for Nvidia, its commitment to the $100bn may have been loose in the first place, even as it was widely reported. “They will not discourage people from overhyping. Why say something and immediately sucker punch your own share price?”\n\nFor a giant startup like OpenAI, manoeuvring in and out of deals – for example, with chipmakers – may just be business as usual, said Nguyen: “You know [Altman’s] background as a startup person, and you know the manoeuvres he’s doing make sense from a startup perspective.”\n\nFor Nvidia, meanwhile, AI hype is part of selling chips. “You don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Nguyen. “And so you let other people put numbers out there for you and let that drive the hype.”\n\nThe issue is, of course, that investors and other companies like Oracle may have taken widely reported $100bn commitments seriously.\n\nIn response to a query from the Guardian, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to Altman’s X post, and to remarks Huang made to CNBC on Tuesday, including: “There is no drama.”\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Our teams are actively working through details of our partnership. Nvidia technology has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”\n\nNvidia and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis is all taking place against the backdrop of a changing investment landscape for AI, where hype is giving way to realities about what aspects of the technology are actually going to earn money.\n\nWhile investors ponder whether OpenAI is going to be able to pay for a $1.4tn compute deal, reality is biting further down the AI food chain. This week has seen a massive sell-off in certain software stocks, prompted in part by the launch of a new Anthropic AI tool that can carry out a number of professional services, which has led to fears that business models exposed to competition from AI products will be disrupted .\n\nThis is the flip-side of “jagged AI”, which is the term for advanced AI tools having uneven talents, such as being good at sifting through documents but less good at solving complex maths problems. If advanced systems are good at automating legal work, then legacy companies in service industries will suffer. The losers are beginning to emerge and are being picked up by investors.\n\nAt the top of the AI pyramid the competitive effects are also biting. OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, is losing ground to competitors. Data released on Tuesday show its market share has eroded from 69% to 45% owing to the rise of Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude. OpenAI appears to have retreated from soaring talk of super-intelligence in the past months, focusing instead on profitable mundanities such as adverts and adult content.\n\nThe apparent evaporation of a $100bn deal may be of a piece with last year’s sci-fi rhetoric meeting this year’s practicalities. The question is, who might be left holding the bill?\n\n“I think there will be knock-on effects,” said Nguyen. “I mean, it’s that statement: the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”",

    "description": "BofA analysts predict this tax season will bring fresh stimulus to the economy. It could also boost these eight stock in the retail sector.",
    "fullText": "Tax season approaches, and with the promise of refunds hitting Americans' bank accounts comes potential positive impacts for the stock market.\n\nBank of America analysts think that coming tax refunds will provide fresh stimulus for the US economy in the form of both bigger refunds and smaller tax bills. The bank's analysts estimate that the total boost to GDP could amount to as much as $140 billion.\n\nSome of the value could come from the state and local tax (SALT) cap, no tax on overtime or tips, and an increased standard deduction for seniors. BofA's US Economics team estimates that these policies will boost returns by 26%, adding $1,000 per family on average.\n\nBut that's not the only positive force the bank is eyeing. According to BofA's Robert Ohmes, two areas of the stock market's wider retail sector are poised to win amid this year's lighter tax burden for US consumers.\n\nHe breaks down the categories into value and broadline stocks. Here are the winners he sees in each category.\n\nOhmes thinks value retail names will get a boost as lower and middle-income tax filers are likely to spend refund cash on consumer staples and paying down debt.\n\n\"Tax refunds in the lowest (sub $3K) refund buckets appear to support growth in discretionary purchases (general merchandise) along with growth in spending on Groceries & Gas,\" the analyst said.\n\nBroadline retail is a category that the bank associates with higher-income households. Ohmes said Costco and Walmart will benefit as high earners gravitate toward these stores and as the companies double down on same-day delivery and e-commerce ventures.\n\n\"As a result, we believe WMT & COST could see greater benefits from tax refunds in 2026 vs. LY as well as potentially higher exposure to middle- and higher-income filers who benefit from higher standard deductions for seniors and the higher state and local tax (SALT) cap,\" he noted.\n\nThe analyst added that he also expects broadline retailers to benefit from an increase in spending on consumer electronics, which could benefit other retail names like Best Buy.\n\nMany retailers saw solid gains in Tuesday's session amid a pronounced rotation out of tech stocks. Walmart jumped 3% to hit a $1 trillion valuation.",

    "description": "Chipotle plans to raise prices this year, but executives said on Tuesday that their core consumer, who makes over $100k, probably won't mind.",
    "fullText": "Chipotle Mexican Grill plans to raise menu prices by 1-2% this year — and leadership is betting that its core consumer segment, digital natives who earn over $100k, won't mind.\n\nSpeaking during Tuesday's fourth-quarter earnings call, interim CEO Scott Boatwright said Chipotle is focusing on boosting foot traffic and revenue amid weak comparable sales. To do that, they're targeting their core customer, who sits firmly at the top end of the K-shaped economy.\n\nChipotle recently conducted a \"deep dive\" of consumer research to identify the demographics and desires of its core audience and refine its strategy accordingly, Boatwright said.\n\n\"What we've learned is the guest skews younger, a little higher income, is typically a digital native, and that their grounded purpose aligns with our North Star as a brand, around clean food, clean ingredients, high protein,\" Boatwright said. \"We are the way they want to eat, and we're going to lean into that in the most meaningful way.\"\n\n\"After looking at the data last week, we learned that 60% of our core users are over $100,000 a year in average household income,\" he added. \"That gives us confidence that we can lean into that group in a more meaningful way, whether it's the solo occasion and/or group occasions to really drive meaningful transaction performance in the year.\"\n\nChipotle beat revenue estimates in 2025, its earnings report released on Tuesday showed, despite comparable restaurant sales decreasing 1.7%. The company projected its comparable sales in 2026 would be \"about flat,\" accounting for the openings of between 350 and 370 new restaurants.\n\nIn 2026, Chipotle's margins will remain \"under pressure,\" Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer said during the call, so consumers can expect pricing to increase 1-2% to narrow the gap between rising expenses and menu prices.\n\nThe broader restaurant segment is struggling with slumping sales as the K-shaped economy has upended the typical playbook for value deals and marketing campaigns. Lower-income consumers have been cutting back on spending, especially dining out, as they face rising costs across the board, while higher-income households show no signs of slowing their spending.\n\nTo draw in traffic, Chipotle recently launched its new protein snack menu, allowing customers to purchase a single taco or a side of meat (either chicken or steak) in a cup. It has also sped up the cadence of its limited-time offer releases, such as the recent promotions for chicken al pastor and red chimichurri sauce.\n\nThose promotions seem to be working, and are proof that Chipotle's core customer isn't particularly price-sensitive, Boatwright said during Tuesday's call.\n\nPrior to the protein snack menu debut, Boatwright said leadership considered whether the launch would result in a \"consumer trade-down\" effect, a common phenomenon in which price-sensitive consumers opt for a discount deal or a lower-cost menu item than they'd usually order to find better value — but \"frankly, we just didn't see it.\"\n\nInstead of becoming a cheaper alternative to their usual favorite, customers are frequently purchasing the protein side as an add-on to their typical order, which Boatwright said \"gives us confidence that the core consumer is not necessarily looking for a smaller, lower price-pointed component to the menu.\"\n\nBoatwright added that Chipotle will continue to test ideas to keep consumers coming back, including more limited-time offers and drink innovations. He also teased a \"Happier Hour\" deal specifically to re-engage younger and lower-income customers, but he added, \"I don't know if it'll be a meaningful unlock for Chipotle.\"\n\nChipotle's stock sank by more than 6% in after-hours trading.",

    "fullText": "Tehran, Iran – Iran’s economic outlook appears increasingly grim more than three weeks after the start of what became one of the most comprehensive and prolonged state-imposed internet blackouts in history, impacting a population of more than 90 million people.\n\nIranian authorities abruptly cut off all communications across the country on the night of January 8, at the height of nationwide protests that the United Nations and international human rights organisations say were suppressed with the use of deadly force.\n\nMost of Iran’s internet bandwidth, local and international phone calls and SMS text messages have been restored over recent days. But most of the country is still unable to freely connect to the global internet amid heavy filtering by the state.\n\nThe increased bandwidth allows more people to circumvent state restrictions using a variety of proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs), but solutions are often costly and temporary.\n\nLast week, Information and Communications Technology Minister Sattar Hashemi told reporters his ministry estimates that the Iranian economy suffered at least 50 trillion rials (about $33m at the current exchange rate) in damages on a daily basis during the blackout.\n\nBut the minister admitted that the true toll is likely much higher, and said that other ministers and economic officials have privately offered heftier estimates that he did not expand upon.\n\nThe government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has said the decision to fully block connectivity was taken outside of its control by the Supreme National Security Council.\n\nPezeshkian, who had made scaling back internet filtering a main campaign promise, has refrained from talking about Iran’s largest internet blackout to date, instead focusing on economic reforms and cash subsidies.\n\nThe administration has promised to offer online businesses financial support, but the losses have already been sudden, acute, and too heavy to bear for many.\n\nSimin Siami, a travel agent working in Tehran, told Al Jazeera that her company lost most of its income and had to lay off a number of employees.\n\n“Most international flights were cancelled, and there was no way to purchase tickets or compare existing flights,” she said, adding that her company was also unable to book hotels for customers, who were initially even unable to renew their passports.\n\n“Unfortunately, that limited our services to selling tickets for local flights and booking local hotels, and cancelled all our previous international tickets and bookings.”",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China has been flooding Latin American markets with low-priced exports, especially autos and e-commerce goods, as its exporters adjust to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and geopolitical moves.\n\nThe world’s second-largest economy has become a major trading partner for many Latin American nations, seeking access to their abundant natural resources and growing markets while expanding its influence in a region Trump views as America’s Backyard.\n\nChinese businesses face slow demand at home. They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates. Shein’s monthly active users in the region grew 18%.\n\nT-shirts, jackets, pants, toys, watches and furniture and more products made in China fill the stalls of street vendors in downtown Mexico City.\n\nÁngel Ramírez, manager of a downtown lamp shop, is struggling to compete.\n\n“The Chinese have invaded us in terms of merchandise,” said Ramírez, sitting behind the counter of his completely deserted store.\n\nOver the past few years the number of shops selling Chinese-made goods in Mexico City ’s downtown has more than tripled, Ramírez said, in some cases putting long-established Mexican stores out of business.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has boasted about strengthening the US economy since returning to the Oval Office. Meanwhile, millions of Americans say they're struggling to afford food, rent, and other basic necessities.\n\nGary Cohn, Trump's former chief economic advisor, said both these realities are true right now in America.\n\n\"If you look at gross domestic product, which is the overall output of the US economy, we're trending about 5% right now, which is a very high growth rate in the United States,\" Cohn said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nCohn, who is now IBM's vice chairman, also cited promising trends in inflation and unemployment rates.\n\nHowever, those numbers don't give the whole picture.\n\n\"That said, we've got an interesting economy,\" Cohn said. \"We have a massive wealth effect at the top end, and we have got hardworking Americans having a very difficult time paying their bills, and they are suffering in this economy.\"\n\nThat's why, Cohn said, the Trump administration is making affordability a key issue going forward.\n\n\"The White House is going on the offensive. The president is going to spend time out on the road talking about affordability,\" Cohn said. \"Affordability will be the issue between now and the mid-term elections.\"\n\nThe widening gap between wealthy and lower-income Americans is often described as a \"K-shaped economy.\" That's when people at the top see profound economic growth, while those at the bottom, who are more sensitive to economic shifts, face financial stress. Some economists have cautioned that a K-shaped economy portends bad days ahead.\n\n\"A silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,\" Gregory Daco, a chief economist at EY, said in a recent LinkedIn post. \"Slower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median, and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.\"\n\nThe chief economist of RSM, Joe Brusuelas, said in a recent briefing that the US would need to undergo policy shifts to reshape the economy, but that likely won't happen in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" he said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"",

    "description": "As US-Canada relations grow rocky, Canada is rethinking its economy, its alliances, and its place on the world stage under Mark Carney.",
    "fullText": "It's a best-of-times, worst-of-times scenario for Canada on the global stage.\n\nTo get the bad out of the way, its most important ally — the United States — has grown increasingly antagonistic, with renewed tariff threats and talk of annexation coming from the White House. On the upside, Canada is signaling it can stand more firmly on its own. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has identified a \"rupture\" in North American integration and is moving his country in a more self-sufficient direction — both economically and politically. There's a recognition that Canada and the US will always be deeply intertwined — Americans aren't suddenly going to stop watching \"Heated Rivalry\" or \"Schitt's Creek,\" and the Toronto Maple Leafs aren't going to stop traveling south of the border — but some level of unwinding may now be unavoidable.\n\n\"Every country has to take care of itself,\" says Tony Stillo, director of Canada Economics at Oxford Economics, \"and Canada's putting Canada first.\"\n\nIn a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Carney struck a determined, defiant tone toward the US and a decades-old rules-based international order that, in his view, is now falling apart. \"Canadians know that our old comfortable assumptions that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security — that assumption is no longer valid,\" he said. In turn, he's made the choice to take on \"the world as it is, not wait around for a world we wish it to be.\"\n\nCarney is walking a fine line. He is right that the US is no longer as reliable a partner as it once was in the economy, security, and trade. And as much as President Donald Trump has turned the divide into a chasm, the fracture has been forming for years, as both Democratic and Republican administrations in the US have taken a more protectionist stance.\n\nAt the same time, Canada can't just walk away. Exports account for a third of Canada's GDP, and more than 75% of its exports go to the US. By comparison, exports are about one-tenth of the US's GDP, and around 16% of its exports go to Canada. Many of the two countries' biggest industrial sectors, including automotives and energy, are almost irreversibly interwoven. The uncertainty emanating from the US has a big impact on Canada's economy — as the saying goes, when the US catches a cold, Canada gets the flu.\n\nThere is also a short-term impetus to keep relations amicable. The US-Mexico-Canada trade deal (formerly known as NAFTA) is up for review mid-year, and the US, thanks to its sheer size, has more leverage.\n\n\"The prime minister's in an impossible situation. It is incredibly challenging for any Canadian on the international side right now to both vigorously defend our economy and to do that without escalating an already volatile relationship,\" says Dan Kelly, the president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. \"The pope himself, I think, would struggle to find the patience to deal with the US administration right now.\"\n\nCanada is trying to reduce its reliance on the US through a series of policies aimed at growing and integrating its domestic economy. The federal government removed internal trade barriers that prevented goods and even workers from flowing between provinces. The IMF estimates that fully eliminating them would boost real Canadian GDP by 7%. Many Canadian consumers are opting to buy Canadian products where possible. Under Carney, the country established the Major Projects Office as part of a push to advance nation-building ventures and streamline regulatory approvals for ambitious programs in mining, energy, ports, and rail.\n\n\"The government isn't trying to just invest, they're trying to catalyze and incentivize private money to come in,\" Stillo says.\n\nThese are steps in the right direction, but the major projects will take years to build. This is a long-term undertaking.\n\n\"We have high-talent workers. We're the most educated in the OECD. We have real innovation in areas like AI and quantum computing, and we have natural resources — critical minerals, LNG, oil and gas — most countries would absolutely love to have,\" says Matthew Holmes, the chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \"We have all the preconditions to be an energy superpower and a major player economically, but we need to get our domestic economy fundamentals.\"\n\nKelly tells me about a third of CFIB's members, which are small- and medium-sized businesses, have started to do more business internationally in countries beyond the US, and a third are doing more internal trade. A recent business survey from the Bank of Canada found that sentiment remains \"subdued,\" though firms' overall outlook has improved slightly.\n\nPart of the problem Canada faces is that any move it makes to cultivate ties elsewhere may elicit an outsize reaction from its neighbors to the south. Just look at its recent trade negotiations with China. Carney visited China in January and subsequently announced that Canada would allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at a 6.1% tariff rate, while China agreed to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed. When Trump caught wind of it, he threatened to put 100% tariffs on Canadian goods coming into the US. Canada has tried to calm the situation, emphasizing that it's not entering a free trade agreement with China, it's just settling some preexisting disputes. The tit-for-tat also comes as Canadian oil sales in China surge, as it pushes into Asia.\n\n\"We're not running into the arms of China,\" says Julian Karaguesian, a course lecturer in McGill University's economics department. \"We're just looking to take a couple of eggs out of this basket and spread them around the world. And China's the largest economy in the world after the United States.\"\n\nCanada has trade opportunities outside the US and has set a goal to double non-US exports over the next decade. It already has a robust set of free trade agreements and is the only G7 nation to have them with all other G7 members. It's also likely looking toward India and MERCOSUR, a trade bloc in South America.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has downplayed the ongoing spat, calling it \"political noise\" coming out of the prime minister. He said Canada has the \"second-best deal in the world\" with the US, behind Mexico. Lutnick also indicated that getting too close to China could hurt Canada amid the USMCA talks set for the summer and create a \"road map\" for overhauling the entire deal. Given the constantly changing nature of the US and Canada's relationship as of late — and Trump's ever-shifting focus on a variety of issues — the possible scenarios for USMCA negotiations run the gamut, from minor adjustments to a total breakdown in talks.\n\n\"With USMCA, the gloves are going to be off,\" Karaguesian says.\n\nNone of this is to say that Canada is in sterling shape. Its economy is growing at a lackluster pace, and its labor market is doing OK, but not great. Productivity has been lagging for years. It would surely prefer the US were not so adversarial. At the same time, the country and its leaders are clear-eyed about what's happened and are laying out a plan for what's next, internationally and domestically. Holmes, from the Chamber of Commerce, says Canada has had a sort of \"it's the economy, stupid\" moment under Carney.\n\nPeter Morrow, an economist at the University of Toronto, says that Canada is doing better than was feared a year ago. \"There were a lot of concerns about dramatic levels of protectionism in the United States and all but complete collapses of manufacturing in Canada,\" he says. \"The realized tariffs have not been as dramatic as they might have been otherwise,\" he says. The effective tariff rate on Canadian goods coming into the US is still under 10%. Carney has a \"very good relationship with reality,\" Morrow says, and as much as economic nightmare scenarios haven't come to pass, the geopolitical outlook is worse than expected, given the instability of the NATO alliance and the deterioration of the global rules-based system that's been in place since World War II.\n\nMost of the economists and business people I spoke to for this story agreed that Canada coming into its own was a long time in the making. From Bush's \"you're with us or against us\" mentality post-9/11 to Obama's \"Buy America\" push to Biden's industrial policy, America has been acting like a less friendly friend for a while. Trump has taken it to an extreme, often failing to differentiate between international friend and foe. If it nudges Canada further out of America's shadow, the thinking goes, so be it. Carney's declaration that the global economy's middle powers need to band together and his suggestion that the US cannot be trusted is a sentiment he's not alone in — he's just saying it out loud.\n\n\"Carney is saying things that obviously encapsulate well how many, many countries, companies, and leaders are feeling, including many parts in many parts of the United States,\" Kelly says, adding that Carney's economic background and focus are also a plus. \"For a decade, anything economic was kind of issue number 500 on the Trudeau government's list of priorities. And now it seems very much like ensuring our economy is in high gear is the top job for the prime minister.\"\n\nOne of the main pieces of certainty Canada can have, at least in the immediate future, is that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty coming from the US. In many ways, America has become a threat actor and cause of decline. This has fostered a novel level of pro-Canadian sentiment within the country's borders and also boosted Carney's profile on the international and domestic stage — his approval rating jumped to 60% in a recent poll.\n\nThis is also landing at what's culturally a bright moment for Canada. Canada's men's hockey team is favored to win gold at the coming Winter Olympics, following up its victory in 2025's Four Nations tournament. Its women's team will likely be in contention for a medal as well. The gay hockey romance \"Heated Rivalry,\" out of Ontario, is everywhere. Tourists are turning up in Hamilton, Ontario, where the show is partially filmed, to check out some of the spots featured. The town is inviting them in.\n\n\"All these kinds of things to brand Canada's reputation as a welcoming place to everyone is not unhelpful,\" Kelly says. Especially as the US is moving in a different and much more unwelcoming direction.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "title": "I flew 9 hours in Europe's top-rated airline economy class. The food was the biggest surprise.",
    "description": "Turkish Airlines is considered the best airline in Europe. Besides a few complaints, I get the hype — and I'd actually recommend eating the food.",
    "fullText": "I've flown coach on most major European and North American carriers, and economy food rarely makes a mark. Air Canada, British Airways, and United didn't exactly impress; Finnair and Delta were better, but not memorable.\n\nMy recent Turkish Airlines flight from New York to Istanbul, though, was beyond the norm.\n\nThe airline was named Europe's best economy class in the 2025 Skytrax awards, which evaluate cabin service, seating, and catering. Despite a few complaints, I could see why.\n\nPassengers received printed menus ahead of the meal service, detailing mains and sides — including salmon — all served with real cutlery. It wasn't the usual \"chicken or pasta,\" and the food tasted as good as it looked.\n\nTurkish outsources its New York catering to the Austrian company DO & CO. While DO & CO prepares meals for multiple airlines, Turkish sets its own standards for ingredients, plating, and presentation — which helps explain why the food looked and tasted a cut above competitors.\n\nThe Boeing 787 seat was otherwise in line with competitors, with a headrest and power, though the provided headphones were scratchy. The seatback screen, however, was among the largest I've seen in economy.\n\nI also appreciated the linens and storage, and the deep recline made sleeping easier — though it comes with a trade-off: to comfortably watch TV or avoid feeling cramped, everyone needs to recline.\n\nThis isn't ideal for using the tray table for work or streaming, and it relies on everyone cooperating. While I personally don't mind, those on the \"you should not recline\" side of the viral debate may find this frustrating.\n\nHere's what the full nine-hour economy flight on Turkish was like.\n\nThe flight was operated by a Boeing 787, equipped with Turkish' most modern economy cabin. The midday departure is currently the only 787 option on the route; overnight flights still use the older 777, which has noticeably dated screens and onboard tech.\n\nI wanted to fly Turkish's most up-to-date product. You'll also find similarly modern seats on most of the airline's Airbus A350-900s.\n\nI didn't check a bag and checked in via the Turkish app, meaning I could skip the desk and head straight to security. But I noticed the check-in area had a long line that wrapped around the corner.\n\nThe desk closes 60 minutes before departure, so arriving early — or sticking to carry-on only — may save you some time.\n\nThe Turkish Business Lounge is part of the Priority Pass network, which I access through my Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card.\n\nIt was small but offered free food and drinks, including eggs, meat, muffins, yogurt, and vegetables. There were no alcoholic beverages, but it was a comfortable place to pass the time with views of the ramp.\n\nI always pay extra for an aisle on long-haul flights so I can get up without disturbing others. I chose seat 26C, the closest aisle seat to the front at that price point.\n\nEconomy is arranged in a 3-3-3 layout, and each seat has 31 inches of pitch — the space between seatbacks — and 17.4 inches of width.\n\nWhile headrests are now common across the industry, I appreciated the extra seatback compartments for organizing cables, headphones, and snacks.\n\nBefore the first meal service, the crew handed out warm towels, water, and printed menus detailing each course. Lunch, as we were departing midday, included a choice of grilled salmon or mushroom orecchiette, followed by sides and dessert.\n\nBreakfast, served about 1.5 hours before our 6:30 a.m. local arrival, was a choice between a tomato-and-cheese omelet or a waffle with blueberry purée and vanilla sauce. It's easy to see why Turkish won Skytrax's award for best economy catering.\n\nDespite my skepticism, the salmon, served with ratatouille, Caesar salad, and celeriac mousseline, was fresh and flavorful, and the portions were generous. I was full by the time I got to the carrot cake.\n\nThe waffle was fluffy and sweet, paired with fruit, cheese, and bread. Beer and wine were complimentary with lunch, and I enjoyed the Turkish beer.\n\nWhile nothing beats the bidet on Japan's All Nippon Airways, I was surprised to find both a makeup mirror and a full-size mirror in the lavatory — a convenient touch for freshening up.\n\nI don't usually recommend eating airline food if you can avoid it, but Turkish seems to have figured it out. The meals felt lighter and more satisfying than usual, similar to what I've experienced on five-star carriers like Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe main drawback is the seat recline, which may frustrate travelers who want to work and find their workspace cramped by the seat ahead of them.\n\nTurkish also doesn't have a premium economy cabin, and only a few rows have extra legroom. Taller passengers should book early to secure bulkhead seats.",

    "fullText": "TUC urges ministers to bring forward changes to protect workers amid concerns over apps such as Temper\n\nThe fashion retailer Urban Outfitters, the bed specialist Dreams and the operator of several Royal Parks cafes have been criticised for the use of the gig economy app Temper to take on staff – some of whom can end up earning below minimum wage.\n\nThe TUC is urging the government to bring forward promised reforms to protect gig economy workers amid concerns that those hired by apps such as Temper are missing out on significant employment rights including sick pay, rest breaks, holiday pay and a minimum hourly rate.\n\nIt suggested that such apps are leading to bogus self-employed roles. “We find it hard to see how roles like shop assistant can be self-employed,” the trade union body said.\n\nA year ago a number of major high street chains including Lush and Uniqlo stopped using apps such as Temper and the now defunct YoungOnes to take on freelancers, after outrage over the spread of gig economy working into the retail sector.\n\nLast week Outernet, the central London music and digital art venue – which was advertising for £13-an-hour temporary “cloakroom hosts” on Temper – said it had removed jobs from the site after being contacted by the Guardian. “This was the first time we used this site and we won’t be again,” a spokesperson said.\n\nThe continued use of Temper by retailers and coffee shops indicates that freelancing continues to spread beyond delivery workers, such as Deliveroo riders, to store staff, baristas and warehouse workers.\n\nCharges imposed by Temper to guarantee swift payment – taken up by 80% of users according to the app – mean than some workers can receive less than the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over of £12.21 an hour. Freelance workers are not guaranteed the minimum wage, unlike employees.\n\nIn recent weeks, Urban Outfitters has been advertising a number of posts paying £12.50 an hour – including a stock assistant to help with the annual stock take in Exeter and sales assistants in Gateshead and Birmingham. The latter location has 70 reviews, suggesting it is a regular user of the service.\n\nWorkers who take up the Urban Outfitter roles and wish to be paid in fewer than 14 days must pay the 2.9% fee, taking their hourly rate down to £12.14, 7p an hour below the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over.\n\nIt was a similar story at Colicci Cafe, a family-owned business that runs cafes in London’s Royal Parks including Richmond Park, wherewas offering as low as £12.50 an hour for barista shifts in recent weeks. Anyone not wishing to wait up to 30 days for payment would have to pay the Temper fee, taking their hourly rate below the legal minimum for most workers.\n\nUrban Outfitters and Colicci did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDreams has advertised a number of posts in recent weeks including two paying £12.71 an hour, one of which involves helping delivery drivers with loading and unloading deliveries to customers’ homes and another for receiving and dispatching deliveries in its warehouse until 11pm. It has also offered a delivery driver post at £15.14.\n\nHowever, those who do not wish to wait for up to 60 days to be paid must pay the 2.9% fee to Temper – reducing their pay to £12.35 and £13.68 an hour – as they must pay the fee to Temper in order to be paid shortly after their shift instead.\n\nTemper has a “Free Security” insurance scheme that covers sick pay, but this falls short of protections workers would be entitled to if they were employed. Temper workers must have worked through the app at least 10 times within the previous three months to receive sick pay, and will only receive such payments after being off for more than two weeks.\n\nStatutory sick pay for employees currently kicks in after three days and from day one from April under new rights guaranteed in the Employment Rights Act.\n\nPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Cynical bosses should not be able to exploit gaps in the law to deny workers proper pay and conditions. The historic Employment Rights Act will bring welcome new protections. But without action on bogus self-employment, bad employers will make greater use of legal loopholes and talent platforms to deny workers their rights.”\n\nTemper, which claims it is gaining 1,000 new sign-ups a week through word of mouth, said in a statement: “We fully refute the comment that Temper constitutes ‘bogus’ self-employment.”\n\nIt said workers who signed up to its site could enjoy better protections than those on zero-hours contracts, including compensation of half what they would have earned on a shift if it is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice.\n\n“Everyone who works via Temper is doing so on a self-employed basis, and this is made clear at sign-up and throughout the app (to both individuals and companies). It’s also the reality of how the platform operates, and people working via Temper: choose which shifts to apply for (or not), negotiate pay, are free to work for multiple clients and platforms and have the right to arrange a substitute to complete a shift.\n\n“We are committed to remaining fully compliant with UK employment law. If there are any changes to worker status definitions in the future, we will, of course, adapt our platform and model to remain fully compliant.\n\n“Many people value the flexibility of freelance work, and the challenge for policymakers is to balance flexibility with fairness.”\n\nTemper said it set a “floor” of £12.50 an hour, before fees, for hiring workers via its app and this would rise to £13 for all shifts from 1 February. It said applicants were free to negotiate on rates if they believed they were too low and could be taken on full time without any fees.",

    "description": "Reactions are already pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders about President Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.\n\nHere are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,\" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.\"\n\nEarlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the \"credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.\"\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that \"Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n\"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,\" Furman added. \"I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.\"\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n\"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,\" Brusuelas wrote on X.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,\" he added.\n\nRobin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh \"is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.\"\n\nHe did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.\n\n\"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,\" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Substack: \"As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House.\"\n\nKrugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had \"argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy.\"\n\n\"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,\" he added.\n\nSonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: \"Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.\"\n\nWarsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,\" said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,\" he added.\n\nHoward, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an \"outstanding choice for Fed Chair.\"\n\n\"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,\" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.",

    "description": "The global economy is more resilient than expected, but that shouldn't be taken for granted, the IMF's Kristalina Georgieva said.",
    "fullText": "The International Monetary Fund projects another year of solid global economic growth — but it's also warning not to take the continued upward trajectory for granted.\n\nThe IMF predicts that the global economy will grow 3.3% in 2026, mirroring that 3.3% growth seen in 2025, with 2027 expected to see similar gains.\n\n\"The world economy is resilient but you should not take this resilience for granted,\" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of IMF said at an event on Monday.\n\nAccording to Georgieva, there are four things that are driving up growth, and at least one is being overlooked by observers.\n\nHere's what the IMF sees pushing the world economy higher.\n\nGovernments around the world have let the private sector take the reins. With \"governments put out from running the economy where they don't belong,\" private sector strength supports growth, Georgieva said.\n\nThe economist said in remarks at Davos that governments taking a back seat allows the private sector to be \"more adaptable, more agile, and we see the benefits of it\".\n\nThe global economy's recent growth has been less tied to trade, mitigating the impacts many had feared from Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy.\n\nThe fact that effective tariff rates are below liberation day levels has meant the impact has been significantly less than initially feared.\n\nDespite trade tensions spurred by tariffs, \"we continue to trade for now,\" Georgieva says, adding, \"don't take this for granted.\"\n\nGlobal AI spending reached 1.76 trillion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $3.34 trillion in 2026, according to Gartner.\n\nThe \"massive investment in AI\" has served to boost optimism in the global economy, Georgieva said.\n\nThe IMF economist says one factor that is often forgotten when assessing global economic growth is \"the role of good policies and strong institutions.\"\n\nGeorgieva flagged the role of independent central banks, specifically, in the resilient global economy. She said tht these things are often given little attention but, and as a result, that could \"erode\" that source of strength.\n\nCentral bank independence is a key concern in the US as President Trump's administration pressures Fed chair Jerome Powell. The latest tensions have arisen from a criminal investigation by the DOJ into Powell's testimony about the Fed building renovation.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his criticism of the Fed chair, rattling markets with his threats to fire Powell over the last year.",

    "fullText": "(The Center Square) – The Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl run isn’t just a win for the team, but also a win for the Seattle economy, particularly for downtown bars, restaurants and hotels near Lumen Field.\n\nHowever, economic principles of fungibility suggest that the overall, long-term economic impact on the city may be exaggerated.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Seahawks' victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday – which advanced the team to Super Bowl LX against the New England Patriots on Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. – means a genuine, short-term economic boost to Seattle, especially the local hospitality industry.\n\nAccording to Visit Seattle, hosting National Football League playoff games – which the Seahawks did twice, being the top seed in the National Football Conference – provides a vital economic stimulus during the typically quiet winter season, with hotel occupancy often soaring more than 50% above typical January figures.\n\nThe Center Square reached out to several organizations about the Seahawks’ potential championship run and asked if a team making the Super Bowl brings localized, high-impact spending during the playoffs, noting the difference between a short-term economic boost and the more mixed long-term impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, I have absolutely no data to validate whether or not those claims may be true,” Patrick Connor, Washington state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, told The Center Square.\n\nJoey Thompson, public relations manager at Visit Seattle, had a similar take.\n\n“We won’t be able to provide any comment just yet, but we may be able to put together an estimated economic impact for hotels after the fact, when more data is available to us,” he said. “We’ll make sure to circle back!”\n\nDowntown Seattle Association President and CEO Jon Scholes said it will be a little while before any specific economic impact can be quantified.\n\n“The platform we use to measure economic impact of events has a lag time of 10-14 days, so we won’t have the NFC championship metrics for a while,” he explained.\n\nHe did point to a Tuesday morning Puget Sound Business Journal piece that includes a link to a 2025 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report with estimates of spending in the markets of last year’s Super Bowl participants, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n“For the hometowns of each team, the Chamber estimates the Kansas City metro area could see $123.3 million in spending on the big game, while the Philadelphia metro could see $346.8 million,” the report states.\n\nSeattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Joe Nguyen also referenced last year's Chamber of Commerce report and Tuesday's Puget Sound Business Journal story in touting the Seahawks' success translating into economic success for Seattle.\n\n\"Yes, this is true - a Seahawks Super Bowl appearance will likely deliver a real economic boost for Seattle! The U.S. Chamber of Commerce report from 2025 shows the Super Bowl drove hundreds of millions to more than $1 billion in spending nationwide, with increased demand for food, apparel, hospitality, and entertainment reaching cities like Seattle even when they aren’t hosting (Seattle's estimated benefit in 2025 was $224,636,077),\" he said in a statement to The Center Square.\n\n\"The Puget Sound Business Journal reports that Seattle retailers and restaurants are already seeing higher sales tied to the Seahawks playoff run, especially in merchandise and game-day traffic. Super Bowl Sunday will likely up that spending across Seattle’s retail and hospitality sectors, including in the next 12 days leading up to the game.”\n\nWhile Seattle is experiencing an economic surge during playoff games, this is most likely a temporary effect that won’t fundamentally transform the city's overall economy.\n\nWhile civic boosters and the National Football League often project high economic impact figures, research suggests the true benefit is often a fraction of those, according to researchers from North Caroline State University.\n\nThe university’s report, released earlier this month, argues that the Super Bowl's economic impact on host cities is often exaggerated, with benefits frequently falling short of promises while the NFL captures the majority of revenue. While the event drives immense commercial value, local, long-term economic gains are limited, while public costs for infrastructure and security are high.\n\nWhile the economic impact of the NFL playoffs in Seattle is often substantial, the fungibility of money suggests the total impact might be lower than advertised. Much of this spending is often diverted from other local entertainment rather than entirely new, outside money entering the economy.\n\nA Super Bowl run is about much more than money, Scholes acknowledged.\n\n“A Seahawks march to the Super Bowl just months after the Mariners made a postseason run helps generate a continued sense of optimism and community,” he said. “The civic pride extends beyond the playing field and has the potential to drive, on some level, a positive reputational jolt.”",

    "description": "A new report shows that despite popular belief that an AI crash will tank the economy, regular consumers are much more crucial for GDP growth.",
    "fullText": "Worried about the AI bubble? A new report suggests AI was not the main leg propping up the economy in 2025.\n\nMacro Research Board Partners, an economic research platform, published a report in January that contradicted the popular belief that AI is the main driver of GDP and that the \"narrowly concentrated\" and \"extremely vulnerable\" growth would tank the entire economy once it falters.\n\n\"In short, without an AI boom, there would have certainly been less GDP growth last year, but there would also be fewer imports, so that overall real growth would still have been decent,\" wrote economic strategist Prajakta Bhide, who authored the report.\n\nBhide told Business Insider that personal consumption, meaning the spending of everyday people, was still the main pillar of GDP growth in 2025, and that despite the amount of investment in AI infrastructure, a lot of high-tech equipment is imported, and imports do not contribute to GDP.\n\nThe main categories that count toward GDP are personal consumption, private domestic investment, government spending, and net exports.\n\n\"Consumers continue to be the backbone of the economy,\" Bhide told Business Insider. \"Aggregate income growth is lower than it used to be, and so is job growth, which affected consumer sentiments. But there is a divide between what consumers say they feel and what they say that they're going to do versus what they actually go and do.\"\n\nAI growth was an important secondary driver of GDP growth, the report found, but that is mostly from software investment, while the contribution of data centers is \"negligible.\"\n\n\"Although a negative shock to the optimism around AI implies a risk to GDP growth,\" Bhide wrote in the report, \"the more realistic (and smaller) estimate of AI's growth impact after adjusting for imports dispels the popular notion that the US economy would falter without it.\"\n\nBeyond the GDP, concerns about the AI bubble are also tied to the stock market and people's retirement funds. America's eight most valuable public companies, including Nvidia, Alphabet, and Apple, are all betting heavily on AI and are worth $22 trillion altogether.\n\nBusiness Insider has previously reported that historically, a pullback in consumer spending has rarely been the trigger for an economic downturn. Instead, spending typically weakens only after job losses mount and when a recession is already well underway.",

A basic economy ticket would have cost $150.\n\nThe perks of Delta Comfort include early boarding, a more cushioned seat with extra legroom, reserved overhead bin space, and more miles per dollar spent than in basic economy.\n\nDelta's Boeing 737-800 has 160 seats, including 36 Delta Comfort seats, according to Delta's website.\n\nAs a basic economy regular, I'm used to being among the last to board a flight. It was a nice change to be in boarding zone 3 because I was able to get on the plane right after the first-class passengers.\n\nDelta Comfort seats on the Boeing 737-800 are the same size as basic economy seats. I thought the seats were slightly more comfortable than the standard economy Delta seats I've booked in the past, and I appreciated having two more inches of legroom with a 34-inch seat pitch.\n\nMy seatback entertainment system had a wide variety of movies and TV shows, as well as access to YouTube Music and live TV.\n\nSince my flight was relatively short, I appreciated the search filter for movies under two hours. I stretched out in my open row of seats and watched \"17 Again\" as the sun went down.\n\nSince I was seated toward the front of the plane, I waited less than five minutes to exit after we landed. This final perk was my favorite and sealed the deal for me — Delta Comfort was totally worth the added price.\n\nI'll certainly book the upgraded economy class for future flights.\n\nCorrection: January 27, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated the added cost of the upgrade. It was $110 more than basic economy.",

    "fullText": "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-born TikTok star with the largest following on the platform, has struck a landmark commercial deal valued at approximately $900 million, marking one of the most significant monetisation moves ever by a global digital creator.\n\nThe transaction involves the partial sale of his company, Step Distinctive Limited, to Rich Sparkle Holdings, a United States-listed firm that disclosed the acquisition alongside a broader strategic partnership focused on scaling Lame’s commercial operations worldwide.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rich Sparkle, through its operating partners, will hold exclusive rights to Khaby Lame’s global commercial activities for an initial period of 36 months.\n\nThese rights cover brand partnerships, endorsements, licensing, and e-commerce ventures, signalling a shift from traditional influencer marketing to a platform-driven business model.\n\nRich Sparkle estimates that the integrated structure combining traffic, fulfilment, operations, and proprietary technology could eventually generate more than $4 billion in annual sales once fully implemented.\n\nAs part of the deal, Khaby Lame will become a controlling shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings, positioning him not just as a creative partner but as an equity stakeholder in the commercial infrastructure built around his brand.\n\n“This is not just an equity acquisition, but a revolution in the global content e-commerce model,” the company said, adding that the combination of a US-listed platform, globally recognised content IP, and supply chain expertise could unlock unprecedented shareholder value.\n\nThe rollout of the commercial strategy will initially focus on the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with execution planned over the next three years. Rich Sparkle will work with Anhui Xiaoheiyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based content commerce operator with experience in large-scale creator-led e-commerce.\n\nKhaby Lame rose to global prominence through silent, minimalist videos that humorously dismantle overly complicated life hacks. His wordless format has allowed him to transcend language barriers and build a vast, culturally diverse audience at remarkable speed.\n\nHe currently commands an estimated 360 million followers across social media platforms, making him one of the most influential digital figures in the world and a rare example of truly global creator reach.\n\nBeyond conventional commerce, the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\nRich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\nThe broader strategy also includes premium brand collaborations and co-branded intellectual property in sectors such as beauty, fragrance, and apparel, highlighting how creator influence is increasingly being transformed into long-term industrial-scale businesses.",

    "title": "I'm set to inherit my childhood home abroad. I'm not sure it will be worth the headache.",
    "description": "Parents think passing down their homes for their children to inherit is the ultimate reward. In this economy, it might not be.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katarina Polonska, a relationship scientist and coach who will be inheriting her childhood home in Slovakia. Vancouver-based Polonska, 36, said the home needs a lot of work, and it may not be worth managing renovations from abroad. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm going to be inheriting my childhood home where I was born. I love it, and it's very precious to me. But I don't have any right to it yet.\n\nIt's mostly used as a family holiday home, but ultimately when my mother passes, it's going to be given to me.\n\nMy mother owns it, and there's no plan to sell it — the value of the home isn't very high, in fairness. It's a two-bedroom, one-bathroom. It's not worth much at all; maybe $80,000 CAD. I don't think the money would go very far in Canada.\n\nAlso, selling it would require a lot of renovations. It's very old school and needs a lot of TLC, and my mother doesn't live in Slovakia, she lives in England. So from her perspective, she's thinking, \"Why would I invest 30,000 or 50,000 euros (about $35,245 or $58,742) in a property that I go to a few times a year max? What's the point?\"\n\nShe also knows it would to be really complicated to sell it from abroad, having to navigate viewings and trusting realtors and all of this stuff.\n\nThe reality is, I'm going to own this foreign property when she passes.\n\nMy husband is also waiting to inherit. His mother inherited a property in Barbados from her parents, though she never lived in Barbados.\n\nHis mother had to wait to take over the Barbados property, and by the time she took it over, it had declined a little bit and there are always complications with it.\n\nI've actually never seen it myself, but I know that there's a lot of work to be done with the house. But his mother has been holding onto it saying, \"You can inherit it and you and Kat can enjoy it.\"\n\nBut he's like, \"We don't go to Barbados enough.\" It's just more hassle having to manage and protect a property when you're not physically in the country.\n\nI think from my perspective, because I'm naive about it, I'm like, keep it, it'd be really nice to have it. But his argument is that the place isn't in the area of Barbados that I would necessarily want to go to.\n\nHe's really wary. He doesn't want to be managing the property and he would rather sell it and then distribute the money within his family.\n\nSo we both know that there's going to be this new responsibility on our heads and, candidly, I think life is difficult enough as it is.\n\nI'm not going to rent the Slovakia home out because it's from, like, the 1980s. It's not been renovated. It's ancient; the wallpaper's faded.\n\nWhile Slovakia is kind of an up-and-coming country from a tourism perspective, I don't think anyone would want to stay in this place as an Airbnb unless it was literally advertised as a historical relic: \"Come stay in this ancient old-school apartment!\"\n\nMy husband and I have talked about how we're probably going to have to renovate it. We know that at some point, we're probably going to have to take a couple of months to be there physically to renovate it. But when is that going to happen? We both work, and getting to Slovakia is like a 20-hour journey from here.\n\nI think, more realistically, we could just keep the place and treat it as a little getaway to escape to. There is really lovely nature nearby and I don't have any other properties, so there is merit psychologically to knowing that there is a place that's home, even if it is halfway across the world.\n\nWhen it comes to inheriting property, I think there needs to be more dialogue between the parent and the child of, \"What do you actually want to do?\"\n\nI think a lot of parents have this assumption that leaving a kid the property is the ultimate goal; we've made it, we've paid off the mortgage, we have this home, and now the kid gets it. Those days are kind of gone.\n\nWe don't live in a world where everyone grows up and lives in the same town or city as their parents. We live in a really global economy. People are moving, people are more transient, and the world has become smaller. It's also become a lot more expensive, and home ownership isn't what it used to be.\n\nParents need to recognize that the world we're in is very different, and Millennials are not an anxious generation for no reason. We have a lot of stresses. It makes more sense to have a dialogue with your kid around what they want.\n\nI wish parents would ask, \"What do you want? Where are you at with your life, and what kind of inheritance makes sense?\"\n\nIs it, in fact, a lump sum of cash, because maybe you're a busy entrepreneur and you don't have time to sell? Maybe you actually would prefer the parent to sell, which is annoying for the parents, but maybe the kid would prefer that.\n\nThank you for the inheritance — that's very generous. But I think quite a lot of kids would probably say it's not worth it. Either enjoy the money, mom and dad, or cash out, downsize, and just give us a down payment or something.",

    "description": "Hisham Alrayes, CEO of GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models to spread AI's gains across its economy.",
    "fullText": "Open source — that might be the clearest signal of how China wants artificial intelligence to reshape its economy.\n\nHisham Alrayes, the group CEO of Bahrain-based GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models and broad deployment to spread AI's gains across the economy, instead of funneling them to a few tech giants.\n\nSpeaking at a Davos panel on China's \"AI+ Economy\" strategy on Wednesday, Alrayes said the country's approach reflects a fundamentally different economic philosophy.\n\n\"You look at the open structure of the China AI philosophy — then you have the non-open structure,\" Alrayes said. \"That signals that the benefit they want to see is to trickle down into the economy, into the companies.\"\n\nChina's most prominent AI breakout, DeepSeek, reflects that philosophy.\n\nIt mostly uses open-source models that have drawn global attention, in contrast to many large US language models that remain closed and proprietary, reaping the benefits of tightly controlled commercial ecosystems.\n\nMeta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, has said that a key reason behind DeepSeek's success is its open-source model, which, he said, can outperform proprietary models in terms of efficiency and innovation by building on shared research.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said that China's open-source AI models could gain an edge globally because they're free, making them more attractive than costly proprietary US systems for governments and countries that can't afford closed models.\n\nSimilarly, Alrayes said, China — in pursuing the open model — is aiming for affordability and scale.\n\n\"It's not the benefit of that company, of that product, the return of that individual. It's not an individual — it's an economy,\" Alrayes said.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in China's national \"AI Plus\" action plan, which prioritizes diffusion, said fellow panelist Gong Ke, executive director of the Chinese Institute for New Generation AI Development Strategies at Nankai University.\n\nThe policy, he said, focuses on embedding AI across manufacturing, healthcare, finance, education, and other sectors, rather than on breakthroughs such as artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe added that the plan sets explicit adoption targets, with AI agents and intelligent terminals expected to reach 70% penetration by 2027 and 90% by 2030.\n\nAlrayes said China's open-source tilt ultimately reflects a broader goal: making AI an economic utility rather than a profit center for a small group of companies.\n\n\"China is looking to create value throughout the economy, very clear, with very specific objectives across the economy,\" he said. \"Not just as a benefit to those companies. This is the difference in the philosophy.\"",

    "title": "Supreme Court justices expressed frustration with 'hurried' Trump administration handling of Lisa Cook case",
    "description": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump's efforts to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. The case has broad implications for the economy.",
    "fullText": "Eight of the nine Supreme Court justices expressed wariness with what Justice Samuel Alito described as a \"hurried\" attempt from the Trump administration to oust Lisa Cook from her position as a Federal Reserve board governor — and then to rush her case to the high court when lower courts allowed her to keep her post.\n\nSeveral members of the Republican-appointed majority also expressed sharp disagreement with the Trump administration's claim that judges lack the authority to review a president's power to fire members from the Federal Reserve board.\n\n\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, told Solicitor General John Sauer.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could have broad ramifications for Federal Reserve independence, a cornerstone of American monetary policy and the status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nThe hearing comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into his handling of the Fed's office renovations. Powell has said the investigation is a \"pretext\" for an attempt to pressure the central bank for political reasons.\n\nPowell attended Wednesday's oral arguments, along with Cook and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve's board of governors can only be removed for \"cause.\" Trump attempted to fire Cook in August, alleging she had lied on mortgage paperwork and therefore could not be trusted with her role in the Fed, which sets interest rates that influence mortgage lending rates.\n\nCook — an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose Federal Reserve board term ends in 2038 — argued that Trump's real intent was to replace her with an appointee who would more quickly drive down interest rates. Trump did not give Cook an opportunity to explain the apparent discrepancies in her mortgage paperwork before he posted the letter firing her on his Truth Social account.\n\nWednesday's oral argument didn't concern the merits of Trump's allegations about Cook's mortgage paperwork, but whether the judicial branch had the power to ensure Cook could keep her job while additional litigation plays out.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts — in a sentiment echoed by every other member of the Supreme Court except for Justice Clarence Thomas — expressed skepticism at the idea that the judicial branch couldn't have a role in checking the legitimacy of a \"for cause\" firing.\n\n\"If there is any level of cause — and you indicate that there is some level of cause, right? — well, then you can't be right about the idea that a court can't order anybody who's been removed to be reinstated,\" Roberts told Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh, while pressing Sauer, suggested that the Trump administration's position effectively erased the distinction between \"for cause\" and \"at-will\" firing — a notion that all of the Democratic appointees on the court also appeared to agree with.\n\nThe Trump administration's position may open the door for a Democratic president to fire all of Trump's Federal Reserve board appointees using \"trivial or inconsequential or old allegations,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"It incentivizes kind of the 'search-and-destroy and find something, and just put that on a piece of paper — no judicial review, no process, nothing, you're done,'\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nAlito asked about why Cook had to be fired and the lawsuit against her handled in a \"cursory manner.\" He asked Sauer whether Cook's mortgage application had even been entered into evidence in the case.\n\nSauer said he wasn't sure if the paperwork itself had been seen by the district court judge who allowed Cook to keep her job, but that screenshots of the text of her mortgage application were included in social media posts.\n\n\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody — by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit — in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked. \"You began by laying out what you claim to be the factual basis for the for cause removal, but no court has ever explored those facts.\"\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, expressed anxiety about whether removing Cook could risk a recession, as economists have warned.\n\nShe wondered whether a dispute over mortgage paperwork was severe enough grounds to fire Cook, and why Trump didn't make an effort to give her the opportunity to respond to his allegations.\n\n\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt room where the president provides Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, gives her a chance to defend herself,\" Barrett said. \"I mean, that just wouldn't be that big a deal.\"\n\nAfter Sauer finished addressing the justices' questions, Cook's lawyer Paul Clement took the podium. He said Sauer's approach effectively erased the \"for cause\" standard required for firing members of the Fed.\n\n\"If there's no judicial review, then this is all kind of a joke,\" Clement said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

It also introduced a guarantee plan totalling 500 ⁠billion yuan ($71.83 billion) over two years for private ​investment.\n\nZhou Chen, an official at the NDRC, said the ​government would continue to use trade-in subsidies to support consumption of goods like electric vehicles, but its focus was shifting toward services.\n\nOfficials say services, ‍including elderly care, healthcare ⁠and leisure, offer substantial room for growth.\n\n\"The services sector has now become a key focus in efforts to expand domestic demand,\" Zhou said.\n\nIn December, China deployed 62.5 ⁠billion yuan ($8.98 billion) in special treasury bond funds to support its 2026 consumer trade-in scheme for appliances ‌and new-energy vehicles.\n\n($1 = 6.9606 Chinese yuan renminbi)",

Despite an economy comparable in size to that of the United States, Europe invests only a fraction as much in venture-backed firms, and the gap is widening as capital concentrates around AI and other winner-take-all technologies. The consequences are visible in lower innovation, weaker returns for investors, and a steady outflow of entrepreneurial talent. But Europe’s venture deficit is not inevitable.

    "description": "President Donald Trump wrapped up his first year in his second term. Here's how inflation, the job market, tariffs, and spending have evolved.",
    "fullText": "The US experienced the smallest job growth outside a recession since 2003 last year, adding just 584,000 jobs.\n\nDraho said overall policy uncertainty, tariffs, immigration, and fears of a recession from months ago have been factors.\n\n\"It's made companies a little more reluctant to invest, to hire, if you're not sure how much of an overall economic drag that tariffs would have,\" Draho said about overall uncertainty. \"So even if your company may not be directly affected by tariffs, just the uncertainty of how this could play out would be a bit of a negative.\"\n\nEconomists and job-market experts have said that the slower job market is unsustainable. Renter said it could affect consumer spending if it doesn't reverse course.\n\n\"How we feel about our income plays a big role in how we spend, and I think the longer this uncertainty and the longer this labor market chill sort of sits over us, the more that a greater number of households are going to start tightening their purse strings,\" Renter said.\n\nGregory Daco, the chief economist at EY, said the economy is showing resilience despite a jobless expansion.\n\n\"That's been really the key defining factor of the US economy in the face of a number of cross-currents, from significant shifts in trade policy and tariffs to industrial policy, to significant shifts in immigration dynamics, to now an AI-led technological revolution,\" he said.\n\nReal GDP grew in the second and third quarters of 2025 after falling in the first, as businesses prepared for new tariffs.\n\nWhile economic growth has been strong, Daco thinks a jobless boom will continue because an aging population and a drop in net migration are affecting the supply of workers at the same time as less demand for new workers.\n\n\"Businesses are very cautious as to who they hire and at what rate they hire because they don't necessarily need as much talent as they did a year or two years ago,\" Daco said.\n\nOne of the Trump administration's goals was to increase efficiency within the federal government. That led to several actions to shrink the workforce, including reduction-in-force and buyouts led by the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data showed a massive drop in federal employment in October because people who had taken deferred resignations officially came off the government payrolls.\n\nCameron Hilaker, an AFGE Local 1534 member, was an emergency manager for US Agency for International Development before being laid off last spring. He is still looking for work and has become a stay-at-home dad. Without his government paycheck, Hilaker and his wife can't comfortably afford childcare for their new baby.\n\n\"We were fully unprepared for this,\" Hilaker said. \"All of a sudden, I am at home with my son because we're not paying daycare. We can't afford another $2,500 a month expense. Budgets are tight.\"\n\nThe manufacturing sector continued its trend of job losses or weak job growth that had been underway before Trump took office.\n\n\"Part of the justification for tariffs was bringing manufacturing back to the US,\" Renter said, adding it would be costly and could take years to do that, \"if even possible.\"\n\nShe added that tariffs have likely had a negative effect on the sector, with manufacturing firms that rely on imports taking a hit.\n\n\"The Fed's industrial production measure is now at its highest level since 2019, clearly reversing its Biden era decline,\" Desai said. \"Meanwhile, core capital goods shipments have hit an all-time high under President Trump, signaling strong investment into future manufacturing production and jobs.\"\n\nA blog post from the St. Louis Fed showed that the effective import tariff rate and tariff revenue as a share of gross domestic product have spiked.\n\n\"Both rates jumped noticeably in 2018 during the first trade war, more or less doubling by 2022,\" the blog post said.\n\nThere has been a lot of back-and-forth on tariffs. The administration has announced tariffs on different goods, including some wines, cars, and furniture. Some tariffs are no longer in effect or pushed back — tariffs on coffee, spices, beef, and more were stopped in November. The Supreme Court is also expected to rule on the legality of many of the tariffs soon.\n\nThe inflation rate has cooled down a lot since it surged to about 9% in 2022, but it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. In 2025, it slowed in the first few months before speeding up and then holding steady in December.\n\nDraho said the inflation rate climbed higher than expected, with tariffs having a small effect.\n\n\"I knew retailers and producers would be reluctant to pass along cost increases to consumers. I didn't imagine that they would be able to hold the line for quite so long,\" Renter said.\n\nRenter believes tariffs will continue to affect inflation because they are affecting a variety of items, so their effect is trickling in instead of causing a one-time increase in prices. \"It's tough, really, to know how much of the spikes in price growth can be attributed to tariffs and how much might be attributed to other issues like supply chain issues, demand-driven issues, which makes monetary policy a little more difficult,\" she said.\n\nDespite economic uncertainty, spending has been strong. However, like much else in the economy, consumer spending has taken on a \"K-shape,\" where wealthier people are spending big while lower-income Americans are cutting back. Draho said this is likely more of a structural pattern that existed before Trump's term.\n\n\"Much of the robust spending that we've seen over the past year has been driven primarily by people with assets and people with high incomes,\" Renter said. \"If you're invested in the stock market, you're probably doing pretty well right now. If you own your home, and especially if you have owned your home for more than a handful of years, you're probably feeling pretty secure right now. And I think the bulk of the spending has been coming from these groups of people.\"",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood is making another bold call on the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nIn a 2026 outlook letter published on Jan. 15, the ARK Invest founder and CEO says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying U.S. economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" she said.\n\nWood said post-Covid high interest rates squeezed the economy, hitting housing, manufacturing, and non-AI investment. But she is optimistic that easing rates and rising productivity could release growth potential.\n\nWood wrote in a post on X (the former Twitter) that the next three years could look like “Reaganomics on steroids,” which she believes could lead to “another golden age” for the U.S. stock market.\n\n\"Early in my career, I remember how deregulation, tax cuts, sound monetary policy, and peace through strength sent the dollar soaring, which put a lid on the gold price,\" she explained.\n\nIn the Reagan era, a mix of those forces helped the market enter a long bull that ran through much of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"The Trump Administration’s policies are echoing the early days of Reaganomics in the 1980s, when the dollar nearly doubled,\" Wood said.\n\nWood focuses on emerging high-tech companies in areas including artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics.\n\nShe gained a reputation after the Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. In 2025, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP): 5.29%\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD): 4.06%\n\nBeam Therapeutics (BEAM): 3.79%\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR): 3.57%\n\nWood’s style brings sweet wins in rising markets but also painful losses in bearish ones, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term results. As of Jan. 16, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -10.31%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 14.66% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.",

    "description": "The CEO of a digital economy think tank said relying on identical AI tools can erode competitive edge and weaken firms' independence.",
    "fullText": "As companies rush to adopt AI to boost productivity and cut costs, they may be setting themselves up for a new problem: losing what makes them different.\n\nMehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, said widespread reliance on the same AI tools risks flattening competitive advantage across industries, because firms increasingly rely on identical systems to think, write, and decide for them.\n\nParyavi said that as AI tools become cheaper, more powerful, and more widely deployed, companies risk outsourcing the very thinking that once differentiated them.\n\nWhile AI can boost efficiency in the short term, he said, relying on shared models and standardized systems could leave businesses competing on cost and speed alone — eroding originality, strategic depth, and long-term advantage.\n\n\"If you and your competitor are all using the same service, you have no edge over each other,\" Paryavi told Business Insider.\n\n\"Their AI and your AI against each other — I don't know who's going to win.\"\n\nAs generative AI becomes embedded across workplaces, Paryavi warned that the biggest risk isn't automation — it's uniformity.\n\nWhen companies rely on the same large language models trained on the same data, decision-making, writing, and problem-solving can start to converge, shrinking the space for creative divergence.\n\nThat concern echoes warnings from researchers and academics who say AI can produce polished output at scale, but also flips human thinking by delivering fluent answers before understanding, creating an illusion of expertise that weakens judgment and depth.\n\nWhen everyone relies on the same models trained on the same data, Paryavi said, creative divergence shrinks.\n\n\"The beauty of our world is that we have different choices because we think differently,\" he said. \"That's where innovation comes from.\"\n\nIt's not just a question of companies all thinking the same — Paryavi warned that treating AI as a shortcut to efficiency can quietly hollow out human judgment, expertise, and control, leaving businesses faster in the short term but more fragile over time.\n\nOver time, Paryavi said, that shift can erode internal expertise and decision-making capacity.\n\n\"What they don't think about is that initially it might sound more efficient and more productive and cheaper,\" he said. \"But this is going to be very expensive down the line.\"\n\nOne risk, Paryavi said, is dependency. As firms replace employees with AI subscriptions, they become increasingly reliant on external vendors to function effectively.\n\nParyavi compared the AI boom to the early 2000s rush to cloud computing, when many companies initially adopted third-party infrastructure but later repatriated workloads in-house as costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in became concerns — a trend commonly referred to in tech as cloud repatriation.\n\nThe same dynamic could play out with AI, Paryavi said — except with even higher stakes. As companies downsize human teams, they also lose institutional knowledge and the ability to operate without automation, he said.\n\n\"You've killed all your chances of ever becoming independent as an organization,\" he said. \"You've fired your manpower. You've made them no good.\"\n\nAI, he said, is not inherently harmful. In fields such as medicine, scientific research, and disaster prediction, it can significantly accelerate progress.\n\nBut without clear guardrails, companies risk trading long-term resilience for short-term speed.\n\n\"It's a very powerful tool,\" Paryavi said, comparing AI to an atomic bomb. \"If that [an atomic bomb] can eliminate an entire population physically, this [AI] can eliminate humanity cognitively.\"",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic.\n\nHarsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran’s ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country’s theocracy.\n\nThere have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the death toll, at 2,797. The number continues to rise.\n\nIran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.”\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran.\n\nKhatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump’s soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.”\n\n“They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. “Americans and Zionists should not expect peace.”\n\nHis fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nPeskov said “the situation in the region is quite tense, and the president is continuing his efforts to help de-escalate it.”\n\nRussia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month.\n\nExiled Iranian royal calls for fight to continue\n\nDays after Trump pledged “help is on its way” for the protesters, both the demonstrations and the prospect of imminent U.S. retaliation appeared to have receded. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had raised concerns with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nYet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance.\n\n“I believe the president is a man of his word,\" Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that \"regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“\n\nDespite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall.\n\nIran and the U.S. traded angry accusations Thursday at a session of the United Nations Security Council, with U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz saying that Trump “has made it clear that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter.”\n\nGholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., blasted the U.S. for what he said was American “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”\n\nIran authorities list protest damage\n\nKhatami, the hard-line cleric, also provided the first overall statistics on damage from the protests, claiming 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other holy places had sustained damage. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government.\n\nHe said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulance, 71 fire department vehicles and another 50 emergency vehicles also sustained damage.\n\nEven as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAmid the continuing internet shutdown, some Iranians crossed borders to communicate with the outside world. At a border crossing in Turkey’s eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout.\n\n“I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns.\n\nAlso crossing the border were some Turkish citizens escaping the unrest in Iran.\n\nMehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey.\n\nAlthough he did not venture into the streets, Önder said he heard heavy gunfire.\n\n“I understand guns, because I served in the military in the southeast of Turkey,” he said. “The guns they were firing were not simple weapons. They were machine-guns.”\n\nIn a sign of the conflict’s potential to spill over borders, a Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s crackdown on protests.\n\nA representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran.\n\nThe death toll of at least 2,797, provided by the Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.\n\nThe agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. Iran's government has not provided casualty figures.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press journalist Serra Yedikardes contributed to this story from Kapikoy Border Crossing, Turkey.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s second term has been eventful. You wouldn’t know it from his approval numbers.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from January found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s performance as president. That’s virtually unchanged from March 2025, shortly after he took office for the second time.\n\nThe new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research does show subtle signs of vulnerability for the Republican president. Trump hasn’t convinced Americans that the economy is in good shape, and many question whether he has the right priorities when he’s increasingly focused on foreign intervention. His approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has also slipped since he took office.\n\nHere’s how Americans’ views of Trump have — and haven’t — changed over the past year, according to AP-NORC polling.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 Americans consistently approved of Trump's performance\n\nCall it a gift or a curse — for all his unpredictability, Trump's approval numbers just don't change very much.\n\nThis was largely the case during his first term in office, too. Early in his first term, 42% of Americans approved of how he was handling the presidency. There were some ups and downs over the ensuing years, but he left office with almost the same approval.\n\nThat level of consistency on presidential approval numbers could be the new normal for U.S. politics — or it could be unique to Trump. Gallup polling since the 1950s shows that presidential approval ratings have grown less variable over time. But President Joe Biden had a slightly different experience. Biden, a Democrat, entered the White House with higher approval numbers than Trump has ever received, but those fell rapidly during his first two years in office, then stayed low for the remainder of his term.\n\nMost Americans have held a critical view of Trump throughout his time in office, and Americans are twice as likely to say he's focused on the wrong priorities than the right ones. About half of U.S. adults say he’s mostly focusing on the wrong priorities one year into his second term, and approximately 2 in 10 say he’s mostly focused on the right priorities. Another 2 in 10, roughly, say it’s been about an even mix, and 14% say they don't have an opinion.\n\nThe economy has haunted Trump in his first year back in the White House, despite his insistence that “the Trump economic boom has officially begun.”\n\nJust 37% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling the economy. That’s up slightly from 31% in December — which marked a low point for Trump — but Trump started out with low approval on this issue, which doesn’t give him a lot of room for error.\n\nThe economy is a new problem for Trump. His approval rating on this issue in his first term fluctuated, but it was typically higher. Close to half of Americans approved of Trump’s economic approach for much of his first White House stint, and he’s struggled to adjust to this as a weak point. Americans care a lot more about costs than they did in Trump’s first term, and, like Biden, he’s persistently asserted that the U.S. economy is not a problem while the vast majority describe it as “poor.”\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults say Trump has done more to hurt the cost of living in his second term, while only about 2 in 10 say he’s done more to help. About one-quarter say he hasn't made an impact.\n\nViews of Trump’s handling of immigration have declined\n\nWhen Trump entered office, immigration was among his strongest issues. It’s since faded, a troubling sign for Trump, who campaigned on both economic prosperity and crackdowns to illegal immigration.\n\nJust 38% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, down from 49% in March. The poll was conducted Jan. 8-11, shortly after the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.\n\nBut there are signs that Americans still give Trump some leeway on immigration issues. About half of U.S. adults say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, which is unchanged since April, despite an immigration crackdown that spread to cities across the U.S. in the second half of the year.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, say Trump has helped immigration and border security “a lot” or “a little” in his second term. This is an area where Democrats are more willing to give Trump some credit. About 2 in 10 Democrats say Trump has helped on this issue, higher than the share of Democrats who say he's helped on costs or job creation.\n\nAs Trump turns to foreign policy, most Americans disapprove of his approach\n\nTrump has focused his attention more on foreign policy in his second term, and polling shows most Americans disapprove of his approach.\n\nBut much like Trump's overall approval, views of his handling of foreign policy have changed little in his second term, despite wide-ranging actions including his push to control Greenland and the recent military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of foreign policy, and most Americans, 56%, say Trump has “gone too far” in using the U.S. military to intervene in other countries.\n\nTrump’s continued focus on global issues could be a liability given its sharp contrast with the “America First” platform he ran on and Americans’ growing concern with costs at home. But it could also be hard to shift views on the issue — even if Trump takes more dramatic action in the coming months.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,203 adults was conducted Jan. 8-11 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

    "fullText": "Russia could be staring down a painful financial reckoning in Venezuela after the US military operation on January 3 threw into doubt years of strategic investment and cooperation between Moscow and Caracas, according to a think tank analyst.\n\n\"Russian investments in Venezuela's oil industry over the last twenty years will now have to be, formally or informally, written off,\" wrote Stephen Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a post on Wednesday.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, added Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union at the State Department.\n\n\"The overall market appeal of such arms has clearly been diminished,\" following the US's military operation, he wrote.\n\nSome $2 billion to $3 billion in annual trade between Russia and Venezuela could also \"cease altogether,\" he added.\n\nThose concrete economic losses contrast with more intangible political upsides for Moscow in a shifting global order, he added.\n\n\"The Trump administration's emphasis on preserving a US sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere could also seem to validate Russia's claims for a similar sphere in its own neighborhood,\" Sestanovich wrote.\n\nThe developments come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy, as its war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year next month.\n\nSweeping Western sanctions and depressed oil prices are squeezing Russia's revenues, putting pressure on the funds Moscow uses to sustain the war effort and support the broader economy.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented publicly on the US's operation in Venezuela. The Russian foreign ​ministry has called for deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's release and for dialogue between the US and Venezuela.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian state-owned oil company Roszarubezhneft sought to draw a line around its oil holdings in Venezuela. The company said earlier this week that all its assets in the South American country are \"owned by the Russian state.\"",

    "description": "Citi's CFO Mark Mason said Trump's proposed credit card cap would have a 'deleterious' impact on the economy.",
    "fullText": "Citi's top executives warned that President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates could have dire consequences.\n\n\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly,\" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a call with reporters ahead of the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"At the end of the day, I think an interest rate cap would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most, and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy.\"\n\nMason said multiple times that he did not want to speculate on the impact of the potential cap, given the limited available information. He said that Citi would work with the Trump administration to address the \"important issue\" of affordability.\n\nReporters asked Mason about the cap multiple times, and he repeatedly said it would likely not help customers most in need, as is Trump's stated intention. He said later in the call that, again, it would have a \"very negative impact on the economy.\"\n\nOn the bank's earnings call, CEO Jane Fraser said that \"a rate cap is not something that we can support\" when asked about the news that Bilt Rewards is releasing three cards with interest rates capped at 10%, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\"To be clear, the impact to us and other banks would just be dwarfed by the severe impact on access to credit and on consumer spending across the country. These things just don't work out as intended,\" Fraser continued.\n\nMuch like Mason did on an earlier call, Fraser acknowledged the importance of affordability and said she's keen to collaborate with the administration.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump said he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates. He argued that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. A cap would have to be approved by Congress, and similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nOther bank leaders, including JPMorgan's CFO, Jeremy Barnum, have warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; however, others in the financial sector have applauded the plan.\n\nCiti's profits fell 13% in the fourth quarter, to $2.47 billion, brought down partly by the sale of its operations in Russia, the bank said in an earnings report.\n\nThe bank saw an 84% surge in financial advisory fees in the fourth quarter. The investment banking unit has been reenergized under its new head, JPMorgan veteran Viswas Raghavan. Investment banking revenues increased by 38%, the bank said, and investment banking fees rose 35%.\n\nCiti said that its \"Transformation\" — a years-long effort to modernize the bank and cut costs— is more than 80% complete, as stated in its earnings presentation. Fraser's attempted turnaround has included layoffs, new hires, and multibillion-dollar investments.",

    "fullText": "Analysts have flagged the risk of an oil price shock as geopolitical tensions escalate.\n\nOil prices have climbed 10% in the last week amid tensions between the US and Venezuela and unrest in Iran.\n\nHigher oil prices could stoke inflation and lead stocks and bonds to sell off, one economist said.\n\nSoaring oil prices. Hot inflation. Turmoil in markets.\n\nThat was a dire combination the US economy saw in the 1970s, but analysts say that the risks of another oil price shock — a situation where oil prices abruptly surge and set off a domino effect of negative consequences in markets and the economy —are on the rise as geopolitical conflict escalates.\n\nOil prices spiked in recent weeks as the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and threatened to take military action in Iran — two of the world's largest crude producers.\n\nMarch contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 10% in the last week, and jumped by as much as 3% to trade above $65 a barrel on Tuesday. It's the highest price for Brent since November.\n\nShould Brent oil hit $80 a barrel, that would probably constitute an oil price shock, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn that scenario, Torres said he believes bonds and stocks would sell off in tandem, as higher energy prices could stoke inflation, which could weigh on economic growth. Higher inflation could also mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates down the line, a major catalyst that has pushed risk assets higher in the past year.\n\n\"Definitely there's risk for an oil price shock, especially with stocks coming up for three really robust years,\" Torres told Business Insider, referring to the back-to-back years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500.\n\nMatt Gertken, the chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, said that recent tensions in Iran have raised the odds of a \"massive global oil supply shock\" to around 40%. Should Iran's regime fall and conflict in the region increase, that could result in a \"significant loss\" in oil production around the region, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"Global and US equities are exposed to a correction in the near term given overvalued and overbought conditions and escalating geopolitical risk at the moment,\" Gertken added.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank also flagged the risk of the market experiencing an oil shock this year.\n\n\"A positive supply shock to oil prices would materially impact inflation expectations and inflation risks,\" the bank wrote in a recent client note, calling the scenario a key risk to their economic outlook.",

    "title": "Goldman Sachs breaks down what the doomsayers get wrong about the US economy in 8 charts",
    "description": "Investors gripped with concern over the US economy can relax. Goldman Sachs explains why common worries, including frothy valuations, are overblown.",
    "fullText": "American investors are worried.\n\nThey've been worried for a while now: that a recession is coming, that stock valuations are overheated, and that AI spending is the only thing keeping the economy (and markets) afloat.\n\nAnd if you're in the wealth management business, like Goldman Sachs, it's your job to listen to these concerns. To nod solemnly and empathize as your millionaire clients lay bare their greatest fears. And then it's your job to tell them that, actually, things aren't so bad, and despite all the apparent chaos out there, it would be quite unwise to cash out your chips in the US stock market.\n\nGoldman Sachs' wealth management unit did just that Monday, sending out a report to clients saying that the outlook for the US economy and stock market is bright — and that most of the concerns keeping investors awake at night are overblown.\n\n\"Clients — and also some colleagues — are now asking whether it is time to reduce exposure to US equities in favor of other developed and emerging markets,\" the firm's Investment Strategy Group wrote in its 2026 outlook report. But it concludes that many of the perceived risks dominating conversations these days — from tariffs to government dysfunction to market concentration — are overstated, and that the most significant risk for equities, a US recession, is unlikely.\n\nThe group puts the probability of a recession at 25%, down from last year's estimate of around 35%. Instead, Goldman's base-case projection calls for continued economic expansion and robust earnings growth for the S&P 500.\n\n\"We wanted to emphasize that in spite of all the headlines that you read about 'Is America on the decline?' et cetera, we want to make a very strong stand and say, 'No, that is not the case,'\" Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer of the Investment Strategy Group, said in a media appearance for the report's release.\n\nThe US remains the preeminent destination for investors around the world, Mossavar-Rahmani said — and a \"surprising\" number of popular narratives miss what's actually driving growth and returns.\n\n\"We want to dispel a couple of myths,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nHere are some of the other takeaways from Goldman's Investment Strategy Group, and what they're telling wealthy clients to do with their money in 2026.\n\nGoldman's team argues that \"US preeminence\" is evident across multiple measures, including economic wealth, labor productivity, deep capital markets, and natural resources — advantages they say are difficult for other major economies to match.\n\nThey also point to US leadership in key innovation areas, including semiconductors, biotechnology, and AI, as well as the scale and liquidity of US equity and bond markets.\n\nDespite political turmoil and tariff uncertainty, Goldman says the US remains a magnet for global capital.\n\n\"When people say, 'Oh, money's flowing out of the US.' It actually isn't. We had one month when that was the case,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nThat month of outflows came last April, in the aftermath of Trump's Liberation Day tariff plan announcement. Since then, foreign investors have flooded back into the US.\n\nOne argument for US economic fragility is that the boom in AI-adjacent tech spending — including data centers, chips, and power infrastructure — is propping up GDP.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has a more dour global economic outlook, estimated the US would have been in a recession in the first half of last year if not for AI investments. A report from Deutsche Bank shows they're not alone in that sentiment.\n\nBut Goldman says that view is off base, and that people underestimate how much consumption contributes to GDP. The bank's investment strategy group estimates all tech-related spending accounted for 0.5% of the 2.1% GDP growth in 2025, and Goldman's chief economist says AI capital expenditures accounted for just 0.1%.\n\nThe estimate, which \"includes everything related to AI, including data centers,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said, is \"probably a little bit on the high side because they're trying to include all the power generation as well, all the utility infrastructure that has benefits elsewhere other than just AI.\"\n\nThis dovetails with the myth that the US stock market is dependent on AI and the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), according to Mossavar-Rahmani.\n\n\"It's just not correct that AI has driven everything in the US, including all earnings and including S&P 500 returns,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nWhile no one disputes the incredible performance of these tech titans, Goldman contends that the rest of the S&P 500 receives short shrift and that earnings growth and returns remain respectable even after stripping out the contributions from the Magnificent Seven.\n\n\"This idea that it would be a poor economy, a weak economy, no earnings, no returns is again, just another falsehood,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit record highs last year, and investors often worry that new highs mean a painful drop is imminent. In reality, history shows that the market usually continues to post robust gains after hitting an all-time high, Goldman notes.\n\nWhile Goldman acknowledges valuations are elevated, it doesn't see an overheated market reminiscent of past market bubbles. It expects the S&P 500 to continue its rise in 2026, with a base-case estimate of a 7% total return and 10% earnings growth.\n\nGoldman's \"good\" scenario assumes a 17% return; its \"bad\" scenario assumes a 15% decline in a recession. (The team assigns a higher probability to upside than downside.)\n\n\"We do think that there are some good fundamental reasons why valuations have increased over time that are not just because of speculative excesses,\" said Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation within Goldman's investment strategy group.\n\nIn the run-up to the Dot Com bust at the turn of the century, for example, valuations and investor exuberance were divorced from earnings reality, which isn't the case today.\n\nYes, the S&P 500 is highly concentrated, Goldman says, but today's tech companies have enormous profit margins justifying their stock valuations, not just hype.\n\nGoldman isn't worried about a bubble in US equities. Where its investment strategists do see cause for concern is bitcoin.\n\n\"We do think bitcoin is a bubble,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said, noting that explosive price behavior in the cryptocurrency usually precedes a steep drawdown.\n\n\"We are even more convinced than we were in 2021 that bitcoin has no real value, that it is a speculative and trading asset and that only questionable practices support its current price,\" the 2026 outlook report says.\n\nAnother area of concern is gold, which is at unsustainable price levels unless central banks — especially the Chinese government and households — continue to buy it to prop it up, Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\n\"We do not recommend clients use gold or bitcoin as a hedge in their portfolios,\" the report says.\n\nThere are also \"pockets of euphoria\" in generative AI, with some public and private companies carrying bubble-like valuations, according to Goldman's outlook, which calls out the circular financing, easy credit, and questionable economics, coupled with soaring expectations.\n\n\"Some AI company founders and CEOs of the major companies involved with AI have raised expectations to an unrealistic level about what AI will deliver in the near future in terms of both revenues for the AI companies and productivity gains for enterprises leveraging AI,\" the report says.",

    "fullText": "CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil landed an interview with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and one of the unusual moments came when the president talked of what would have happened if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election.\n\nThe president was claiming Harris would have continued what he called a “mess” of an economy under Joe Biden.\n\nTony Dokoupil’s First Week As ‘CBS Evening News’ Anchor Down Year Over Year; ‘World News Tonight’ Tops Viewers, ‘Nightly News’ Wins 25-54 Demo\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nNew 'CBS Evening News' Anchor Tony Dokoupil To Interview Donald Trump\n\n“You wouldn’t have a job right now, if she got in. You probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump told Dokoupil during the interview, conducted on the floor of a Ford plant in Detroit.\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nThen the president appeared to refer to David Ellison, who became CEO of Paramount last year after his Skydance bought the CBS parent company. Ellison’s father, Larry, is a longtime supporter of the president’s.\n\n“Your boss is an amazing guy,” Trump said. “Might be bust. Okay. Might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn’t have this job. You wouldn’t have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they are paying you.”\n\nDokoupil later said that “I do think I’d have this job even if the other guy won.”\n\n“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump responded.\n\nThe Evening News ran the entirety of the interview, Dokoupil said, and it lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the conversation Trump talked about taking “very strong action” against Iran if the regime hangs protesters amid the unrest that has spread throughout the country. The president, though, was not specific about what that meant. At other points, Dokoupil let some of Trump’s claims go unchallenged, including that he “ended eight wars.” That has been challenged as hyperbole from the AP and other fact-checking sites.\n\nTrump also claimed that “there’s no inflation,” and later said that he had them “down to a level that they haven’t seen in about nine years.” In fact, consumer prices rose about 2.7% in December, according to the Department of Labor, and inflation was below 2% during points of Trump’s first term. The CBS Evening News anchor noted that “when I travel the country and I go all over the place and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don’t feel it.”\n\n“I’ve only been here for 11 months, okay,” Trump responded, before saying that he “inherited a mess” and that “we have now the hottest country in the world.”\n\nThe most revelatory part of the interview may have been when Dokoupil questioned Trump about the shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.\n\nDokoupil noted that he spoke to Good’s father, who is “a big supporter of yours.”\n\n“He’s heartbroken because his daughter is dead. He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist. What do you want to say to her father right now?”\n\nTrump answered, “Well, I want to say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side, as you say. He might be on my side.”\n\nDokoupil said, “He’s on your side.”\n\nTrump replied, “And I think that’s great … and I would bet you that she under normal circumstances was a very solid, wonderful person, but pretty tough.” He then went on to defend ICE and blast Joe Biden, before going back to the video of Good’s killing, and acknowledging that the videos are open to interpretation. Soon after the killing, the Department of Homeland Security quickly said that Good was trying to strike the ICE officer with her vehicle.\n\n“When you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways, I guess,” Trump said. “But when you look at the way that was, that car was pulled away. There are a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

Turmoil in markets.\n\nThat was a dire combination the US economy saw in the 1970s, but analysts say that the risks of another oil price shock — a situation where oil prices abruptly surge and set off a domino effect of negative consequences in markets and the economy —are on the rise as geopolitical conflict escalates.\n\nOil prices spiked in recent weeks as the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and threatened to take military action in Iran — two of the world's largest crude producers.\n\nMarch contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 10% in the last week, and jumped by as much as 3% to trade above $65 a barrel on Tuesday. It's the highest price for Brent since November.\n\nShould Brent oil hit $80 a barrel, that would probably constitute an oil price shock, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn that scenario, Torres said he believes bonds and stocks would sell off in tandem, as higher energy prices could stoke inflation, which could weigh on economic growth. Higher inflation could also mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates down the line, a major catalyst that has pushed risk assets higher in the past year.\n\n\"Definitely there's risk for an oil price shock, especially with stocks coming up for three really robust years,\" Torres told Business Insider, referring to the back-to-back years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500.\n\nMatt Gertken, the chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, said that recent tensions in Iran have raised the odds of a \"massive global oil supply shock\" to around 40%. Should Iran's regime fall and conflict in the region increase, that could result in a \"significant loss\" in oil production around the region, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"Global and US equities are exposed to a correction in the near term given overvalued and overbought conditions and escalating geopolitical risk at the moment,\" Gertken added.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank also flagged the risk of the market experiencing an oil shock this year.\n\n\"A positive supply shock to oil prices would materially impact inflation expectations and inflation risks,\" the bank wrote in a recent client note, calling the scenario a key risk to their economic outlook.\n\nJeff Currie, a longtime commodities strategist and the chief strategy officer of energy pathways at Carlyle, added that he believes there could be further upside risk to oil prices. He pointed to factors such as high demand for crude and \"quite high\" geopolitical risk, which could make oil more expensive.\n\n\"The situation in Venezuela, the impact on geopolitical risk is very large,\" Currie told CNBC last week. \"For oil importers, whether you're China, India, or Europe, the world got a lot more dangerous.\"",

    "title": "Trump’s Slash-and-Burn Economy Is Devastating Black Women",
    "description": "Kali...",
    "fullText": "His administration is hitting them with “discriminate harm.”\n\nElections have consequences—and they are, unfailingly, most profoundly visited upon Black women. Donald Trump’s reelection has had the consequence of Black women being pushed out of their workplaces at astonishing rates. Between February and July of last year, Black women lost 319,000 jobs in both the private and public sectors, driven largely by mass layoffs in education, healthcare, and housing. During that same period, white women gained 142,000 jobs, Hispanic women 176,000 jobs, and white men—wait for it!—picked up 365,000 jobs. In February, Black women’s unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent, but that figure had soared to 6.7 percent by August. In September, the most recent snapshot available because of the shutdown, yet another 0.8 percent of Black women lost their jobs—while just 0.2 percent of white women suffered the same fate that month. All in all, according to the gender economist Katica Roy, roughly 600,000 Black women have been “economically sidelined” since February—which was, not coincidentally, this president’s first full month in office.\n\nThis has failed to set off alarm bells in a country that has never cared much about the well-being of Black women. Perhaps that’s why concerned policymakers and economists so often take such pains to emphasize that Black women’s economic distress is a bellwether for everyone else—to underline that their fates, and even their humanity, are connected to the nation’s in the hopes that the country might finally care. And it’s not just that racism and sexism make Black women the first to be let go when the economy stalls—it’s also that Black women power the economy in ways this country often refuses to acknowledge. Nearly 70 percent of Black mothers are the breadwinners in their homes, though they’re paid just 34, 44, or 52 cents of every dollar paid to Asian, white, or Black breadwinner dads, respectively. So when they lose jobs en masse, families are left financially vulnerable and local economies are weakened. Nationally, the cost has already surpassed $37 billion in lost GDP.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous to suggest that Black women are merely hit the hardest during economic slumps when, in fact, they’ve been targeted for harm by a right wing that is openly committed to undoing their progress. This country has—again—chosen to meet gender and racial advancement with aggressive rollbacks, including dismantling institutions that have provided Black women with financial security and career advancement. It’s not a coincidence that the first move of the Trump administration, in partnership with Elon Musk’s DOGE, was to vilify and hollow out the civil service—long an engine of Black middle-class stability—where Black women make up 12 percent of staffers, double their portion of the overall workforce. A National Women’s Law Center study found that women and people of color made up the majority of the workforce in the agencies that sustained the deepest cuts. The Department of Education, with a workforce of 28 percent Black women, lost 46 percent of its staff. The Department of Justice and the Department of Energy, both of which are about 70 percent white? Cut by just 1 percent and 13 percent, respectively, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nThe Trump administration has also made a show of pushing out high-profile Black women leaders, including Carla Hayden at the Library of Congress, Gwynne Wilcox at the National Labor Relations Board, and the ongoing effort to oust Lisa Cook at the Federal Reserve. Peggy Carr has described her abrupt dismissal after 35 years of climbing the ranks at the Department of Education as a “tragedy” both personal and professional. “It was like I was being taken out like the trash,” Carr told The New York Times of being escorted out of the building by a security guard, “the only difference is I was being taken out the front door rather than the back door.”\n\nThose public-sector layoffs have been accompanied by attacks on private-sector diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or DEI. NPR reports that roles in DEI plummeted from 20,000 in 2023 to 17,500 in April 2025. Companies too numerous to name have hastily retreated from DEI efforts they had boasted about earlier, and not because they are mandated to, since Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders cannot overturn civil-rights laws or dictate the hiring practices of private businesses. A New York Times investigation found that the number of S&P 500 companies that include DEI language in their financial filings is down 60 percent since 2024. And for the first time since 2017, the majority of new directors hired at S&P 500 companies this year were white men.\n\nBlack women have long worked at rates higher than other American women, including as recently as 2024. But even in the best of times, intertwined sexism and anti-Black racism, or misogynoir, consign them to the most precarious jobs in the least recession-proof sectors. Across industries, they are paid less than white men with the same—and even, in some comparisons, lower—levels of education; are least likely of all women to be promoted; and leave college burdened with the most student-loan debt. Now Trump has launched what Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) rightly calls a campaign of “discriminate harm” against them. History vividly illustrates what the consequences will be. After economic downturns in the early 1980s, the Great Recession of the aughts, and the Covid pandemic, Black women were the last to recover financially. But this time, the Trump administration has scrubbed race-based employment data from government websites—preemptively erasing evidence of the harms it’s inflicting.\n\nWhen Black women voted against this regime, they were fighting for their lives at the ballot box, knowing they’d be the first to bear the brunt of its damages—and fully aware they wouldn’t be the last. It was, of course, not enough to stop a country unwilling to heed their warnings. So once again we’re trapped, forced to inhale the noxious fumes no one else notices are poisoning us all.",

That's largely because they're more aware of economic conditions, such as the persistent wealth gap. In recent years, Americans of all ages' positive views about capitalism have declined, according to a range of surveys. The shift is particularly pronounced among younger generations and Democrats.\n\nRegardless of their views on it, said David Ring, a 12th-grade economics teacher in Texas, capitalism is the dominant economic system in the US, and to teach it effectively, it's helpful to start with the basics.\n\n\"There's no purely free-market driven large-scale economy out there, just as there's no purely communist driven large-scale economy out there,\" Ring said.\n\nHere's a lightly edited version of a quiz Ring gives his students on capitalism.

    "fullText": "Dr. Mehmet Oz made the case that improving Americans’ health through better diets could transform both the nation's economy and healthcare spending.\n\nOz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, connected the dots between improved public health and workforce participation during a White House press conference this week. If Americans could stay healthy enough to work just one additional year beyond the current average retirement age of 61, it would “increase the overall GDP of our nation by trillions of dollars,” he said.\n\n“We will reduce healthcare expenses,” Oz said. “At the same time, we jazz up the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars created by the productivity of American workers.”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nOz praised the Trump administration's updated dietary guidelines, which encourage Americans to prioritize whole foods, proteins and healthy fats while reducing ultraprocessed food and added sugar.\n\n“The best way to reduce drug spend in America is to not need the drugs in the first place,” he said. He said that new guidelines could cut demand for expensive medications like GLP-1 drugs and autoimmune treatments by helping prevent chronic diseases from developing. “You can’t be a wealthy nation without being a healthy nation,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services showing that roughly 30% of Medicare spending, about $300 billion a year, is directly tied to obesity. “If we were to affect obesity by 10%, which is an incredibly conservative and justifiable assumption… just that alone is $30 billion of reduction of expenses for Medicare,” he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform Before the Raise Ends 1/19\n\nOz highlighted the importance of reaching children early, saying that 53% of U.S. children are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Programs teaching families how to implement the new dietary guidelines, he said, “will dramatically change the natural history of how children are able to participate in life.”\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the press conference that reducing healthcare costs requires upfront investments in education and access to healthy food. “The idea that a cheap meal made of processed food is cheap is an illusion, because you’re paying for it on the back end,” he said. “You’re paying for it with diabetes, with obesity, with illness.”",

    "description": "Quartermast Advisors estimated a 17.4% YoY increase in creator economy M&A activity last year. Here's what it's watching for in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Is the creator economy in the midst of a comeback era?\n\nAnother year of increased M&A deal volume is a signal that the sector is in good health, according to James Creech, who advises creator economy companies via his M&A advisory firm, Quartermast Advisors.\n\nWhile the industry — like many categories across tech and media — saw an unprecedented boom in attention and cash flow in 2021, Creech said the space battled through a \"winter\" through 2022 and 2023.\n\n\"We started to see these signs of recovery in 2024, and then all of a sudden last year was like: 'We're back, baby,'\" Creech told Business Insider. \"More investment, more M&A activity, larger deals, very high-profile transactions, public companies.\"\n\nQuartermast estimated that 2025 saw a 17.4% year-over-year increase in M&A activity with a total of 81 deals.\n\nHere are a few of the biggest ticket deals from 2025, according to Quartermast:\n\nThe first week of January 2026 already brought new deal announcements, such as ad agency PMG acquiring influencer-marketing agency Digital Voices, and media company Global acquiring sports YouTube channel The Overlap.\n\nMeanwhile, creator economy startups — particularly social commerce and AI companies — closed out 2025 raising billions in venture capital, with at least 13 startups raising more than $50 million.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of which companies are driving M&A in the creator economy, Quartermast analyzed the companies that have historically been the most active buyers.\n\nThe biggest takeaway is a caveat: While many of these companies were historically very active, some have scaled back their M&A strategies or even faded away (in the case of Fullscreen).\n\nHere are seven companies that have been active buyers in the creator economy over time, according to Quartermast's analysis:\n\nLooking ahead at 2026, Creech said agencies and holding companies, such as Publicis and Omnicom (which recently completed its $9 billion merger with IPG), will continue to seek out strategic acquisitions and are the most likely buyers.\n\nCreech includes Humanz, an Israeli influencer marketing company, in this category. Humanz announced in late 2025 that it raised $15 million in venture funding to fuel an M&A spree.\n\nTalent agencies and management firms will also see more consolidation, Creech said. Creech predicts that the talent sector, followed by marketing technology platforms, will be the most active categories for M&A in 2026 after agencies and holding companies.\n\nPrivate equity is expected to continue having a stake in the space, too, as firms \"become increasingly comfortable with the creator economy as an asset class,\" Creech said. For instance, PE firm Silver Lake has played a major role in TikTok's ownership shake-up.\n\nCompanies building tools for creators' businesses, such as Patreon and Kajabi, could also be at the center of some deals, he added.\n\nFinally, Creech expects non-creator-economy companies, such as traditional media companies or even food companies like Wonder, to continue making bets in the space.\n\n\"That's a sign that the creator economy is entering a new age of maturity and growth,\" Creech said.",

He described the move as a part of a broader effort to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nProminent economists and business leaders are reacting as the news hit markets at the start of the trading week. They weighed in on how the DOJ move affects the Fed's independence, a question also raised by Sen. Thom Tillis. On Sunday, the Republican said he would oppose nominees for the Fed.\n\n\"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\n\nHere's what leaders in economics and business are saying:\n\nProminent economist Mohamed El-Erian called for Powell's resignation months ago to protect the Fed's independence amid the feud with Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, El-Erian wrote on X that the inquiry into Powell is damaging for the US central bank.\n\n\"For those of us who value the operational autonomy of central banks, the risk is that this situation could expose deeper issues — further undermining the credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile,\" wrote El-Erian, who is a former co-chief investment officer at Pimco.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman raised concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"Question to all those who said Trump would be better for the economy: is attacking the Fed's independence what you had in mind?\" wrote the prominent Democratic donor on X.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, attributed the gold price surge to fresh record highs on Sunday evening to the investigation into Powell.\n\n\"I am not a fan of Powell, but I agree with him on Trump's motivation,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\nIn April, Schiff said Trump's next Fed Chair pick would be a \"loyal soldier.\"\n\nMichael A. Gayed, a renowned investment manager, said direct action against a sitting Fed Chair is \"without modern precedent,\" in an edition of his Lead-Lag substack report published on Sunday evening.\n\nThe inquiry into Powell raises questions about whether the long-standing boundaries between fiscal power, prosecutorial authority, and monetary independence are beginning to blur, Gayed said. The concern was less about any single case and more about the future precedent it may establish.\n\n\"Should investors conclude that future Fed officials could face legal consequences for policy decisions that conflict with political priorities, the incentive structure governing monetary policy could change,\" said Gayed.\n\nThat shift could increase inflation risk premiums and weaken confidence in long-duration financial assets tied to stable policy expectations, he added.",

    "fullText": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina has repaid the funds it drew from a $20 billion credit line with the Trump administration, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Friday, in a crucial step for Argentine President Javier Milei to restore confidence in his chronically distressed economy.\n\nIn addition to making payments to bondholders, Milei’s radical libertarian administration had “quickly and fully repaid its limited draw,” Bessent said, without specifying the amount.\n\nThe Treasury’s latest report on the status of the credit line said that Argentina’s central bank had traded pesos for $2.5 billion through the swap as of the end of October.\n\nThe Argentine Central Bank confirmed Bessent's announcement.\n\nThe contentious and largely unprecedented U.S. rescue provided dollar liquidity to the Trump administration's cash-strapped ideological ally and halted a market rout in Argentina ahead of crucial midterm elections last October.\n\nMilei’s libertarian party won a major victory in the vote, cementing support for his harsh austerity program and quelling investor concerns about the crisis-stricken country's ability to repay debts. In another sign of the revived optimism around Milei's reforms, his government issued a dollar bond for the first time in eight years last month, presaging a return to international bond markets.\n\nThanks to Argentina’s deposit, Bessent said, the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund tapped for the bailout holds no more Argentine pesos.\n\nHe praised the payment as a landmark that justified the Treasury’s bailout of Argentina, which raised doubts about the consistency of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy and drew backlash in the U.S. for putting taxpayer funds at risk. Experts have also criticized the opaque and apparently unconditional nature of the loan.\n\n“Stabilizing a strong American ally – and making tens of millions in profit for Americans – is an America First homerun deal,” Bessent wrote. “Setting the course for Latin America, a strong and stable Argentina that helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in our clear best interest.”\n\nLuis Caputo, Argentina’s economy minister thanked the Trump administration “for the trust in our economic policy.”\n\n“It is an excellent reality for our country to have been able to build this geopolitical alliance and to know that we have the explicit support of the most important country in the world,” he said.\n\nBut Argentina is not out of the woods.\n\nIts foreign exchange reserves still run perilously low. The country is set to come under further strain in the coming months from repayments on previous International Monetary Fund loans and other private debt.",

    "title": "A Guggenheim heir is raising $50 million to back media and creator startups. Here are 4 areas he's betting on.",
    "description": "Guggenheim Brothers Media and Abu Dhabi's EIH formed a fund for media, entertainment, and creator economy investments.",
    "fullText": "A new $50 million fund is targeting media, entertainment, and creator economy startups, tapping into Hollywood networks and the UAE's growing appetite for cultural investment.\n\nUS investment firm Guggenheim Brothers Media is launching the fund with backing from Abu Dhabi-based Ethmar International Holding.\n\nThe firm is led by Dillon Lawson-Johnston and Criswell Fiordalis, who are looking to write checks of $2 million to $5 million, targeting 10 to 15 companies. They plan to seek other investors as well and hope to grow the fund to as much as $75 million.\n\nThe pair brings extensive entertainment and cultural ties. Lawson-Johnston is the great-great-grandson of Solomon R. Guggenheim, founder of New York City's famed Guggenheim Museum, and has experience from UTA, Sugar23, Untitled Entertainment, and Anonymous Content. Fiordalis has had roles at Lionsgate, MRC, Hello Sunshine, and Webtoon. The two had previously invested in Stapleview, a comedy platform, and The Lighthouse, Whalar Group's campus for creators.\n\nEIH is an investment holding company that's led by a prominent member of a UAE ruling family. The UAE, like other Gulf nations, has been pouring money into US media and entertainment as it tries to diversify away from oil. One UAE government project, Creators HQ, aims to get 10,000 creators to relocate to the country. Lawson-Johnston's family is set to open the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi in 2026.\n\n\"We're investing in creativity and culture, and we're looking to leverage this amazing museum that's being built,\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nHe and Fiordalis want to deploy the fund mainly in the US, where the creator economy is more mature. The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimated that advertisers would spend $37 billion with creators in 2025, a sum that it says is growing four times faster than overall media spending.\n\nHere are four trends the new fund is betting on:\n\nInvestors tend to shy away from backing individual creators because of the risk of overdependence on a single person, also called \"key man risk.\" That's why some big names like Steven Bartlett and Alex Cooper are building networks of complementary creators (and attracting millions of dollars in the process).\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in creators who are looking beyond themselves when building talent-related businesses.\n\nThey'll also look at companies that develop creators through talent management or other services. One example is their earlier investment in Stapleview, which manages social media-born comedians and produces with them.\n\nTraditional media companies have a lot of intellectual property that they want to give new life to in digital media. It's why Disney did a deal that'll open its vault of famous characters to OpenAI.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston, both of whom have spent time at legacy media companies, envision a mutually beneficial way for creators and Hollywood to collaborate in this area and aim to facilitate this process.\n\n\"If you're SpongeBob SquarePants, what do you do other than taking SpongeBob and slapping it on YouTube and saying, 'Oh, we now have a digital presence?'\" Lawson-Johnston said.\n\nBrands are clamoring to get their message out using creators, leveraging influencers' built-in distribution and popularity among younger consumers. The IAB found in November that brands were most eager to work with mid-tier creators — those with between 50,000 and 500,000 followers — because of their ability to drive sales and awareness.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston see an opportunity to back platforms that connect such influencers with brands using a mix of people and technology. They pointed to the platform Kyra, which raised $15 million in 2022, as one they admire.\n\n\"There's a lot of, not top creators, but downstream creators that have way more engagement and can drive a lot more value to said brand,\" Fiordalis said.\n\nAs more brands shift their budgets to creators, they face increasing pressure to prove that their spending has paid off. Brands have gone from just caring about a creator's follower count to looking at other ways to prove efficacy.\n\nFiordalis and Lawson-Johnston are interested in companies trying to standardize how creators are measured.\n\n\"Who's standardizing the definition of value across these platforms and across pieces of content?\" Fiordalis said. \"I think the industry is getting to a point where it needs that.\"",

Xi invited Carney to China when they met during an Asia-Pacific summit in October. The visit comes as the two countries move to restore stronger ties after years of tensions.\n\n“We’re forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner, to one that is stronger and more resilient to global shock,” Carney said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nCarney will travel to China from Jan. 13 to 17. He will also attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from Jan. 19 to 21.\n\nTrump has been threatening Canada’s economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be “the 51st state.”\n\nThe attempt at rapprochement with China comes as Carney looks to double Canada’s non-U.S. exports in the next decade and as the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico is up for review this year. More than 75% percent of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.\n\nChina is Canada's second largest trading partner.\n\nRelations between China and Canada took a nosedive in late 2018 after Canadian authorities arrested a senior executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei as a part of its extradition agreement with the United States. China then arrested two Canadian citizens in retaliation.\n\nMore recently, relations have been shaken by Canada’s decision to levy a 100% tariff on electric vehicles, batteries and other goods from China in 2024. Canada made the move in tandem with the U.S.\n\nCanadian canola producers, seafood exporters and pork farmers are dealing with steep Chinese tariffs in retaliation.\n\nChina has offered to remove its import taxes on some Canadian products if Canada drops the EV tariff.",

    "fullText": "The narrative from the AI labs is dazzling: build AGI, unlock astonishing productivity, and watch GDP surge. It’s a compelling story, especially if you’re the one building or investing in the new thought machines. But it skips the part that makes an economy an economy: circulation.\n\nAn economy is not simply production. It is production matched to demand, and demand requires broadly distributed purchasing power. When we forget that, we rediscover an old truth the hard way: You can’t build a prosperous society that leaves most people on the sidelines.\n\nIn The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, the visionary poet and painter William Blake (writing during the first Industrial Revolution) put the circulatory logic perfectly: “The Prolific would cease to be prolific unless the Devourer as a sea received the excess of his delights.” In other words: Output has to be consumed. The system has to flow.\n\nToday, many AGI narratives assume that the “prolific” can keep producing and the broad mass of customers (“the devourer”) somehow continue to buy, even as more and more human labor is displaced and labor income and bargaining power collapses. That’s not a future of abundance. It’s a recipe for a kind of congestive heart failure for the economy: Profits and capabilities accumulate in what should be the circulatory pump, while the rest of the body is starved.\n\nSo if we want an AI economy that makes society richer, we need to ask not just “How smart will the models get?” and “How rich will AI developers, their investors, and their immediate customers get?” but “How will the value circulate in the real economy of goods and services?” Not “What can we automate?” but “What new infrastructure and institutions are needed to turn capability into widely shared prosperity?”\n\nTwo versions of the future are often discussed as if they are separate. They’re not.\n\nI’m excited by the discovery potential of AI. It may help us solve problems that have defied us for decades: energy abundance, new materials, cures for diseases. As Nick Hanauer and Eric Beinhocker put it so well, “Prosperity is the accumulation of solutions to human problems.” That AI can grow the store of solutions to human problems is a wonderful dream, and it should be our goal to make it come true.\n\nBut discovery alone is not the same thing as economic value, and it certainly isn’t the same thing as widely shared prosperity. Between discovery and economic value lies a long, failure-prone pipeline: productization, validation, regulation, manufacturing, distribution, training, and maintenance. The valley of death is not a metaphor; it is a bureaucratic, technical, and financial landscape where many promising advances go to die. And from that valley of death, the path follows either an ascent to the broad uplands of shared prosperity, or a shortcut to a dead-end peak of wealth concentration.\n\nIf AI accelerates discovery but doesn’t accelerate diffusion, we get headlines and paper wealth, but broad-based growth takes much longer to arrive. We get a taller peak, not a wider plateau.\n\nThe distribution question begins with choke points. Who owns the discovery engines? Who controls access to compute, data, and the models themselves? Who captures the IP? Who has the channels to bring new capabilities to market? To what extent do incumbents and the moats they have built restrict innovation? Do government regulatory processes also speed up, or do they keep AI adoption at a glacial pace? Do those at the choke points use their market shaping power wisely? If those choke points are tight, the discovery economy becomes a kind of discovery feudalism: The breakthroughs happen, but the spillovers are limited, adoption is slow, and the returns concentrate.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the tools and standards of diffusion are broadly available, if interoperability is real, if licensing is designed for many routes to market, if regulatory processes can also be sped up with AI, then the discovery economy can become what we want it to be: a generalized engine of progress. There’s a huge amount of work to be done here.\n\nMany of the questions are economic. If discovery becomes cheap, does the rest of the pipeline get cheaper, or does it get more expensive to compensate for other lost revenue? The happy dream is that a cancer vaccine becomes available at the marginal cost of production. The unhappy reality may be that the drug manufacturers conclude “We have to price this high to make up for our losses from the existing drugs that people no longer need to buy.” Even in an age of cheap discovery, it is possible that some vaccines will still cost millions of dollars per dose and only be available to people who can afford them.\n\nThe other story is labor replacement. We are told that AI will substitute for a great deal of intellectual work, much as machines replaced animal labor and much of human manual labor. Businesses become more efficient. Margins rise. Output increases. Prices fall and spending power increases for those who are still employed.\n\nBut who are the customers when a large number of humans are suddenly no longer gainfully employed?\n\nThis is not a rhetorical question. It is the central macroeconomic constraint that much of Silicon Valley prefers not to model. You can’t replace wages with cheap inference and expect the consumer economy to hum along unchanged. If the wage share falls fast enough, the economy may become less stable. Social conflict rises. Politics turns punitive. Investment in long-term complements collapses. And the whole system starts behaving like a fragile rent-extraction machine rather than a durable engine of prosperity.\n\nIn a 2012 Harvard Business Review article, Michael Schrage asked a powerful strategic question: “Who do you want your customers to become?” As he put it, the answer to that question is the true foundation of great companies. “Successful companies have a ‘vision of the customer future’ that matters every bit as much as their vision of their products.”\n\nIn the early days of mass production, Henry Ford reportedly understood that if you want mass markets, you need mass purchasing power. He paid higher wages and reduced working hours, helping to invent what we now call the weekend, and with it, the leisure economy. The productivity dividend was distributed in ways that created new customers.\n\nFord’s innovation had consequences beyond the factory gate. Mass adoption of cars required a vast extension of infrastructure: roads, traffic rules, hotels, parking, gas stations, repair shops, and the entire social reorganization of distance. The technology mattered, but the complements made it an economy.\n\nSteven Johnson tells a related story in his book Wonderland. The preindustrial European desire for Indian calico and chintz helped catalyze modern shopping environments and global trade networks. But there’s even more to that story. When it became cheaper to make cloth, fashion, taste, and the democratization of status display became a larger part of the economy. The point is not “consumerism is good.” The point is that economies grow because desires and capabilities change as the result of innovations, infrastructure, and institutions that allow the benefits to spread. New forms of production require new systems of distribution, experience, and exchange.\n\nAI is at that inflection point now. We may be building the engines of extraordinary productivity, but we are not yet building the social machinery that will make that productivity broadly usable and broadly beneficial. We are just hoping that they somehow evolve.\n\nThis failure of insight and imagination is the Achilles’ heel of today’s AI giants. They imagine themselves as contestants in a race to be the next dominant platform, with the majority of the benefits going to whoever has the smartest model, the most users, and the most developers. This is not unlike the vision of Marc Andreessen’s Netscape in the early days of the web. Netscape sought to replace Microsoft Windows as the platform for users and developers, using the internet moment to become the next monopoly gatekeeper. Instead, victory went to those who embraced the web’s architecture of participation.\n\nNow, it is true that 30 years later, we are in a world where companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have indeed become gatekeepers, extracting huge economic rents via their control over human attention. But it didn’t start that way. Amazon and Google in particular rose to prominence because they solved the circulation problem. Amazon’s flywheel, in which more users draw in more suppliers with more and cheaper products, which in turn brings in more users, in a virtuous circle, is a great example of an economic circulation strategy. Not only did Amazon drive enormous consumer value, they created a whole new set of suppliers.\n\nSo too, Google’s original search engine strategy was also deeply rooted in the circulation of value. As Larry Page put it in 2004, “The portal strategy tries to own all of the information….We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible.” The company’s algorithms for both search and ad relevance were a real advance in market coordination and shared value creation. Economists like Hal Varian were brought in to design advertising models that were better not only for Google but for its customers. Google grew along with the web economy it helped to create, not at its expense. Yes, that changed over time, but let’s not forget how important Google’s support for a circulatory economy was to its initial success.\n\nGoogle also provides a really good example of mechanism design to solve problems with rights holders that have economic lessons for today. When music companies sent takedown notices to YouTube for user-generated content that made unauthorized use of their IP, YouTube instead asked, “How about we help you monetize it instead?” In the process it created a new market.\n\nThe extent to which Amazon and Google seem to have forgotten these lessons is a sign of their decline, not something to be emulated. It provides an opportunity for those (including Google and Amazon, if they recommit to their roots!) who are building the next generation of technology platforms. Build a flywheel, enable a circulatory economy. AI should not be enshittified from the beginning, prioritizing value capture over broadly based value creation.\n\nAn important lesson from the internet technology revolution of the 1990s and early 2000s is that decentralized architectures are more innovative and more competitive than those that are centralized. Decentralization creates value; centralization captures it. The PC decentralized the computer industry, ending IBM’s chokehold on competition during the mainframe era. The new software industry exploded. Over the next few decades, as it became dominant, Microsoft recentralized the industry by monopolizing operating systems and office applications in the way that IBM had monopolized computer hardware. The personal computer software industry began to stagnate, until open source software and the open protocols of the internet undermined Microsoft’s centralized control over the industry and ushered in a new era of innovation.\n\nThe tragedy began again, as those who had once flourished as internet innovators in turn began to prioritize control, raising moats and extracting rents rather than continuing to innovate, leading to today’s internet oligopoly. This, of course, is what allowed the current AI revolution to happen as it did. Google invented the transformer architecture, and then published it freely, but did not itself fully explore the possibilities because it was protecting an existing business model. So it was left to OpenAI to invent the future.\n\nHowever, the AI revolution has a significant difference from the early internet. The U.S.’s current set up of large, closed models, enormous data centers for model training, and a highly concentrated cloud market has echoes of central planning, in which a small cadre of deep pocketed investors choose the winners at the outset rather than discovering them through a period of intense market competition and finding product-market fit (which involves finding products and services that users not only want but are willing to pay for at less than the cost of production!).\n\nMarket competition is important to ensuring that the economy is not reliant on a handful of firms reinvesting their profits into production. When this becomes the case, circulation can get cut off. Profits stop being reinvested and instead become hoarded, trapped within the sphere of financial circulation, from dividends to share buybacks to more dividends and less and less to investment in fixed or human capital.\n\nIf we are to realize the full potential of AI to reinvigorate and reinvent the economy, we need to embrace decentralized architectures. This might involve the triumph of lower-cost open weight models that commoditize and decentralize inference, and it also certainly entails protocols and technical infrastructure that can reduce the inherent concentrating tendencies of economies of scale and other technological moats that make concentration a more efficient mode of production.\n\nCentralization is an advantage in a mature economy; it is a disadvantage when you are trying to invent the future. Premature centralization is a mistake.\n\nIf AI labs wish to be architects of a prosperous future, they must work as hard on inventing the new economy’s circulatory system as they do on improving model capabilities. They need to measure success by diffusion, not just capability. They have to treat the labor transition as a core problem to be solved, not just studied. They have to be willing to win in the marketplace, not through artificial moats. That means committing to open interfaces, portability, and interoperability. General-purpose capabilities should not become a private toll road.\n\nCompanies adopting AI face their own challenges. Simply using AI to slash costs and turbocharge profits is a kind of failure. The productivity dividend should show up for employees not as a pink slip but as some combination of higher pay, reduced hours, profit-sharing, and investment in retraining. They must use the opportunity to reinvent themselves by creating new kinds of value that people will be eager to pay for, not just trying to preserve what they have.\n\nGovernments and society as a whole need to invest in the complements that will shape the new AI economy. Diffusion will be limited by the fragility of our energy grid, by bottlenecks in the supply of rare earths, but also by sclerotic approval processes for new construction or the approval of new innovations.\n\nGovernments must also develop scenarios for a future in which taxes on labor might provide a much smaller part of their income. Solutions are not obvious, and transitions will be hard, but if we face a future where capital appreciation is abundant and labor income is scarce, perhaps it’s time to consider reducing taxes on labor and increasing those on capital gains.\n\nOver the next few months, we intend to convene a series of conversations and to publish a series of more detailed action plans in each of these areas. Let me know if you think you have ideas to contribute.\n\nWe can build an AI economy that concentrates value, hollows out demand, and forces society into a reactive cycle of backlash and repair. Or we can build an AI economy that circulates, where discoveries diffuse, where productivity dividends translate into purchasing power and time, and where the complements are built fast enough that society becomes broadly more capable.\n\nAI labs like to say they are building intelligence. They are making good progress. But if they want to build prosperity, they also need to discover the flywheel for the AI economy.\n\nThe prolific needs the devourer. Not as a villain, not as an obstacle, but as the sea that receives the excess, and returns it, transformed, as the next wave of demand, innovation, and shared flourishing.",

    "fullText": "Ray Dalio spent 2025 expressing fear and urging caution, and he's remaining cautious as the US economy enters a new year.\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates sounded alarms throughout 2025 over what he sees as a budding global debt crisis and the waning value of fiat currency.\n\nThe surge in gold last year—the biggest gain for the metal since 1979—contains a warning for investors, specifically as it relates to the depreciating value of fiat money, Dalio said in a post on Monday.\n\nA potent cocktail of central bank buying, geopolitical worries, and appetite from individuals pushed gold to records all year, but Dalio argues that the gold rally is mainly a result of fiat money losing real value. In his view, that was the biggest story in markets in 2025.\n\n\"The best major investment of the year was long gold (returning 65% in dollar terms), which outperformed the S&P index (which returned 18% in dollars) by 47%,\" he said. \"Or, said differently, the S&P fell by 28% in gold-money terms.\"\n\nDalio urged investors to consider a few key factors when evaluating the forces that drove markets in 2025. Specifically, he highlighted that examining investment through calculations made in a depreciating currency can be misleading, as it can make returns appear stronger than they actually were.\n\nFrom Dalio's perspective, the stock market's 2025 performance varied greatly based on the measuring stick.\n\n\"When one's own currency goes down, it makes it look like the things measured in it went up,\" he said. \"In this case, the S&P returned 18% for a dollar-based investor, 17% for a yen-based investor, 13% for a renminbi-based investor, only 4% for a euro-based investor, only 3% for a Swiss franc-based investor, and, for a gold-based investor, it returned -28%.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has touted the economic benefits of a weakening US dollar, attempting to frame it as beneficial for US exports. But economic think tanks such as the Cato Institute have argued against this perspective, claiming that it ignores negative spillover effects for US consumers.\n\nDalio seems to share that mindset, noting that a weaker currency tends to lower the cost of a nation's exported goods for international buyers while increasing the price of domestic imports.\n\n\"When one's currency goes down, it reduces one's wealth and one's buying power, it makes one's goods and services cheaper in others' currencies, and it makes others' goods and services more expensive in one's own currency.\"\n\nIn his view, rising gold prices reflect a weakening economy and a national currency that is decreasing in value. For that reason, Dalio sees the continued strength of the so-called debasement trade as a warning for the US.\n\nThe stock market's big bull run in recent years might also be making it easier for investors to disregard other warning signals flashing in the economy. Dalio emphasized that the gold rally is a reason to reassess the macro picture and take a more cautious position.\n\nThe billionaire investor added that stocks and gold benefited from monetary policy easing in 2025, but as both assets are no longer cheap, they're at risk of a pullback if conditions shift again.\n\n\"Whether or not you are currency hedged matters a lot,\" Dalio said. \"You should always be hedged to your least-risk currency mix and make tactical moves from there if you think you are capable of making them well.\"",

    "description": "The push for tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a \"significant increase\" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.\n\nThe Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.\n\nA share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\n\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\n\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\n\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\n\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\n\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\n\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\n\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says the US raid on Venezuela is a much bigger deal than the markets' muted reaction suggests.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, published a post early Monday saying the \"game just changed\" in the mid to long term, and \"markets are not pricing in all that may come of this weekend's events.\"\n\n\"This is a paradigm shift despite the markets yawning,\" he later wrote on X.\n\nBenchmark oil prices climbed less than 1% on Monday, and US stock futures opened higher, after the US captured President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and President Trump said America would \"run\" the oil-rich country for the time being.\n\nThe seizure was a \"shot across China's bow,\" Burry wrote, pointing to billions of dollars in loans that China has made to Venezuela under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which were collateralized using future oil output that is \"now in US hands.\"\n\nThe investor, who shot to fame after his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" wrote that China may now have a \"blueprint\" for how to take control of Taiwan, but \"must be in awe of Trumpian America's infuriating gall and decisive power.\"\n\nBurry said that China stocks strike him as \"somewhat riskier\" now in terms of running afoul of sanctions. He wrote that Alibaba, Baidu, and other potential sanction targets \"could be in for some volatility\" if China escalates its aggression in the South China Sea or targets Taiwan.\n\nThe contrarian bargain hunter also wrote that \"Putin's jaw has to be on the floor\" after the US did in \"practically seconds\" what Russia has been trying to do in Ukraine for three years.\n\nHe added that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid to long term, as tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nBurry also suggested that Canada and Mexico could \"lose a good amount of leverage\" in trade with the US if American refineries switch out Canadian crude for Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe veteran investor also said US oil-services companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes \"should benefit significantly\" as US contractors will be tasked with fixing and modernizing Venezuela's pipelines and refineries.\n\nBurry also forecast a \"long term tailwind\" for the US as inflows of Venezuelan oil will mean gas, diesel, and jet fuel prices will drop. He said that could push down prices to the benefit of consumers, especially lower-income ones, cut supply chain costs, and ease some uncertainty about the future for business owners.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — As uncertainty simmers in Venezuela, interim President Delcy Rodríguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicolás Maduro, captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation, and offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration in what could be a seismic shift in relations between the adversary governments.\n\nRodríguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela’s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, and the leader was backed by Venezuela’s military.\n\nRodríguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and politician has had a lengthy career representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. It's been unclear if the leader would warm up to the Trump administration or follow the same adversarial line as her predecessor.\n\nHer rise to become interim leader of the South American country came as a surprise on Saturday morning, when Trump announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in communication with Rodríguez and that the Venezuelan leader was “gracious” and would work with the American government. Rubio said Rodríguez was someone the administration could work with, unlike Maduro.\n\nBut in a televised address, Rodríguez gave no indication that she would cooperate with Trump, referring to his government as “extremists\" and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela's rightful leader.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” Rodríguez said, surrounded by high-ranking civilian officials and military leaders.\n\nTrump warned on Sunday, if Rodríguez didn't fall in line, “she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” He added that he wanted her to provide “total access,” from oil facilities to basic infrastructure like roads, so they can be rebuilt.\n\nTrump’s comments also followed Rubio having asserted in TV interviews on Sunday that he didn’t see Rodríguez and her government as “legitimate” because he said the country never held free and fair elections.\n\nOn Sunday, in statements posted to her Instagram, she took a major shift in tone in a conciliatory message where she said she hoped to build “respectful relations” with Trump.\n\n“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” she wrote.\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, the interim president and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping of American business owner William Niehous in 1976, and later died in police custody.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S., though the interim president did face U.S. sanctions during Trump's first term for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nRodríguez held a number of lower-level positions under Chávez's government, but gained prominence working under Maduro to the point of being seen as his successor. She served the economic minister, foreign affairs minister, petroleum minister and others help stabilize Venezuela's endemically crisis-stricken economy after years of rampant inflation and turmoil.\n\nRodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. The interim president also presided over an assembly promoted by Maduro in response to street protests in 2017 meant to neutralize the opposition-majority legislature.\n\nShe enjoys a close relationship with the military, which has long acted as the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, said Ronal Rodríguez, a spokesperson for the Venezuela Observatory of Rosario University in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n“She has a very particular relationship with power,” he said. “She has developed very strong ties with elements of the armed forces and has managed to establish lines of dialogue with them, largely on a transactional basis.”\n\nIt's unclear how long Rodríguez will hold power, or how closely she will work with the Trump administration.\n\nGeoff Ramsey, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute, said Rodríguez's initially firm tone with the Trump administration may have been an attempt to “save face.” Others have noted that Maduro's capture required some level of collaboration within the Venezuelan government.\n\n“She can’t exactly expect to score points with her revolutionary peers if she presents herself as a patsy for U.S. interests,\" Ramsey said.\n\nVenezuela’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. Reasons listed include death, resignation, removal from office or “abandonment” of duties as declared by the National Assembly.\n\nThat electoral timeline was rigorously followed when Maduro’s predecessor, Chavez, died of cancer in 2013. However, the loyalist Supreme Court, in its decision Saturday, cited another provision of the charter in declaring Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, there is no election requirement. Instead, the vice president, an unelected position, takes over for up to 90 days — a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nIn handing temporary power to Rodríguez, the Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day time limit, leading some to speculate she could try to remain in power even longer as she seeks to unite the disparate factions of the ruling socialist party while shielding it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.\n\n—— Janetsky reported from Mexico City and Debre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Associated Press writers Joshua Goodman in Miami, Darlene Superville aboard Air Force One and Jorge Rueda in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.",

The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "description": "Trump is having the government buy stakes directly in companies — and it's going to change the way we all do business and reshape the economy.",
    "fullText": "This is the first story in Business Insider's new series \"The Future of Capitalism.\" The series looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding, and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth.\n\nTo believe in American capitalism has long meant believing in a mostly laissez-faire approach from the government — it sets the rules of the game, but it doesn't have a piece on the board. Markets pick winners and losers, not Washington. The strong thrive, the weak fail. That consensus has been eroding for years, and finally, the dam has broken: The US government has become a shareholder in nearly a dozen companies over the past several months, and the list is growing. It's moved the economy into a much more interventionist — and unfamiliar — territory. The machine is still turning, but more hands are tinkering with the gears, including, most importantly, the president's.\n\nThe federal government has been on an equity stake shopping spree during the first year of Trump's second term. The US took a nearly 10% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion in August, a move aimed at bolstering the country's semiconductor industry. It has invested in several critical minerals firms, including MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals, as well as in Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company. In June, the administration acquired a \"golden share\" in US Steel in exchange for approving Japanese company Nippon Steel's acquisition of the company — it gives the government veto-like power over decisions such as shifting jobs outside the US and shuttering plants. (And as for recent developments in Venezuela, the president clearly is waving a heavy hand toward the US oil industry and potential investment there. How that situation plays remains to be seen.)\n\nThese types of moves are not abnormal outside the United States. China's version of capitalism is hyper-state-led. Many governments, including those of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, make direct investments in some domestic firms. The US has gotten extra involved in private industry in the past, but it's generally been in times of distress, such as during the 2008 crisis, when it took stakes in certain financial institutions and automakers in order to prevent a broader economic meltdown.\n\nThis time, it's different: The government is meddling when there's no apparent urgent need, and it's picking companies in what some observers say is a scattershot manner. The sectors make sense, but the criteria for selecting companies are rather unclear, as is the role the government will play in its investments.\n\n\"With industrial policy, the devil's in the details of so much, and this is where the details are really obscured, and where they are defined, they're kind of ad hoc,\" says Nathan Lane, an assistant professor of economic development at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nA novel vision of American state capitalism is emerging right before our eyes. It's a world where the White House puts its thumb on the scale, whether in injecting funds into a firm, weighing in on mergers, or implementing legally questionable tariffs at the drop of a hat. Many critics have expressed concerns about the risks arising from the Trump administration's actions — the potential for politically biased decision-making, the appearance of crony capitalism, and possible market distortions. In the grand scheme of things, these maneuvers may be financially minor, but they're structurally major developments. Regardless of the drawbacks, it's indicative of where we're headed. There may be no going back.\n\n\"The use of these tools generally only goes in one direction, and so the Trump administration, for better or worse, has introduced a new group of tools into the economic statecraft toolkit,\" says Aaron Bartnick, a former White House economic security official under the Biden administration and a current fellow at Columbia University. \"Whatever administration comes next, whether Republican or Democrat, will find it very tempting to continue to use them.\"\n\nThis hasn't all happened out of nowhere — the US has, for a decade, been increasingly comfortable with industrial policy, meaning the government taking a more active role in steering the economy. Trump 1.0 implemented several protectionist policies, including imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, engaging in a trade war with China, and renegotiating the NAFTA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Rather than rolling everything back, Biden left in place many of Trump's tariffs, and his administration pushed in a state-nudged economic direction with the CHIPS Act, which was meant to support the US semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, put tax credits and funds toward sectors such as electric vehicles and solar energy. And even prior to Trump and Biden, the government hasn't completely steered clear of steering the economy when needed. See: The New Deal and the aforementioned response to the financial crisis.\n\nStill, overall, the US has largely taken a hands-off approach to the economy over the last 40 years and been critical of countries that don't.\n\n\"The United States has spent decades tsk-tsking the rest of the world about state-owned enterprises and industrial policy and state capitalism,\" says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. On the Trump administration's current about-face, \"the hypocrisy is pretty big,\" he says.\n\nThe latest turn is a significant step further. Instead of deploying a more typical playbook — grants, loans, tariffs, etc. — that can be seen as at least somewhat neutral in its application, the White House is now picking and choosing companies to get involved in. In broad strokes, one can see what they're getting at here. The companies on Trump's investment list are in important sectors where the US lags behind, and they fit into the president's overall theory of the case on the economy: it's better to have and make stuff here. Take Intel: The Trump administration wants to make sure the US is not reliant on semiconductor companies such as TSMC, which is based in Taiwan, since the island is vulnerable to China. It's a similar story with critical minerals companies, which mine, process, or refine materials crucial for a range of products, from smartphones to defense technology. Even some progressives see these as worthwhile endeavors. Sen. Bernie Sanders is into the Intel deal, telling Reuters in August that \"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment.\"\n\nWhat some critics find head-scratching is why specific companies are being chosen. Why Intel in particular, and even more peculiarly, why a startup helmed by Intel's former CEO? On a macro level, the end goal may be the same as more typical industrial policy — supporting certain sectors — but it's being performed on a micro level. Trump has also been critical of policies with the same end in mind. Back in March, he told Congress to \"get rid of\" the CHIPS Act.\n\n\"It is fair to say that Intel has been underperforming, but I don't know of anyone who feels that if Intel continued to underperform, there was a risk of taking the entire technology sector down,\" Bartnick says. \"We haven't seen a rationale for how these particular companies were selected, how these particular industries were selected, how the valuations were reached.\"\n\nThe Trump administration may have determined that the US can't win its existential battle with China and protect its economic priorities with the regular tools in the toolbox. William Henagan, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says those instruments have proven effective in the past because of the size of America's economy and the critical role the US dollar plays in global finance. The fact that the White House thinks throwing around our national weight is not enough to achieve their desired outcomes is an eyebrow-raising sign.\n\n\"We've basically been able to use restrictive enforcement tools to achieve international policy outcomes that we were interested in,\" Henagan says. \"Those are no longer sufficient.\"\n\nA White House official tells me there's \"very much\" a logic to what the administration is doing in taking equity stakes in strategic industries and sectors. \"The point with the equity stakes is that it's a tool that other countries have used with various degrees of success, but we're not indiscriminately trying to take equity stakes in everyone, in anything. We see it as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" they say. Losing Intel, for example, would be an \"asymmetric blow\" to America's national and economic security.\n\nThe equity stakes are a \"rounding error\" compared with the trillions of dollars of GDP being affected by \"what are very unequivocally free-market or pro-capitalist policymaking\" activities, the official says, pointing to tax cuts and deregulation, among other moves. But they are an acknowledgment that the White House feels the free market has fallen short in shoring up these critical sectors.\n\nWhile the motivation for taking stakes in companies may be clear-ish, the execution is not, nor are the potential consequences.\n\n\"We know very little about the other rights that are associated with these deals,\" Bartnick says.\n\nIt's hard to predict exactly how the government will wield its equity-derived power. How will these stakes dilute the rights of existing shareholders? And what happens if the US government's interests don't align with those of other stockholders? Will the company feel compelled to follow through on what the government says, regardless? How exactly will the terms of these deals work? And even if the government doesn't use the hard power of its vote shares, it can use soft power to keep companies it's invested in from stepping out of line.\n\nThe federal government's Intel investment will be passive, meaning it gets no board representation or other governance rights, and it's agreed to vote with the company's board of directors — with limited exceptions. As part of the MP Materials agreement, the company isn't allowed to nominate any board members who are not US citizens without the Department of Defense's consent. However, the government will generally vote with the company's board, with exceptions.\n\nThe way American capitalism is generally supposed to work is that money flows to companies that are doing the best job of utilizing it. The whole idea is that market capital allocation is designed to separate the wheat from the chaff. These stakes may distort that — the government is choosing which specific firms it wants to come out ahead.\n\nWhat's more, if the federal government is going about throwing around money, rather than businesses focusing on making the best products and services possible, they may turn their attention to currying favor with the president. Whether or not this is crony capitalism or merely appears to be doesn't really matter. If executives make the calculation that it's much better to be on Trump's good side than his bad side, they may fall in line preemptively. The competition isn't for customers, market share, or innovation — it's for the president's affection.\n\nThe Trump administration doesn't want to be in the business of running private companies from the Oval Office, the White House official tells me, but the point is for the government to have some sway. \"Obviously, the intent wasn't for us to take an equity stake in Intel and then they just close down their Ohio foundry and ship it off to Taiwan,\" the official says. The hope is there's an \"overlap\" between what's best for companies and best for American economic national security.\n\nScott Kennedy, a senior advisor in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells me that in an economy as vast and varied as America's, Washington's power is relatively limited, and this activity could be just a \"minor nuisance\" to industry. \"On the other hand, if there are more cases, then it will begin to affect the decision-making of businesses and will increasingly orient them to think about how they should do business in a way that benefits the current administration as opposed to what benefits their company or the US national interest,\" he says. \"And I think that that could have a distorting effect eventually.\"\n\n\"It's better if tech CEOs spend less time in DC and more time coming up with new products,\" says Owen Zidar, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\nNearly every analyst, economist, and academic I spoke to for this story agreed that Trump's version of American state capitalism is more a reflection of where the US is going than where it has been. It's not the same as what China's doing, and it's not socialism, but it's an unconventional step further down the road that the US has been on for a while.\n\nOn issues such as antitrust enforcement, industrial policy, and tariffs, factions within both the Republican and Democratic parties are leaning more towards interventionism. Trump is being more obvious with his actions and intentions — there's a reason Tim Cook is showing up in the Oval Office with a gold plaque. This is a situation where there's likely no backtracking. Other countries are reacting to America's inward turn as well — it's why Canada is shoring up its domestic economy, and Europe is taking a corporatist turn.\n\n\"It changes the political equilibrium in a way that other countries pursue similar policies. And we get away from the brand of capitalism that we were doing before,\" Lane says.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to look beyond the previous consensus. Capitalism is increasingly unpopular in America, especially among young people, for a reason. For many Americans, the system isn't working. Instead, it's breeding inequality, shipping jobs overseas, and making the overall economy more precarious. During the pandemic, the public got a front-row seat to the fragility of our supply chains and the risks associated with the just-in-time, globally distributed setup. Political leaders and policymakers aren't wrong to wonder if the state shouldn't take a heavier hand in shoring up important industries, supporting vital companies, and making investments where the private market might blanch at the risks.\n\nThe White House has indicated that more equity investments are likely on the horizon, but the criteria for who it will pick are a black box. \"We should entirely leave it up to the market to do whatever it wants\" is not a great approach to the economy. Neither is, \"Who gets a leg up depends on how the president's feeling today.\" It's odd for Trump to seize the means of production a little bit.\n\n\"We've had this sort of ideological view that's now breaking down a bit because we've realized that what we've been doing isn't good enough, isn't adequate enough,\" says Robert Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech and science policy think tank. \"I wish there was a sort of unified field theory for this in the Trump administration, but I don't think so.\"\n\nWhile the motives are understandable, the mechanics are anything but. It's unclear how the US will exit these investments, or, once it does, how much money it will actually make. However, in the context of the enormous federal budget, the return will be minimal. It pushes the global economy into new territory, and it's hard to know whether it's one the US will always like.\n\n\"We have spent decades, under both Democrats and even more so under Republicans, criticizing certainly China and Russia, but also Italy, Germany, and the UK on their use of these tools,\" Bartnick says. \"And if the US starts to go down that path as well, it will give not just our adversaries, but also our allies, even greater license to do the same.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Financial firms are planning trips to Venezuela to scout out new investment opportunities. Bill Ackman praised the move as \"good for America.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds.\n\nHere's what they've been saying:\n\nMyers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the \"centerpiece\" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow \"faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment.\"\n\nMyers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nBremmer, founder of the political risk research and consulting firm, Eurasia Group, in a post on LinkedIn, wrote that the \"US presumption is next Venezuelan leaders will now do what the Americans want because they've just seen the 'or else.'\"\n\nAccompanying the post was a photo of a drawing of a horse. The hindquarters of the horse were drawn in intricate detail, and labeled \"SOF operation to capture Maduro,\" referencing the special operations forces mission that was executed early Saturday. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned \"plans for future of Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly call it a plan,\" Bremmer added.\n\nIn a separate post, he wrote: \"The law of the jungle is dangerous. What applies to your enemies one day can apply to you the next. Make no mistake where the world is heading here.\"\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that \"The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.\"\n\nGao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in \"the brave new world of international law.\"\n\n\"Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,\" he continued. \"It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.\"\n\nThe Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, \"no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.\"\n\n\"What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?\" Warren wrote. \"The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.\"\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was \"heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.\"\n\nIn another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption \"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.\"\n\nMusk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening protests in Iran sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy are putting new pressure on its theocracy.\n\nTehran is still reeling from a 12-day war launched by Israel in June that saw the United States bomb nuclear sites in Iran. Economic pressure, intensified in September by the return of United Nations sanctions on the country over its atomic program, has put Iran's rial currency into a free fall, now trading at some 1.4 million to $1.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” — a coalition of countries and militant groups backed by Tehran — has been decimated in the years since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.\n\nA new threat by U.S. President Donald Trump warning Iran that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the U.S. “will come to their rescue\" has taken on new meaning after American troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran.\n\nHere's what to know about the protests and the challenges facing Iran's government.\n\nHow widespread the protests are\n\nDemonstrations have reached over 170 locations in 25 of Iran’s 31 provinces, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported early Sunday. The death toll had reached at least 15 killed, it added, with more than 580 arrests. The group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.\n\nUnderstanding the scale of the protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in general in Iran also face limits on reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country, as well as the threat of harassment or arrest by authorities.\n\nBut the protests do not appear to be stopping, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday said “rioters must be put in their place.”\n\nThe collapse of the rial has led to a widening economic crisis in Iran. Prices are up on meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table. The nation has been struggling with an annual inflation rate of some 40%.\n\nIn December, Iran introduced a new pricing tier for its nationally subsidized gasoline, raising the price of some of the world’s cheapest gas and further pressuring the population. Tehran may seek steeper price increases in the future, as the government now will review prices every three months.\n\nThe protests began first with merchants in Tehran before spreading. While initially focused on economic issues, the demonstrations soon saw protesters chanting anti-government statements as well. Anger has been simmering over the years, particularly after the 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody that triggered nationwide demonstrations.\n\nIran's “Axis of Resistance,\" which grew in prominence in the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, is reeling.\n\nIsrael has crushed Hamas in the devastating war in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group in Lebanon, has seen its top leadership killed by Israel and has been struggling since. A lightning offensive in December 2024 overthrew Iran’s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, President Bashar Assad, after years of war there. Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels also have been pounded by Israeli and U.S. airstrikes.\n\nChina meanwhile has remained a major buyer of Iranian crude oil, but hasn't provided overt military support. Neither has Russia, which has relied on Iranian drones in its war on Ukraine.\n\nThe West worries about Iran’s nuclear program\n\nIran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials have increasingly threatened to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels prior to the U.S. attack in June, making it the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.\n\nTehran also increasingly cut back its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, as tensions increased over its nuclear program in recent years. The IAEA's director-general has warned Iran could build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”\n\nIran recently said it was no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. But there's been no significant talks in the months since the June war.\n\nWhy relations between Iran and the US are so tense\n\nIran decades ago was one of the United States’ top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule.\n\nBut in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. Then came the Islamic Revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which created Iran’s theocratic government.\n\nLater that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed.\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the U.S. backed Saddam Hussein. During that conflict, the U.S. launched a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea as part of the so-called “Tanker War,” and later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the U.S. military said it mistook for a warplane.\n\nIran and the U.S. have seesawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, and relations peaked with the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw Iran greatly limit its program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, sparking tensions in the Mideast that intensified after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",

    "description": "The US is once again teetering into an economy where high earners keep things afloat, and lower earners see cooling prospects.",
    "fullText": "The post-pandemic era marked by growing wages and opportunities for lower-income Americans has flipped around.\n\nThe K-shaped economy is back, and it could mean more trouble in 2026.\n\nFor higher earners, economic outcomes and opportunities are chugging along, albeit perhaps a bit muted than during the boom labor market of a few years ago. For those at the bottom, in lower-earning positions that are traditionally more sensitive to downturns, things are looking worse.\n\nIt might also spell rocky times ahead for an economy that's largely being propped up by the spending and opportunities of those at the top.\n\nThe return to a K-shaped economy has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve and its voting members. In minutes from the December Fed meeting, a majority of participants \"mentioned evidence of stronger spending growth for higher-income households,\" while lower-earning households were becoming \"increasingly price sensitive\" and adjusting their spending in response to price increases for essentials.\n\nAt a December press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he's not sure how long this can last. \"Most of the consumption does happen by people who have more means,\" Powell said. \"I think the top third accounts for way more than a third of the consumption, for example. So, it's a good question how sustainable that is.\"\n\nThe \"K\" has been slowly shaping up over the last couple of years, and has accelerated in the last few months: A Bank of America Institute report showed that the growth in credit and debit card spending among lower-income and higher-income households split into a K shape around this past spring, with higher-income households experiencing spending growth near 3% year-over-year in late 2025, compared to less than 1% growth for the lower-income households.\n\n\"While the 'K shape' continues, it will likely, in our view, gather additional focus in 2026,\" the authors wrote.\n\nOn the income side, those at the bottom are doing worse than those at the top. The Atlanta Fed wage growth tracker showed that growth for the highest quartile of the wage distribution surpassed that of the lowest quartile in October 2024 and has remained consistently higher since then. Wage growth for the lowest quartile skyrocketed back in 2022, reaching the highest point on record in the fall after the gap between the two quartiles widened to the highest point in July.\n\n\"People who are putting a lot more of their income toward essential expenses are feeling burdened by that at a much greater capacity than people who have much higher incomes at the same time, unlike during that post-pandemic environment,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, said.\n\nAnd while wages are trending higher for the upper quartile, it doesn't necessarily mean blockbuster gains — part of the precarity of the K as inflation remains stubborn. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, said cooler income growth has pushed many upper-median and below households to lean on savings and credit.\n\n\"A K-shaped consumer spending outlook is simply not sustainable in the long-run — eventually income pulls spending,\" Daco said in written commentary.\n\nTo be sure, some economists and analysts don't think the K-shaped economy ever really left. \"We've been in a K-shaped economy for the better part of two decades,\" Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist of RSM, said, pointing to the 2008 financial crisis as one factor kick-starting the uneven outcomes. Now, Brusuelas said, economic inequality has \"clearly deepened.\"\n\n\"There was a brief period of narrowing early in the post-pandemic era when fiscal policy was put in place to provide a substitute for lost wages and mitigate the post-recession transition of the pandemic,\" he said.\n\nAnna Paulson, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said higher-income households have been able to \"spend freely,\" benefiting from the ongoing robust stock market. The wealthiest 1% of Americans hold nearly half of the country's corporate equities and mutual funds, data from the Federal Reserve's Distributional Financial Accounts showed.\n\n\"So, while headline growth is shaping up to be pretty decent this year, the base of support looks different — with a lot of concentration at the top,\" Paulson said.\n\nIn Brusuelas's view, the US economy is largely locked into that K-shape and would need serious policy changes to shift it, and he doesn't see that as likely happening in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" Brusuelas said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"\n\nHow is the economy affecting you?

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening demonstrations sparked by Iran's ailing economy spread Thursday into the Islamic Republic's rural provinces, with at least seven people being killed in the first fatalities reported among security forces and protesters, authorities said.\n\nThe deaths may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran’s theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded elsewhere. The fatalities, two on Wednesday and five on Thursday, occurred in four cities, largely home to Iran’s Lur ethnic group.\n\nThe protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the demonstrations have yet to be countrywide and have not been as intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.\n\nThe most-intense violence appeared to strike Azna, a city in Iran's Lorestan province, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, online videos purported to show objects in the street ablaze and gunfire echoing as people shouted: “Shameless! Shameless!”\n\nThe semiofficial Fars news agency reported three people had been killed. Other media, including pro-reform outlets, cited Fars for the report while state-run media did not fully acknowledge the violence there or elsewhere. It wasn't clear why there wasn't more reporting over the unrest, but journalists had faced arrest over their reporting in 2022.\n\nIn Lordegan, a city in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, online videos showed demonstrators gathered on a street, with the sound of gunfire in the background. The footage matched known features of Lordegan, some 470 kilometers (290 miles) south of Tehran.\n\nFars, citing an anonymous official, said two people had been killed during the protests Thursday.\n\nThe Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said two people had been killed there, identifying the dead as demonstrators. It also shared a still image of what appeared to be an Iranian police officer, wearing body armor and wielding a shotgun.\n\nIn 2019, the area around Lordegan saw widespread protests and demonstrators reportedly damaged government buildings after a report said people there had been infected with HIV by contaminated needles used at a local health care clinic.\n\nIn Fuladshahr in Iran's Isfahan province, state media reported on the death of a man there Thursday that activist groups attributed to the police opening fire on demonstrators.\n\n'Protests due to economic pressures'\n\nA separate demonstration Wednesday night reportedly led to the 21-year-old volunteer in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Basij force.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member’s death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, which is believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Lorestan province.\n\nThe Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,” he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.\n\n“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,\" Pourali said. \"The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”\n\nThe protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, over 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Tehran. Local prosecutor Kazem Nazari said 20 people had been arrested after the protests and that calm had returned to the city, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.\n\nIran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters. However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.\n\nMeanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.\n\nIran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.\n\nThe protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well. The country's leaders are still reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country in June. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the war.\n\nIran has said it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. However, those talks have yet to happen as U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned Tehran against reconstituting its atomic program.",

    "description": "I'm keeping track of Trump's economy right here. Every month. Enjoy!",
    "fullText": "(AKA the unemployment rate, cost of eggs, gas prices, inflation, the Dow Jones, whether citizens received a stimulus check, and Trump's overall approval rating.)\n\nIt wasn't exactly convincing, considering Americans are facing massive insurance hikes in 2026 because Trump and his party recently chose to allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire in two weeks. Likewise, our pockets are shrinking as the cost of food and living bloat.\n\nNote: Data on inflation is released a few weeks after each month has ended, so our reports will look at the previous month's numbers.\n\nGetting data on the unemployment rate between September and November has been plagued and vague due to the government shutdown this year. September's numbers were late. October's rate was altogether canceled, and November appears to have come in at 4.6% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor someone who brags about a booming economy, the steady increase in Americans searching for work sure doesn't bode well for the president's claims.\n\nAh, the price of eggs. Another cursed number.\n\nFood indexes are also released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and so we won't be getting an October number. I can, however, report that eggs officially dropped under the $3 mark, and you can find a grade A dozen for around $2.86 on average in November.\n\nShifting from a positive to a negative, the cost of beef is still skyrocketing, and I continue to find that giving up red meat this year was one of the best financial decisions I've made.\n\nIf you're looking for a pound of beef, prices jumped to $6.50 on average in November.\n\n(And yes, the government shutdown is still acting as the Ghost of Christmas past, and we will not be getting an October average here either.)\n\nGas is going down, though! I'm sure y'all will flood the comment section with local prices wayyyyy higher than the national average, and wish you saw numbers as low as this, but according to the Energy Information Administration, a gallon of gasoline cost around $3.179 last month.\n\nInflation dropped to its lowest point in months, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2.7% figure has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"For the inflation report, many economists were caught off guard by the way the B.L.S. handled the distortions, which is part of why they are casting so much doubt on the numbers published today.\"\n\nThe above is fancy speak to say that the government shutdown caused \"distortions\" in the data surrounding inflation, and so it may or may not paint a prettier picture than reality.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones neither rose nor fell in November, according to Stat Muse. So, there's that.\n\nWe're approaching a full year under Trump's second presidency, and there's still no stimulus check in sight for struggling Americans. What happened to those $2,000 tariff dividend checks Trump promised on Truth Social? I haven't heard a single word of it since Nov. 9.\n\nYIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES.

YIKES.\n\nTrump's approval rating hit an all-time low for this term. Gallup reports that only 36% of Americans approve of how Trump's second presidency is going. It's looking BLEAK.\n\nIt's not uncommon for me to see comments from conservatives who claim the data presented in this report is \"fake news.\" Usually, I point to the fact that the data is retrieved from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Energy Administration, which fall under Trump's own administration. So, if the numbers are \"fake news,\" that would mean these MAGA commenters believe Trump's people are spreading fake news...\n\nI appreciate the readership, regardless. <3\n\nAlso in In the News: 27 Photos Of Donald Trump In 2025 He Probably Reaaaaaally Doesn't Want You To See\n\nAlso in In the News: \"Oh My God\": People Are Not Holding Back AT ALL After Trump Made Another White House \"Upgrade,\" And Hoo Boy, You Gotta See This One\n\nAlso in In the News: Donald Trump Hated His Time Magazine Cover...

    "fullText": "Hollywood remains the world's entertainment nexus, but many next-gen creators have decided they don't need a Los Angeles address to make it big.\n\nMiami, Las Vegas, and Seattle all attract more top Instagram influencers per capita than LA, according to new research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm.\n\nThe top two by total creator count were LA (over 12,000) and New York (nearly 11,000), followed by Miami (about 6,000).\n\nOther major creator communities have formed in established film markets, such as Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, which have emerged due to their lower cost of living and production tax incentives. But other top creator cities — Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia — lie outside those secondary film markets.\n\nThe ability to create content for social platforms from anywhere means creators can build a livelihood from just about anywhere. Talent managers say that, apart from when they want a creator to attend an in-person event, brands rarely request a city-specific creator when seeking a partner.\n\n\"You do have people in LA and New York making the lion's share of the dollars. But now they're increasing everywhere else,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. \"Eventually, there will be a hot influencer in Idaho.\"\n\nLooking at cities by concentration of creators, Miami comes in No. 1, outranking LA and NYC.\n\nSome creators are drawn to places that already have a robust creative community, like Nashville or Las Vegas. Others want to be near fashion and retail, which fuels a lot of the creator economy. LTK, a major e-commerce platform that connects influencers to shoppers, is based in Dallas, as was Neiman Marcus for a long time. Dude Perfect, a superstar creator group known for sports-focused stunt videos, is based in nearby Frisco. Miami, where Alix Earle gained social media fame and often appears, experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes.\n\nCreators also move to be near family and for a lower cost of living. It makes sense for people building a brand based on themselves to work in areas that reflect their identity. The biggest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, a.k.a. MrBeast, chose his hometown of Greenville, NC, as his base.\n\nDude Perfect has recently embarked on a major expansion in Texas. CEO Andrew Yaffe said there's no need to be in LA with access to top brands and talent there.\n\n\"We'll be here as far in the future as we can see,\" he previously told Business Insider. \"There's no shortage of opportunity for us here.\"\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.",

    "description": "ETH Zurich researchers have developed a process that can be used on site to render environmental toxins such as DDT and lindane harmless and convert them into valuable chemicals – a breakthrough for the remediation of contaminated sites and a sustainable circular economy.",
    "fullText": "Persistent organic pollutants such as DDT and lindane still pollute the environment and affect humans decades after their use.\n\nETH researchers have developed a new electrochemical process that completely dehalogenates these long-lived toxins and converts them into valuable industrial chemicals.\n\nThe method uses cheap equipment, prevents side reactions and could be used on contaminated landfills, soils or sludge.\n\nMobile systems could be used on site in the future – an important step towards the remediation of contaminated sites and the creation of a sustainable circular economy.\n\nThey were once considered miracle workers – insecticides such as lindane or DDT were produced and used millions of times during the 20th century. But what was hailed as progress led to a global environmental catastrophe: persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are so chemically stable that they remain in soil, water and organisms for decades. They accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals and thus enter the human food chain. Many of these substances were banned long ago, but their traces can still be found today – even in human blood.\n\nHow to remediate such contaminated sites, be they soils, bodies of water or landfills, is one of the major unresolved questions of environmental protection. How can highly stable poisons be rendered harmless without creating new problems? Researchers at ETH Zurich, led by Bill Morandi, Professor of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, have now found a promising approach. Using an innovative electrochemical method, they are not only able to break down these long-lived pollutants but also to convert them into valuable raw materials for the chemical industry.\n\nA key distinction between this and previous work is that the carbon skeleton of the pollutants is recycled and made reusable, while the halide component is sequestered as a harmless inorganic salt. “The previous methods were also energetically inefficient,” says Patrick Domke, a doctoral student in Morandi’s group. He explains: “The processes were expensive and still led to outcomes that were harmful to the environment.”\n\nTogether with electrochemistry specialist Alberto Garrido-Castro, a former postdoc in this group, Domke developed a process that renders the pollutants in question completely harmless. During this project, the two researchers were able to draw on the many years of experience of ETH professor Morandi, who has been working on the transformation of such compounds for years. “The key advance of this new technology is the use of alternating current to sequester the problematic halogen atoms as innocuous salts such as NaCl (table salt), while still generating valuable hydrocarbons,” says Morandi.\n\nElectrolysis enables almost complete dehalogenation of pollutants under mild, environmentally friendly and cost-effective conditions. It cleaves the stable carbon-halogen bonds, leaving behind only harmless salts such as table salt and useful hydrocarbons such as benzene, diphenylethane or cyclododecatriene. These are actually sought-after intermediates in the chemical industry, for example, for plastics, varnishes, coatings and pharmaceutical applications. In this way, the technology not only contributes to the remediation of contaminated sites but also to the sustainable circular economy.\n\n“What makes our process so special from a technical point of view is that we supply electricity using alternating current, similar to the electrical waveform delivered to households. It is one of the most cost-effective resources in chemistry,” explains Garrido-Castro. “Alternating current protects the electrodes from wear, which is why we can reuse them for many subsequent electrolysis cycles. In addition, the alternating current suppresses unwanted side reactions and the formation of poisonous chlorine gas, allowing the pollutant’s halogen atoms to be fully converted to inorganic salts.” The reactor used by the researchers consists of an undivided electrolysis cell in which dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used as a solvent – itself a by-product of the pulp process in paper production.\n\nThe process can be applied not only to pure substances but also to mixtures from contaminated soils. Soil or sludge can therefore be treated without pre-treatment or further separation processes. A prototype of the reactor has already been successfully tested on classic environmental toxins such as lindane and DDT. “Our system is mobile and can be assembled on site. This eliminates the need to transport these hazardous substances,” explains Domke.\n\nOn 27 November 2025 at ETH Zurich @ Open-i, ETH Zurich will award the Spark Award for the best invention of the year for the 14th time. The criteria for this award are originality, patent strength and market potential.\n\nSpark Award ceremony, Industry Day @ Open-i, Thursday, 27 November 2025, 1.30 p.m., Zurich Convention Center.

That's one lesson behind the abrupt exodus of talent from the esports and marketing company FaZe Clan last week.\n\nBuilding a business led by an influencer or celebrity can make you a boatload of money. Just ask the teams behind Kim Kardashian's Skims or George Clooney's Casamigos tequila, which both crossed $1 billion in value.\n\nBut starting a company where the product you're selling is the influencer — such that you make money primarily from their social-media reach, content, or ability to do brand deals — can be risky.\n\nIf a YouTuber or TikTok creator loses popularity due to a scandal or a sudden algorithm change, the revenue dries up. If they become burned out from posting or simply decide they no longer want to work with an intermediary company, then poof!\n\nThat's the situation FaZe Clan appears to have found itself in this week after all six creators its website listed as its talent roster announced they were leaving the company in separate posts on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nCompany investor Matt Kalish, who cofounded DraftKings, told Bloomberg that the current financial structure of FaZe Clan is \"unsustainable\" and he had offered talent the option to go independent or sign deals with his company, HardScope, which they declined.\n\nFaZe Clan acknowledged the departures in its own post on X, writing that \"this era of FaZe\" had \"come to a close.\" With its most famous talent gone and their millions of followers in tow, the company is leaning into its esports business that makes money from league participation, player transfer fees, and IP licensing.\n\nFounded in 2010, FaZe Clan started as a group of friends who enjoyed making gaming videos. The group amassed millions of fans and began making revenue through brand deals. FaZe Clan went public in 2022, sharing in investor filings that it pulled in tens of millions of dollars in revenue from brand sponsorships and other advertising tied to its content. Other business lines, such as consumer products or esports, represented a smaller piece of the pie.\n\nFaZe Clan, when it was still reporting its revenue sources as a public company in 2022 and 2023, relied heavily on brand deals and YouTube ads to make money.\n\nFaZe Clan's stock plummeted in value during its first year trading on the Nasdaq. After cutting about 20% of its staff in early 2023, the company sold itself to gaming and marketing firm GameSquare in March 2024. GameSquare later sold FaZe Clan's media business in multiple transactions to Kalish and others, while retaining the esports business.\n\nThe sudden departure of FaZe's creators — and its struggle in recent years — highlights a key risk that should keep any creator-economy CEO up at night. Being overly reliant on specific creators or revenue sources can be a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe solution: diversify, diversify, diversify.\n\nFaZe Clan, GameSquare, and HardScope did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "‘Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary isn't blaming the economy for your empty bank account. He's blaming you. And he's not shy about it.\n\n\"Listen, I'm going to tell you something most people don't want to hear,\" O'Leary said in a December YouTube video titled \"If You Want To Get Rich, Stop Buying These 5 Things.\" \"You're broke. Not because you don't make enough money, not because the economy is rigged against you, not because you didn't get lucky. You're broke because you keep buying stupid things that are keeping you poor.\"\n\nFrom the first line, O'Leary makes it clear—building wealth doesn't start with more income. It starts with cutting the nonsense.\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nHis first target? That shiny new car in your driveway.\n\n\"Buying a new car is one of the dumbest financial decisions you can make,\" O'Leary said. A car drops 20% to 30% in value the second you drive it off the lot, he explained, turning thousands of dollars into dust—for nothing but \"that new car smell.\" And leasing? \"Leasing is the absolute worst,\" he said. \"You're renting a depreciating asset… You gave the dealership thousands of dollars for the privilege of borrowing their car.\"\n\nHis advice is brutal but simple: \"Buy a three-year-old certified pre-owned car. Let somebody else take the depreciation hit. That's what rich people do.\"\n\nO'Leary isn't just coming for your car. He's coming for your kitchen—or more accurately, the one you refuse to use. \"People tell me they don't have money to invest. And then I watch them spend $15 on a salad for lunch,\" he said. That's not a splurge. It's financial self-sabotage.\n\nThe average American spends nearly $4,000 a year eating out, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. O'Leary runs the math: investing that same $3,500 annually for 30 years at 10% could become more than $600,000. \"You're trading half a million dollars in retirement wealth for convenience and fancy meals you'll forget about in 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nPack your lunch. Make your coffee at home. \"These aren't sacrifices,\" O'Leary said. \"These are smart financial decisions.\" But when you do eat out, he says, at least make it count. \"Don't waste money on mediocre chain restaurants because you're too lazy to cook. That's not living well. That's being financially irresponsible.\"",

    "description": "AI in the workplace may boost speed and efficiency, but risks eroding confidence and critical thinking, the CEO of a digital economy think tank said.",
    "fullText": "AI appears to be making workers faster, more efficient, and more productive on paper.\n\nHowever, according to Mehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, which advises companies and governments on building the data centers that power AI, it may also be quietly eroding workers' confidence in their job skills.\n\nParyavi told Buisness Insider that excessive and poorly designed AI use in workplaces is driving what he called a \"quiet cognitive erosion\" and \"down-skilling.\"\n\n\"There used to be a notion called 'thinking outside the box,'\" he said. \"That notion will soon cease to exist when everyone draws on all their creativity, analytics, and innovation from a single box called AI.\"\n\nParyavi believes the most immediate casualty of heavy AI reliance is self-belief.\n\n\"If you come to believe that AI writes better than you and thinks smarter than you, you will lose your own confidence in yourself,\" he said.\n\nParyavi said the loss of confidence compounds quickly as workers begin deferring writing, analysis, and judgment to AI systems, gradually relying less on the skills they have built through years of reading, writing, learning, and observation.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you realize you are not good enough without this new tool, and day by day, you rely less on yourself and more on AI,\" he said.\n\nResearch is beginning to reflect that pattern. A new report from the Work AI Institute, produced with researchers from universities including Notre Dame, Harvard, and UC Santa Barbara, found that AI is turning ordinary office workers into people who feel smarter and more productive while their underlying skills slowly erode.\n\nRebecca Hinds, head of the Work AI Institute, told Business Insider that AI creates an illusion of expertise, which is especially risky for early-career employees who still need to establish their foundations.\n\nMuch of the problem, Paryavi said, lies in how leaders define productivity.\n\nAI's biggest promise is speed — faster reports, faster launches, faster analysis. But faster doesn't always mean better, Paryavi said.\n\nWhile AI can generate professional-sounding output, Paryavi said it often lacks the depth that comes from years of hands-on expertise.\n\nThat loss of depth is already visible, according to Anastasia Berg, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has said that workers who rely heavily on AI risk rapid skill atrophy, especially junior employees who never fully learn how to think through problems independently.\n\nParyavi isn't opposed to AI. He said the risk comes from indiscriminate use.\n\nCompanies should tailor AI access by job function, he said, rather than rolling it out universally. Some roles may benefit heavily from AI support, while others should rely primarily on human judgment.\n\nHe also discussed the importance of human involvement at both ends of the workflow — leading creative thinking at the beginning and quality-checking AI output at the end.\n\n\"What's critical to note is that you, the human you, must quality check AI, not the other way around,\" he said.\n\nAI may not eliminate jobs outright. But without deliberate limits, Paryavi said, it could quietly erode the confidence and thinking skills that careers are built on.\n\n\"How much technology do we really need, and how far are we willing to push the envelope? How much is enough?\" he said.",

    "description": "Japan's aging workforce, labor shortages, and government policies show how the country has adapted as 30% of its population is over 65.",
    "fullText": "While traversing the narrow, winding roads outside the Japanese town of Fujikawaguchiko, I stopped by a farm with a view of Mount Fuji, where a few locals were picking fruit. Most were older, and one was walking with a cane as she bent down to put berries into a bag.\n\nAt an udon shop, drivers and construction workers — some of whom looked to be in their 60s — were slurping noodles. The server said she knew people who have owned nearby restaurants and shops for decades.\n\nAfter settling back at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, I noticed that the older workers I had encountered in the city worked as crossing guards, cleaners, gift shop owners, taxi drivers, or wholesale workers. Only a handful of the older Tokyoites I observed were wearing the white-collar uniform of suits and ties.\n\nWhen I visited Japan in early December, I had just finished the capstone story of my 80 Over 80 series, the most in-depth look at America's older workers that I know of in modern press or academia. In the months prior, I interviewed nearly 200 Americans working past 80 in dozens of professions. I discovered that nearly 550,000 Americans in this demographic work, according to Census data, and the number is expected to continue increasing as the US workforce ages and the cost of living rises. In interviews, dozens of American researchers said government benefits fall short for millions of older Americans each year, adding that the US could look to countries like Japan for inspiration.\n\nJapan, like many of its neighbors, has experienced rapid aging over the last few decades. Nearly 30% of Japan's population is 65 and older, the highest of any country, according to government data. About one in four in this demographic works, meaning that about one in seven Japanese workers is 65 and older.\n\nComparatively, this demographic comprises about 18% of the US population, and roughly one in five works. The US has not aged as rapidly as East Asia, although increased longevity and lower birth rates have propelled aging enough that by 2030, the Census Bureau projects there will be more Americans 65 and older than under 18.\n\nJapan has adapted in many ways to its hyper-aging population. Its government has actively supported older worker employment, especially among older women. Seven researchers studying aging workforces in Japan and South Korea told Business Insider that keeping older workers employed at higher levels has helped both countries mitigate economic disaster and severe labor shortages.\n\nThe Japanese case is much different from the US, though, some researchers said. While the US will continue to experience lower growth rates, the workforce is unlikely to decline as much due to aging, assuming that comparatively higher fertility rates and immigration levels hold steady or rise. The desire to hire younger people is often stronger in the US than in Japan, though the US also has a younger population. The US also lacks a comprehensive healthcare system like Japan's, with worse general health metrics.\n\nResearchers agreed Japan still has a long way to go in supporting its aging workers and preparing mid-career workers for a stable retirement. For the US, Japan may offer a different glimpse into what an older workforce can look like.\n\nJapan is often the first country many think about when discussing aging. It boasts the world's highest number of centenarians per capita and advocates for active lifestyles, healthier diets, and reliable healthcare.\n\nMany older Japanese people work in manufacturing and retail, with an increasing number in service roles, construction, and medical-related services. America's oldest workers also frequently worked in these professions, particularly construction and education, according to Business Insider's analysis of Census Bureau data.\n\nJapan has mandated that companies provide more employment opportunities for workers aged 65 and above through its Act on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons. Legislation has encouraged companies to offer work opportunities until the age of 70, while former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida committed one trillion yen over five years for reskilling efforts.\n\nJapan also has Silver Human Resource Centers, which provide part-time work and skills training for older people, as well as the government's Lifetime Employment Support Office.\n\nThe World Economic Forum notes that 80% of Japanese workers hope to continue working in some capacity after retirement. Some companies have implemented policies that enable workers to extend their retirement age and offer promotions and salary increases beyond 60. Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides employers with subsidies if they can convert older contract workers to permanent jobs.\n\nJacob Funk Kierkegaard, a nonresident senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued in a paper from April that Japan has alleviated many potentially disastrous economic outcomes of hyper-aging. Kierkegaard told Business Insider that despite Japan's unique socioeconomic and aging circumstances, the country may be a model for its neighbors, as it raised female employment levels, expanded immigration pathways, and became more integrated with foreign economies.\n\n\"In many ways, the Japanese labor market was always much more receptive to the idea of employing workers at high ages because they tend to be healthy and motivated and do the type of service-sector jobs that you could do at a high age,\" Kierkegaard said.\n\nJapan isn't without its challenges, though.\n\n\"Even if Japan has done better than any other country, it doesn't mean that older workers in Japan have the same labor force participation or earnings potential as does prime-age workers,\" Kierkegaard said.\n\nMany older Japanese workers are employed in low-wage jobs, as many companies remain reluctant to hire older workers for higher-paid positions. Much like in the US, many Japanese companies assume older workers require more training and costs. Japan's hierarchical workplace structure also means it's often harder for an older worker to climb the ranks.\n\nPopulation aging contributes to critical labor shortages, according to Haruki Seitani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund and coauthor of a working paper on aging and AI in Japan. His research found that as Japan's labor force ages, productivity growth at work falls.\n\nMany older Japanese workers earn money out of necessity, said Yasuo Takao, a political scientist at Curtin University in Australia. Government survey data shows that over half of older Japanese workers were predominantly motivated by money, compared to under 16% who worked to feel fulfilled.\n\nJapan has struggled to expand employment among its older population, he said. Many companies are incentivized to \"retire\" their older workers, then rehire them at lower pay, which Takao said discourages them from \"remaining fully engaged.\"\n\n\"Japan's wage structure is harsh for older workers because it is built on an aging seniority system that inflates wages in mid-career and then resets them sharply at retirement age to control labour costs,\" Takao said.\n\nTakao said that older Japanese work at rising rates because labor shortages sometimes force firms to retain workers. Each year, more people leave the workforce than enter, and the working-age population has declined by over 10 million since 1995. Projections put the labor shortage at upwards of 6.4 million by 2030, and many companies have opted to automate tasks or give employees more work instead of hiring older workers.\n\nPension reforms have also made work more imperative for some older workers. Japan has a two-tier mandatory public pension system that relies on contributions, which is \"highly sensitive to population aging,\" Takao said.\n\nOlder Japanese workers tend to put in fewer hours compared to their younger peers, although this may be partly due to cuts in pension benefits that apply if they exceed a specific threshold.\n\n\"If Japan can transition from quantity-driven senior employment to quality-driven, skill-aligned senior employment, it stands to gain a powerful long-term demographic dividend: higher productivity, lower fiscal strain, stronger innovation capacity and a healthier, more engaged older population,\" Takao said. \"In this sense, treating older workers as a source of economic strength, not a cost to be managed, may be one of Japan's most important growth strategies in the decades ahead.\"\n\nJapan's approach to managing its aging workforce — and its shortcomings — can offer some valuable insights into what the US can do.\n\nTakao said the US can avoid the \"Japan trap\" of older workers needing to work by acting earlier to expand phased-retirement opportunities and protect older workers' earnings. Takao added that the US should invest earlier in training and job redesign so that older workers can secure jobs that match their skill sets.\n\nAbout 40% of female Japanese workers of all ages hold part-time jobs, compared to about a quarter of US female workers, and this rate increases with age. The US can learn from this discrepancy by providing more assistance to women who want to hold steady employment during their parenting and caregiving years.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Japan may be a cautionary tale. Japan has a relatively low exposure to AI, as determined by usage rate, compared to the US and China. Seitani said that AI could help aging-related labor shortages in occupations like transportation services, construction, and clerical work. Long-term, this could mean older workers may be less pressured to stay on the job or may have more flexible hours.\n\nAdditionally, the research suggests limited mobility between jobs with high and low AI exposure among Japanese occupations. The US can do more to promote technological education for older workers to improve their work outcomes.\n\nKierkegaard said many countries may have to adjust their lower retirement ages and more robust safety nets as they age, so older residents aren't as reliant on the social safety net, which might crumble if the demand exceeds the available resources.\n\n\"Ultimately, Japan's experience shows that aging societies require more than labor-supply fixes. They demand a broader redesign of pensions, work norms, care systems and urban infrastructure,\" Takao said. \"The United States still has time to adapt, but the window for proactive reform is narrowing.\"",
