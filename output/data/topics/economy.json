    "fullText": "Checking AI’s work may become a significant sector in the new machine learning economy; one that will have to significantly scale, and that cannot be automated. But as the years pass, human ‘experts’ are likely to deteriorate in quality.\n\nOpinion. My wife is an architect in one of the most log-jammed and intense bureaucracies in Europe. A significant part of the value of her education lies in the obtaining and maintenance of her right of signature – an expensive credential that must be re-subscribed to each year, and which allows her to literally ‘sign off’ on proposals whose implementation may be in the hundreds of thousands, even millions of euros.\n\nShe tells me that this is not the hardest part of her work, since it only formalizes her own calculations, or those of others, and that for this purpose, external work is not usually difficult to check.\n\nEssentially – as is so often also the case when appointing CEOs – this stamp (it is literally a stamp) mainly provides stakeholders with an ass to kick if things go wrong. In assuring accountability, it also facilitates insurance coverage and investor confidence, which would not be obtainable without such vouchsafes.\n\nIt’s the second time in my life I have seen this process directly in action; 25 years ago I was affianced to an oncologist in another notoriously glutinous EU bureaucracy, Italy, and saw the extent to which her expert signature was the last stage in a chain of trust to which many others besides herself had to contribute their expertise.\n\nI heard from both my ex-fiancée, in that period, and more recently my wife, that their professions were/are riddled with qualified hacks selling their stamp and eschewing more original or useful work as less profitable. Such cynical practitioners can charge high sums because they represent relatively scarce and essential resources.\n\nThis topic came to mind as I stumbled across a new and sprawling paper today, titled Some Simple Economics of AGI. In it, three researchers spanning MIT, Washington University in St. Louis, and UCLA, depict a near-future where the terrifying, job-destroying impetus towards AI-driven automation collides with the need for real-world asses to kick in high-stakes scenarios – thus leading to a new economy of human verification, ratification and responsibility*.\n\nThe paper contrasts with the media’s current imagining of shriven business sectors with extensive offices reduced down to single-person ‘overseers’, whose decisions are being used as training data to (hopefully) fire even this last shred of meatware†.\n\nRather, the authors believe that practical considerations and compliance requirements will focus enormous attention on the ‘rubber-stamping’ humans that placate a company’s (AI/human/AI-aided) legal department:\n\n‘For companies, the core strategic insight is that verification is no longer a mere compliance function, but a primary production technology—and increasingly, their most defensible one. This dictates a structural shift: investing heavily in observability, expanding verification-grade ground truth, and reorganizing around a “sandwich” topology (human intent → machine execution → human verification and underwriting).\n\n‘In an economy where raw output is commoditized, competitive advantage migrates to the scarce talent and data capable of reliably steering and certifying agentic systems—generating network effects not in sheer output, but in trusted outcomes.’\n\nThe authors hypothesize that the defining constraint on growth may not be intelligence – which AI has now ‘decoupled from biology’ – but verification bandwidth.\n\nThe paper describes the move toward AGI as a widening divergence between the expense of producing machine output and the expense of checking that output – the latter of which remains tied to finite human time and lived experience.\n\nGenerating plans, reports, designs, and recommendations would in this scenario become cheap and abundant, while determining which of them are sound, aligned, and safe enough to act on would become the ‘scarce function’. The effective limit on deployment would therefore not be how much output systems can produce, but how much of that output can be credibly verified.\n\nThus, instead of rewarding ever more specialized skill in measurable tasks, the system, the authors predict, will begin to reward measurability itself: work that can be parametrized will drift toward commoditization as its execution cost nears the marginal cost of compute, with value accruing instead in high-quality ground truth, reliable audit trails, and institutional mechanisms for assigning and absorbing responsibility.\n\nTherefore, in a verification economy, the advantage would lie less in producing content, and \n\nIf automation keeps accelerating while verification stays limited by human time and attention, the paper predicts that a Hollowed Economy would emerge, where, as the cost of automating work falls, more and more agents would be deployed because it makes economic sense to do so – even though the ability to properly check their output would not grow at the same speed. In that scenario, the share of work that is genuinely verified would shrink, with all the negative consequences that entails.\n\nConversely, an Augmented Economy would ensure that verification capacity would expand in tandem with automation. This would involve a deliberate investment in structured training to preserve expertise, as well as new liability frameworks that can absorb risk. Deployment would then be tied to what can actually be checked and insured – effectively, a very old bottleneck brought center stage by an unprecedented scale of technological development:\n\n‘In the technology sector, the dominant revenue model will shift from monetizing software access (Software-as-a-Service) to monetizing outcomes (“Software-as-Labor”). Consequently, firms will be valued primarily on their capacity to absorb tail risk through Liability-as-a-Service.\n\n‘Execution is now infinitely scalable; the legal and financial capacity to absorb its inevitable failures is the new bottleneck.’\n\nIndeed, the preservation of domain expertise in humans is critical to the problem, since a culture of industrialized oversight, according to the authors, would risk over time to degrade the quality of those performing the oversight – because subsequent generations of overseers would no longer possess direct and lived experience of the domains requiring verification.\n\nArguably, at that stage, the quality of oversight would truly be susceptible to automation, since new decisions would be formed solely on the basis of prior decisions. However, that would leave stakeholders without a kickable ass, or a viable business model. It would also render such a role so volatile and risk-strewn as to be unappealing, even in a climate of low employment.\n\nSequestering credentialed professionals such as doctors and architects into a well-paid but highly-burdened ‘rubber-stamping’ position is likely to erode their value in such a role, over time: the further in the past their actual field-experience recedes, the more ‘theoretical’ their decisions could become, as their abandoned domain continues to evolve in their absence.\n\n(This is familiar even in pre-AI business culture, in the form of skilled staff who progress into management and become increasingly out-of-touch with novel developments, eventually undermining their worth as overseers and organizers. It’s also familiar to Star Trek: TNG fans, in the form of the Pakleds – a race who use advanced technology extensively, but no longer know how to create or to fix it.)\n\nEntry-level execution has historically served as the training ground for future experts; but if automation eliminates the routine tasks through which judgment is cultivated, the future supply of capable verifiers will shrink, the authors suggest.\n\nThus the paper augurs a paradox: the more powerful agentic systems become, the more society will depend on a stock of human expertise that those same systems may erode.\n\nAnd let’s remember that this is not in any way a technical problem, nor susceptible to a technological solution. In many ways this syndrome suggests the logistical equivalent of AI model collapse – except that here we are considering the undermining of an economic model.\n\n‘From a policy perspective, the core challenge is a profound structural asymmetry: the gains of AI deployment are aggressively privatized, while the systemic risks are socialized. Firms and individuals capture the upside of automation while externalizing catastrophic tail risks.\n\n‘Without shared verification infrastructure and rigorous liability pricing, the market will rationally drift toward a Hollow Economy—an equilibrium characterized by explosive measured activity, but fundamentally hollowed-out human control.’\n\nThe authors define the predicted crisis as a measurability gap, wherein quantifiable processes can be automated away from all human contribution, leaving n-hard or n-legal processes that still require human expertise.\n\nHowever, my wife’s experience suggests that the complexity or difficulty of a process is not necessarily related to the need for accountability in that process; many of the things that she ‘signs off’ represent trivial problems or calculations in themselves, but are consequential in the breach. And the more litigious business culture becomes, the more underwriters and investors will require human accountability across a wider range of processes.\n\nSo, transitioning to the verification economy could cause a different crisis to the one that is currently garnering headlines. The issue in such a case would not be whether AI can produce more, but whether institutions can verify enough of what is produced to translate machine intelligence into durable value.\n\nSince machine intelligence may soon be scaling without precedent, and the availability of case-applicable human time cannot keep up with that pace, the issues outlined in the new work seem likely to loom up very quickly – even if they may be initially drowned out by the wider economic ramifications of AI adoption.\n\n* The paper is too long to break down in the usual manner, and in any case structurally unsuited for that kind of analysis. Therefore I decided to comment on it and consider its significance instead, and refer the reader to the source work so that they can do likewise.\n\nFirst published Wednesday, February 25, 2026\n\nWriter on machine learning, domain specialist in human image synthesis.

    "fullText": "The stock market is wavering this year as investors fret over everything from tariffs to AI, but Mark Zandi thinks things could soon get a lot worse.\n\nThe top economist at Moody's Analytics, Zandi's takes are often more focused on the broader economy than the stock market. However, he said that recent events compelled him to offer a warning on where the US may be headed if certain conditions persist.\n\n\"There are times when I feel markets are overdone and increasingly disconnected from the economy,\" Zandi added. \"Markets risk moving in a big way, causality is reversed, and falling asset prices threaten an already vulnerable economy. This is one of those times.\"\n\nZandi sees a dangerous shift taking place that's putting many assets at risk of a meaningful sell-off that could be a threat to Main Street as well as Wall Street.\n\n\"Valuations are high\" he wrote in an X thread. \"There are good fundamental reasons for this, but markets appear increasingly tainted by speculation. That is, investors are simply investing on the faith that prices will rise quickly in the future because they have in the recent past.\"\n\nThe economist highlighted that he doesn't think the risk is constrained to popular risk assets. Safe-haven assets such as gold and silver, which have benefited significantly from high geopolitical uncertainty in 2025, could also be at risk. He also included crypto in that category, implying that he sees risk beyond the current market pullback.\n\nZandi's analysis focused on the mixed nature of the US economy, a topic that he has repeatedly raised concerns about. The January jobs report was stronger than expected, but Zandi remains unconvinced that it will spur growth.\n\n\"Real GDP is the strongest indicator, and it is growing just over 2%, below the economy's potential, estimated to be near 2.5%,\" he said. \"Employment has flat-lined, and unemployment continues to creep higher. Inflation, as measured by the Fed's preferred consumer expenditure deflator, remains stubbornly and uncomfortably high at 3%.\"\n\nAnother warning sign comes from the Treasury market, generally considered a beacon of stability. Zandi praised the appointment of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve, but he also has concerns about the institutional buyers who continue to prop up the market.\n\nIf these hedge funds were spooked by fears of an unstable US economy, they could all flee at the same time, sending Treasury prices down and interest rates up. That type of scenario would make lending more expensive, making it difficult for borrowers to get mortgages and business loans.",

    "description": "The economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants.",
    "fullText": "Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation.\n\nCOBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US. Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government.\n\nDespite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\n\nThe developers who built these systems retired years ago, and the institutional knowledge they carried left with them. Production code has been modified repeatedly over decades, but the documentation hasn't kept up. Meanwhile, we aren't exactly minting replacements—COBOL is taught at only a handful of universities, and finding engineers who can read it gets harder every quarter.\n\nGiven these roadblocks, how can organizations modernize their systems without losing the reliability, availability, and data they’ve accumulated over decades? And without breaking anything?\n\nCOBOL modernization differs fundamentally from typical legacy code refactoring. You aren’t just updating familiar code to use better patterns, you’re reverse engineering business logic from systems built when Nixon was president. You’re untangling dependencies that evolved over decades, and translating institutional knowledge that now exists only in the code itself.\n\nModernizing a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows. This resulted in large timelines and high costs that few were willing to take on.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate the exploration and analysis phases that consume most of the effort in COBOL modernization. These tools can:\n\nWith AI, teams can modernize their COBOL codebase in quarters instead of years.\n\nAI excels at streamlining the tasks that once made COBOL modernization cost-prohibitive. With it, your team can focus on strategy, risk assessment, and business logic while AI automates the code analysis and implementation.\n\nAI starts by reading your entire COBOL codebase and mapping the structure.\n\nIt identifies program entry points, traces execution paths through called subroutines, maps data flows between modules, and documents dependencies that span hundreds of files.\n\nThis kind of mapping goes beyond simple call graphs. Shared data structures, file operations that create coupling between modules, initialization sequences that affect runtime behavior—these implicit dependencies don't show up in static analysis because they involve data shared through files, databases, or global state. They're also exactly what makes COBOL modernization risky, which is why automated discovery matters: it finds these hidden relationships before they cause problems during migration.\n\nWorkflow documentation also emerges out of this analysis.\n\nWith the codebase mapped, AI can assess which components are safe to move and which need careful handling. Modules with high coupling can be more risky to modernize. Isolated components surface as candidates for early, independent modernization. Duplicated logic points to refactoring opportunities. Areas with accumulated technical debt get documented before they become migration surprises.\n\nThis is where human judgment becomes essential. Your COBOL engineers bring the understanding of regulatory requirements, business priorities, operational constraints, and risk tolerance that AI cannot.\n\nThe planning phase develops a detailed roadmap that sequences modernization work strategically:\n\nCode testing and validation are also defined before any code changes:\n\nExecution happens one component at a time, with validation at each step. AI translates COBOL logic into modern languages, creates API wrappers around legacy components that stay in place, and builds the scaffolding to run old and new code side by side during transition.\n\nEach step either succeeds and gets validated, or fails and gets corrected while the scope is small.\n\nYou never have massive changes in flight where failure means rolling back weeks of work. As your team sees modernized components passing tests, they gain confidence to tackle progressively more complex parts of the system.\n\nThe approach outlined above works for COBOL systems of any size.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate much of the exploration and analysis work described, giving your team the comprehensive understanding they need to plan and execute migrations confidently.\n\nStart with a single component or workflow that has clear boundaries and moderate complexity. Use AI to analyze and document it thoroughly, plan the modernization with your engineers, implement incrementally with testing at each step, and validate carefully.  This will build organizational confidence and surface adjustments needed for your systems.\n\nThe economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants, freeing your engineers to make the migration decisions that require their domain expertise.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide, see the Code Modernization Playbook.\n\nProduct updates, how-tos, community spotlights, and more.

    "fullText": "Life is complicated. Regardless of what your beliefs or politics or ethics are, the way that we set up our society and economy will often force you to act against them: You might not want to fly somewhere but your employer will not accept another mode of transportation, you want to eat vegan but are at some point in a situation where the best you can do is a vegetarian option.\n\nSometimes it’s not even our hand being forced but us not having the mental strength or priorities to do something: I could just not use WhatsApp because it is owned by Meta but my son’s daycare organizes everything through WhatsApp and do I really want to force my belief on all those very busy parents and caretakers or should I just bite the bullet and use the tool that seems to work for everyone – even though it’s not perfect?\n\nThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions for this: Sometimes a belief or ethic you hold is so integral to you that you will not move. Sometimes they are held loosely enough to let go under certain conditions. There’s a multitude of factors and thoughts that go into those kinds of decisions and at some point you just gotta make a call based on what’s in front of you and your priorities.\n\nWhat I am saying is: We are all doing things we know are not ideal, are either morally questionable or do not align with our values. That’s life. I for example know that consuming meat is problematic for ethical and ecological reasons, I still do it sometimes. I reduce as much as I can but I am far from perfect. Just one of the many examples of my actions not being perfectly and purely aligned with my beliefs.\n\nAnd I am 100% sure each and every reader will have similar experiences. We are imperfect and messy beings. In the end all you can do is actually try to make good decisions based on your values, try to learn from your actions and ideally do better – or at least understand what were the forces that go you to act against your values.\n\nCory Doctorow, probably one of the most influential writers about digital technology and culture celebrated the 6th anniversary of his personal blog pluralistic – congratulations! Cory is quite the phenomenon, I know nobody with his amount of output and his consistency of publication. It is scary just how consistently he writes and published while also churning out books. I do admire his work ethic tremendously.\n\nBut one thing in his celebratory post rubbed me the wrong way and I think it’s worth pointing out. Not for the one specific case but because it highlights a problematic way of thinking that I see a lot in current tech discourse that stands in the way of us actually improving the world.\n\nSo Cory outlines his process of how he publishes to his blog (and then pushes the same writing out to other places). He describes how one QA step in his process is piping his writing through an LLM (using the Ollama software, it’s unclear which open weight LLM he uses) to check for typos and small grammar mistakes. He then points out how some readers might find that problematic:\n\n“Doubtless some of you are affronted by my modest use of an LLM. You think that LLMs are “fruits of the poisoned tree” and must be eschewed because they are saturated with the sin of their origins. I think this is a very bad take, the kind of rathole that purity culture always ends up in.”\n\nUsing LLMs isn’t always popular with the cool crowd, Cory knows that. And he wants to defend his (quite modest) use, which I understand: Nobody likes their problematic behavior being pointed out to them. But as outlined: Life’s complicated. Cory could just have said “I know there are many critiques of LLMs, but right now that is the best way for me to enable my work, I try to limit the problematic aspects by using a small open weight model and checking the results in detail.” and have moved on. But he needed to make a stand. And that stand lead him into the problematic train of thought that I wanted to point out here. Because many, many people listen to him and basically take his word as the gospel. So great power, great responsibility and such.\n\nThe whole argument is based on a strawman. Let’s look at Cory’s words:\n\nLet’s start with some context. If you don’t want to use technology that was created under immoral circumstances or that sprang from an immoral mind, then you are totally fucked. I mean, all the way down to the silicon chips in your device, which can never be fully disentangled from the odious, paranoid racist William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the silicon transistor\n\nCory is right in pointing out that almost any technology we have has been touch by problematic figures. Racists, fascists, sexists, rapists. You name it. Anything you touch will have some research or engineering or product work by a person you despise in it.\n\nThe strawman is his claim that people who criticize LLM usage are doing that for some form of absolutist reasons. That they have a fully binary view of the world as separated into “acceptable, pure things” and “garbage”. Which is of course false. Because they are using a computer, using warm water that’s probably heated through the use of fossil fuels etc.\n\nHe attacks a ridiculous made-up figure to deflect from specific criticism of LLM use (that many probably wouldn’t even apply that strongly to his use case). But that’s not where criticism of LLMs comes from: It’s mostly specific focusing on the material properties of these systems, their production and use.\n\n“Refusing to use a technology because the people who developed it were indefensible creeps is a self-owning dead-end. You know what’s better than refusing to use a technology because you hate its creators? Seizing that technology and making it your own. Don’t like the fact that a convicted monopolist has a death-grip on networking? Steal its protocol, release a free software version of it, and leave it in your dust:”\n\nHere again Cory is misrepresenting the LLM-critic’s argument: Sam Altman is a scam artist and habitual liar, but that’s not one of the first 10 to 20 reasons people criticise OpenAI’s products. Sure, basically every leading figure in the “AI” space seems to be unpleasant at best but that’s true for most of tech TBH. People criticise LLMs for their structural properties, their material impacts, for the way they make it harder to learn and grow, for the way they make products worse while creating massive negative externalities in the form of emissions, water use and e-waste. For the way these systems can only be build by taking every piece of data – regardless of whether the authors consent or even explicitly refuse – and how the training needs ungodly amounts of harmful, exploitative labor done mostly by people in countries from the global majority. How it materially harms the commons.\n\nEven if OpenAI was run by decent, ethical, friendly, trustworthy people (which would then of course make them not work on the products OpenAI has, but it’s just a thought experiment) their products would need to be criticized for what they are and what they do. It’s really not about these few dudes running the companies.\n\nCory misrepresents the arguments (well basically hides them) in order to not have to face any material criticism and turns them into “you just don’t like these people” which frames the criticism as emotional and not rational. As if it was about not liking a bunch of rich men.\n\nHe then goes into how the path forward is to “steal the protocol”. His following paragraph goes into detail:\n\n“That’s how we make good tech: not by insisting that all its inputs be free from sin, but by purging that wickedness by liberating the technology from its monstrous forebears and making free and open versions of it”\n\nAnd here we are coming to the core of the problematic argument. Because Cory implicitly argues that technology is neutral and that one can just change its meaning and effect through usage. But as Langdon Winner argues in his famous essay “Do artifacts have politics” artifacts have built-in politics deriving from their structure. A famous example is the nuclear power plant: Due to the danger of these plants, their needs with regards to resources as well as security, power plants imply a certain form of political arrangement based on having a strong security force/army and a way to force these facilities (and facilities to store the waste in) upon communities potentially against their will.\n\nArtifacts and technologies have certain logics built into their structure that do require certain arrangements around them or that bring forward certain arrangements. The second aspect is often illustrated by how ships are organized: Because ships are sometimes in dangerous situations and sometimes critical decisions need to be made, the existence of ships implies the existence of a hierarchy of power relationships with a captain having the final say. Because democracy would be too slow at times. These politics are built into the artifact.\n\nUnderstanding this you cannot take any technology and “make it good”. Is a torturing device “good” if the plans on how to build it are creative commons? Do we need to answer the existence of the digital torment nexus by building an open source torment nexus? I’d argue we need to destroy it – regardless of what license it is released under.\n\nThat does not mean that it is impossible to take certain technologies or artifacts and try to reframe them, change their meaning. In some way computers are one such example: They were first used by governments, banks and other corporations to reach their goals but where then taken and reframed as devices intended to support personal liberation. It’s a bit more complicated (for why, dive into the late David Golumbia’s “The Cultural Logic of Computation”) but let’s give that one to Cory. Sure, sometimes it is possible to take something originally built for nefarious purposes and find better uses for it. But is that true for everything? Very obviously not.\n\nLet’s just look at the embedded politics of LLMs: In order to train a capable system you need data. Lots of it. AI companies keep buying books to scan them, they download everything from every legal or illegal source claiming “fair use” (a doctrine that only applies to the US by the way) or that “scraping is always okay”. Capable LLMs require a logic of dominance and of disregarding consent of the people producing the artifacts that are the raw material for the system. LLMs are based on extraction, exploitation and subjugation: To produce these systems – even if you release the end result as open weights for people to use at home – you need to take cultural works, personal writing etc. from people who not only not consented but actively reject that notion. The politics of LLMs is violence. How does one “liberate” that? What’s the case for open source violence?\n\nHe uses a so-called “open source LLM” and that’s very much how he presents his values but open-source LLMs do not really exist. You can download some weights but cannot understand what went into them or really change or reproduce them. Open source AI is just marketing and openwashing.\n\nCory shows his libertarian leanings here: If everything is somehow “free and open” then we have won. But “free and open” in this context usually means that “certain privileged groups have easy access to it and are not limited in what to do with it”. That’s one of the core problems with the whole “open Source” movement: That it reduces all struggle to if one can get their hands on the tools and has any restrictions to using them.\n\nThis also shines through in Cory arguing that we need to “liberate” technology. What a strange idea: Technology doesn’t need liberation, people do. Technologies are tools, not what we actually care about. Sure, sometimes technologies can play a role in liberating people but just as often “freeing” a technology does quite the opposite to people: Ask the women who have massive amounts of nonconsensually created sexualized images and videos generated of them whether they think that the “liberation” of stochastic images generators is liberating them? Technology doesn’t need to be free. It cannot be free because freedom as a concept applies to people.\n\nAnd freedom is not the only value that we care about. Making everything “free” sounds cool but who pays for that freedom? Who pays for us having for example access to the freedom an open weight LLM brings? Our freedom as users rests on the exploitation of and violence against the people suffering the data centers, labeling the data for the training, the folks gathering the resources for NVIDIA to build chips. Freedom is not a zero-sum game but a lot of the freedoms that wealthy people in the right (which I am one of) enjoy stem from other people’s lack thereof.\n\n“Purity culture is such an obvious trap, an artifact of the neoliberal ideology that insists that the solution to all our problems is to shop very carefully, thus reducing all politics to personal consumption choices:”\n\nCory labels people’s values and their prioritization as “purity culture” (referring back to the black and white strawman the started this part of his post with) and then pulls a really interesting spin here: Many people criticizing LLMs come from a somewhat leftist (in contrast to Cory’s libertarian) background. Cory intentionally frames those leftist thoughts that put politics based on values as “neoliberal ideology” that reduces “all politics to personal consumption choices”. This is clever narratively: Tell those stupid leftists that they are just neoliberals, the thing they hate! Awesome.\n\nBut the argument against using LLMs is not about shopping and markets at all. My not using LLMs does not influence anything in that regard, Microsoft will just keep making the data center go BRRRRRRR.\n\nIn a way this framing shows more about Cory’s thinking than about that of the people he criticises: Cory is focused on markets and market dynamics and in that world it’s about purchasing. But moral choices only sometimes relate to markets. They do when I for example choose only to buy fairly produced garments. But when I for example refused conscription (when I was young Germany still forced every young man to learn how to kill) that was not a shopping decision. That was politics as well as leading an ethical life.\n\nPeople do not believe that “not using LLMs” will solve the issue of OpenAI etc all existing. They do no want to build on, use products with so clearly defined harms and negative externalities. Because they believe it to be wrong. Sure, there might be a utilitarian argument for “the thing exists anyways and if it saves you time, that’s good, right” but many people are not utilitarians. They want to lead a life where they feel their actions align with their values. In a way that is a path to freedom: To having the freedom to make the decisions one feels are right are in alignment with one’s values.\n\nWhich Cory actually also believe and acts upon when it’s about his values: He has refused to create a Bluesky account in spite of wanting to be there cause his friends are there for (good!) ideological reasons: Because Bluesky was back then and honestly is still today mostly centralized with the Bluesky corporation having a central chokepoint to control the network. Cory believes that one sometimes needs to make decisions based on one’s values. He just does not think that your values as someone not wanting to use LLMs matter.\n\nI mean, it was extraordinarily stupid for the Nazis to refuse Einstein’s work because it was “Jewish science,” but not merely because antisemitism is stupid.\n\nEverybody hates Nazis. Implying that one is in any way like the Nazis is just a killer argument. But let’s talk about Nazis for a second. The Nazis did a lot of psychological and medical research. On people they interned and later killed in concentration camps. There actually was a massive debate within especially psychology whether using the results of that kind of research is ethically possible. Utilitarianism of course argues that if it’s there one should use it but especially when your whole discipline is focused on understanding how our psyche works in order to for example help people in trauma just taking research that has been created through unthinkable violence and torture feels wrong. Feels contrarian to what your whole discipline is there for. This reminds me of Ursula K. Le Guin’s story “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas“: Omelas is an almost perfect city. Rich, democratic, pleasant. But it only works by having one small child in perpetual torment. Okay, but if that kid is already suffering because those other people chose to, should you walk away? Of just reap the fruits of that suffering?\n\nSometimes you need to walk away.\n\nCory then repeats the strawmen we already talked about and lands here:\n\n“It’s not “unethical” to scrape the web in order to create and analyze data-sets. That’s just “a search engine””\n\nAgain, he twists the argument in the way that the AI corporations like to do it as well: Search engines scour the web so AI companies should be allowed the same. It’s the same technology! But what’s the purpose?\n\nA search engine scrapes pages to build an “index” in order to let people find those pages. The scraping has value for the page and its owner as well because it leads to more people finding it and therefore connecting to the writer, journalist, musician, artist, etc. Search engines create connection.\n\nAI scrapers do not guide people towards the original maker’s work. They extract it and reproduce it (often wrongly). “AI”‘s don’t point out to the web for you to find other’s work to relate to, they keep you in their loop and give you the answer cutting off any connection to the original sources.\n\nWhile the technology of scraping is the same, the purpose and material effects of those two systems is massively different. Again, Cory misrepresents the critique and tries to make it look unreasonable by making it just a conversation about tech without regarding how that technology affects the world and the people in it.\n\nI appreciate a lot of work Cory Doctorow has done in the last decades. But the arguments he presents here to defend his usage of LLMs for this rather trivial task (which TBH could probably be done reasonably well with traditional means) are part of why the Internet – and therefore the world – looks like it does right now. It’s a set of arguments that wants to delegitimize political and moral actions based on libertarian and utilitarian thinking.\n\nTechnologies are embedded not only in their deployment but also in their creation, conceptualization. They carry the understanding of the world that their makers believe in and reproduce those. A bit like an LLM reproduces the texts it learned from: It might not always be a 100% identical replica but it’s structurally so similar that the differences are surface level.\n\nIn order to build an Internet and a world that is more inclusive, fairer, freer we need to move past the dogma of unchecked innovation and technology. We need to re-politicize our conversations about technology and their effects and goals in order to build the structures (technological, political, social) we want. The structures that lead to a conviviality in harmony with the planet we all live on and will live on till the end of our days.\n\nThat path is paved with discussions about political and moral values. Discussions about how certain technological artifacts do align with those values or not.\n\nI do agree with Cory that demanding perfect purity lead nowhere. We are imperfect people in an imperfect world. I just do not think that this means to go all accellerationalist. Just turning the “open source” dial up to 11 does not stop the apocalypse. It’s a lot harder.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.",

    "description": "The wealthy are becoming worried about the US economy more rapidly than lower-income households. A Wall Street veteran says it's that's bullish for stocks.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 could be set to break out of its anemic trading range, according to a veteran Wall Street strategist.\n\nThe key metric to watch isn't some piece of technical analysis or a big earnings update. Rather, it's the growing feeling of economic unease among high-earning Americans, according to Jim Paulsen.\n\nThe S&P 500 is roughly flat since the start of 2026 as investors weigh the market impact of Trump's uncertain tariff regime and AI disruption fears. Jim Paulsen, former chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, says his new market indicator, which he dubs the poor/rich sentiment measure, has successfully forecast recent market rallies and is signaling a potential upswing is on the horizon.\n\nLower-income households were seen by forecasters as a weak spot in the economy for some time, but their mood has been brightening of late. At the same time, high earners have become more downbeat. This narrowing of the sentiment gap, Paulsen says, is a buy signal.\n\nPaulsen compares consumer confidence in the economy by income level to find a daily confidence ratio that he then combines with a ratio of Walmart's stock performance relative to the S&P Global Luxury stock price index.\n\nPaulsen overlaid his poor/rich sentiment indicator over the S&P 500 to assess it as an indicator for market performance.\n\n\"The Poor/Rich sentiment indicator has spiked higher 8 previous times since 2018 — in late-2018, October 2019, March 2020, May 2022, October 2022, November 2023, September 2024, and in April 2025. During each of these previous spikes in the Poor/Rich sentiment indicator, the S&P 500 was at a level which represented a good buy! \"\n\nSince the end of 2025, Paulsen's indicator has climbed. The measure's spike since December shares similarities with increases seen at the end of the 2022 bear market and at the 2020 pandemic lows.\n\nThe strategist ties the indicator's success to the idea that if the high-income cohort is losing faith in the economy, then the stock market is often at a low point. Paulsen highlights a downturn in Bloomberg's US billionaires relative total return index, which he says could be a signal that the rich are losing faith in the market.\n\n\"We seem to be in a relatively rare period when the Rich are losing confidence faster than the Poor … when the rich start complaining more than the poor, it's often been a good time to step up and buy some equities,\" the strategist said.\n\nPaulsen warned investors against using a single gauge, but said it may be a good time to assess equity exposure.\n\n\"If you are underinvested, perhaps it's worth considering taking advantage of recent volatility by adding to your equity exposure during selloffs,\" he wrote on his Substack post.",

    "description": "\"The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,\" Prokopenko said.",
    "fullText": "Four years after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy has entered a “death zone,” said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nIn a recent Economist op-ed, the former Russian central bank adviser drew on a term from mountain climbing when high altitude forces the body to consume itself faster than it can repair itself.\n\nWhat is Russia's economic 'death zone'?\n\nWhat signs indicate Russia may face economic crisis?\n\nHow has the war impacted Russia's economic structure?\n\nWhy can't monetary policy fix Russia's economic problems?\n\n“Russia’s economy is stuck in what might be described as negative equilibrium: holding itself together while steadily destroying its own future capacity,” she wrote.\n\nThe economy isn’t headed for an imminent crash, but GDP has stagnated, oil revenue has been halved amid Western sanctions, and the government’s budget deficit is rapidly draining reserves.\n\nAt the same time, two economic systems have emerged. One is comprised of the military and related industries that receive priority from the Kremlin. And then there’s everything else that’s been “left in the cold,” Prokopenko explained.\n\n“The most dangerous feature of this new structure is the fuel it burns,” she added. “Russia’s economy now runs on what might be called ‘military rent’: budget transfers to defense enterprises that generate wages and economic activity.”\n\nBut the transfers are aimed at assets designed for destruction, Prokopenko pointed out. In other words, the money that keeps Russia’s factories humming pays for tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons that eventually get destroyed or damaged, making them useless for future economic growth.\n\nSimilarly, money spent to attract fresh recruits to Russia’s army doesn’t retrain them to become more productive. Instead, many die or return home permanently wounded. The Center for Strategic and International Studies has estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed.\n\n“The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,” Prokopenko said.\n\nWhile the central bank has cut interest rates to prop up growth and the Kremlin has taken steps to rein in the budget deficit, Russia’s economic predicament can’t be fixed with monetary or fiscal policies, she wrote.\n\nIn fact, interest payments on government debt this year are already set to exceed spending on education and health care combined.\n\nUnlike a cyclical downturn such as a recession, Prokopenko argued that what Russia is suffering from is more akin to altitude sickness—”the longer you stay, the worse it gets, regardless of rest.”",

    "title": "The economy grew strongly last year, but hiring stagnated. It's making the gap between the rich and everyone else worse.",
    "description": "The US economy grew 2.2% in 2025 while job creation stalled, exacerbating inequality in a \"K-shaped economy\" scenario.",
    "fullText": "The data is in, and last year presents an economic conundrum: Overall growth was relatively strong, but job growth was virtually nonexistent. It bodes ill for the gap between the rich and everyone else.\n\nNewly released data showed the US economy grew 2.2% in 2025. That's a respectable pace, although cooler than the past few years. Economic activity was affected by the record-long government shutdown in the fall, businesses figuring out how to handle trade announcements, and new investments.\n\nMeanwhile, the US added the fewest jobs since 2003 outside recessions. While unemployment stayed low, hiring and job openings fell, meaning plenty of people couldn't find a job. It's an unfortunate situation for new graduates looking to get on the first rung of the career ladder, job switchers eager for a fresh opportunity, and basically anyone looking to land a job quickly outside the in-demand healthcare and social assistance sectors.\n\nThe divide between output and jobs is widening another divide: some call it a \"K-shaped economy\" where the rich are earning and spending more, while everyone else is stagnating. And it doesn't look like 2026 will be much better.\n\n\"Consumers are feeling the weight of the price increases, and combined with the jobs outlook that's worsening they say, 'OK, when I look out, I don't see prices going down that much, but I do see my wage is not growing and my job not being as reliable or secure as it once was,'\" Atsi Sheth, the chief credit officer at Moody's Ratings, told Business Insider.\n\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian said in a Financial Times opinion piece before the newest GDP figures that while this \"decoupling of job growth from economic growth\" has happened before in the US, it's typically occurred during recession recoveries and \"not in the midst of a prolonged period of robust growth such as the one we are experiencing today.\"\n\n\"We're in this unusual environment where economic activity has remained quite robust, and yet job gains have fallen to near zero,\" Gregory Daco, the chief economist at EY, told Business Insider.\n\nThe US added a measly 181,000 jobs last year; annual figures are often at least a million. It's comparable to 2003, when the US only added 124,000 jobs in the wake of the 2001 recession.\n\nDaco said GDP's strength is \"masking a growing bifurcation\" and thinks the polarization will persist and maybe worsen because supply shocks, such as trade and tax policies, AI, and demographic changes, aren't reversing.\n\n\"In some cases, we're seeing a more significant effect on economic activity,\" Daco said.\n\nSome economic experts are optimistic about the year ahead. \"We expect a strong year of economic growth in 2026, driven by business investment, consumer spending and fading trade headwinds,\" said Rick Gardner, chief investment officer of RGA Investments. ZipRecruiter economist Nicole Bachaud thinks the job market could be at a \"pivot point\" after stronger hiring in January.\n\n\"Demand in other sectors that are more cyclically based instead of demographically based is starting somewhat to show signs of growth,\" Bachaud said.\n\nThe strength in the economy isn't being felt by all. People at the top are feeling much better than pretty much everyone else. They don't have to worry as much about rising prices of necessities and slowing wage growth.\n\n\"The wealthier, more affluent consumers are benefiting from wealth accumulation, allowing them to still spend relatively freely,\" Daco said. \"They're also enjoying faster wage growth, while lower-income families are seeing reduced wage growth, near-zero real wage growth, and not much wealth appreciation outside of real estate, if they have that.\"\n\nSheth said the benefits of GDP growth have been higher for those who earn from investments and capital gains. \"They've benefited a lot from financial market booms, whereas those who earn their income primarily by wages have benefited some, but not as much,\" she said.\n\nDiane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, told Business Insider that \"What productivity growth we've seen since basically the turn of the century has accrued mostly to the owners of capital, not rank and file workers. And that means we've seen wealth compound, but also income inequality worsen.\"\n\nSheth said regardless of how people refer to the disconnect happening in the economy, the \"real trouble\" is that wages are no longer keeping up with the rising cost of living and that people are having to pay a lot more to buy essentials.\n\nSwonk said inflation is \"the most regressive tax\" because of how much lower-income households have to spend on necessities relative to their earnings.\n\n\"When those goods go up in price, obviously that affects them even harder, and so it's a very regressive tax,\" Swonk said, adding, \"Oftentimes, we lose sight of the fact that it really is the level of prices that people are still reacting to.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report that inflation-adjusted consumer spending has increased for high-income households since 2023, but low-income household spending has mostly trended down. \"The trend since 2023 is different from the trend during the pandemic recession and recovery, when consumption growth was similar across income groups,\" the report said.\n\nAmid those price increases and changes to spending habits, wage growth has drastically cooled for lower earners. Lower-income wage growth surged between 2021 and 2022, but has since cooled down a lot from the late 2022 peak. Sheth also pointed out that wage growth for hourly workers, who she said are likely \"subject to much more fluctuation and downside risk than if you have a steady salary,\" has also been falling faster than those not paid hourly.\n\nSheth said another issue is that the lower end of the wage spectrum is under more credit stress.\n\n\"We're seeing greater credit stress in subprime auto, for instance, some parts of borrowing, but again at the lower end of the spectrum,\" Sheth said. \"But overall, if you compare household balance sheets today to, say, the pre-global financial crisis era, they're generally stronger — much stronger at middle- and upper-income levels, of course, but generally stronger.\"\n\nEl-Erian said in the Financial Times piece that, \"This period of decoupling of employment from growth may prove more persistent and more consequential,\" partly because the effects of AI are still unfolding.\n\nAI-related investments have already made a dent in real GDP growth based on findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"As firms continue integrating AI into their operations and building the infrastructure required to support it, these categories are likely to remain significant drivers of investment well into 2026 and beyond,\" the authors wrote.\n\nLaura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, described a \"precarious balance\" between GDP and the job market. Ullrich is unsure whether employers will decide they should hire more to keep up with the relatively robust economic growth or make job cuts because they aren't keeping up.\n\n\"I do think the uncertainty about the role AI plays adds in another interesting pivot,\" Ullrich said. \"Because if AI is able to take on the work of humans, then we could see economic growth without hiring picking up much. But, I'm skeptical that that's happening in big ways right this second.\"\n\nAside from the impact of AI, the US doesn't need as many jobs to hold unemployment stable at a time when the population isn't growing as quickly, so it's possible job growth continues to be lower than previously experienced.\n\n\"The low-hire, low-fire job market isn't just about policy changes in the new administration or about AI,\" Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Business Insider. \"So, there may not be a quick fix.\"\n\n\"While participants generally assessed that, under appropriate monetary policy, the labor market likely would stabilize and then improve this year, they continued to note that the outlook for the labor market remained uncertain,\" minutes from the January Federal Reserve meeting said.",

    "title": "'We're just going to get worse': 3 reasons Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz thinks the US economy will keep weakening",
    "description": "Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz pointed to several concerns he had about the US economy, like the decline in blue-collar jobs & uncertainty over rates.",
    "fullText": "An esteemed American economist isn't feeling good about where things are headed.\n\nJoseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and Columbia economist, said he believes the US economy would continue to weaken when speaking to CNBC about his macro outlook on Thursday. That's largely due to a handful of issues he sees hanging over the US, he said, pointing to tariffs, a decline in jobs, and interest rates in particular.\n\n\"Not great right now, and the prospects are that we're just going to get worse,\" Stiglitz said of his economic outlook.\n\nHis downbeat sentiment regardi g the US economy doesn't square with recent growth figures. GDP grew at a robust 4.4% in the third quarter, and is expected to have expanded by 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to the latest estimates from the Atlanta Fed.\n\nBut there are a few under-the-surface details that suggest the economy isn't on a good path, Stiglitz suggested. Here's what explains his pessimistic view about where the US is headed:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court, but should they stick around, the import taxes are expected by many economists to raise prices for consumers.\n\nMoreover, the inflationary impact of tariffs is regressive, meaning they're expected to impact lower-income consumers the most, Stiglitz said.\n\nAn analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale University found that, over the short run, tariffs are expected to hit the bottom 10% of US households the hardest, reducing disposable income by an estimated 3.5 percentage points.\n\n\"If you look at who is paying these tariffs, it is the lower-end people in terms of percentage of their incomes,\" Stiglitz said. \"It's regressive and it's distortive.\"\n\nPresident Trump has said that tariffs would help jump-start a revival in America's manufacturing sector, but a recovery isn't yet visible in broad-strokes employment data, Stiglitz said.\n\nManufacturing, one of the US's largest industries, is estimated to make up around 10% of GDP.\n\nEmployment in the manufacturing sector has declined for more than two years straight, according to data from the Labor Department.\n\n\"The decline in blue-collar jobs is even larger,\" Stiglitz said. \"The point is there's a mismatch between what they say — they've done these policies, these are the results.\"\n\nStiglitz also pointed to the push from the Trump administration to lower interest rates.\n\nIn particular, he pointed to recent comments from Kevin Warsh, Trump's Fed Chair nominee, who said that AI could unlock a productivity boom in the US. In that scenario, the economy could grow without stoking inflation, meaning the US could have room to lower interest rates more than markets expect.\n\nStiglitz said he was \"most disturbed\" by Warsh's comments.\n\nAmong investors, the fear is that the central bank could lower rates prematurely, which could lead to hotter inflation down the line.\n\nAdditionally, if the Fed were to be seen as caving to political pressure to cut rates, that could undermine the Fed's credibility, which could also unanchor inflation expectations.\n\n\"I don't think there's any significant body of thought that thinks that AI productivity increases are going to percolate into the macro economy fast enough to justify any significant or with any impact on rate increases. And the fact that he said that, to me, was very worrisome,\" Stiglitz said.",

There was the one about the founder who hadn’t taken a weekend off in more than six months. The woman who joked that she’d given up her social life to work at a prestigious AI company. Or the employees who had started taking their shoes off in the office because, well, if you were going to be there for at least 12 hours a day, six days a week, wouldn’t you rather be wearing slippers?\n\n“If you go to a cafe on a Sunday, everyone is working,” says Sanju Lokuhitige, the co-founder of Mythril, a pre-seed-stage AI startup, who moved to San Francisco in November to be closer to the action. Lokuhitige says he works seven days a week, 12 hours a day, minus a few carefully selected social events each week where he can network with other people at startups. “Sometimes I’m coding the whole day,” he says. “I do not have work-life balance.”\n\nAnother startup employee, who came to San Francisco to work for an early-stage AI company, showed me dismal photos from his office: a two-bedroom apartment in the Dogpatch, a neighborhood popular with tech workers. His startup’s founders live and work in this apartment – from 9am until as late as 3am, breaking only to DoorDash meals or to sleep, and leaving the building only to take cigarette breaks. The employee (who asked not to use his name, since he still works for this company) described the situation as “horrendous”. “I’d heard about 996, but these guys don’t even do 996,” he says. “They’re working 16-hour days.”\n\nStartups have never been particularly glamorous. When I started reporting on the industry a decade ago, people were cashing in on the new mobile app economy, and coders were chugging Soylent to stay at their desks longer. Startups then, too, were defined by hustle culture, high-octane energy and the pursuit of growth at all costs – ideas that, to some extent, have remained in the bloodstream of the industry.\n\nBut in the last year, as the magic dust of artificial intelligence has settled in San Francisco, the vibe among tech workers does seem different. The excitement about a new epoch in tech – and all the money that comes with it – is now tempered with anxieties about the industry, and the economy. Some workers are going all in on AI while also questioning whether all that AI is good for the world. Others are effectively training machines to do their jobs better than they can. And many of the same workers who are racing to build the future are now wondering if the future they’re building has a place for them in it.\n\nThe rest of us may be ambiently aware of these anxieties, but they are already tangible and keenly felt inside the tech industry. Even the biggest tech companies, once known for coddling employees with on-site massages and barber shops, have scaled back perks as they have escalated the expectations of workers. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have each been candid about their predictions that AI will replace some junior and mid-level engineers at their companies, and have respectively called for their workforces to be more “efficient” and “extremely hard core” as waves of layoffs set employees on-edge. Tech companies laid off about a quarter of a million workers around the world in 2025, according to a report published by RationalFX. In many of those layoffs, AI was cited as a main factor, even if the full reason for layoffs is often more complex.\n\n“If you were a software engineer five years ago, you could kind of write your ticket,” says Mike Robbins, an executive coach who has worked with companies like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Airbnb. Now, the balance of power has shifted away from tech workers, many of whom are left feeling anxious about their work performance. “When companies become less scared about losing employees, then they can be a little more forthright in terms of what they want and be a little more demanding.”\n\nRobbins, who wrote the book Bring Your Whole Self to Work, used to be asked to speak to companies and their leaders about topics like employee burnout, wellbeing and belonging – top priorities in the years during and shortly after the pandemic. “Quite frankly, we’ve stopped talking about all that,” he says. Now, company leaders want advice on topics like change, disruption and uncertainty in the workplace.\n\nThose themes – change, disruption and uncertainty – are each part of the fuel that has driven tech workers to put in more hours, at a higher intensity. Investment in artificial intelligence companies reached record highs in 2025, yet workers are feeling scarcity in ways they haven’t before.\n\n“It’s definitely something that’s on everyone’s mind,” says Kyle Finken, a software engineer at Mintlify, which makes an AI tool for developers. “I think a lot of people are concerned like, ‘Oh, am I going to have a job in three years?’”\n\nDespite his fears, Finken, like many other startup employees I spoke to, feels energized by the “extraordinary innovation” happening in artificial intelligence and believes that there will still be plenty of jobs for software engineers in the future, even if those jobs look different from the pure coding roles of today. He and other tech workers characterized the current moment as a particularly creative and productive time in tech, where people are devoting extra hours to work not because their employers demand it but out of genuine interest in the new tools and capabilities. For example, Garry Tan, the head of the famous startup accelerator Y Combinator, recently bragged that he “stayed up 19 hours” playing around with Claude Code.\n\nEven those who felt excited about the pace of change acknowledged that AI was rapidly augmenting their work, in ways that could have uncertain outcomes for the jobs of the future. “This is definitely not an era of complacency,” says Finken.\n\nOne reason for working so many hours is to keep up with tools and technology that are changing nearly every day. If you take the weekend off, you can miss a major development, which makes it harder to keep up with what competitors are doing. Another reason is to have something to show future employers, especially as more junior-level jobs are replaced by AI.\n\n“No one hires junior developers any more,” says Lokuhitige, the Mythril co-founder. Landing a job now requires “doing something cool”, he says, like building a new product or solving a problem that gets recognized as useful by larger companies. Job postings for entry-level tech jobs have dropped by a third since 2022, according to Indeed’s Hiring Lab, while job postings requiring at least five years of experience have risen. If you’re not grinding at a startup, you’re missing the prerequisite to get hired in the future.\n\nWhile economists are torn about whether AI will replace most jobs or just change them, they seem aligned in the idea that AI has already reshaped a great deal of entry-level work and will continue to do so. A paper published by Stanford researchers in November found “substantial declines in employment for early-career workers” in industries exposed to AI and suggested that areas where change is already occurring could be like a “canary in the coalmine” for the rest of the economy. The Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei, has suggested AI could eliminate about half of all entry-level jobs in white-collar industries within the next five years.\n\nThe head of the International Monetary Fund recently predicted that 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence, “like a tsunami hitting the labour market”. In San Francisco, you can already see the early signs, as Uber drivers compete with self-driving Waymos, and baristas are replaced by robotic coffee bars. Professional business services that support the tech industry have also been negatively affected by the layoffs. The pressure to grind in the tech world could be an early signal – a harbinger for what many other industries will feel soon.\n\nRobbins, the executive coach, says that companies once looked to Silicon Valley as a model of how they should operate, down to emulating policies like unlimited vacation days or adopting perks like free lunch in the office.\n\n“There was an idealization of tech and Silicon Valley for a long time across the business world. Some of that has changed,” he says. “Now, people aren’t asking me to tell them what’s going on in the Valley so that they can adopt it, the same way they were a decade ago.”\n\nRather than a model of how we should all work, the tech industry may be a premonition for the anxiety and attempts to compensate that are coming for all of us.",

    "description": "Jobs growth is decoupling from economic growth for the first time since the post-Great Financial Crisis era, Mohamed El-Erian said.",
    "fullText": "The job market isn't going to catch up with the rest of the US economy anytime soon.\n\nThat's according to top economist Mohamed El-Erian, who thinks there's an \"unusual\" pattern that's unfolding in the labor market. In an op-ed for the Financial Times over the weekend, the former PIMCO CEO pointed to how job additions in the US have lagged economic growth over the past year — a divergence that's only been seen a few other times in history, and typically during recessions.\n\nAfter accounting for revisions, 2025 represented one of the weakest years for hiring outside of recessions for the last two decades, El-Erian said. The number of nonfarm jobs rose an average 0.47% in 2025, the weakest average annual growth rate outside of a recession since 2003, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nYet, the US economy as a whole continues to show strength. GDP rose at a 4.3% yearly pace in the third quarter, and is expected to increase 3.7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to the latest estimate from Atlanta Fed economists.\n\nEl-Erian pointed to past instances of similar divergence across history: the 90s, the early 2000s, and the years that followed the onset of the Great Financial Crisis. Although he noted that, in those instances, the economy was in the early stages of recovering after a recession — earlier in the cycle than we are rightn ow.\n\n\"This trend is likely to prove more unsettling than prior episodes of 'jobless growth,'\" El-Erian wrote, pointing to several reasons he believed the divergence in jobs and economic growth would continue:\n\n\"This time around, it may well last longer because we are just at the start of the AI adoption process, with robotics just around the corner and quantum computing further behind,\" he added of the trend.\n\nThis period of economic decoupling could also bring on more pain, El-Erian suggested, pointing to existing concerns about affordability and wealth inequality in the US.\n\n\"Indeed, part of the challenge for 2026 is managing a lot better the economic, political and social risks of an economy that, without corporate and policy adjustments, may no longer need as many workers to grow,\" he added.\n\nMore forecasters have been eyeing the potential for a weaker labor market in 2026, particularly as AI starts to disrupt the business world.\n\nLast year, JPMorgan economists said they linked the rising jobless rate among recent college graduates to the growing excitement for AI, and flagged the risks for a \"jobless recovery\" in the US economy.\n\nGoldman Sachs also said it saw the potential for a period of \"jobless growth\" in the US, and previously estimated that AI could impact around 300 million full-time jobs around the world.",

    "fullText": "\"We're the same age,\" I told Ernest Ang, a 24-year-old who opened an eatery two years ago with his grandmother's recipes.\n\nAnd yet, it feels like we live in different worlds.\n\nEvery day, he whips up large batches of fried chicken and beef rendang in Singapore's 90-degree tropical heat. On the other side of the island, in the glitzy financial district, I write about the Trump administration and the general chaos of the world.\n\nI started my first job in a newsroom after graduating from college in 2024, diving headfirst into the corporate grind. I sign off at 5:30 p.m. and value the work-life balance my writing job offers.\n\nLast year, I started collecting stories of Singaporean Gen Zers and millennials shunning the comfort and stability of the 9-5 in favor of starting their own food businesses — ventures that come with backbreaking long hours. I was humbled.\n\nHawker centers, like where Ang set up shop, are the go-to for budget meals in Singapore. They're cheap, hearty, and convenient, and I've eaten from them as long as I can remember.\n\nThere are 123 hawker centers in the country, managed by the National Environment Agency. On average, each center has about seven to 10 individual stalls.\n\nTraditionally, they sell dishes like Hainanese chicken rice, bak kut teh, a peppery and flavorful pork soup, or nasi lemak, aromatic rice served with dishes. The stalls are typically run by middle-aged to senior hawkers.\n\nBut as younger hawkers join the business, there's been an increase in specialty stalls selling matcha, craft beer, baked goods, and fusion dishes.\n\nSuccess is an uphill battle, with a massive failure rate due to rising store rents and a frugal consumer base. In 2025, 3,074 food and beverage businesses in Singapore closed their doors, per statistics from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore.\n\nThis has not deterred hopeful entrepreneurs — 4,103 new food businesses opened last year.\n\nMost of the young chefs I interviewed work six to seven days a week, getting up well before the sun rises to prep ingredients for the day and retiring late into the night after feeding hungry dinner crowds.\n\nI spoke with eight Gen Z and millennial F&B owners across the country about what makes them tick, what fears give them chills at night, and if they regret choosing a risky career path.",

Waitstaff are also taking notice and trying their best to navigate what happens when someone suddenly leaves the table.\n\nChef Gabrielle Macafee encountered this exact scenario when she worked at a Brooklyn restaurant serving a small tasting menu. After a couple walked in looking \"morose,\" the man stood up and left halfway through the $130 meal.\n\n\"My teammates and I were like, wait, how do we handle this? He's gone. You can only hold the food for so long,\" Macafee told BI's Kaplan, who added that the woman still seated paid for both meals. \"We offered to send her the rest, but obviously, she just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\"\n\nIf you do find yourself giving the \"it's not you, it's me\" speech in public, dating coach Julie Nguyen advised picking a neutral spot, such as a park, and avoiding regular haunts you both frequent. \"You don't want either of you to feel dread going back, or tie bad memories to a spot they love. A neutral, quiet outdoor setting is the best play,\" she added.\n\nLane Denbro, a former line cook, said that if you're not in total shock at what's happening, be thoughtful of the staff, the servers, and the bartenders. \"If you're going through a breakup, make sure to tip well, because the service staff in the back of house, we're going to try to support you however we can,\" Denbro said.",

    "description": "Yardeni has touted his \"Roaring 20s\" thesis before, retierating his view this week that the economy and markets will remain strong through this decade.",
    "fullText": "Ed Yardeni thinks the US is in the midst of the \"Roaring 20s,\" which will carry the economy through the rest of the decade without a recession.\n\nIn a video update on Friday, the founder of Yardeni Research re-upped his bullish thesis, noting that he sees no reason for the US to tumble into a recession in the coming four years. His market views have been similarly bullish. In recent years, the economist has predicted the Dow to hit 60,000 and the S&P 500 to rise to 8,000 by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We've got four more years to go. The end of the decade is the end of 2029,\" he stated. \"I'm still thinking that we're not going to have a recession between now and the end of the decade.\"\n\nYardeni noted the primary reason for his bullishness is the sheer resilience that the US economy has shown, which he measures by the frequency of recession. He noted that he doesn't think the US has seen an actual one since 2008.\n\n\"It's been hit by a lot of shocks and yet it continues to grow,\" Yardeni stated of the US economy. \"We had one recession that lasted all of two months back in 2020, but that was not really a legitimate recession.\"\n\nThe US economy's ability to keep chugging along has been a boon for the stock market, which has been enjoying in a nearly two-decade-long secular bull market. Yardeni highlighted the progress made by many S&P 500 members, which enjoyed significant growth for most of 2025.\n\nWhile some high-growth S&P stocks have struggled recently due to AI-related fears, Yardeni isn't concerned about this bearish trend persisting, adding that he thinks market strength will remain intact.\n\n\"I think we can also conclude that because of the resilience of the economy, earnings have been remarkably resilient for the S&P 500 and indeed they've been so during the current uh growing 2020 scenario,\" he noted.\n\nYardeni also expects real GDP growth to continue into 2026. He predicts that this year's GDP will expand by 3.5% to 4.5%, citing gains in productivity.\n\nThe economist acknowledged that the 4.5% figure may strike some as overly optimistic, but he maintained that it fits within his broader Roaring 20s model and forecast.\n\n\"That might be the outlook actually for the rest of the decade if things continue to go along as we're expecting,\" Yardeni added.",

    "fullText": "LTK, a Softbank-backed startup and creator economy unicorn, let go of some staff on Thursday as part of a reorganization, a company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe cuts were designed to refocus LTK's business around its revamped brand platform and to account for structural changes to internal teams like marketing, according to the company.\n\nThe job reductions, which hit a variety of roles including software engineers and staffers who worked with creators, affected a low single-digit percentage of LTK's overall head count, which numbers over 550 employees, they said.\n\n\"LTK recently completed a targeted organizational restructure to ensure we are aligned around the skills and priorities required for our next phase of growth,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was not a broad-based layoff, but a strategic realignment focused on strengthening performance and positioning the business for long-term success.\"\n\nLTK, previously known as RewardStyle, was founded around 15 years ago by president Amber Venz Box. The company, which says it's profitable and doubled its EBITDA in 2025, has raised a little over $300 million in its lifetime. Most of that capital came in a 2021 round from SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, which valued the startup at $2 billion.\n\nOver the last decade, LTK has established itself as one of the leading players in affiliate marketing, building a network of influencers who promote products on social media in exchange for commissions.\n\nRecently, the company has made a series of moves to establish itself beyond social media affiliate marketing.\n\nThe company relaunched its app for influencer-driven shopping, called LTK, in early 2025, to add more consumer-facing features as it sought to build its own brand identity with consumers.\n\nIn late 2025, the company announced it was revamping its platform for brands, offering features such as creator discovery and performance tracking at no cost. LTK makes money by collecting a commission on sales. The company said that over 1,000 brands have been onboarded onto the platform.\n\nLTK is one of several creator economy startups that have focused their businesses on e-commerce. Other big players in the space include affiliate platform ShopMy and live-selling app Whatnot, which in October raised $225 million at an $11.5 billion valuation.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 12 (Reuters) - China's chief trade negotiator Li Chenggang met Mexico's Deputy Economy Minister Vidal Llerenas in Beijing on Monday, in ‌the first face-to-face talks since Mexico imposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports, ‌drawing warnings from Beijing.\n\nThe two countries conducted in-depth exchanges on bilateral economic and trade relations and ​other issues, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHow do USMCA negotiations affect Chinese investment plans?\n\nHow might China respond to Mexico's tariff increases?\n\nWhy did Mexico impose higher tariffs on China?\n\nWhat impact could tariffs have on China-Mexico trade?\n\nMexico announced in December steep tariff increases on China and other countries without free trade agreements with Mexico - most up to 35%. The move was widely interpreted by analysts as an attempt ‌to placate U.S. President Donald ⁠Trump, who levied significant tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nMexico's duties apply to thousands of goods including automobiles, auto parts, textiles, clothing, plastics and ⁠steel.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the tariffs are intended to increase domestic production and address trade imbalances. The tariffs are expected to have the biggest impact on China, which ​is Mexico's ​second-largest trading partner after the United States.\n\nChina's ​Commerce Ministry had warned Mexico to \"think ‌twice\" before levying tariffs and said it would take steps in response to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, but it has so far not announced countermeasures.\n\nSeparately, China's top automaker BYD said in 2024 it was considering setting up a factory in Mexico, although the FT reported in March that China was delaying approval for ‌the plant over concerns of technology leakage to ​the United States.\n\nThe China-Mexico talks come as the ​U.S., Mexico and Canada prepare to ​jointly review their free trade agreement by July 1.\n\nThe U.S.' top ‌trade negotiator has said the pact ​is not equipped to ​deal with surges of exports and investment from non-market economies such as China into the region, suggesting the U.S. may press for tighter rules on ​China-origin goods in a ‌new agreement. That would make it harder for Chinese firms to use ​Mexico as a base for exporting to the U.S.",

In other words, whether those are the rare earths we actually need. So we still ‌need to investigate,\" he said.\n\nGiven Taiwan does ​not mine such elements itself, it can ​instead play a role in ​refining the materials from other countries, Kung added.\n\n\"The technology ‌is not an issue; the next ​step is scaling up,\" ​he said.\n\nTaiwan consumes 1,500 metric tonnes of rare earth annually, a figure projected to rise to 2,000 metric tonnes given economic growth, ​Kung added.\n\n\"Our goal is ‌to expand production capacity to meet half of our demand ​by then, strengthening the supply chain.\"",

The firm pointed to recent market volatility stemming from President Donald Trump's threats on Greenland.\n\nGeopolitical conflict could have a more significant impact on AI trade down the line, considering that Europe is a major market for the US tech sector, it added. The US's allies and partners in Europe make up around 40% of revenue among tech firms, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"But our sense is that for those to have a lasting effect on the AI rally, they'd have to either have a sizeable effect on the US economy or on tech companies' earnings through some other channel,\" Mathew added of the risk.",

    "description": "TikTok dances won't make you an A-list celebrity anymore. But niche content creators make substantial incomes and are having a moment.",
    "fullText": "Sorry, but you're not going to be the next MrBeast. In fact, YouTube's top creator might be part of a dying breed of megastars.\n\nAs algorithms on TikTok and Instagram become more personalized, everyone's For You page is tailored to them. That means creators aren't appearing to new audiences as often, which is hurting their chances of becoming universally recognized celebrities.\n\nIt's the \"hardest it's ever been to break through the noise and become a big macro creator,\" Reed Duchscher, MrBeast's former manager, told Business Insider.\n\nWe're entering the era of the \"niche creator,\" and it's changing how talent agents, managers, investors, and other industry executives think about the influencer business. Few are betting on the idea of incubating influencers into A-list stars. The new strategy is all about finding creators who make specialized content, have a small but fiercely loyal fan base, and are hungry to build businesses outside the social feed.\n\nThere are vastly more creators than ever before. The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimated last year that there are about 1.5 million full-time content creators. Millions of amateurs are posting videos for fun or as a side hustle, and AI video generators are making it easier than ever to spit out content.\n\nWithout appealing to a specific community, it's harder than ever to get seen at all.\n\n\"I would not want to try to break into the creator sphere right now if I didn't have a niche,\" said Kelsey Reese, a TikTok creator who makes DIY and fashion content.\n\nFor those who missed the window for global TikTok fame — which saw the emergence of Charli D'Amelio, Addison Rae, and Khaby Lame — the path to a creator career requires a clear strategy.\n\n\"At this point, to grow, you have to contribute something new and something different,\" Reese said. It's \"a lot more difficult than posting a little TikTok dance.\"\n\nTikTok's early years were defined by a monoculture — or as close as social media could get — featuring creators like the Hype House crew.\n\nYou could hack your way to the top of everyone's TikTok feeds by collabing with the right creators or jumping incessantly on trends — does anyone remember Jason Derulo's 2020 campaign? New faces broke into the mainstream each year.\n\nThe 10 most popular creators on TikTok this quarter are roughly the same from a year ago, with just one new entrant, Indonesian influencer Willie Salim, according to follower data from analytics firm Social Blade. That's different from early 2021, a moment of rapid user growth at TikTok, when five new faces entered the app's top 10 compared to the previous year.\n\nYouTube stars are similarly static in 2026. Its top 10 creators this quarter are identical to a year ago, according to Social Blade's global subscriber tallies. MrBeast has been the platform's most followed individual creator since 2022.\n\nThe top talent lock-in is changing how talent agents and managers think about who to sign next.\n\nFinding someone who can break through at a global scale \"feels really, really difficult in today's day and age,\" said Kai Gayoso, a managing partner at Range Media Partners. Gayoso said he cares less about follower counts and views prospective talent through the lens of \"what can we as representation do to go and build a really compelling business that can exist on its own and actually scale, potentially outside of the creator.\"\n\nFor Nick Jacklin, a partner at Underscore Talent, growing talent is all about drilling down to what's made their content appealing.\n\n\"We're helping them just narrow their focus,\" he said. \"This is what seems to be working. Let's double down on this for six or nine or 12 months.\"\n\nTrying to find the next MrBeast is not a practical business plan. Instead, it's about tracking down a talented content creator with an entrepreneurial drive.\n\n\"These creators are not going to be generalists,\" Duchscher said. \"They're going to be very specific to their niche, and then we're going to be able to build production companies and businesses with them in that specific vertical.\"\n\nBeing popular in a narrow category can lead to big revenue, even if you don't reach Kardashian-level fame.\n\nA main area of focus for creators' teams is influencer marketing, where US spend is expected to cross $12 billion this year, according to a forecast from EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company.\n\nFor talent with a clearly defined vertical, the sponsorship pitch to brands can be straightforward, Jacklin said. A creator who mostly cooks pasta in videos can easily sell their audience to Barilla or De Cecco, for example.\n\nIt's also more obvious which products an influencer should consider launching themselves, Duchscher said. That pasta creator could roll out a line of tomato sauces with their face on the jar.\n\nSlow Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in creators' businesses, is looking for influencers with authority in particular communities. Being limited in what you post about can be a key part of the appeal.\n\nIt's not just about making dog grooming videos, it's about being the \"go-to pet groomer for Australian Huskies with this length hair,\" Slow Ventures' partner Megan Lightcap said.\n\n\"For us, taking a bet on these super niche and vertical creators was just way more defensible than backing broad-name, bigger kinds of celebrities,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, you're betting on their ability to retain attention, which is just so hard.\"\n\nSome creators are turning to alternative platforms to make money, like Discord and Substack, where niche content thrives. Nick Norwitz, a health YouTuber and Underscore client, used Substack to launch his science newsletter, for instance.\n\nEstella Struck, founder of talent management firm Viviene, said that in-person events are another avenue for creators.\n\nWith AI content overload and the generalized experience of being \"chronically online\" for nearly a decade, \"people want human connection,\" Struck said.\n\nInfluencers are hosting their own events or working with brand partners to bring that online community into the real world.\n\nReese — one of Struck's clients who has over 200,000 Instagram followers and 428,000 on TikTok — said she isn't looking to get \"super famous.\"\n\n\"I just want to be successful and have an abundant platform to show off my work,\" she said, \"and make a comfortable income from it.\"",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday the fuel situation in Cuba was critical and U.S. attempts to \"suffocate\" the island's economy were causing many difficulties, pledging to act ​against any sort of military intervention and expressing Moscow's solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nCuba detailed ‌its plans to navigate the deepening crisis on Friday including protecting essential services and rationing fuel, as the communist-run government dug ‌in its heels in defiance of a U.S. effort to cut off oil supplies.\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has declared Cuba \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security and said it will no longer receive oil from Venezuela after the U.S. operation to capture its leader Nicolas Maduro last month. It has threatened ⁠to impose tariffs on other suppliers ‌like Mexico if they continue to ship fuel to the island.\n\n\"The situation in Cuba is indeed critical. We are aware of this. We are maintaining intensive contacts ‍with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nRussia is trying to restore its own battered ties with the United States as Trump seeks to broker a deal to end its war in ​Ukraine. But the Kremlin made clear it was unhappy with Washington's treatment of Cuba.\n\n\"The suffocating tactics ‌employed by the United States are indeed causing many difficulties for the country. We are discussing with our Cuban friends possible ways to resolve these problems, or at least to provide all possible assistance,\" said Peskov.\n\nPeskov was answering a question about jet fuel shortages and whether that might affect Russian tourists wanting to leave Cuba, a long-time ally of Moscow's.\n\nCuba warned international airlines that jet fuel would no longer ⁠be available on the island beginning on Tuesday. Air Canada ​said on Monday it was suspending flights to Cuba.\n\nRussian Foreign ​Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a message marking the day of diplomatic workers in Russia, said Moscow sought to build relations with developing countries.\n\n\"The focus remains on countering neo-colonial ‍practices, from unilateral coercive measures ⁠to military interventions,\" Lavrov wrote on his ministry's website.\n\n\"In this context, we reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Venezuela and Cuba. We are convinced that only they can determine their ⁠own destiny.\"\n\nRussia's ambassador to Cuba, Viktor Coronelli, told the state RIA news agency last week that Moscow had repeatedly supplied oil ‌to Cuba in recent years, and would continue to do so.",

    "fullText": "While theme park giants such as Disney and Universal have continued to see high visitor numbers in an uncertain economy, many smaller amusement parks and themed hotels in different parts of the world have struggled with rising operational costs, to the point of having to shut down business.\n\nAfter posting a loss of more than $1.2 billion at the end of 2025, Six Flags shared its intention to close more \"underperforming\" locations in its amusement and water park portfolio across North America. A Six Flags park in Maryland had closed down month earlier in November 2025.\n\nAt the start of the new year, the Cartoon Network Hotel serving primarily visitors to the Dutch Wonderland park in central Pennsylvania also shut its doors over a string of financial challenges dating back to the Covid pandemic.\n\nOperating in the British seaside town of Somerset since 1946, Brean Theme Park has become the latest theme park to risk a total shutdown after being assigned liquidators over its financial situation.\n\nThe 80-year-old park was originally a campsite for visitors to the coastline along the Bristol Channel but was expanded into a theme park with rides in the 1970s.\n\nThe park that had become beloved local staple known for its free entry (visitors paid credits for rides they wanted to take) had more than 40 attractions and was preparing to open for the summer season in March when it announced that it was taking \"resolutions for winding-up\" on February 4.\n\nNicholas Stafford of Hazlewoods LLP is the insolvency attorney overseeing the liquidation of Brean in a way that helps creditors and shareholders recoup some of their losses.\n\nAs a former public company, Brean stopped trading at the end of January and, short of a last-minute Hail Mary, will be shuttered forever in the coming weeks. The local notice announcing this decision states that \"the Company be wound up voluntarily.\"\n\nAccording to local reports, visitor numbers dipped significantly during the Covid pandemic, and the theme park was not able to recover from the debt created during that period.\n\nThe closure marks a significant blow to both the Somerset community and vacationers from nearby cities such as Gloucester and Bristol.\n\nThe struggling theme park had been renting land from Unity Holidays, the company also behind parks such as Brean Unity Holidays, Brean Splash, Brean Play, and Brean Gym, reported U.K. outlet Daily Express. Those parks, according to their ownership, will continue to operate in the coming summer.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan's volatile financial markets must now contend with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi firmly in the driver's seat after her decisive victory on Sunday, which hands her an electoral mandate to reflate the economy.\n\nThe question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously.\n\nHow has the Takaichi trade impacted Japanese markets?\n\nWhy are investors concerned about Japan's debt burden?\n\nHow might Takaichi's electoral victory affect policy direction?\n\nWhat are Takaichi's key economic stimulus policies?\n\nSince she began her rise to become the nation's first female premier in October, the \"Takaichi trade\" has pushed domestic shares to record highs while causing a precipitous selloff in Japanese government bonds ‌and the yen.\n\nVoters braved heavy snowfalls in Tokyo and other parts of Japan to deliver what exit polls indicated to be the most decisive win for Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party since 1996.\n\n\"The stock market is a true believer in Takaichi, so the big win is going to be good news for equities when the markets open on Monday,\" said Chris Scicluna, the head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.\n\nTakaichi, a devotee of the \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies of the late premier Shinzo Abe, has ⁠pledged a proactive fiscal policy funded largely through bond ‌issuance.\n\nShe came to office at a low point in power and popularity for her Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-World War Two period, forcing her to bargain with opposition parties with even more liberal fiscal ‍platforms.\n\n\"The administration's foundation will become much more stable, making it easier for expectations to build around advancing economic policy,\" said Kota Suzuki, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management. \"Because there will no longer be a need to actively seek the opposition's cooperation, there will be less pressure for giveaway-style fiscal expansion.\"\n\nWith polls already indicating a decisive LDP win, Japan's benchmark ​Nikkei 225 Index set an all-time high of 54,782.83 on Tuesday. Big winners of late include sectors like defence, artificial intelligence and chips that ‌have been singled out by Takaichi for targeted investment.\n\nBut prospects for more government outlays have unsettled investors already concerned about Japan's debt burden, the largest in the developed world. Those worries came to a head on January 20, when rates across the JGB yield curve shot to multi-decade or even record highs after Takaichi called for the snap election and embraced suspending the sales tax on food.\n\nThe yen has also been punished, losing about 6% against the dollar since Takaichi's selection as prime minister in October and plumbing record lows against the euro and Swiss franc. Only threats of joint currency market intervention with the United ⁠States have arrested the yen's slide.",

    "description": "Some Wall Street banks are betting the US economy is going to run hot in 2026. But David Kelly thinks things will be a little chillier than expected.",
    "fullText": "Some Wall Street banks are betting the US economy is going to run hot in the months and years ahead, predicting a stretch of high growth and hot inflation.\n\nBut David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, thinks things will be a little chillier than most are expecting.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider this week, Kelly said that by the fourth quarter of this year, he expects to see both GDP growth and inflation under 2%. Given that the economy grew 4.3% in the third quarter last year and inflation was 2.7% in December, that might sound surprising.\n\nKelly's reasoning? Immigration numbers are falling, and that will eventually weigh on the labor pool and consumer demand.\n\n\"We're getting stimulus right now from income tax refunds, we may get some stimulus from tariff rebate checks, but all that's gonna fade in the fourth quarter of this year, and the economy really can't grow more than about 1.5% per year without some change in immigration numbers,\" Kelly said. \"I think that could allow for some more rate cuts in 2027 in a sort of soggier economy.\"\n\nHe pointed to January Census Bureau data that the agency said showed a \"historic decline in net international migration.\"\n\n\"I think a report that didn't get enough prominence last week was the Census Bureau report, which showed not so much what immigration did over the last year or the year that ended in July of 2025, but what they think is going on right now,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"Right now, they think that annual immigration to the United States is down to 321,000. If that's right, the working age population age 18 to 64, is falling by 20,000 people per month.\"\n\nGiven these numbers, Kelly said he's leaning away from parts of the market that could be sensitive to population declines, such as consumer staples and housing.\n\n\"I'd be a little cautious about consumer staples here,\" he said. \"I saw a large consumer staples company blaming some poor results on consumer worries or consumer income. It's not consumer worries or consumer income, it's a lack of consumers.\"\n\nKelly said investors are best off increasing their exposure to international stocks right now. While ex-US stocks have outperformed in the last year, they still have have cheap valuations relative to US stocks, he said. Plus, US investors are still historically under-indexed on international due to the long-run outperformance of US stocks in recent decades.\n\n\"Ask yourself one question: Where is there an embedded prejudice within markets?\" Kelly said. \"Where is there something where people almost irrationally hate something or irrationally love something?\"\n\n\"We saw this, after the tech meltdown after the dot com bubble burst. We saw that with financials in 2009,\" he continued. \"Well, today, what do people really hate? People hate international. US investors hate international.\"\n\nKelly said that it didn't necessarily matter which regions or countries outside the US to invest in, but to simply add exposure. Examples of funds that offer exposure to international stocks include the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU) and the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS).\n\nOutside of stocks, Kelly said he prefers municipal bonds over corporate credit because of the relative tax savings. In alternative assets, which are historically uncorrelated to stock movements, Kelly prefers the real estate, infrastructure, and global transportation themes.",

    "description": "As tech sells off, Wall Street is in the midst of a rotation that Piper Sandler analysts say should favor stocks in \"old economy\" sectors of the market.",
    "fullText": "Investors looking for refuge from the tech sell-off slamming Wall Street should look to the \"old economy.\"\n\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler offered a handful of ideas for weary investors weathering the tech sell-off this week. The latest rout, which started in a small corner of the software space, eventually spread to bigger names like Microsoft after an agentic AI update from Anthropic sparked AI replacement fears. The new bearish AI sentiment has bled into the wider tech sector, with a risk-off shift gripping investors in the last few days.\n\nWhile some commentators argue the software crash is overblown, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, others frame it as a healthy rotation away from tech.\n\nPiper Sandler analysts are in the \"rotation nation\" camp, seeing the tech sell-off as a shift to \"old economy\" plays in cyclical and value shares.\n\n\"The bull market is intact; however, it's not being led by the popular Tech and Growth favorites of investors. Instead, new momentum and leadership are emerging in cyclical and value sectors—Energy, Industrials, Materials, Staples, and Banks,\" they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 information technology sector is the worst performer in the index in 2026, down more than 6% year to date. The losses have been particularly pronounced in software this week, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF falling 17% in the last week.\n\n\"After years of focus on identifying stocks with the greatest potential AI exposure, concerns about disruption have pushed investors back toward 'real economy' industries, including those leveraged to recent signs of accelerating economic growth,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote this week.\n\nThe analysts examined industry exposure to AI automation compared to labor costs and sales to determine which spaces are most insulated. Some of Piper Sandler's \"old economy\" sectors, specifically energy, industrials, and consumer staples, were part of the same group Goldman flagged.\n\nGoldman analysts added that the sell-off has only sped up an existing market rotation into cyclical stocks.\n\n\"The investor search for insulation from AI disruption risk has accelerated the ongoing cyclical rally,\" they wrote.\n\nBeyond clear flight from stocks exposed to AI risks, BNY Investment researchers credit the rotation, in part, to a cyclical recovery in the US economy.\n\n\"The prevailing narrative in US equity markets is one of market broadening and leadership rotation, consistent with our view of a cyclical recovery in the US economy,\" the BNY analysts wrote.",

    "fullText": "Apparent collapse of Nvidia–OpenAI tie-up raises questions about circular funding and who will bear the cost of AI’s expansion\n\nDid the circular AI economy just wobble? Last week it was reported that a much-discussed $100bn deal – announced last September – between Nvidia and OpenAI might not be happening at all.\n\nThis was a circular arrangement through which the chipmaker would supply the ChatGPT developer with huge sums of money that would largely go towards the purchase of its own chips.\n\nIt is this type of deal that has alarmed some market watchers, who detect a whiff of the 1999-2000 dotcom bubble in these transactions.\n\nNow it seems that Nvidia was not as solid on this investment as had been widely believed, according to the Wall Street Journal. Negotiations had not progressed, with Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, privately emphasising that the deal was “non-binding” and “not finalised”. Huang appeared to confirm this in Taipei on Saturday, telling reporters that Nvidia would make a “huge” investment into OpenAI’s next funding round, but “nothing like” $100bn.\n\nA report from Reuters soon suggested that the feeling was mutual: OpenAI was “unsatisfied” with Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, it said, and seeking alternatives. Nvidia’s stock has taken a 10% hit so far this week, a flurry of headlines have ensued and both companies have stepped into damage control.\n\n“We love working with Nvidia and they make the best AI chips in the world,” wrote Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, on X. “We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time.”\n\nEven Oracle appears to be shaken: the software company, which is counting on a $300bn cloud computing deal with OpenAI, said it still expects the startup to be good for its commitment even if it does not receive the full amount from Nvidia. In total, OpenAI has committed to compute deals – the infrastructure for building and powering its AI tools – worth more than $1tn.\n\n“The Nvidia-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI,” Oracle posted on X. “We remain highly confident in OpenAI’s ability to raise funds and meet its commitments.”\n\nThat a $100bn deal between two of the most crucial players in AI appears to have evaporated over a weekend is unsettling. But there are solid business reasons behind the apparent shake-up, said Alvin Nguyen, analyst at research firm Forrester.\n\nOpenAI’s ambitious growth trajectory means it will be difficult for the company to stick with a single vendor, especially as it plans new, computationally demanding AI models, he said. “They need chips. They need as many as possible.”\n\nAs for Nvidia, its commitment to the $100bn may have been loose in the first place, even as it was widely reported. “They will not discourage people from overhyping. Why say something and immediately sucker punch your own share price?”\n\nFor a giant startup like OpenAI, manoeuvring in and out of deals – for example, with chipmakers – may just be business as usual, said Nguyen: “You know [Altman’s] background as a startup person, and you know the manoeuvres he’s doing make sense from a startup perspective.”\n\nFor Nvidia, meanwhile, AI hype is part of selling chips. “You don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Nguyen. “And so you let other people put numbers out there for you and let that drive the hype.”\n\nThe issue is, of course, that investors and other companies like Oracle may have taken widely reported $100bn commitments seriously.\n\nIn response to a query from the Guardian, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to Altman’s X post, and to remarks Huang made to CNBC on Tuesday, including: “There is no drama.”\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Our teams are actively working through details of our partnership. Nvidia technology has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”\n\nNvidia and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis is all taking place against the backdrop of a changing investment landscape for AI, where hype is giving way to realities about what aspects of the technology are actually going to earn money.\n\nWhile investors ponder whether OpenAI is going to be able to pay for a $1.4tn compute deal, reality is biting further down the AI food chain. This week has seen a massive sell-off in certain software stocks, prompted in part by the launch of a new Anthropic AI tool that can carry out a number of professional services, which has led to fears that business models exposed to competition from AI products will be disrupted .\n\nThis is the flip-side of “jagged AI”, which is the term for advanced AI tools having uneven talents, such as being good at sifting through documents but less good at solving complex maths problems. If advanced systems are good at automating legal work, then legacy companies in service industries will suffer. The losers are beginning to emerge and are being picked up by investors.\n\nAt the top of the AI pyramid the competitive effects are also biting. OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, is losing ground to competitors. Data released on Tuesday show its market share has eroded from 69% to 45% owing to the rise of Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude. OpenAI appears to have retreated from soaring talk of super-intelligence in the past months, focusing instead on profitable mundanities such as adverts and adult content.\n\nThe apparent evaporation of a $100bn deal may be of a piece with last year’s sci-fi rhetoric meeting this year’s practicalities. The question is, who might be left holding the bill?\n\n“I think there will be knock-on effects,” said Nguyen. “I mean, it’s that statement: the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”",

Here are the winners he sees in each category.\n\nOhmes thinks value retail names will get a boost as lower and middle-income tax filers are likely to spend refund cash on consumer staples and paying down debt.\n\n\"Tax refunds in the lowest (sub $3K) refund buckets appear to support growth in discretionary purchases (general merchandise) along with growth in spending on Groceries & Gas,\" the analyst said.\n\nBroadline retail is a category that the bank associates with higher-income households. Ohmes said Costco and Walmart will benefit as high earners gravitate toward these stores and as the companies double down on same-day delivery and e-commerce ventures.\n\n\"As a result, we believe WMT & COST could see greater benefits from tax refunds in 2026 vs. LY as well as potentially higher exposure to middle- and higher-income filers who benefit from higher standard deductions for seniors and the higher state and local tax (SALT) cap,\" he noted.\n\nThe analyst added that he also expects broadline retailers to benefit from an increase in spending on consumer electronics, which could benefit other retail names like Best Buy.\n\nMany retailers saw solid gains in Tuesday's session amid a pronounced rotation out of tech stocks. Walmart jumped 3% to hit a $1 trillion valuation.",

    "description": "Chipotle plans to raise prices this year, but executives said on Tuesday that their core consumer, who makes over $100k, probably won't mind.",
    "fullText": "Chipotle Mexican Grill plans to raise menu prices by 1-2% this year — and leadership is betting that its core consumer segment, digital natives who earn over $100k, won't mind.\n\nSpeaking during Tuesday's fourth-quarter earnings call, interim CEO Scott Boatwright said Chipotle is focusing on boosting foot traffic and revenue amid weak comparable sales. To do that, they're targeting their core customer, who sits firmly at the top end of the K-shaped economy.\n\nChipotle recently conducted a \"deep dive\" of consumer research to identify the demographics and desires of its core audience and refine its strategy accordingly, Boatwright said.\n\n\"What we've learned is the guest skews younger, a little higher income, is typically a digital native, and that their grounded purpose aligns with our North Star as a brand, around clean food, clean ingredients, high protein,\" Boatwright said. \"We are the way they want to eat, and we're going to lean into that in the most meaningful way.\"\n\n\"After looking at the data last week, we learned that 60% of our core users are over $100,000 a year in average household income,\" he added. \"That gives us confidence that we can lean into that group in a more meaningful way, whether it's the solo occasion and/or group occasions to really drive meaningful transaction performance in the year.\"\n\nChipotle beat revenue estimates in 2025, its earnings report released on Tuesday showed, despite comparable restaurant sales decreasing 1.7%. The company projected its comparable sales in 2026 would be \"about flat,\" accounting for the openings of between 350 and 370 new restaurants.\n\nIn 2026, Chipotle's margins will remain \"under pressure,\" Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer said during the call, so consumers can expect pricing to increase 1-2% to narrow the gap between rising expenses and menu prices.\n\nThe broader restaurant segment is struggling with slumping sales as the K-shaped economy has upended the typical playbook for value deals and marketing campaigns. Lower-income consumers have been cutting back on spending, especially dining out, as they face rising costs across the board, while higher-income households show no signs of slowing their spending.\n\nTo draw in traffic, Chipotle recently launched its new protein snack menu, allowing customers to purchase a single taco or a side of meat (either chicken or steak) in a cup. It has also sped up the cadence of its limited-time offer releases, such as the recent promotions for chicken al pastor and red chimichurri sauce.\n\nThose promotions seem to be working, and are proof that Chipotle's core customer isn't particularly price-sensitive, Boatwright said during Tuesday's call.\n\nPrior to the protein snack menu debut, Boatwright said leadership considered whether the launch would result in a \"consumer trade-down\" effect, a common phenomenon in which price-sensitive consumers opt for a discount deal or a lower-cost menu item than they'd usually order to find better value — but \"frankly, we just didn't see it.\"\n\nInstead of becoming a cheaper alternative to their usual favorite, customers are frequently purchasing the protein side as an add-on to their typical order, which Boatwright said \"gives us confidence that the core consumer is not necessarily looking for a smaller, lower price-pointed component to the menu.\"\n\nBoatwright added that Chipotle will continue to test ideas to keep consumers coming back, including more limited-time offers and drink innovations. He also teased a \"Happier Hour\" deal specifically to re-engage younger and lower-income customers, but he added, \"I don't know if it'll be a meaningful unlock for Chipotle.\"\n\nChipotle's stock sank by more than 6% in after-hours trading.",

    "fullText": "Tehran, Iran – Iran’s economic outlook appears increasingly grim more than three weeks after the start of what became one of the most comprehensive and prolonged state-imposed internet blackouts in history, impacting a population of more than 90 million people.\n\nIranian authorities abruptly cut off all communications across the country on the night of January 8, at the height of nationwide protests that the United Nations and international human rights organisations say were suppressed with the use of deadly force.\n\nMost of Iran’s internet bandwidth, local and international phone calls and SMS text messages have been restored over recent days. But most of the country is still unable to freely connect to the global internet amid heavy filtering by the state.\n\nThe increased bandwidth allows more people to circumvent state restrictions using a variety of proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs), but solutions are often costly and temporary.\n\nLast week, Information and Communications Technology Minister Sattar Hashemi told reporters his ministry estimates that the Iranian economy suffered at least 50 trillion rials (about $33m at the current exchange rate) in damages on a daily basis during the blackout.\n\nBut the minister admitted that the true toll is likely much higher, and said that other ministers and economic officials have privately offered heftier estimates that he did not expand upon.\n\nThe government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has said the decision to fully block connectivity was taken outside of its control by the Supreme National Security Council.\n\nPezeshkian, who had made scaling back internet filtering a main campaign promise, has refrained from talking about Iran’s largest internet blackout to date, instead focusing on economic reforms and cash subsidies.\n\nThe administration has promised to offer online businesses financial support, but the losses have already been sudden, acute, and too heavy to bear for many.\n\nSimin Siami, a travel agent working in Tehran, told Al Jazeera that her company lost most of its income and had to lay off a number of employees.\n\n“Most international flights were cancelled, and there was no way to purchase tickets or compare existing flights,” she said, adding that her company was also unable to book hotels for customers, who were initially even unable to renew their passports.\n\n“Unfortunately, that limited our services to selling tickets for local flights and booking local hotels, and cancelled all our previous international tickets and bookings.”",

They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has boasted about strengthening the US economy since returning to the Oval Office. Meanwhile, millions of Americans say they're struggling to afford food, rent, and other basic necessities.\n\nGary Cohn, Trump's former chief economic advisor, said both these realities are true right now in America.\n\n\"If you look at gross domestic product, which is the overall output of the US economy, we're trending about 5% right now, which is a very high growth rate in the United States,\" Cohn said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nCohn, who is now IBM's vice chairman, also cited promising trends in inflation and unemployment rates.\n\nHowever, those numbers don't give the whole picture.\n\n\"That said, we've got an interesting economy,\" Cohn said. \"We have a massive wealth effect at the top end, and we have got hardworking Americans having a very difficult time paying their bills, and they are suffering in this economy.\"\n\nThat's why, Cohn said, the Trump administration is making affordability a key issue going forward.\n\n\"The White House is going on the offensive. The president is going to spend time out on the road talking about affordability,\" Cohn said. \"Affordability will be the issue between now and the mid-term elections.\"\n\nThe widening gap between wealthy and lower-income Americans is often described as a \"K-shaped economy.\" That's when people at the top see profound economic growth, while those at the bottom, who are more sensitive to economic shifts, face financial stress. Some economists have cautioned that a K-shaped economy portends bad days ahead.\n\n\"A silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,\" Gregory Daco, a chief economist at EY, said in a recent LinkedIn post. \"Slower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median, and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.\"\n\nThe chief economist of RSM, Joe Brusuelas, said in a recent briefing that the US would need to undergo policy shifts to reshape the economy, but that likely won't happen in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" he said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"",

    "description": "As US-Canada relations grow rocky, Canada is rethinking its economy, its alliances, and its place on the world stage under Mark Carney.",
    "fullText": "It's a best-of-times, worst-of-times scenario for Canada on the global stage.\n\nTo get the bad out of the way, its most important ally — the United States — has grown increasingly antagonistic, with renewed tariff threats and talk of annexation coming from the White House. On the upside, Canada is signaling it can stand more firmly on its own. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has identified a \"rupture\" in North American integration and is moving his country in a more self-sufficient direction — both economically and politically. There's a recognition that Canada and the US will always be deeply intertwined — Americans aren't suddenly going to stop watching \"Heated Rivalry\" or \"Schitt's Creek,\" and the Toronto Maple Leafs aren't going to stop traveling south of the border — but some level of unwinding may now be unavoidable.\n\n\"Every country has to take care of itself,\" says Tony Stillo, director of Canada Economics at Oxford Economics, \"and Canada's putting Canada first.\"\n\nIn a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Carney struck a determined, defiant tone toward the US and a decades-old rules-based international order that, in his view, is now falling apart. \"Canadians know that our old comfortable assumptions that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security — that assumption is no longer valid,\" he said. In turn, he's made the choice to take on \"the world as it is, not wait around for a world we wish it to be.\"\n\nCarney is walking a fine line. He is right that the US is no longer as reliable a partner as it once was in the economy, security, and trade. And as much as President Donald Trump has turned the divide into a chasm, the fracture has been forming for years, as both Democratic and Republican administrations in the US have taken a more protectionist stance.\n\nAt the same time, Canada can't just walk away. Exports account for a third of Canada's GDP, and more than 75% of its exports go to the US. By comparison, exports are about one-tenth of the US's GDP, and around 16% of its exports go to Canada. Many of the two countries' biggest industrial sectors, including automotives and energy, are almost irreversibly interwoven. The uncertainty emanating from the US has a big impact on Canada's economy — as the saying goes, when the US catches a cold, Canada gets the flu.\n\nThere is also a short-term impetus to keep relations amicable. The US-Mexico-Canada trade deal (formerly known as NAFTA) is up for review mid-year, and the US, thanks to its sheer size, has more leverage.\n\n\"The prime minister's in an impossible situation. It is incredibly challenging for any Canadian on the international side right now to both vigorously defend our economy and to do that without escalating an already volatile relationship,\" says Dan Kelly, the president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. \"The pope himself, I think, would struggle to find the patience to deal with the US administration right now.\"\n\nCanada is trying to reduce its reliance on the US through a series of policies aimed at growing and integrating its domestic economy. The federal government removed internal trade barriers that prevented goods and even workers from flowing between provinces. The IMF estimates that fully eliminating them would boost real Canadian GDP by 7%. Many Canadian consumers are opting to buy Canadian products where possible. Under Carney, the country established the Major Projects Office as part of a push to advance nation-building ventures and streamline regulatory approvals for ambitious programs in mining, energy, ports, and rail.\n\n\"The government isn't trying to just invest, they're trying to catalyze and incentivize private money to come in,\" Stillo says.\n\nThese are steps in the right direction, but the major projects will take years to build. This is a long-term undertaking.\n\n\"We have high-talent workers. We're the most educated in the OECD. We have real innovation in areas like AI and quantum computing, and we have natural resources — critical minerals, LNG, oil and gas — most countries would absolutely love to have,\" says Matthew Holmes, the chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \"We have all the preconditions to be an energy superpower and a major player economically, but we need to get our domestic economy fundamentals.\"\n\nKelly tells me about a third of CFIB's members, which are small- and medium-sized businesses, have started to do more business internationally in countries beyond the US, and a third are doing more internal trade. A recent business survey from the Bank of Canada found that sentiment remains \"subdued,\" though firms' overall outlook has improved slightly.\n\nPart of the problem Canada faces is that any move it makes to cultivate ties elsewhere may elicit an outsize reaction from its neighbors to the south. Just look at its recent trade negotiations with China. Carney visited China in January and subsequently announced that Canada would allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at a 6.1% tariff rate, while China agreed to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed. When Trump caught wind of it, he threatened to put 100% tariffs on Canadian goods coming into the US. Canada has tried to calm the situation, emphasizing that it's not entering a free trade agreement with China, it's just settling some preexisting disputes. The tit-for-tat also comes as Canadian oil sales in China surge, as it pushes into Asia.\n\n\"We're not running into the arms of China,\" says Julian Karaguesian, a course lecturer in McGill University's economics department. \"We're just looking to take a couple of eggs out of this basket and spread them around the world. And China's the largest economy in the world after the United States.\"\n\nCanada has trade opportunities outside the US and has set a goal to double non-US exports over the next decade. It already has a robust set of free trade agreements and is the only G7 nation to have them with all other G7 members. It's also likely looking toward India and MERCOSUR, a trade bloc in South America.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has downplayed the ongoing spat, calling it \"political noise\" coming out of the prime minister. He said Canada has the \"second-best deal in the world\" with the US, behind Mexico. Lutnick also indicated that getting too close to China could hurt Canada amid the USMCA talks set for the summer and create a \"road map\" for overhauling the entire deal. Given the constantly changing nature of the US and Canada's relationship as of late — and Trump's ever-shifting focus on a variety of issues — the possible scenarios for USMCA negotiations run the gamut, from minor adjustments to a total breakdown in talks.\n\n\"With USMCA, the gloves are going to be off,\" Karaguesian says.\n\nNone of this is to say that Canada is in sterling shape. Its economy is growing at a lackluster pace, and its labor market is doing OK, but not great. Productivity has been lagging for years. It would surely prefer the US were not so adversarial. At the same time, the country and its leaders are clear-eyed about what's happened and are laying out a plan for what's next, internationally and domestically. Holmes, from the Chamber of Commerce, says Canada has had a sort of \"it's the economy, stupid\" moment under Carney.\n\nPeter Morrow, an economist at the University of Toronto, says that Canada is doing better than was feared a year ago. \"There were a lot of concerns about dramatic levels of protectionism in the United States and all but complete collapses of manufacturing in Canada,\" he says. \"The realized tariffs have not been as dramatic as they might have been otherwise,\" he says. The effective tariff rate on Canadian goods coming into the US is still under 10%. Carney has a \"very good relationship with reality,\" Morrow says, and as much as economic nightmare scenarios haven't come to pass, the geopolitical outlook is worse than expected, given the instability of the NATO alliance and the deterioration of the global rules-based system that's been in place since World War II.\n\nMost of the economists and business people I spoke to for this story agreed that Canada coming into its own was a long time in the making. From Bush's \"you're with us or against us\" mentality post-9/11 to Obama's \"Buy America\" push to Biden's industrial policy, America has been acting like a less friendly friend for a while. Trump has taken it to an extreme, often failing to differentiate between international friend and foe. If it nudges Canada further out of America's shadow, the thinking goes, so be it. Carney's declaration that the global economy's middle powers need to band together and his suggestion that the US cannot be trusted is a sentiment he's not alone in — he's just saying it out loud.\n\n\"Carney is saying things that obviously encapsulate well how many, many countries, companies, and leaders are feeling, including many parts in many parts of the United States,\" Kelly says, adding that Carney's economic background and focus are also a plus. \"For a decade, anything economic was kind of issue number 500 on the Trudeau government's list of priorities. And now it seems very much like ensuring our economy is in high gear is the top job for the prime minister.\"\n\nOne of the main pieces of certainty Canada can have, at least in the immediate future, is that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty coming from the US. In many ways, America has become a threat actor and cause of decline. This has fostered a novel level of pro-Canadian sentiment within the country's borders and also boosted Carney's profile on the international and domestic stage — his approval rating jumped to 60% in a recent poll.\n\nThis is also landing at what's culturally a bright moment for Canada. Canada's men's hockey team is favored to win gold at the coming Winter Olympics, following up its victory in 2025's Four Nations tournament. Its women's team will likely be in contention for a medal as well. The gay hockey romance \"Heated Rivalry,\" out of Ontario, is everywhere. Tourists are turning up in Hamilton, Ontario, where the show is partially filmed, to check out some of the spots featured. The town is inviting them in.\n\n\"All these kinds of things to brand Canada's reputation as a welcoming place to everyone is not unhelpful,\" Kelly says. Especially as the US is moving in a different and much more unwelcoming direction.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "description": "Turkish Airlines is considered the best airline in Europe. Besides a few complaints, I get the hype — and I'd actually recommend eating the food.",
    "fullText": "I've flown coach on most major European and North American carriers, and economy food rarely makes a mark. Air Canada, British Airways, and United didn't exactly impress; Finnair and Delta were better, but not memorable.\n\nMy recent Turkish Airlines flight from New York to Istanbul, though, was beyond the norm.\n\nThe airline was named Europe's best economy class in the 2025 Skytrax awards, which evaluate cabin service, seating, and catering. Despite a few complaints, I could see why.\n\nPassengers received printed menus ahead of the meal service, detailing mains and sides — including salmon — all served with real cutlery. It wasn't the usual \"chicken or pasta,\" and the food tasted as good as it looked.\n\nTurkish outsources its New York catering to the Austrian company DO & CO. While DO & CO prepares meals for multiple airlines, Turkish sets its own standards for ingredients, plating, and presentation — which helps explain why the food looked and tasted a cut above competitors.\n\nThe Boeing 787 seat was otherwise in line with competitors, with a headrest and power, though the provided headphones were scratchy. The seatback screen, however, was among the largest I've seen in economy.\n\nI also appreciated the linens and storage, and the deep recline made sleeping easier — though it comes with a trade-off: to comfortably watch TV or avoid feeling cramped, everyone needs to recline.\n\nThis isn't ideal for using the tray table for work or streaming, and it relies on everyone cooperating. While I personally don't mind, those on the \"you should not recline\" side of the viral debate may find this frustrating.\n\nHere's what the full nine-hour economy flight on Turkish was like.\n\nThe flight was operated by a Boeing 787, equipped with Turkish' most modern economy cabin. The midday departure is currently the only 787 option on the route; overnight flights still use the older 777, which has noticeably dated screens and onboard tech.\n\nI wanted to fly Turkish's most up-to-date product. You'll also find similarly modern seats on most of the airline's Airbus A350-900s.\n\nI didn't check a bag and checked in via the Turkish app, meaning I could skip the desk and head straight to security. But I noticed the check-in area had a long line that wrapped around the corner.\n\nThe desk closes 60 minutes before departure, so arriving early — or sticking to carry-on only — may save you some time.\n\nThe Turkish Business Lounge is part of the Priority Pass network, which I access through my Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card.\n\nIt was small but offered free food and drinks, including eggs, meat, muffins, yogurt, and vegetables. There were no alcoholic beverages, but it was a comfortable place to pass the time with views of the ramp.\n\nI always pay extra for an aisle on long-haul flights so I can get up without disturbing others. I chose seat 26C, the closest aisle seat to the front at that price point.\n\nEconomy is arranged in a 3-3-3 layout, and each seat has 31 inches of pitch — the space between seatbacks — and 17.4 inches of width.\n\nWhile headrests are now common across the industry, I appreciated the extra seatback compartments for organizing cables, headphones, and snacks.\n\nBefore the first meal service, the crew handed out warm towels, water, and printed menus detailing each course. Lunch, as we were departing midday, included a choice of grilled salmon or mushroom orecchiette, followed by sides and dessert.\n\nBreakfast, served about 1.5 hours before our 6:30 a.m. local arrival, was a choice between a tomato-and-cheese omelet or a waffle with blueberry purée and vanilla sauce. It's easy to see why Turkish won Skytrax's award for best economy catering.\n\nDespite my skepticism, the salmon, served with ratatouille, Caesar salad, and celeriac mousseline, was fresh and flavorful, and the portions were generous. I was full by the time I got to the carrot cake.\n\nThe waffle was fluffy and sweet, paired with fruit, cheese, and bread. Beer and wine were complimentary with lunch, and I enjoyed the Turkish beer.\n\nWhile nothing beats the bidet on Japan's All Nippon Airways, I was surprised to find both a makeup mirror and a full-size mirror in the lavatory — a convenient touch for freshening up.\n\nI don't usually recommend eating airline food if you can avoid it, but Turkish seems to have figured it out. The meals felt lighter and more satisfying than usual, similar to what I've experienced on five-star carriers like Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe main drawback is the seat recline, which may frustrate travelers who want to work and find their workspace cramped by the seat ahead of them.\n\nTurkish also doesn't have a premium economy cabin, and only a few rows have extra legroom. Taller passengers should book early to secure bulkhead seats.",

    "fullText": "TUC urges ministers to bring forward changes to protect workers amid concerns over apps such as Temper\n\nThe fashion retailer Urban Outfitters, the bed specialist Dreams and the operator of several Royal Parks cafes have been criticised for the use of the gig economy app Temper to take on staff – some of whom can end up earning below minimum wage.\n\nThe TUC is urging the government to bring forward promised reforms to protect gig economy workers amid concerns that those hired by apps such as Temper are missing out on significant employment rights including sick pay, rest breaks, holiday pay and a minimum hourly rate.\n\nIt suggested that such apps are leading to bogus self-employed roles. “We find it hard to see how roles like shop assistant can be self-employed,” the trade union body said.\n\nA year ago a number of major high street chains including Lush and Uniqlo stopped using apps such as Temper and the now defunct YoungOnes to take on freelancers, after outrage over the spread of gig economy working into the retail sector.\n\nLast week Outernet, the central London music and digital art venue – which was advertising for £13-an-hour temporary “cloakroom hosts” on Temper – said it had removed jobs from the site after being contacted by the Guardian. “This was the first time we used this site and we won’t be again,” a spokesperson said.\n\nThe continued use of Temper by retailers and coffee shops indicates that freelancing continues to spread beyond delivery workers, such as Deliveroo riders, to store staff, baristas and warehouse workers.\n\nCharges imposed by Temper to guarantee swift payment – taken up by 80% of users according to the app – mean than some workers can receive less than the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over of £12.21 an hour. Freelance workers are not guaranteed the minimum wage, unlike employees.\n\nIn recent weeks, Urban Outfitters has been advertising a number of posts paying £12.50 an hour – including a stock assistant to help with the annual stock take in Exeter and sales assistants in Gateshead and Birmingham. The latter location has 70 reviews, suggesting it is a regular user of the service.\n\nWorkers who take up the Urban Outfitter roles and wish to be paid in fewer than 14 days must pay the 2.9% fee, taking their hourly rate down to £12.14, 7p an hour below the legal minimum wage for those aged 21 and over.\n\nIt was a similar story at Colicci Cafe, a family-owned business that runs cafes in London’s Royal Parks including Richmond Park, wherewas offering as low as £12.50 an hour for barista shifts in recent weeks. Anyone not wishing to wait up to 30 days for payment would have to pay the Temper fee, taking their hourly rate below the legal minimum for most workers.\n\nUrban Outfitters and Colicci did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDreams has advertised a number of posts in recent weeks including two paying £12.71 an hour, one of which involves helping delivery drivers with loading and unloading deliveries to customers’ homes and another for receiving and dispatching deliveries in its warehouse until 11pm. It has also offered a delivery driver post at £15.14.\n\nHowever, those who do not wish to wait for up to 60 days to be paid must pay the 2.9% fee to Temper – reducing their pay to £12.35 and £13.68 an hour – as they must pay the fee to Temper in order to be paid shortly after their shift instead.\n\nTemper has a “Free Security” insurance scheme that covers sick pay, but this falls short of protections workers would be entitled to if they were employed. Temper workers must have worked through the app at least 10 times within the previous three months to receive sick pay, and will only receive such payments after being off for more than two weeks.\n\nStatutory sick pay for employees currently kicks in after three days and from day one from April under new rights guaranteed in the Employment Rights Act.\n\nPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Cynical bosses should not be able to exploit gaps in the law to deny workers proper pay and conditions. The historic Employment Rights Act will bring welcome new protections. But without action on bogus self-employment, bad employers will make greater use of legal loopholes and talent platforms to deny workers their rights.”\n\nTemper, which claims it is gaining 1,000 new sign-ups a week through word of mouth, said in a statement: “We fully refute the comment that Temper constitutes ‘bogus’ self-employment.”\n\nIt said workers who signed up to its site could enjoy better protections than those on zero-hours contracts, including compensation of half what they would have earned on a shift if it is cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice.\n\n“Everyone who works via Temper is doing so on a self-employed basis, and this is made clear at sign-up and throughout the app (to both individuals and companies). It’s also the reality of how the platform operates, and people working via Temper: choose which shifts to apply for (or not), negotiate pay, are free to work for multiple clients and platforms and have the right to arrange a substitute to complete a shift.\n\n“We are committed to remaining fully compliant with UK employment law. If there are any changes to worker status definitions in the future, we will, of course, adapt our platform and model to remain fully compliant.\n\n“Many people value the flexibility of freelance work, and the challenge for policymakers is to balance flexibility with fairness.”\n\nTemper said it set a “floor” of £12.50 an hour, before fees, for hiring workers via its app and this would rise to £13 for all shifts from 1 February. It said applicants were free to negotiate on rates if they believed they were too low and could be taken on full time without any fees.",

    "description": "Reactions are already pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders about President Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.\n\nHere are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,\" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.\"\n\nEarlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the \"credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.\"\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that \"Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n\"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,\" Furman added. \"I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.\"\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n\"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,\" Brusuelas wrote on X.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,\" he added.\n\nRobin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh \"is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.\"\n\nHe did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.\n\n\"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,\" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Substack: \"As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal.

But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,\" he added.\n\nSonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: \"Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.\"\n\nWarsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,\" said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,\" he added.\n\nHoward, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an \"outstanding choice for Fed Chair.\"\n\n\"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,\" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.",

    "description": "The global economy is more resilient than expected, but that shouldn't be taken for granted, the IMF's Kristalina Georgieva said.",
    "fullText": "The International Monetary Fund projects another year of solid global economic growth — but it's also warning not to take the continued upward trajectory for granted.\n\nThe IMF predicts that the global economy will grow 3.3% in 2026, mirroring that 3.3% growth seen in 2025, with 2027 expected to see similar gains.\n\n\"The world economy is resilient but you should not take this resilience for granted,\" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of IMF said at an event on Monday.\n\nAccording to Georgieva, there are four things that are driving up growth, and at least one is being overlooked by observers.\n\nHere's what the IMF sees pushing the world economy higher.\n\nGovernments around the world have let the private sector take the reins. With \"governments put out from running the economy where they don't belong,\" private sector strength supports growth, Georgieva said.\n\nThe economist said in remarks at Davos that governments taking a back seat allows the private sector to be \"more adaptable, more agile, and we see the benefits of it\".\n\nThe global economy's recent growth has been less tied to trade, mitigating the impacts many had feared from Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy.\n\nThe fact that effective tariff rates are below liberation day levels has meant the impact has been significantly less than initially feared.\n\nDespite trade tensions spurred by tariffs, \"we continue to trade for now,\" Georgieva says, adding, \"don't take this for granted.\"\n\nGlobal AI spending reached 1.76 trillion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $3.34 trillion in 2026, according to Gartner.\n\nThe \"massive investment in AI\" has served to boost optimism in the global economy, Georgieva said.\n\nThe IMF economist says one factor that is often forgotten when assessing global economic growth is \"the role of good policies and strong institutions.\"\n\nGeorgieva flagged the role of independent central banks, specifically, in the resilient global economy. She said tht these things are often given little attention but, and as a result, that could \"erode\" that source of strength.\n\nCentral bank independence is a key concern in the US as President Trump's administration pressures Fed chair Jerome Powell. The latest tensions have arisen from a criminal investigation by the DOJ into Powell's testimony about the Fed building renovation.\n\nTrump has been vocal in his criticism of the Fed chair, rattling markets with his threats to fire Powell over the last year.",

    "fullText": "(The Center Square) – The Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl run isn’t just a win for the team, but also a win for the Seattle economy, particularly for downtown bars, restaurants and hotels near Lumen Field.\n\nHowever, economic principles of fungibility suggest that the overall, long-term economic impact on the city may be exaggerated.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Seahawks' victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday – which advanced the team to Super Bowl LX against the New England Patriots on Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. – means a genuine, short-term economic boost to Seattle, especially the local hospitality industry.\n\nAccording to Visit Seattle, hosting National Football League playoff games – which the Seahawks did twice, being the top seed in the National Football Conference – provides a vital economic stimulus during the typically quiet winter season, with hotel occupancy often soaring more than 50% above typical January figures.\n\nThe Center Square reached out to several organizations about the Seahawks’ potential championship run and asked if a team making the Super Bowl brings localized, high-impact spending during the playoffs, noting the difference between a short-term economic boost and the more mixed long-term impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, I have absolutely no data to validate whether or not those claims may be true,” Patrick Connor, Washington state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, told The Center Square.\n\nJoey Thompson, public relations manager at Visit Seattle, had a similar take.\n\n“We won’t be able to provide any comment just yet, but we may be able to put together an estimated economic impact for hotels after the fact, when more data is available to us,” he said. “We’ll make sure to circle back!”\n\nDowntown Seattle Association President and CEO Jon Scholes said it will be a little while before any specific economic impact can be quantified.\n\n“The platform we use to measure economic impact of events has a lag time of 10-14 days, so we won’t have the NFC championship metrics for a while,” he explained.\n\nHe did point to a Tuesday morning Puget Sound Business Journal piece that includes a link to a 2025 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report with estimates of spending in the markets of last year’s Super Bowl participants, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n“For the hometowns of each team, the Chamber estimates the Kansas City metro area could see $123.3 million in spending on the big game, while the Philadelphia metro could see $346.8 million,” the report states.\n\nSeattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Joe Nguyen also referenced last year's Chamber of Commerce report and Tuesday's Puget Sound Business Journal story in touting the Seahawks' success translating into economic success for Seattle.\n\n\"Yes, this is true - a Seahawks Super Bowl appearance will likely deliver a real economic boost for Seattle! The U.S. Chamber of Commerce report from 2025 shows the Super Bowl drove hundreds of millions to more than $1 billion in spending nationwide, with increased demand for food, apparel, hospitality, and entertainment reaching cities like Seattle even when they aren’t hosting (Seattle's estimated benefit in 2025 was $224,636,077),\" he said in a statement to The Center Square.\n\n\"The Puget Sound Business Journal reports that Seattle retailers and restaurants are already seeing higher sales tied to the Seahawks playoff run, especially in merchandise and game-day traffic. Super Bowl Sunday will likely up that spending across Seattle’s retail and hospitality sectors, including in the next 12 days leading up to the game.”\n\nWhile Seattle is experiencing an economic surge during playoff games, this is most likely a temporary effect that won’t fundamentally transform the city's overall economy.\n\nWhile civic boosters and the National Football League often project high economic impact figures, research suggests the true benefit is often a fraction of those, according to researchers from North Caroline State University.\n\nThe university’s report, released earlier this month, argues that the Super Bowl's economic impact on host cities is often exaggerated, with benefits frequently falling short of promises while the NFL captures the majority of revenue. While the event drives immense commercial value, local, long-term economic gains are limited, while public costs for infrastructure and security are high.\n\nWhile the economic impact of the NFL playoffs in Seattle is often substantial, the fungibility of money suggests the total impact might be lower than advertised. Much of this spending is often diverted from other local entertainment rather than entirely new, outside money entering the economy.\n\nA Super Bowl run is about much more than money, Scholes acknowledged.\n\n“A Seahawks march to the Super Bowl just months after the Mariners made a postseason run helps generate a continued sense of optimism and community,” he said. “The civic pride extends beyond the playing field and has the potential to drive, on some level, a positive reputational jolt.”",

    "description": "A new report shows that despite popular belief that an AI crash will tank the economy, regular consumers are much more crucial for GDP growth.",
    "fullText": "Worried about the AI bubble? A new report suggests AI was not the main leg propping up the economy in 2025.\n\nMacro Research Board Partners, an economic research platform, published a report in January that contradicted the popular belief that AI is the main driver of GDP and that the \"narrowly concentrated\" and \"extremely vulnerable\" growth would tank the entire economy once it falters.\n\n\"In short, without an AI boom, there would have certainly been less GDP growth last year, but there would also be fewer imports, so that overall real growth would still have been decent,\" wrote economic strategist Prajakta Bhide, who authored the report.\n\nBhide told Business Insider that personal consumption, meaning the spending of everyday people, was still the main pillar of GDP growth in 2025, and that despite the amount of investment in AI infrastructure, a lot of high-tech equipment is imported, and imports do not contribute to GDP.\n\nThe main categories that count toward GDP are personal consumption, private domestic investment, government spending, and net exports.\n\n\"Consumers continue to be the backbone of the economy,\" Bhide told Business Insider. \"Aggregate income growth is lower than it used to be, and so is job growth, which affected consumer sentiments. But there is a divide between what consumers say they feel and what they say that they're going to do versus what they actually go and do.\"\n\nAI growth was an important secondary driver of GDP growth, the report found, but that is mostly from software investment, while the contribution of data centers is \"negligible.\"\n\n\"Although a negative shock to the optimism around AI implies a risk to GDP growth,\" Bhide wrote in the report, \"the more realistic (and smaller) estimate of AI's growth impact after adjusting for imports dispels the popular notion that the US economy would falter without it.\"\n\nBeyond the GDP, concerns about the AI bubble are also tied to the stock market and people's retirement funds. America's eight most valuable public companies, including Nvidia, Alphabet, and Apple, are all betting heavily on AI and are worth $22 trillion altogether.\n\nBusiness Insider has previously reported that historically, a pullback in consumer spending has rarely been the trigger for an economic downturn. Instead, spending typically weakens only after job losses mount and when a recession is already well underway.",

It was a nice change to be in boarding zone 3 because I was able to get on the plane right after the first-class passengers.\n\nDelta Comfort seats on the Boeing 737-800 are the same size as basic economy seats. I thought the seats were slightly more comfortable than the standard economy Delta seats I've booked in the past, and I appreciated having two more inches of legroom with a 34-inch seat pitch.\n\nMy seatback entertainment system had a wide variety of movies and TV shows, as well as access to YouTube Music and live TV.\n\nSince my flight was relatively short, I appreciated the search filter for movies under two hours. I stretched out in my open row of seats and watched \"17 Again\" as the sun went down.\n\nSince I was seated toward the front of the plane, I waited less than five minutes to exit after we landed. This final perk was my favorite and sealed the deal for me — Delta Comfort was totally worth the added price.\n\nI'll certainly book the upgraded economy class for future flights.\n\nCorrection: January 27, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated the added cost of the upgrade.

    "fullText": "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-born TikTok star with the largest following on the platform, has struck a landmark commercial deal valued at approximately $900 million, marking one of the most significant monetisation moves ever by a global digital creator.\n\nThe transaction involves the partial sale of his company, Step Distinctive Limited, to Rich Sparkle Holdings, a United States-listed firm that disclosed the acquisition alongside a broader strategic partnership focused on scaling Lame’s commercial operations worldwide.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rich Sparkle, through its operating partners, will hold exclusive rights to Khaby Lame’s global commercial activities for an initial period of 36 months.\n\nThese rights cover brand partnerships, endorsements, licensing, and e-commerce ventures, signalling a shift from traditional influencer marketing to a platform-driven business model.\n\nRich Sparkle estimates that the integrated structure combining traffic, fulfilment, operations, and proprietary technology could eventually generate more than $4 billion in annual sales once fully implemented.\n\nAs part of the deal, Khaby Lame will become a controlling shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings, positioning him not just as a creative partner but as an equity stakeholder in the commercial infrastructure built around his brand.\n\n“This is not just an equity acquisition, but a revolution in the global content e-commerce model,” the company said, adding that the combination of a US-listed platform, globally recognised content IP, and supply chain expertise could unlock unprecedented shareholder value.\n\nThe rollout of the commercial strategy will initially focus on the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with execution planned over the next three years. Rich Sparkle will work with Anhui Xiaoheiyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based content commerce operator with experience in large-scale creator-led e-commerce.\n\nKhaby Lame rose to global prominence through silent, minimalist videos that humorously dismantle overly complicated life hacks. His wordless format has allowed him to transcend language barriers and build a vast, culturally diverse audience at remarkable speed.\n\nHe currently commands an estimated 360 million followers across social media platforms, making him one of the most influential digital figures in the world and a rare example of truly global creator reach.\n\nBeyond conventional commerce, the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\nRich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\nThe broader strategy also includes premium brand collaborations and co-branded intellectual property in sectors such as beauty, fragrance, and apparel, highlighting how creator influence is increasingly being transformed into long-term industrial-scale businesses.",

    "description": "Parents think passing down their homes for their children to inherit is the ultimate reward. In this economy, it might not be.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katarina Polonska, a relationship scientist and coach who will be inheriting her childhood home in Slovakia. Vancouver-based Polonska, 36, said the home needs a lot of work, and it may not be worth managing renovations from abroad. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm going to be inheriting my childhood home where I was born. I love it, and it's very precious to me. But I don't have any right to it yet.\n\nIt's mostly used as a family holiday home, but ultimately when my mother passes, it's going to be given to me.\n\nMy mother owns it, and there's no plan to sell it — the value of the home isn't very high, in fairness. It's a two-bedroom, one-bathroom. It's not worth much at all; maybe $80,000 CAD. I don't think the money would go very far in Canada.\n\nAlso, selling it would require a lot of renovations. It's very old school and needs a lot of TLC, and my mother doesn't live in Slovakia, she lives in England. So from her perspective, she's thinking, \"Why would I invest 30,000 or 50,000 euros (about $35,245 or $58,742) in a property that I go to a few times a year max? What's the point?\"\n\nShe also knows it would to be really complicated to sell it from abroad, having to navigate viewings and trusting realtors and all of this stuff.\n\nThe reality is, I'm going to own this foreign property when she passes.\n\nMy husband is also waiting to inherit. His mother inherited a property in Barbados from her parents, though she never lived in Barbados.\n\nHis mother had to wait to take over the Barbados property, and by the time she took it over, it had declined a little bit and there are always complications with it.\n\nI've actually never seen it myself, but I know that there's a lot of work to be done with the house. But his mother has been holding onto it saying, \"You can inherit it and you and Kat can enjoy it.\"\n\nBut he's like, \"We don't go to Barbados enough.\" It's just more hassle having to manage and protect a property when you're not physically in the country.\n\nI think from my perspective, because I'm naive about it, I'm like, keep it, it'd be really nice to have it. But his argument is that the place isn't in the area of Barbados that I would necessarily want to go to.\n\nHe's really wary. He doesn't want to be managing the property and he would rather sell it and then distribute the money within his family.\n\nSo we both know that there's going to be this new responsibility on our heads and, candidly, I think life is difficult enough as it is.\n\nI'm not going to rent the Slovakia home out because it's from, like, the 1980s. It's not been renovated. It's ancient; the wallpaper's faded.\n\nWhile Slovakia is kind of an up-and-coming country from a tourism perspective, I don't think anyone would want to stay in this place as an Airbnb unless it was literally advertised as a historical relic: \"Come stay in this ancient old-school apartment!\"\n\nMy husband and I have talked about how we're probably going to have to renovate it. We know that at some point, we're probably going to have to take a couple of months to be there physically to renovate it. But when is that going to happen? We both work, and getting to Slovakia is like a 20-hour journey from here.\n\nI think, more realistically, we could just keep the place and treat it as a little getaway to escape to. There is really lovely nature nearby and I don't have any other properties, so there is merit psychologically to knowing that there is a place that's home, even if it is halfway across the world.\n\nWhen it comes to inheriting property, I think there needs to be more dialogue between the parent and the child of, \"What do you actually want to do?\"\n\nI think a lot of parents have this assumption that leaving a kid the property is the ultimate goal; we've made it, we've paid off the mortgage, we have this home, and now the kid gets it. Those days are kind of gone.\n\nWe don't live in a world where everyone grows up and lives in the same town or city as their parents. We live in a really global economy. People are moving, people are more transient, and the world has become smaller. It's also become a lot more expensive, and home ownership isn't what it used to be.\n\nParents need to recognize that the world we're in is very different, and Millennials are not an anxious generation for no reason. We have a lot of stresses. It makes more sense to have a dialogue with your kid around what they want.\n\nI wish parents would ask, \"What do you want? Where are you at with your life, and what kind of inheritance makes sense?\"\n\nIs it, in fact, a lump sum of cash, because maybe you're a busy entrepreneur and you don't have time to sell? Maybe you actually would prefer the parent to sell, which is annoying for the parents, but maybe the kid would prefer that.\n\nThank you for the inheritance — that's very generous. But I think quite a lot of kids would probably say it's not worth it. Either enjoy the money, mom and dad, or cash out, downsize, and just give us a down payment or something.",

    "description": "Hisham Alrayes, CEO of GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models to spread AI's gains across its economy.",
    "fullText": "Open source — that might be the clearest signal of how China wants artificial intelligence to reshape its economy.\n\nHisham Alrayes, the group CEO of Bahrain-based GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models and broad deployment to spread AI's gains across the economy, instead of funneling them to a few tech giants.\n\nSpeaking at a Davos panel on China's \"AI+ Economy\" strategy on Wednesday, Alrayes said the country's approach reflects a fundamentally different economic philosophy.\n\n\"You look at the open structure of the China AI philosophy — then you have the non-open structure,\" Alrayes said. \"That signals that the benefit they want to see is to trickle down into the economy, into the companies.\"\n\nChina's most prominent AI breakout, DeepSeek, reflects that philosophy.\n\nIt mostly uses open-source models that have drawn global attention, in contrast to many large US language models that remain closed and proprietary, reaping the benefits of tightly controlled commercial ecosystems.\n\nMeta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, has said that a key reason behind DeepSeek's success is its open-source model, which, he said, can outperform proprietary models in terms of efficiency and innovation by building on shared research.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said that China's open-source AI models could gain an edge globally because they're free, making them more attractive than costly proprietary US systems for governments and countries that can't afford closed models.\n\nSimilarly, Alrayes said, China — in pursuing the open model — is aiming for affordability and scale.\n\n\"It's not the benefit of that company, of that product, the return of that individual. It's not an individual — it's an economy,\" Alrayes said.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in China's national \"AI Plus\" action plan, which prioritizes diffusion, said fellow panelist Gong Ke, executive director of the Chinese Institute for New Generation AI Development Strategies at Nankai University.\n\nThe policy, he said, focuses on embedding AI across manufacturing, healthcare, finance, education, and other sectors, rather than on breakthroughs such as artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe added that the plan sets explicit adoption targets, with AI agents and intelligent terminals expected to reach 70% penetration by 2027 and 90% by 2030.\n\nAlrayes said China's open-source tilt ultimately reflects a broader goal: making AI an economic utility rather than a profit center for a small group of companies.\n\n\"China is looking to create value throughout the economy, very clear, with very specific objectives across the economy,\" he said. \"Not just as a benefit to those companies. This is the difference in the philosophy.\"",

    "description": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump's efforts to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. The case has broad implications for the economy.",
    "fullText": "Eight of the nine Supreme Court justices expressed wariness with what Justice Samuel Alito described as a \"hurried\" attempt from the Trump administration to oust Lisa Cook from her position as a Federal Reserve board governor — and then to rush her case to the high court when lower courts allowed her to keep her post.\n\nSeveral members of the Republican-appointed majority also expressed sharp disagreement with the Trump administration's claim that judges lack the authority to review a president's power to fire members from the Federal Reserve board.\n\n\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, told Solicitor General John Sauer.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could have broad ramifications for Federal Reserve independence, a cornerstone of American monetary policy and the status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nThe hearing comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into his handling of the Fed's office renovations. Powell has said the investigation is a \"pretext\" for an attempt to pressure the central bank for political reasons.\n\nPowell attended Wednesday's oral arguments, along with Cook and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve's board of governors can only be removed for \"cause.\" Trump attempted to fire Cook in August, alleging she had lied on mortgage paperwork and therefore could not be trusted with her role in the Fed, which sets interest rates that influence mortgage lending rates.\n\nCook — an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose Federal Reserve board term ends in 2038 — argued that Trump's real intent was to replace her with an appointee who would more quickly drive down interest rates. Trump did not give Cook an opportunity to explain the apparent discrepancies in her mortgage paperwork before he posted the letter firing her on his Truth Social account.\n\nWednesday's oral argument didn't concern the merits of Trump's allegations about Cook's mortgage paperwork, but whether the judicial branch had the power to ensure Cook could keep her job while additional litigation plays out.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts — in a sentiment echoed by every other member of the Supreme Court except for Justice Clarence Thomas — expressed skepticism at the idea that the judicial branch couldn't have a role in checking the legitimacy of a \"for cause\" firing.\n\n\"If there is any level of cause — and you indicate that there is some level of cause, right? — well, then you can't be right about the idea that a court can't order anybody who's been removed to be reinstated,\" Roberts told Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh, while pressing Sauer, suggested that the Trump administration's position effectively erased the distinction between \"for cause\" and \"at-will\" firing — a notion that all of the Democratic appointees on the court also appeared to agree with.\n\nThe Trump administration's position may open the door for a Democratic president to fire all of Trump's Federal Reserve board appointees using \"trivial or inconsequential or old allegations,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"It incentivizes kind of the 'search-and-destroy and find something, and just put that on a piece of paper — no judicial review, no process, nothing, you're done,'\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nAlito asked about why Cook had to be fired and the lawsuit against her handled in a \"cursory manner.\" He asked Sauer whether Cook's mortgage application had even been entered into evidence in the case.\n\nSauer said he wasn't sure if the paperwork itself had been seen by the district court judge who allowed Cook to keep her job, but that screenshots of the text of her mortgage application were included in social media posts.\n\n\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody — by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit — in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked. \"You began by laying out what you claim to be the factual basis for the for cause removal, but no court has ever explored those facts.\"\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, expressed anxiety about whether removing Cook could risk a recession, as economists have warned.\n\nShe wondered whether a dispute over mortgage paperwork was severe enough grounds to fire Cook, and why Trump didn't make an effort to give her the opportunity to respond to his allegations.\n\n\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt room where the president provides Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, gives her a chance to defend herself,\" Barrett said. \"I mean, that just wouldn't be that big a deal.\"\n\nAfter Sauer finished addressing the justices' questions, Cook's lawyer Paul Clement took the podium. He said Sauer's approach effectively erased the \"for cause\" standard required for firing members of the Fed.\n\n\"If there's no judicial review, then this is all kind of a joke,\" Clement said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Renter said it could affect consumer spending if it doesn't reverse course.\n\n\"How we feel about our income plays a big role in how we spend, and I think the longer this uncertainty and the longer this labor market chill sort of sits over us, the more that a greater number of households are going to start tightening their purse strings,\" Renter said.\n\nGregory Daco, the chief economist at EY, said the economy is showing resilience despite a jobless expansion.\n\n\"That's been really the key defining factor of the US economy in the face of a number of cross-currents, from significant shifts in trade policy and tariffs to industrial policy, to significant shifts in immigration dynamics, to now an AI-led technological revolution,\" he said.\n\nReal GDP grew in the second and third quarters of 2025 after falling in the first, as businesses prepared for new tariffs.\n\nWhile economic growth has been strong, Daco thinks a jobless boom will continue because an aging population and a drop in net migration are affecting the supply of workers at the same time as less demand for new workers.\n\n\"Businesses are very cautious as to who they hire and at what rate they hire because they don't necessarily need as much talent as they did a year or two years ago,\" Daco said.\n\nOne of the Trump administration's goals was to increase efficiency within the federal government. That led to several actions to shrink the workforce, including reduction-in-force and buyouts led by the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data showed a massive drop in federal employment in October because people who had taken deferred resignations officially came off the government payrolls.\n\nCameron Hilaker, an AFGE Local 1534 member, was an emergency manager for US Agency for International Development before being laid off last spring. He is still looking for work and has become a stay-at-home dad. Without his government paycheck, Hilaker and his wife can't comfortably afford childcare for their new baby.\n\n\"We were fully unprepared for this,\" Hilaker said. \"All of a sudden, I am at home with my son because we're not paying daycare. We can't afford another $2,500 a month expense. Budgets are tight.\"\n\nThe manufacturing sector continued its trend of job losses or weak job growth that had been underway before Trump took office.\n\n\"Part of the justification for tariffs was bringing manufacturing back to the US,\" Renter said, adding it would be costly and could take years to do that, \"if even possible.\"\n\nShe added that tariffs have likely had a negative effect on the sector, with manufacturing firms that rely on imports taking a hit.\n\n\"The Fed's industrial production measure is now at its highest level since 2019, clearly reversing its Biden era decline,\" Desai said. \"Meanwhile, core capital goods shipments have hit an all-time high under President Trump, signaling strong investment into future manufacturing production and jobs.\"\n\nA blog post from the St. Louis Fed showed that the effective import tariff rate and tariff revenue as a share of gross domestic product have spiked.\n\n\"Both rates jumped noticeably in 2018 during the first trade war, more or less doubling by 2022,\" the blog post said.\n\nThere has been a lot of back-and-forth on tariffs. The administration has announced tariffs on different goods, including some wines, cars, and furniture. Some tariffs are no longer in effect or pushed back — tariffs on coffee, spices, beef, and more were stopped in November. The Supreme Court is also expected to rule on the legality of many of the tariffs soon.\n\nThe inflation rate has cooled down a lot since it surged to about 9% in 2022, but it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. In 2025, it slowed in the first few months before speeding up and then holding steady in December.\n\nDraho said the inflation rate climbed higher than expected, with tariffs having a small effect.\n\n\"I knew retailers and producers would be reluctant to pass along cost increases to consumers. I didn't imagine that they would be able to hold the line for quite so long,\" Renter said.\n\nRenter believes tariffs will continue to affect inflation because they are affecting a variety of items, so their effect is trickling in instead of causing a one-time increase in prices. \"It's tough, really, to know how much of the spikes in price growth can be attributed to tariffs and how much might be attributed to other issues like supply chain issues, demand-driven issues, which makes monetary policy a little more difficult,\" she said.\n\nDespite economic uncertainty, spending has been strong. However, like much else in the economy, consumer spending has taken on a \"K-shape,\" where wealthier people are spending big while lower-income Americans are cutting back. Draho said this is likely more of a structural pattern that existed before Trump's term.\n\n\"Much of the robust spending that we've seen over the past year has been driven primarily by people with assets and people with high incomes,\" Renter said. \"If you're invested in the stock market, you're probably doing pretty well right now. If you own your home, and especially if you have owned your home for more than a handful of years, you're probably feeling pretty secure right now. And I think the bulk of the spending has been coming from these groups of people.\"",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood is making another bold call on the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nIn a 2026 outlook letter published on Jan. 15, the ARK Invest founder and CEO says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying U.S. economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" she said.\n\nWood said post-Covid high interest rates squeezed the economy, hitting housing, manufacturing, and non-AI investment. But she is optimistic that easing rates and rising productivity could release growth potential.\n\nWood wrote in a post on X (the former Twitter) that the next three years could look like “Reaganomics on steroids,” which she believes could lead to “another golden age” for the U.S. stock market.\n\n\"Early in my career, I remember how deregulation, tax cuts, sound monetary policy, and peace through strength sent the dollar soaring, which put a lid on the gold price,\" she explained.\n\nIn the Reagan era, a mix of those forces helped the market enter a long bull that ran through much of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"The Trump Administration’s policies are echoing the early days of Reaganomics in the 1980s, when the dollar nearly doubled,\" Wood said.\n\nWood focuses on emerging high-tech companies in areas including artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics.\n\nShe gained a reputation after the Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. In 2025, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP): 5.29%\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD): 4.06%\n\nBeam Therapeutics (BEAM): 3.79%\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR): 3.57%\n\nWood’s style brings sweet wins in rising markets but also painful losses in bearish ones, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term results. As of Jan. 16, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -10.31%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 14.66% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds. And Silicon Valley is increasingly willing to pay for it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The CEO of a digital economy think tank said relying on identical AI tools can erode competitive edge and weaken firms' independence.",
    "fullText": "As companies rush to adopt AI to boost productivity and cut costs, they may be setting themselves up for a new problem: losing what makes them different.\n\nMehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, said widespread reliance on the same AI tools risks flattening competitive advantage across industries, because firms increasingly rely on identical systems to think, write, and decide for them.\n\nParyavi said that as AI tools become cheaper, more powerful, and more widely deployed, companies risk outsourcing the very thinking that once differentiated them.\n\nWhile AI can boost efficiency in the short term, he said, relying on shared models and standardized systems could leave businesses competing on cost and speed alone — eroding originality, strategic depth, and long-term advantage.\n\n\"If you and your competitor are all using the same service, you have no edge over each other,\" Paryavi told Business Insider.\n\n\"Their AI and your AI against each other — I don't know who's going to win.\"\n\nAs generative AI becomes embedded across workplaces, Paryavi warned that the biggest risk isn't automation — it's uniformity.\n\nWhen companies rely on the same large language models trained on the same data, decision-making, writing, and problem-solving can start to converge, shrinking the space for creative divergence.\n\nThat concern echoes warnings from researchers and academics who say AI can produce polished output at scale, but also flips human thinking by delivering fluent answers before understanding, creating an illusion of expertise that weakens judgment and depth.\n\nWhen everyone relies on the same models trained on the same data, Paryavi said, creative divergence shrinks.\n\n\"The beauty of our world is that we have different choices because we think differently,\" he said. \"That's where innovation comes from.\"\n\nIt's not just a question of companies all thinking the same — Paryavi warned that treating AI as a shortcut to efficiency can quietly hollow out human judgment, expertise, and control, leaving businesses faster in the short term but more fragile over time.\n\nOver time, Paryavi said, that shift can erode internal expertise and decision-making capacity.\n\n\"What they don't think about is that initially it might sound more efficient and more productive and cheaper,\" he said. \"But this is going to be very expensive down the line.\"\n\nOne risk, Paryavi said, is dependency. As firms replace employees with AI subscriptions, they become increasingly reliant on external vendors to function effectively.\n\nParyavi compared the AI boom to the early 2000s rush to cloud computing, when many companies initially adopted third-party infrastructure but later repatriated workloads in-house as costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in became concerns — a trend commonly referred to in tech as cloud repatriation.\n\nThe same dynamic could play out with AI, Paryavi said — except with even higher stakes. As companies downsize human teams, they also lose institutional knowledge and the ability to operate without automation, he said.\n\n\"You've killed all your chances of ever becoming independent as an organization,\" he said. \"You've fired your manpower. You've made them no good.\"\n\nAI, he said, is not inherently harmful. In fields such as medicine, scientific research, and disaster prediction, it can significantly accelerate progress.\n\nBut without clear guardrails, companies risk trading long-term resilience for short-term speed.\n\n\"It's a very powerful tool,\" Paryavi said, comparing AI to an atomic bomb. \"If that [an atomic bomb] can eliminate an entire population physically, this [AI] can eliminate humanity cognitively.\"",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic.\n\nHarsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran’s ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country’s theocracy.\n\nThere have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the death toll, at 2,797. The number continues to rise.\n\nIran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.”\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran.\n\nKhatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump’s soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.”\n\n“They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. “Americans and Zionists should not expect peace.”\n\nHis fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nPeskov said “the situation in the region is quite tense, and the president is continuing his efforts to help de-escalate it.”\n\nRussia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month.\n\nExiled Iranian royal calls for fight to continue\n\nDays after Trump pledged “help is on its way” for the protesters, both the demonstrations and the prospect of imminent U.S. retaliation appeared to have receded. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had raised concerns with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nYet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance.\n\n“I believe the president is a man of his word,\" Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that \"regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“\n\nDespite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall.\n\nIran and the U.S. traded angry accusations Thursday at a session of the United Nations Security Council, with U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz saying that Trump “has made it clear that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter.”\n\nGholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., blasted the U.S. for what he said was American “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”\n\nIran authorities list protest damage\n\nKhatami, the hard-line cleric, also provided the first overall statistics on damage from the protests, claiming 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other holy places had sustained damage. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government.\n\nHe said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulance, 71 fire department vehicles and another 50 emergency vehicles also sustained damage.\n\nEven as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAmid the continuing internet shutdown, some Iranians crossed borders to communicate with the outside world. At a border crossing in Turkey’s eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout.\n\n“I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns.\n\nAlso crossing the border were some Turkish citizens escaping the unrest in Iran.\n\nMehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey.\n\nAlthough he did not venture into the streets, Önder said he heard heavy gunfire.\n\n“I understand guns, because I served in the military in the southeast of Turkey,” he said. “The guns they were firing were not simple weapons. They were machine-guns.”\n\nIn a sign of the conflict’s potential to spill over borders, a Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s crackdown on protests.\n\nA representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran.\n\nThe death toll of at least 2,797, provided by the Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.\n\nThe agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. Iran's government has not provided casualty figures.\n\nAmiri reported from New York.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s second term has been eventful. You wouldn’t know it from his approval numbers.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from January found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s performance as president. That’s virtually unchanged from March 2025, shortly after he took office for the second time.\n\nThe new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research does show subtle signs of vulnerability for the Republican president. Trump hasn’t convinced Americans that the economy is in good shape, and many question whether he has the right priorities when he’s increasingly focused on foreign intervention. His approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has also slipped since he took office.\n\nHere’s how Americans’ views of Trump have — and haven’t — changed over the past year, according to AP-NORC polling.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 Americans consistently approved of Trump's performance\n\nCall it a gift or a curse — for all his unpredictability, Trump's approval numbers just don't change very much.\n\nThis was largely the case during his first term in office, too. Early in his first term, 42% of Americans approved of how he was handling the presidency. There were some ups and downs over the ensuing years, but he left office with almost the same approval.\n\nThat level of consistency on presidential approval numbers could be the new normal for U.S. politics — or it could be unique to Trump. Gallup polling since the 1950s shows that presidential approval ratings have grown less variable over time. But President Joe Biden had a slightly different experience. Biden, a Democrat, entered the White House with higher approval numbers than Trump has ever received, but those fell rapidly during his first two years in office, then stayed low for the remainder of his term.\n\nMost Americans have held a critical view of Trump throughout his time in office, and Americans are twice as likely to say he's focused on the wrong priorities than the right ones. About half of U.S. adults say he’s mostly focusing on the wrong priorities one year into his second term, and approximately 2 in 10 say he’s mostly focused on the right priorities. Another 2 in 10, roughly, say it’s been about an even mix, and 14% say they don't have an opinion.\n\nThe economy has haunted Trump in his first year back in the White House, despite his insistence that “the Trump economic boom has officially begun.”\n\nJust 37% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling the economy. That’s up slightly from 31% in December — which marked a low point for Trump — but Trump started out with low approval on this issue, which doesn’t give him a lot of room for error.\n\nThe economy is a new problem for Trump. His approval rating on this issue in his first term fluctuated, but it was typically higher. Close to half of Americans approved of Trump’s economic approach for much of his first White House stint, and he’s struggled to adjust to this as a weak point. Americans care a lot more about costs than they did in Trump’s first term, and, like Biden, he’s persistently asserted that the U.S. economy is not a problem while the vast majority describe it as “poor.”\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults say Trump has done more to hurt the cost of living in his second term, while only about 2 in 10 say he’s done more to help. About one-quarter say he hasn't made an impact.\n\nViews of Trump’s handling of immigration have declined\n\nWhen Trump entered office, immigration was among his strongest issues. It’s since faded, a troubling sign for Trump, who campaigned on both economic prosperity and crackdowns to illegal immigration.\n\nJust 38% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, down from 49% in March. The poll was conducted Jan. 8-11, shortly after the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.\n\nBut there are signs that Americans still give Trump some leeway on immigration issues. About half of U.S. adults say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, which is unchanged since April, despite an immigration crackdown that spread to cities across the U.S. in the second half of the year.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, say Trump has helped immigration and border security “a lot” or “a little” in his second term. This is an area where Democrats are more willing to give Trump some credit. About 2 in 10 Democrats say Trump has helped on this issue, higher than the share of Democrats who say he's helped on costs or job creation.\n\nAs Trump turns to foreign policy, most Americans disapprove of his approach\n\nTrump has focused his attention more on foreign policy in his second term, and polling shows most Americans disapprove of his approach.\n\nBut much like Trump's overall approval, views of his handling of foreign policy have changed little in his second term, despite wide-ranging actions including his push to control Greenland and the recent military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of foreign policy, and most Americans, 56%, say Trump has “gone too far” in using the U.S. military to intervene in other countries.\n\nTrump’s continued focus on global issues could be a liability given its sharp contrast with the “America First” platform he ran on and Americans’ growing concern with costs at home. But it could also be hard to shift views on the issue — even if Trump takes more dramatic action in the coming months.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,203 adults was conducted Jan. 8-11 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

    "fullText": "Russia could be staring down a painful financial reckoning in Venezuela after the US military operation on January 3 threw into doubt years of strategic investment and cooperation between Moscow and Caracas, according to a think tank analyst.\n\n\"Russian investments in Venezuela's oil industry over the last twenty years will now have to be, formally or informally, written off,\" wrote Stephen Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a post on Wednesday.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, added Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union at the State Department.\n\n\"The overall market appeal of such arms has clearly been diminished,\" following the US's military operation, he wrote.\n\nSome $2 billion to $3 billion in annual trade between Russia and Venezuela could also \"cease altogether,\" he added.\n\nThose concrete economic losses contrast with more intangible political upsides for Moscow in a shifting global order, he added.\n\n\"The Trump administration's emphasis on preserving a US sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere could also seem to validate Russia's claims for a similar sphere in its own neighborhood,\" Sestanovich wrote.\n\nThe developments come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy, as its war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year next month.\n\nSweeping Western sanctions and depressed oil prices are squeezing Russia's revenues, putting pressure on the funds Moscow uses to sustain the war effort and support the broader economy.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented publicly on the US's operation in Venezuela. The Russian foreign ​ministry has called for deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's release and for dialogue between the US and Venezuela.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian state-owned oil company Roszarubezhneft sought to draw a line around its oil holdings in Venezuela. The company said earlier this week that all its assets in the South American country are \"owned by the Russian state.\"",

    "description": "Citi's CFO Mark Mason said Trump's proposed credit card cap would have a 'deleterious' impact on the economy.",
    "fullText": "Citi's top executives warned that President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates could have dire consequences.\n\n\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly,\" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a call with reporters ahead of the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"At the end of the day, I think an interest rate cap would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most, and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy.\"\n\nMason said multiple times that he did not want to speculate on the impact of the potential cap, given the limited available information. He said that Citi would work with the Trump administration to address the \"important issue\" of affordability.\n\nReporters asked Mason about the cap multiple times, and he repeatedly said it would likely not help customers most in need, as is Trump's stated intention. He said later in the call that, again, it would have a \"very negative impact on the economy.\"\n\nOn the bank's earnings call, CEO Jane Fraser said that \"a rate cap is not something that we can support\" when asked about the news that Bilt Rewards is releasing three cards with interest rates capped at 10%, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\"To be clear, the impact to us and other banks would just be dwarfed by the severe impact on access to credit and on consumer spending across the country. These things just don't work out as intended,\" Fraser continued.\n\nMuch like Mason did on an earlier call, Fraser acknowledged the importance of affordability and said she's keen to collaborate with the administration.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump said he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates. He argued that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. A cap would have to be approved by Congress, and similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nOther bank leaders, including JPMorgan's CFO, Jeremy Barnum, have warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; however, others in the financial sector have applauded the plan.\n\nCiti's profits fell 13% in the fourth quarter, to $2.47 billion, brought down partly by the sale of its operations in Russia, the bank said in an earnings report.\n\nThe bank saw an 84% surge in financial advisory fees in the fourth quarter. The investment banking unit has been reenergized under its new head, JPMorgan veteran Viswas Raghavan. Investment banking revenues increased by 38%, the bank said, and investment banking fees rose 35%.\n\nCiti said that its \"Transformation\" — a years-long effort to modernize the bank and cut costs— is more than 80% complete, as stated in its earnings presentation. Fraser's attempted turnaround has included layoffs, new hires, and multibillion-dollar investments.",
