    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "description": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.",
    "fullText": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.\n\nSpeaking to Xi across a vast display of orchids in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, the Russian president claimed their ties were “at an unprecedentedly high level”.\n\nCertainly on the surface it appears China’s alliance with Russia has only grown stronger since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nNowhere has this been more evident than when looking at trade between the two countries, which has boomed ever since the West slapped Putin with massive sanctions.\n\nLast year, the value of trade between Russia and China hit a record $245bn (£182bn), fuelled by Xi becoming the world’s largest buyer of Putin’s oil and gas. Overall, China also became Russia’s biggest supplier of goods.\n\nHowever, closer ties with China have come at a cost.\n\nIn particular, Russian businesses have grown increasingly frustrated at a flood of cheap Chinese goods.\n\nVladimir Milov, who worked in the Russian government from 1997 to 2002 before becoming a vocal Putin critic, says the economic alliance is backfiring badly for Russia.\n\n“It is deeply disadvantageous,” he says. “China is taking advantage because it knows that Russia has nowhere to go.”\n\nSuch warnings could signal that the economic ties between the two countries are beginning to fray.\n\nWhile mutual trade hit a record high in 2024, it has fallen by nearly a tenth so far this year.\n\nOne key area of tension is cars.\n\nAfter Western manufacturers cut ties with Russia in 2022, Chinese competitors duly stepped in.\n\nIn the two years to 2024, Chinese car exports to Russia have increased sevenfold, prompting a growing number of complaints from domestic manufacturers.\n\nMaxim Sokolov, the chief executive of Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ, has accused the Chinese of “unprecedented dumping”, which he said in December has crossed “all imaginable boundaries”.\n\nSales of his company’s signature Lada car have plunged, pushing the company to slash production by nearly half and move to a four-day work week at the end of September.\n\nRussia’s largest truck manufacturer, Kamaz, also trimmed its working week in August after demand for its vehicles plunged by 60pc. At the time it blamed “excessive” imports.\n\nTo alleviate some of the criticism, the Kremlin has responded by significantly raising import fees on vehicles.\n\nSince October 2024, Russia has more than doubled the “recycling fee” that it charges on imported cars.\n\nThis charge, which is supposedly to cover the future disposal of the vehicle but functions largely as a tariff, was 667,000 roubles (£6,275) per vehicle as of January this year.\n\nThis led to Chinese car exports to Russia halving in the first six months of 2025.\n\nIn July, Russian regulators also banned truck imports from a fleet of major Chinese brands – Dongfeng, Foton, FAW and Sitrak – which they branded a “direct threat” to public safety.\n\n“These trade-related tensions will start to occur more and more as the market gets saturated with Chinese goods and uncompetitive Russian industries are not able to make their sales,” says John Kennedy, a research leader at Rand.\n\nThere are signs that Russia’s steel sector is also hurting.\n\nAndrey Gartung, chief executive of the Chelyabinsk Forging and Press Plant, warned last year: “Russian enterprises competing with Chinese ones are holding on by the skin of their teeth.”\n\nNot one to shy away, China has hit back with trade restrictions of its own.\n\nMost notably, Xi reintroduced tariffs on Russian coal in January 2024, two years after the restrictions were first lifted.\n\nThis has already hit exports to China, with Milov claiming that the levies are adding to what is the worst crisis for Russia’s coal industry since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe sector’s revenues are expected to plummet by 12pc this year alone.\n\nElsewhere, China has so far refused to lift a longstanding ban on imports of Russia’s largest agricultural exports – winter wheat and barley. Instead, it buys from Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\n\nWhat China does import from Russia, it gets incredibly cheaply because it has a monopoly as one of Russia’s only buyers, says Milov.\n\nRussia’s biggest exports to China are oil and gas, which combined make up two thirds of its trade.\n\nIgor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive, said that between January 2022 and June 2024, China’s savings from purchasing Russian oil compared to Middle Eastern exports amounted to as much as $18bn.\n\n“Taking the sanctions away, Russia is what Beijing would want every trading partner to look like,” says Gregor Sebastian, of Rhodium’s China Corporate Advisory team.\n\n“China is importing raw materials that it produces into manufactured goods that it can then resell at much higher profit margins back to Russia. That is the main bulk of the relationship.”\n\nHowever, more than anything, Russia wants new technology and investment from China. And it is not getting it.\n\nThe average annual flow of Chinese investment into Russia has plummeted from an average of $1.2bn from 2011 to $400m, says Milov.\n\nIn 2022, China dropped Russia from its Belt and Road financing programme, while in July, China’s commerce ministry “strongly advised” carmakers against investing in Russia.\n\nMany major projects that were previously announced with Chinese backing have now been scrapped or are on hold.\n\nRussia quietly disappeared from what was supposed to be a joint development of a long-haul aircraft with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.\n\nWork had already begun on the project, initially called the CR929, which stood for “China Russia”. However, the R has now been dropped, with the aircraft renamed as the C929.\n\nPlans for Chinese CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles to build a high-speed rail line between Moscow and Kazan in south-west Russia have also been paused.\n\nSeparately, there has been no progress on the development of the Tianjin oil refinery, a joint venture between Rosneft and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which was approved in 2014.\n\nAfter the meeting between Putin and Xi in September, Gazprom announced that the two countries had signed a deal to build a “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline to China.\n\nBut while this would no doubt prove to be a huge victory for Russia, China has yet to confirm the project.\n\nThis may be a sign that, for all the pomp and ceremony, the countries’ authoritarian alliance may be weaker than it appears.\n\n“Despite all these hugs and kisses at summits, China and Russia are very much far apart,” says Milov.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "description": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.\n\nHe ended up explaining how his wife organizes her lingerie drawer.\n\n“I think she steams them,” he offered at one point, hoping to underscore the violation Melania Trump felt when, in his telling, FBI agents rummaged through the pristine undergarments — “sometimes referred to as panties” — during their 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn the realm of Trump tangents, it wasn’t the wildest, or angriest, or most bizarre.\n\nYet as the president hopes to refocus the nation’s attention on his economic record ahead of next year’s critical midterm elections, it was another reminder that his own focus often remains somewhat adrift.\n\nTrump did periodically discuss the economy in his 90-minute speech, which he called a “quick little stop” in Rocky Mount on the way to Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. He trumpeted a report this week that showed inflation unexpectedly cooling. He recounted an announcement he made earlier in the day on lowering some drug prices. He framed an uptick in the unemployment rate as a success since he’d fired so many government workers.\n\nSupporters behind him held signs reading “Lower Prices” and “Bigger Paychecks.” But even the visual cues couldn’t keep the president from veering well off-piste — often to the delight of his crowd.\n\nAs he was explaining the negotiations that went into the drug pricing scheme, attendees listened politely, if quietly, as he assumed a French accent to mimic President Emmanuel Macron during their pharmaceutical negotiations.\n\nThe audience really came alive when he reminisced about his opponent from nearly a decade ago.\n\n“I don’t know, beating Hillary was fun,” he said to roars. “Remember, she was a nasty person. I was going to use a B word. I said, ‘my wife would not be happy.’”\n\nThere are plenty of Trump advisers who would prefer the president focus more on the here-and-now, or — even better — the what’s-to-come. As he loses his political edge on the economy, many of his allies worry he’s lost touch with voter concerns and anxieties that propelled him into office in the first place.\n\nFriday’s rally was the latest in a roadshow of sorts that White House advisers have planned for Trump to hone his message on bringing down prices. He also delivered a primetime address to the nation this week meant to drive the message.\n\nMuch of his argument rests on having inherited what he says was an economic disaster from Joe Biden, though inflation was at 3% when he took office and is now only slightly lower. (And economists cautioned that last month’s inflation dip had a lot to do with shutdown-related distortions of economic data.)\n\nYet as is so often the case, the intended content of Trump’s speech was a target that didn’t always find an arrow.\n\nAs he hit the hour mark, his grievance list grew, encompassing the news media and Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the onetime loyalist who has dramatically broken with him and whom Trump now calls “Marjorie Traitor Brown.”\n\nHis aside about Melania’s unmentionables came amid a diatribe over the investigations that plagued him during his time out of office. He mused about awarding himself a massive sum in connection with complaints he filed against the Justice Department.\n\n“I am suing and I’m the one that’s supposed to settle. So maybe I’ll give myself $1 billion and give it all to charity,” he said.\n\nTrump found ample distractions in the crowd, including a group of glamorous women from the western part of the state who volunteer at his events. When he spotted a hat he liked, he explained how he could gauge its value.\n\n“I want gold thread, not mustard color. You know?” he said. “When you have a mustard-colored thread, don’t accept it.”\n\nRecalling the times he came to purchase furniture in North Carolina as a hotelier, he explained the exacting nature of the task.\n\n“The arm of a chair was very important to me. I said, ‘I like that chair, but this arm has to be a different shape,’” he said. He kept going: “I’m a very aesthetic person, believe me, except with women, I don’t care what a woman looks like. I used to say beautiful. Now I don’t care.”\n\nHe spent several minutes discussing his physical health amid questions about his stamina after appearing to doze off during multiple on-camera events recently. He pointed to the string of cognitive tests he claims to have aced. And he pledged to alert the nation should he find himself in decline.\n\n“When that time comes, I will let you know about it. In fact, you’ll probably find out about it just by watching,” he said. “But that time is not now, because I feel the same that I felt for 50 years.”\n\nIt was, in the end, the same type of speech Trump has been delivering now for more than 10 years, the “weave” in which he takes great pride. It has less to do with a calculated political message than free-association of whatever’s on his mind — which is often the people or entities he thinks have done him wrong.\n\nIf some of his fixations cause heartburn among his allies, though, Trump has a different view.\n\n“I think I’m probably very neurotic,” he said in Rocky Mount. “I always say controlled neuroses is good. Being neurotic, no good. But if it’s controlled, that’s okay. It gives you some energy.”",

    "description": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.",
    "fullText": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.\n\nYesterday’s CPI report, showing inflation of 2.7 percent — well below the expected 3.1 percent — was bad political news for Democrats. Since “Liberation Day” in April, when President Trump rolled out tariffs aimed at resetting global trade in favor of U.S. companies, the left and their media allies have warned voters that the White House’s actions would clobber our economy and set inflation soaring.\n\nIt hasn’t happened. The tariffs have only modestly boosted prices. Instead, the Trump agenda of higher energy production, lower budget deficits and lighter regulation has brought inflation down. While inflation averaged 5 percent annually under former President Joe Biden, and in four years jumped by nearly 22 percent, as of November it is rising at 2.7 percent.\n\nWould you remind me again who created the “affordability crisis?”\n\nAs inflation continues to recede from the lofty 9 percent level recorded under Biden, voters may realize just how much damage was done by Joe’s budget-busting big government spending.\n\nAnother narrative that is under fire is that Trump-backed AI is a gift to billionaires but is going to destroy U.S. employment, much like the trade pacts of the 1990s that sent jobs overseas. But two new studies counter that claim. As it turns out, AI is actually creating jobs for Americans.\n\nIn its year-end note to investors, investment firm Vanguard writes that AI is not responsible for slowing job growth. They point to data showing that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nAccompanying graphs show hiring in AI-affected occupations growing at 1.7 percent during the two years mid-2023 to mid-2025, compared to only 1.0 percent pre-COVID, and compared to 0.8 percent for other kinds of jobs. Similarly, real wage growth for AI-involved hires is advancing at 3.8 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for other occupations.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest that “current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities.”",

    "description": "Bank of America was among the first to flag a \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy, defined by robust growth and above-target inflation.",
    "fullText": "The US economy will keep burning hot in 2026, extending a yearslong run of dodging a recession.\n\nThat's a view that is increasingly being woven into consensus forecasts on Wall Street, where top researchers have generally brushed off the risks of a near-term recession and are anticipating another year of stable economic growth and hot inflation.\n\nBank of America dubbed this the \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy back in September, and others have since adopted the phrase.\n\nIn its year-ahead economic outlook, BofA said it believes growth will remain strong and inflation will stay above target next year, pointing to tailwinds such as the Fed's rate cuts, AI investment, more supportive trade policy, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n\"Tariff cuts, tax cuts, rate cuts…'run-it-hot' US policy, implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail,'\" a team of analysts led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a separate client note this fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists also unveiled their \"run it hot\" investment thesis heading into 2026, pointing to the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and the central bank's recent announcement that it would begin reserve management purchases.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it also saw economic growth remaining robust in 2026, thanks to the Fed cutting rates in a non-recessionary macro environment.\n\n\"Despite stagnant job growth, we expect policy rate cuts to limit labour market weakness and help extend the economic cycle further,\" Goldman said, though it noted that valuations in the stock market are already \"hot.\"\n\nHere's how the forecasters think investors should position themselves in a \"run it hot\" market.\n\nCommodities are the top run-it-hot trade heading into next year, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note in December.\n\nOil and energy are also favorable investments under the run-it-hot regime, they added.\n\n\"Trump runs it hot, oil bounces post Russia-Ukraine fix, China keeps yuan cheap, soon all the commodity charts will look like gold,\" strategists wrote. \"We say long commodities the best 'run it hot' trade in '26, and long despised oil/energy without question the best 'run-it-hot' contrarian trade.\"\n\nCyclical assets — which, by definition, tend to do well when the economy is expanding — are likely to benefit from the macro picture next year, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank pointed to areas like housing and consumer-facing sides of the market, which include consumer discretionary and retail stocks.\n\n\"After a patch of worry in November, cyclical assets—including cyclical equities and copper—have been rallying again. But even after these recent moves, we think our more optimistic growth views are not fully reflected in markets,\" the bank wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks consumer discretionary goods investments fall into the \"run it hot\" investing playbook. The bank noted that firms generally have higher pricing power today, which should boost revenue growth.\n\nThat dynamic is already playing out in the discretionary goods sector, strategists said. The rate for top-line earnings beats in the sector for the third quarter clocked in at 6%, above the 2% rate for the overall S&P 500, per Morgan Stanley's analysis.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also look attractive, with earnings and pricing power in the sector poised to accelerate heading into next year, Morgan Stanley added.\n\n\"On the earnings front, the two most important aspects of our constructive call are the return of (1) positive operating leverage and (2) pricing power. This combination is especially impactful for the small cap earnings recovery we foresee into 2026,\" the bank's strategists added.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have also issued bullish calls on small-cap stocks heading into 2026, largely because valuations in the sector are more attractive than in areas such as mega-cap tech stocks.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters) - China on Thursday split off a Belgium-sized island with an economy comparable to a mid-sized country from the mainland for customs processing, part of a bid to join a major trans-Pacific trade deal and establish ​a new Hong Kong-style commercial hub.\n\nOfficials hope that turning the southern province of Hainan into a duty-free zone will spur foreign investment, ‌with goods that achieve at least 30% local value add able to move on into the world's second-largest economy tariff-free. Foreign firms will also be able to operate in service ‌sectors that are restricted on the mainland.\n\nChina is also seeking to boost its free-trade credentials to convince members of one of the world's largest free-trade deals, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), that it can meet the bloc's high standards for trade and investment openness through pilot projects such as the Hainan Free Trade Port.\n\n\"China aims to build the Hainan Free Trade Port into an important gateway that leads the country's opening-up into a new era,\" ⁠an editorial by the state news agency Xinhua said.\n\n\"It ‌is also expected to provide a huge boost for free trade that has been impacted by rising protectionism and unilateralism in recent years,\" the article added, in a veiled swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have pushed ‍policymakers to diversify China's $19 trillion economy from the world's top consumer market and take steps to further consolidate the manufacturing juggernaut's role in global supply chains.\n\nChina's leaders have made reversing a drop in investment a priority for next year, seeking to shift the economy from its current reliance on stimulus toward a dual focus on ​consumption and investment to stabilise growth in the near-term, while officials evaluate undertaking painful structural reforms needed to rebalance the economy long-term.\n\nForeign direct ‌investment into China fell 10.4% year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2025, official data shows.\n\nIf liberalisation succeeds in Hainan, economists say policymakers may feel emboldened to expose more of China's economy to market forces.\n\n\"The benchmark is something similar to Hong Kong,\" said Ran Guo, director for Consumer Economy at the China-Britain Business Council, who has been tracking the plan's developments for the past five years.\n\n\"In addition to boosting Hainan's tourism sector, the plan should also encourage more foreign investment and manufacturing,\" she added.",

He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.\n\nThat is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.\n\nA slowing economy hits the luxury market\n\nA prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

    "title": "We Built Another Object Storage (and Why It's Different)",
    "description": "High-performance object storage exists, but the economics make it unusable at scale. FractalBits breaks out of the high-performance trap.",
    "fullText": "Object storage is the backbone of modern data infrastructure. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, Ceph, newer players like Tigris Data—the market is saturated. So why build another one?\n\nBecause the fundamental assumptions behind these systems are shifting. High performance is no longer optional—but having high performance available isn’t the same as being able to afford using it.\n\nTraditional object storage had a clear priority order: cost first, performance later. This worked fine for archiving backups and storing large, rarely accessed files.\n\nBut today, object storage is increasingly the primary data layer for AI, analytics, and cloud-native applications. Latency directly translates to compute costs—stalled GPUs waiting on I/O are expensive GPUs doing nothing.\n\nHigh-performance object storage exists now. S3 Express One Zone, for example, delivers single-digit millisecond latency. But there’s a catch: the per-request pricing makes it prohibitively expensive to actually use at high IOPS. As one analysis put it, it’s “the right technology, at the right time with the wrong price” [1]. You have the performance on paper, but you can’t afford to run your workload at full speed. That’s the high-performance trap.\n\nModern workloads, especially in AI, impose demands that strain traditional designs:\n\nSmall Objects at Scale: AI training datasets often consist of millions of small files (images, text snippets, feature vectors). A study of typical AI training workloads found over 60% of objects are 512KB or smaller [2]. This shifts the bottleneck from bandwidth to metadata performance.\n\nLatency Sensitivity: Training loops and inference pipelines are bottlenecked by I/O. When fetching thousands of small objects per batch, per-object latency compounds quickly, stalling expensive GPUs.\n\nThe Need for Directories: S3’s flat namespace is a mismatch for many workflows. Data scientists expect atomic renames and efficient directory listings—operations that are either slow or missing in classic object stores.\n\nA reasonable question: if you want directories and atomic rename, why not just use a filesystem like AWS EFS? Object stores and filesystems are different concepts—why blur the line?\n\nThe answer is that the line is already blurring, driven by real workload demands. AWS themselves recognized this when they introduced S3 Express One Zone with explicit “directory bucket” semantics and atomic rename support (currently single-object) [3]. Google Cloud has made similar moves toward hierarchical namespace support [4]. The industry is converging on this because the clean separation between “object storage for scale” and “filesystem for semantics” doesn’t match how modern applications actually work.\n\nWe’re not trying to build a POSIX filesystem. But the subset of filesystem semantics that matter for data workflows—efficient directory listings, atomic rename for safe data handoffs—these belong in object storage. The alternative is forcing every application to build fragile workarounds on top of a flat namespace.\n\nExisting systems struggle with these patterns in predictable ways:\n\nThe High-Performance Trap: High-performance tiers like S3 Express One Zone solve the latency problem, but the per-request cost means you can’t actually use that performance at scale. At 10K PUT/s, you’re looking at ~$29K/month in request fees alone. The performance is there; the economics aren’t.\n\nThe Small Object Tax: With cloud object storage, you pay per request. Storing billions of 4KB objects means your API request costs can exceed your storage costs. The more objects you have, the worse it gets.\n\nMissing Directory Semantics: The lack of atomic rename forces complex workarounds in applications, limiting what you can build directly on object storage. Most systems with rename support rely on inode-like structures that struggle with scalability and performance—adding to the per-IOPS cost burden.\n\nWe built FractalBits to break out of the high-performance trap: delivering performance you can actually afford to use at scale. In our benchmarks, we achieved nearly 1M GET/s on 4KB objects with a cluster totaling 64 cores across all data and metadata nodes.\n\nHere’s what the gap looks like for a small-object intensive workload (4KB objects, 10K IOPS):\n\nS3 costs based on public pricing ($0.00113/1K PUTs, $0.00003/1K GETs, $0.11/GB/Month). FractalBits estimated using 1-year reserved instance pricing for required compute (e.g., i8g.2xlarge for data, m7g.4xlarge for metadata). Your savings will vary based on workload, but the magnitude is indicative.\n\nAt our core is a metadata engine built on an on-disk radix tree, optimized for path-like keys.\n\nMost object stores use LSM-trees (good for writes, variable read latency) or B+ trees (predictable reads, write amplification). We chose a radix tree because it naturally mirrors a filesystem hierarchy:\n\nPrefix Sharing: Common path segments (e.g., /datasets/cifar10/) are stored once, saving memory and speeding up traversal.\n\nEfficient Directory Operations: Listing a directory becomes a subtree scan. Atomic rename is essentially updating a pointer at the branch point, not copying data.\n\nCrash Consistency: We use physiological logging to ensure metadata integrity and fast recovery.\n\nUnlike most systems that use inode-based (or inode-like) structures to support directory features, we use a full-path approach for better scalability and performance.\n\nWhy Zig?\n\nOur S3-compatible API server, built in Rust, manages the data path:\n\nSafety & Concurrency: Rust’s ownership model gives us thread safety without a garbage collector—important for high-concurrency request handling.\n\nAsync I/O: Built on Tokio for handling thousands of concurrent connections.\n\nProduction-Ready Frameworks: We support both axum and actix-web, defaulting to actix-web. Its thread-per-core architecture aligns with our design for maximum performance.\n\nFractalBits deploys as a managed software layer within your own cloud account (currently AWS only).\n\nFor us: We leverage the cloud’s proven infrastructure instead of building it from scratch, letting us focus on the storage engine itself.\n\nThe object storage market has high-performance options, but the economics often make that performance unusable at scale. And systems that do offer directory semantics often struggle with performance or scalability. Getting both at a reasonable cost is still rare. We think there’s room for a different approach.\n\nFractalBits is our answer. We’re early in this journey and learning from users who are pushing these limits.\n\nHitting the performance or cost wall with your current object storage? We’d be interested to hear about your use case.\n\n[1].

    "fullText": "The world is getting hotter, and if you think that means more sunbathing and beach days, think again. There are serious consequences to such a major shift in the climate, and ordinary people all around the world are starting to feel the effects. A new report released in early November in Belgium detailed the expected effect on the country's economy and people, and that report revealed that disaster is looming, Belga News Agency reported.\n\nThe Belgian Climate Risk Assessment came from the climate institute Cerac and is meant to advise the leaders of the country in the defense of its national security. Unfortunately, the findings of this study were bleak.\n\n\"The question is no longer if climate disasters will happen, but when and how we will respond,\" the report said, per Belga News Agency. \"This demands a shift in mindset in which climate change is considered a fundamental and society-wide threat for national security.\"\n\nCerac found that the changing climate threatens Belgium's economy, food supply, water, public health, mortality rate, and even tourism.\n\nWhile a few degrees' difference in temperature might not sound that significant, a shift in the average temperature leads to significant increases in extreme weather events, not to mention changes in agricultural conditions. These lead to economic losses through both natural disasters and the impact on farmers.\n\nMeanwhile, heat leads to a greater number of deaths, both directly through heatwaves and indirectly through the spread of mosquitoes that carry diseases. There are also subtler effects on public health, such as more severe allergy cases due to more pollen in the air and a greater strain on mental health in general.\n\nAll of these effects lead to economic strain, which could also lead to financial institutions and reinsurers leaving the market, causing greater costs for everyday Belgian citizens and business owners. The result is an expected uptick of about 15% in public debt in 2050.\n\nAll in all, ordinary people throughout the country will suffer as the world gets hotter.\n\nHaving the consequences of the changing climate spelled out so clearly can help policymakers prepare to meet these challenges head-on. For example, knowing that more expensive natural disasters are only a matter of time means that they can set money aside for disaster aid.\n\nHowever, the best possible outcome from this study would be a reduction in the air pollution that is driving the changes to the climate in the first place, in order to halt the planet's overheating.\n\nShould the government provide incentives to buy EVs?\n\nDepends on if it's federal or states\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "After years of wartime splurging, Russian shoppers are tightening their grip on their wallets — a shift that hints at growing stress in the country's economy.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending has weakened across most regions, the Central Bank of Russia said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nIn October and November, demand softened even as unemployment remained near historic lows and inflation expectations ticked higher.\n\n\"According to retailers across the country, an increasing share of products are being purchased during promotions, sales, and discounts. Household behavior has become more frugal,\" according to the central bank report.\n\nRetailers in many regions report weakening demand for big-ticket and nonessential goods, marking a clear cooling after the post-2022 consumer boom.\n\n\"More subdued consumption may indicate a gradual reduction in labor market overheating and more moderate expectations for future income dynamics,\" wrote Russia's central bank.\n\nIt's a notable shift for an economy that witnessed a boom in consumer spending after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, even amid sweeping sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThat boom was fueled by surging defense spending and intense competition for scarce workers. Wages jumped, and many households went on spending sprees.\n\nNow, that momentum appears to be fading.\n\nWage growth has slowed, and firms across multiple regions report reduced manpower demand and less urgency to hire, reflecting a cooling labor market, according to the central bank report.\n\nMany firms told the central bank they expect even more modest wage increases in 2026, suggesting that households may be bracing for leaner times.\n\nThe central bank's latest report arrives as Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, and the limits of wartime economic stimulus become more apparent.\n\nOil and gas revenues — the backbone of Russia's budget — dropped 34% year-over-year in November.\n\nEven before this, analysts had warned that Russia's economy was being sustained largely by defense spending, subsidies, and emergency policy interventions.\n\nTop officials had sounded alarms. In December 2023, Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank governor, warned that the economy was at risk of overheating.\n\nLast June, the head of Russia's largest bank said the economy was \"definitely and strongly overheated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a deepening demographic crisis and ongoing competition for labor between the military and industry continue to weigh on Russia's growth prospects, both now and in the years ahead.",

    "fullText": "There are some ominous signals out there that suggest we're in the late stages of the economic cycle, but Morgan Stanley says investors should tune out the noise and brace for more growth ahead.\n\nADP private payrolls were negative in November. Challenger data shows layoffs at the highest levels in two decades. The unemployment rate is on the rise.\n\nBut as Morgan Stanley's equity research department sees things, the worst is already behind us.\n\nAndrew Pauker, a US equity strategist at the bank, laid out four reasons the economy — and therefore corporate earnings and the stock market — are in an \"early cycle\" environment.\n\nFirst, there has been a significant rebound in earnings revisions.\n\n\"Earnings revisions breadth for the S&P 500 troughed at negative 25% in April, it's now around positive 15%,\" Pauker told Business Insider. \"We typically only see these types of rebounds in early cycle environments. This is a clear sign to us that business confidence is improving.\"\n\nSecond, wage growth has slowed, giving profit margins room to expand. Here's the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker, showing a three-month moving average of wage growth at 4.1% year-over year. That's down from 6.7% in July 2022. Typically, this kind of decline happens during recessionary periods, Pauken said.\n\nThird, Pauker said consumer demand appears poised to accelerate. One signal for this is that companies are starting to exhibit higher pricing power, meaning they can increase prices without significantly impacting demand.\n\nAnd fourth, the Fed is cutting rates, a move intended to stimulate economic activity. After the Fed's December rate cut, Pauker and his team expect two cuts in 2026. He said the labor market will continue to show enough moderate weakness to continue to spur these cuts, but not enough weakness to throw the economy into a recessionary spiral.\n\nThe bank expects the S&P 500 to rise 14% in 2026, to 7,800, and Pauker also listed a few specific areas of the market he expects to outperform.\n\nPauker's highest conviction — and most out of consensus — call is \"overweight\" on consumer discretionary stocks after having rated them \"underweight\" for the last four years. The sector is historically cyclical, performing well during economic recoveries. It includes stocks that benefit from consumers spending on non-necessities — you might think of apparel companies like Nike or hotel firms like Marriott.\n\nSecond, and hand-in-hand with this call, is Pauker's expectations for small-caps to do well. Small-caps tend to be cyclical and benefit from falling interest rates, which they're more sensitive to than larger companies. Their margins should also get a boost from falling wage growth, Pauker said.\n\nHe pointed to rising earnings growth for the median stock in the Russell 2000, an index that tracks small-caps.\n\nThird, Pauker is bullish on the financials sector.\n\n\"The Senior Loan Officer Survey indicates that C&I loan growth is likely to improve next year, so that should benefit the banks,\" Pauker said. \"On top of that, earnings revisions, valuation and positioning are attractive for Financials.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley joins banks like HSBC, Bank of America, and JPMorgan in calling for the outperformance of cyclical stocks.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to these three areas of the market through funds like the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR), the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), and the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF).",

    "description": "The latest JOLTS report shows hiring stuck at 3.2% and quits falling again as the Fed prepares to cut rates.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zandi is worried that the labor market no longer has a buffer.\n\nSo many Americans are “already living on the financial edge,” the chief economist for Moody’s Analytics told Fortune. If they start to pull back, that’s “fodder for a recession.”\n\nThe stark assessment comes as hiring has stalled, unemployment is rising—especially for the most vulnerable workers—and layoff announcements are piling up. To Zandi, the next stage is already visible: “If we actually do see layoffs pick up,” he told Fortune, “then it certainly would be a jobs recession.”\n\nZandi reached that assessment before the government released its long-delayed JOLTS report Tuesday, but the official numbers largely confirm the pullback he has been tracking through private data. Since the summer, job openings have risen by only a few hundred thousand and remain far below the highs seen in the frenzy of the pandemic. Layoffs upticked slightly, while quit rates fell, a sign that workers are increasingly hesitant to leave their current positions. Hiring, meanwhile, has held at 3.2%, a level consistent with employers who are not actively slashing staff but are no longer expanding their workforces either: a “low hire, low fire” market.\n\nIf the cooling in the official data looks slow, the private indicators tell a sharper story. ADP’s November report found that private employers cut 32,000 jobs, the steepest decline in more than two years. Nearly all of those losses came from small businesses, which eliminated 120,000 positions. Larger employers moved in the opposite direction and kept hiring.\n\nFor Zandi, the pattern is not random. He sees it as the continuation of a break that appeared earlier in the year, when the administration escalated reciprocal tariffs.\n\n“If you look at when job growth really came to a standstill, it is back soon after Liberation Day,” he said.\n\nBecause these firms often lack the financial cushions that larger corporations can draw upon, payroll becomes the most immediate and often the only mechanism through which they can respond to rising input costs. The result, Zandi argues, is a labor market in which the earliest fractures appear among precisely the kinds of employers most sensitive to policy and price shifts. Those fractures then begin to ripple outward, first through hiring freezes and only later, if conditions worsen, through broader layoffs.\n\nSo for Zandi, if ADP offers a snapshot of the present, the data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas hints at what may lie ahead. Employers have announced 1.1 million layoffs this year, a figure surpassed only during the pandemic shock of 2020 and the depths of the Great Recession. These announcements are global, and not all will materialize as U.S. cuts, Zandi advised, yet he considers their scale meaningful because they reflect decisions made months in advance of actual separations.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump is touring swing states to defend his tariffs and sell the message that the economy is booming.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is standing by his tariffs, at least in theory.\n\nUnder the banner \"Lower Prices, Bigger Paychecks,\" Trump kicked off the first of a series of speeches to promote his economic message in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, as polls indicate the country is increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\n\"They always have a hoax,\" Trump told the crowd, referring to criticism from Democrats that his policies drove up prices. \"The new word is 'affordability.'\"\n\n\"Democrats are like, 'prices are too high.' Yeah, they're too high because they cause them to be too high,\" Trump added. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nLater, he said, \"I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"\n\nTrump, during the 90-minute speech, also reiterated that his favorite word is \"tariff\" and credited his policies for bringing in \"hundreds of billions of dollars,\" presumably for the government in tariff revenue.\n\n\"You can give up certain products,\" Trump said at one point. \"You could give up pencils. Because under the China policy, you know, every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two, you know. They don't need that many.\"\n\nDespite standing by his tariff policies, Trump has, in reality, rolled back many of his earlier tariffs, especially ones enacted on April 2.\n\nTariffs are still higher than they have been in many decades, but the original 25% tariff on every import from Mexico and Canada was walked back to exclude all items covered in the USMCA trade agreement, which includes most imports from the two neighbors. Tariffs on imports from China, once more than 100%, have been reduced to a baseline tariff of 10%, which applies to all other countries.\n\nOn top of that, in an attempt to address the price of groceries, Trump also modified and removed tariffs on a range of food products in November, such as beef, coffee, bananas, and tomatoes.\n\nOf the remaining tariffs, evidence points to an impact on the price of consumer goods.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments, and our model-based regressions confirm that these effects are statistically and economically significant.\"\n\n\"At the same time, the pass-through remains partial; only a portion of the model-predicted effect has materialized so far,\" the report added. \"This could reflect delays in price adjustments, competitive pressure limiting firms' ability to raise prices, or expectations that the tariffs may prove temporary.\"\n\nTrump's speech comes as consumer sentiment remains low. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped by a score of 50 in June 2022.\n\nEarlier on Monday, in an interview with Politico, Trump said that he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nSome Democrats have centered their pre-2026 midterm messaging on affordability, and several have explicitly blamed rising costs on Trump's tariff and trade policies. Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, with whom Trump had a meeting, also won while running primarily on making the city more affordable.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "A recent statewide ranking named the Austin-area suburb Leander as the No. 5 best city in Texas to move to for 2025, and other Austin neighbors made the list as well.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by a customer review and news platform called ConsumerAffairs, evaluated the 50 most populated Texas cities across five categories: affordability, safety, economy, health care and education, in addition to overall quality of life, to determine which cities were best to move to. Each city earned a score out of 100 possible points.\n\nLeander stood out, the analysis said, for its safety ranking — No. 1 statewide — and it also secured the No. 2 spot for its booming economy.\n\nHowever, the city’s rankings were more modest in other areas. The report ranked Leader No. 12 for health care and education, No. 32 for affordability and No. 40 for quality of life.\n\n“Leander’s origin dates back to the 1880s, when a rail line was constructed to connect Austin to Abilene,” the report said. “Nowhere among Texas’ largest cities is violent crime less common, and over the past five years, no metro area has experienced faster job growth.”\n\nThe suburb, which has a population of around 78,000, was also ranked as one of the top ten places to live by U.S. News and World Reports for 2025-2026.\n\nThe top four cities on the ConsumerAffairs list were all in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, followed by Leander and then Round Rock at No. 9.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "Influencer marketing has grown into a $24 billion industry, but trust in influencers is declining as consumers increasingly perceive many as inauthentic. Authenticity is not a fixed trait; it is co-created through interactions among influencers, brands, followers, and agencies, and hinges on five key dimensions: expertise, connectedness, integrity, originality, and transparency. When these dimensions are misaligned—such as when brands prioritize reach over relevance or influencers conceal financial motives—authenticity breaks down and trust erodes. However, when brands and influencers intentionally manage these tensions, influencer marketing can move beyond transactional exchanges to foster genuine, transformational relationships, making authenticity a vital currency in today’s creator economy.",

Yet CMOs face a paradox: Influencer marketing is booming, but trust is eroding. One study shows that while 88% of consumers say authenticity matters, nearly half believe most influencers are fake. Over a third think influencers misrepresent themselves and the products they endorse. The result is an increasingly broken influencer ecosystem: Consumers feel misled, influencers struggle to stay true to themselves, and managers don’t fully grasp how authenticity is built.",
